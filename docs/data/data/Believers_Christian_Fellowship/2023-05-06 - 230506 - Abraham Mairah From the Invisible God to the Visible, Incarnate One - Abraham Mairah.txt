this evening certainly a privilege to be here together and we've been looking forward to this day for quite some time with some anticipation and planning and it has arrived amen We Trust amen that we're going to hear from God tonight because we've come expecting and the prophet of God told us you get what you expect amen so I hope you came with a big expectation because we want to receive what we came expecting men we all know and love brother Abraham he's been with us many times he's been coming here since 2015 the first time he came I didn't realize it had been that long until we were fellowshipping and he shared that I've been always thankful for his visit thankful for his friendship thankful for the ministry that God's entrusted into him it's always edified me I've been built up by the word that's been preached but I'm also thankful that we have an extra pool here because we have sister mercy and brother Moses sharibe and sister Mercy was brother Abraham was her guardian when she was young he raised her as an adopted daughter amen and so he's always got to come back and see his new grandchild amen so we thank God for that little extra pool that we have in this area but yeah brother Abraham's been a good friend we really appreciate this we want to we want to turn the pulpit over to him and we want to pull on the gift and receive what God has for us and trust that God will meet us also we want to welcome all the visitors or several that have traveled in from several different places we want to say God bless you you're very welcome we're very glad that you're here also if you're remaining for tomorrow the morning service will be at 10 30 in the morning we expect brother Abraham to be ministering again in the morning but also wanted to let you know that we're having a fellowship dinner immediately after the service over in the fellowship hall and everybody is welcome to stay and join in and we'll also be having a communion service tomorrow evening so we want to make you aware of that and at this time we're doing invite our brother Abraham to come and share the word like you're rise up on me [Music] [Music] Jesus [Music] him in the light of his glory and embrace one more time so turn your eyes Upon Jesus [Music] and the things of Earth will grow in the light of his glory and embrace I mean just greet you once more than a marvelous Jesus Christ just happy to be with you to see your face is still Shining for the glory of God Amen but you still love the Lord and he loves you that is a sure guess because the Bible says having loved his own he loved them to the very end so maybe you maybe sit for a few minutes or maybe four moments uh bring greetings from Uganda especially from our home Church and my family and also from across a few areas Kenya and Uganda different churches you know very many people love you they share with you the word and of course I appreciate the ministry here you've been a blessing to very many people around the world and what shall I say about the ministers here I go to hear a portion of where someone preached I think last Wednesday by the other brother it was wonderful so we appreciate all of you and um I know that we are not having much time here keep saying it but maybe I keep coming and you think because you keep coming still more time but you see Paul say the same thing is off I think for us we are more sure that we are more on the edge of it than all those who have say the same statements before [Music] amen so the Bible says I mean the prophet I think preached and said they died in an expression and they they were like about receiving Paul didn't even exclude himself when he said we who shall be alive I shall be alive he counted himself among others Whom The Rapture should find when he's still alive so what about us today so I think I must really appreciate all friends who've come I conceive a number of friends who have come from different places and brother Dan rutleaf just been here he did a very nice job for me and I enjoyed that brief one day in his place yeah talk about wonderful men of God who exhibit the love of God and the care is is a very nice brother and his wife so I can see yeah yeah a few friends also from other places is such a honor to have you uh I was asking brother Chad he was saying where are there some friends who've come just to attend these meetings I said well I don't know I think I've preached I'm I'm almost done I've preached I've preached myself finished kaput now so I would rather just come and sit and listen here but somehow he will not let me do that you know yeah and that's why I got it I think that's why God put him here and what shall I say about um the friends where I was in Charlotte they sent their greetings here um Pastor Shambo Stephen and his church and of course have been taking good care of my brother Chad and his lovely wife Angie I think yeah it is my second home here I always enjoy it so much appreciate so thank you for your smiles I can see them before so I think they they they just give me a good foundation like you're saying catch him so we are not having a problem with you we are having a problem with the Devil so you shouldn't have a face that is scared just relax and be free in the princess of the Lord amen so I think uh with those few words I would just request that we all stand up and have a world of Prayer and maybe you want to be remembered in prayer for whatever reason our God is not scared he's not even tired of you worry that you are lifting up your hand he loves it so just lift up your hand and we pray together loving heavenly father I want to thank you for this evening for this wonderful time that you've given us to be in the house of the Lord and Lord Fellowship around your word Lord is standing in this place and knowing how many sermons have been preached to hear the Lord is standard that you've brought here the word that comes forth I'm not even worth the Lord but I'm praying that God will come down and just add a little break today in the lives of your children deal with them gently saving them perfecting them bringing us Lord God to that station of the measure of the fullness of Christ for us why we are here we are still here because there's something that we lord God have to come to may you help us tonight meet the needs of your children you know them each and every one whatever they have come with just anoint your servant as I step completely out of the way and come and bless your people through your word as you break your bread of life which is yourself in Jesus name we pray amen and I'm just going to go to this very common scripture I think almost every preacher has ever preached about at scripture and it's very common even on a funerals so I think it should be today's today should be a funeral for someone in John chapter 14 I'm just speaking some a few verses um I'm picking verse one and then I'll pick verse 7 to 12. Saint John Chapter 14 verse 1 it says let not your heart be troubled and when the word let is applied it means permitted not allow or not so it's up to you either to permit it to allow it or not so he says let not your head be troubled and he's addressing many but if you realize he doesn't say let not your heart you say let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in me so it was very easy company practice to believe in God but now the challenge you was believe in me and verse 7 he says if you had known me you should have known my father also and from henceforth you know him and I've seen him Philip says unto him Lord show us the father and suffices us Jesus says unto him have I been so long time with you and yet you have not known me Philip he that has seen me as seen the father how says Thou then show us the father now this is just chapter 14 of John I think it was just maybe the longest will be made about two years or one and a half years Jesus has been with the disciples and he's saying I've been with you a long time so how you would you think about yourself how many summons have you had how many years have you been here how does Jesus now talk about your time with him so he says I've been a long time so long time with you in the year you have not known him in Philip he that has seen the seen me has seen the father the house says though then show us the father believes thou not that I'm in the father and the father in me the ones that I speak unto you I speak not of myself but the father that dwareth in me he do with the works yes believe that believe me that I mean the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very work sake very liberalization to you he that believes on me the works that I do shall he do also in the Greater Works than these shall he do because I go unto the father I just wanted to read something else in the book of Ephesians chapter 1 and Paul speaking about his ministry saying in verse 9 having made it known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he had purpose in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him which who worketh all the things after the cancer of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ may God bless his word and bless you may be seated dispensation in the indispensation of the fullness of times he wants to gather and he uses the word might so it's not going to apply to everybody um he doesn't say he must together all things but that is part of his program is part of his plan amen so today I'm talking about from the invisible God to the visible incarnate one that is moving from the invisible God to the visible incarnate one man so I have a subject from that which I'm saying move your business your faith business to God is new dispensation office it doesn't want your business in the other office he wants you to move it to the new office it strikes you that Jesus himself is speaking to disciples and he's addressing them and he says let not your hearts be troubled you believe in God I know you believe in God but now the challenge is believe also in me because that God is no longer that God that you thought of he has left it at the office but it had not really got to the understanding they are not received it the disciples the Believers they were with him they had seen the sign of the Messiah they had him preach they are saying that demonstration of creating power unmatched in history and what was it for but here the way they were still trying to hold on to the other office believing the way they are the Jews have been eating yet they are in a new dispensation this is a dispensation of Christ God has become flesh and they were here privileged to be with him they were living with him walking with him eating with him seeing him do like he's telling them even if it was hard for you to believe me Percy believe me for the works the Miracles the sign is the Wonders the display of this financial why is it too hard for you to understand that there is a change of office God is now here Isaiah 9 has been fulfilled glory be to God so the disciples if you remember my sermon which I preached here when I was here I was talking about going Beyond you know you know receiving the mystery the mysterious reality of the moral and a prophet of his ministry you got beyond the office amen so what did the maracai for introduce so that's why those who are stuck at the office of Malacca before are struggling as suffering are getting threatened they are getting weakened they are confused because that dispensation is over why are you holding on an office of the Prophet he's not even there he came preached the message showed you Christ identified reality for you and said here he is here's your bridegroom now you are still stuckled with the umbrella Williams please this is not time for that this time for the reality that he identified so Jesus himself is talking to the disciples and he says you look you are making yourself get to a bird when you stick to the other office when you remain to the office of the invisible God the god of Israel the great Jehovah almighty God of the Old Testament that related to us through the prophets and we could approach him through sacrifices and offerings and you know this right rights and these rituals and so forth we really knew the oracles we kept the Ten Commandments we know the Torah you related to him like that that one is no code you will remain trouble in yourself so it is in your power to travel yourself to fret yourself to confuse yourself or it's in your power to come to me also believe transfer that Faith amen from that office and bring it to me I am here I am the answer I am the reality of that office you were looking for something real something tangible that you can lay a hold on that you can touch and feel Hallelujah and Grace has provided it for you yeah yeah and here it is you are with it and you are still looking back you didn't go to believe in God and that was another dispensation this is a a new one this dispensation is that God has put on flesh he's here amen blessed be the name of the Lord I just love the Lord you know amen I wish I was a good Preacher Brother Chuck then I would start preaching now blessed be the name of the Lord now he says the prophet he says God has got a purpose in a message why cry speak he says God has got a purpose for you being here see if you can only be get to that place how much trouble you save God and yourself you serve God a lot of trouble and yourself when you come to that place you come to identify yourself with a reality he wants to bring you to when you come when you come to the up upgraded position it is a transformation don't stay stuck to a place God is to bring you to something friends we must go home and we are not going to go home by a god that is in heaven Our Father Who Art in Heaven yes but now that where is that father where is that God so I I'm just here to challenge ourselves today asking the grace of God if you can help me you see he says if you can get to that place you how much trouble you save God and yourself to so when you don't get to that spot you give God a lot of trouble because you are at an office that you are crying to you are disturbing him and he has given you the solution the solution is staring in the face he's here but you are stuck there and you are saying God God help me God answer this God do this now the prophet says somewhere where I said now we pray for the sick now we pray for to solve problems but time is coming that you shall speak amen you shall say now folks When shall these things be when are we going to come to that every other sign that the Bible speaks about for the end time preparing us for the Rapture is very clear it's very evident every sign you can read of the Bible what is remaining is for us to come to that to come to that point where God knows what is the new takes care of you what's the new takes care of every situation and you will not need anybody but he is in you Christ in you the hope of glory so God is having trouble by people who are supposed to give him no trouble oh just imagine if all is summons that we have been hearing all these years just imagine all the preachings all the good Summoners that we have had the revelations the Mysteries the teachings the expositions just imagine if all that became life in you just imagine all the courts that we have had all these years what if really you concept I mean you receive them and they become flesh they become manifested he says you believe in God believe also in me now we are coming to something because you see it's it was a common ground and God is warning us always to go away from the common ground that's why brother Branham where as long as he was the first and second policy that was like Common Ground the denomination of the world and everybody was accepting him but when he started to break through into the word the unveiling of the world and the word is God in the beginning was the word the word that created everything the locals the pill of Fire coming down and he says the quickening power came down to open the seals so the seals broke and the Word was unveiled and the word is that logos and the logos coming to you becoming that same original spoken in what he created the universe and it's here Tabernacle in you and it's there just you to come to terms to the fact that it's there that's where the problem is that's why we are still troubled troubled with the disease with the stress with this we did that problem this problem that this one hits me this one who Do You Think Can Hurt God and it bothers him you are still bothered by being hated because you have not yet realized who you are you are still abused and it affects you because you have not yet realized who you are you are still attacked by the devil and you get scared because you have not yet realized who you are but when you come to know what you have received believe also in the third pool believe also any God in Iman believe in also that all that was in God he poured into Christ all that was in Christ he poured into the church can you believe that yeah lord of the middle of God so it was common in practice and it's always the problem you know people will always want common things common practice for the Jews to believe in the existence of God his power his capability the Harmon importance this invisible god Jehovah whom they would relate as I said to through prophets and so forth and you know reciting some Torah some laws but when it came to a visible God it was a taboo and another famous and it was to be resisted by all means let's read something here in John chapter 10. in verse 40 he says a and my father are one amen then the Jews took up stones again to Stone him and Jesus answered them many good works have I showed you from my father for which of those what do you stoned me now look at this the Jews answered him saying for a good work we still need not but for blasphemy foreign being a mere man a mere woman you also at me a man you are making yourself good that's where the whole problem was and that's why in a Ministry that is pointing you to that the devil will rise up even when you yourself you are struggling to come to that the devil will rise up the devil doesn't want you to come to that but I'm not here to give the devil what he wants I'm here to trouble him the more I trouble him the less trouble I get but the less I trouble him the more I trouble I I will permit him trouble me I'd rather follow the devil now he wants to Stone you Glory Be oh God they throw stones he claims to be this he claims to be that I don't claim I am [Applause] I Am What God Says I Am [Applause] and this is not my statement this is the word of God so I Am What God Says I am and I believe that I am what he said I am but the devil doesn't want you to accept that and as long as you don't accept that you are the devil's friend somehow because you have given him the opportunity to keep troubling you and you are troubling Yourself by giving the devil's certificate to trouble you and Jesus says don't allow your hearts to be you are hard to be troubled this way believe us who are with Jesus they were seeing the Miracles the power of God is played and when Jesus is saying something to do with his office and then say show us your father and he will suffice us and Jesus said have I been us a long time with you and you don't know me and and and you know you know many of us have been in this message we have had good summons and preached you know we have seen so many things and yet we don't know that this message introduced to God Amen message is Seven Seals an evailed Christ and that is the mystery that is not for the world it's not for the denominations it's not for nobody else it's for you that's why them seven standards were forbidden to be written he wants to write himself with the ionic pen in the pages of your heart and you get that mystery and it's written there with the ionic pen not devil is able to take it out and the devil is scared of certain people but we must come to that yes glory be to God they wanted to Stone him for one thing because he claimed he's the son of God I I I really want God to help us to see this and Paul is talking about the dispensation of the fullness of times prophetically he's talking about the seven Church ages the times the fullness and after that after the message the seven churches Joni started to come up here and what happens John begins to see things that he could not be able to see the formula of God God has committedly connected him to the theophany and he's able to see things that he cannot see that's why he says he was able to look at the book that no man was supposed to look how did you look attitude and he saw 24 elders and he's one of 24 elders so in other words he saw himself I'm angry 24. but you have to come up here leave this argumentative levels of the seven Church edges message Believers come up here come into the realm where you see things that you couldn't see when you are there and even one of the elders told him don't don't be sorrowful who was that one him he's the only theophan is speaking to him don't be sorrowful John and he saw himself already seated there already with crown already worshiping yet he's still here passing through the patimos island of troubles and prostitution but he sees himself already seated there so now God was giving me a fortress of what he was going to be things that are to be and now here we are we our things that are to be we are going to begin them here because you need that power in you that you are in you before you go home you are not going to go home by grace makes the formation of God in you and God takes over and takes you up up to Glory don't just sit there and say well if God wants to text me to take me to heaven he will take me he might gather so if you are not willing to be gathered that he might that are all things he has the intention to gather all things but some of them might not be gathered so you just have to ask yourself do you want to be in the might or must Hallelujah the master side of God's program or they might decide [Music] blessed be the name of the Lord but that is his plan he must gather all things in Christ and who is Christ the anointed the word so here we see the disciples themselves had not come to that they didn't realize so I think it is not even that you are very very lazy and all that you are too much weak no it is the nature of human beings but God is so perseverant God is still waiting bringing us to that that's why if you notice these days I don't care which preacher stands here he will appoint you to that amen there's no other place God is pointing us at but a word in you the life of the word God in you so when God is in you what do you become when God is with you and for you you are dead [Applause] for you you are dead I am crucified with the Christ even if I am living it's not me living is Christ Living so if it's God in you and you are dead who is there himself amen amen who is there now it's like the opening of the flowers beginning to sprout it's beginning to open slowly and one of these days you are going to see the full reality of Who You Are and God quickened that today bring it quickly friends I'm tired I want to go home I don't know about you so he says here he says no matter what size the circle is in another Court here he says oh how many peoples gather together Christ is omnipro I'm going to present and he is the only being that is there that is omnipresent the devil cannot be omnipresent God is the only one who is omnipresent that is everywhere he fills all Heavens on Earth that's exactly what he said in John chapter 3 verse 13. he says the son of man who was speaking from the Earth but he was in heaven so he says um here sometime ago on the mount up in California I was looking at the great Observatory we are one of the astronomers had been converted in my meeting and they took me up there and he got a glass that you can see you can see a hundred and twenty million light years or years of light space light troubles I think about 800 8 000 miles per second whatever break that down into miles and how many miles would you have over 120 million years how many miles will you have in a minute how many in an hour in a day a year rather what I'm speaking about the universe and in a hundred years or in a million years in a hundred and twenty million years and all beyond that is filled with the solar system our great Jehovah God just blew them off his fingers in creation yeah now I feel religious and you know what I was preaching somewhere that you are in those fingers your names are engraved here so when he was blowing these things into creation you were there you were part of the fingers blowing them into existence and he covers all his fish and sometimes you walk around and act like we we can run his business we act like we can run his business we can't run his business his business he has to come in us and run his own business think for himself talk for himself act for himself achieve for himself plan for himself he says he's so big that he feels all his best and yet it will become so small that he can come to a poor Lost Sinner's heart that is God yes poor lost not sane must holy Reverend doctor so and so oh man no wonder we don't have those titles we don't deserve them he deserves all the titles yes you are just Mrs Jesus not this right reverent doctor this venerable oh blessed be the name of the road he comes he he can become so small that he will come to a poor lost a sinner's heart that's what makes him great did you hear that God is not made great by the greatness that we know he becomes so great when he comes and sits in your head it says I've had a privilege in my life to meet Great Men Kings I've been in four palaces praying for kings and monarchs and potentance and you find great men they are little in their own sight it's man that is nothing little man that thinks himself big that tries to make himself big that's what makes that's what makes God so big he humbles himself to come down to save to heal and makes him go to me now he comes here he says and how true that it is and how true that is with the church today we've had great men across the country like Oral Roberts and great gifts has come in all the Church of course not forgetting William Marion Branham himself but it was greater that because he introduced the greatest and then he says and great gifts have come into the church and the church just sits there and stares the baptism of the Holy Spirit nation and many churches have been filled with their spirit and great Rivals have taken place and the world just sets and stairs in his face when God does anything he expects the people to look at it and believe him not believe in him but believe him present tense I believe in a god that is there a Jehovah I believe in God he's somewhere there in heaven some great supernatural being he wants us to believe him Miracles wander signs that God does is a little something they are shaking before the church to wake up the church that he is soon coming okay now this applies to the disciples they were looking at God doing miracles opening the word teaching them the mystery and they were sitting there and staring yet the purpose why God is doing this the purpose why he is so mightily displayed himself in Malachi foreign and then you come to terms what God has made you to be not sit and stare Satan is there is not going to help you the devil enjoys it when you sit understand so that means whenever God comes down and his place is great power and an omnipotence he does it to show people something he expects people to look at it and believe him believe in him or believe I mean believe in him and be established in the present tense god of the present truth amen present truth yes so the present truth of that day in the disciples age was that God was now with them but that is not our message today God is not just with us God is in US and the more he comes into in us the more we disappear so he becomes bigger we become nothing we begin to diminish until we disappear and the final stand at the final level of the church will be that still be God in the church Hallelujah amen not anything less and don't settle for anything less don't enter into any negotiations with the devil for some deal some have baked here the world sits and stairs they charge seats and stairs but the bright Ponders over these things you remember Joseph never became a Christian it was a very righteous man holy but for him every time the message about Jesus came the Bible doesn't say he pondered it's only Mary who pointed about the things that were being spoken I'll leave that for your pastor so he comes he says and and when the church puts forth another church it will be a Pentecostal church with the signs of the acts in their Apostles doing the same thing with the same Jesus walking the same because he's the same yesterday today and forever a Pentecostal Branch filled with a holy ghost science and wonders of the Resurrection great things taking place among them they who know their gold in the last days they who know they are God in the last days shall do Express yes we are at the end what's the matter with the world I imagine closing saying this what's wrong with the world then he picks up that story of the little boy that the mother realized that he could not react to whatever it was he was playing for her for him ring a bell show himself he could only sit and then he brings down and says that's what is the matter a whole lot like the child today God has took the church in his arms and he has a shook ah and the other robots many other gifts and wonders as he has shook before the eyes of the people he doesn't call he doesn't mention himself because he's the one Speaking but we know through the prophet of the day he shook more and he says and they claim to be religious and they just sit there and stare and actually like they don't even pay any attention to it there is something mentally wrong with the church something's wrong so what if you have a mental problem as a church you need the mind of Christ to restore you are mine the right mind maybe you got some dementia some amnesia you forgotten who you were forgotten the purpose blessed be the name of the Lord so he says there's something mentally wrong with the church something is wrong God displays the gifts and they will walk around and say oh Mentos or they are just putting on the speaking tongues there's nothing to eat see people are shouting and praising the Lord with the tears run down their cheeks oh she's just woke up there's nothing to eat to be paying attention to that a Christian because it's written in the world and they did that at the beginning there's something wrong with the church something wrong with the people something wrong with the nation so he comes down and he says that's the way the church is getting God has shook every promise in the Bible before them still we just sit and stare look at that look at what show me a sign will you they are looking for signs the bride is must be looking for God not just science have God and then the signs will follow this sign shall follow them that the Believers don't follow signs don't look for signs amen besides to follow the Believers because they believe they what they are full of the word they are full of God and God produces the signs and that's ones who follow signs follow those ones who are holding gold [Applause] that's why one brother was telling me Prada tell me the greatest miracle that you have seen in your life we have had so many I say the greatest Miracle is when God led me to this message [Applause] because this message is the word is God amen science will fail Miracles will fail all these other things will fail what people have talked about great testimonies great experiences will fail but the word will never fail and I will have hell I thank God for the word so don't even be disappointed even when you are sick but if you have the word one of these days that you want to take care of whatever problem I want to tell you that we have come to that type blessed be the name of the Lord I'm not even excited these days so much praying for the sick it doesn't excite me I've seen recently you know before I came they brought some girl who was mad and you know given the parents a hard time and beaten people and screaming and fighting and biting and and she's the mother of two children and they brought her to church I was not at the church there was a mismatch in the time that I gave them so they brought her a little bit later and they had gone somewhere so I came back in the evening they have been waiting for five hours and and I believe us they were doing some preparation there was a wedding and you know some of them were scared of the mighty woman you know so you raise up and talk words and people would run away and so I came and you know I I knew God was going to deliver her but I said God I'm tired of just praying for the people to be healed to believe it so what so what that they are delivered so what are they are here so many have been healed and they have gone back in the world serving the devil so that sign blinds them they think God is just too good to set them freeze all and they go and leave he said you know like you know that kind of life I said Lord before I pray for this human I I want to know whether she's going to Value salvation and and God Gave Me A Sign immediately and I thank God so I just took a hold of her and then I was asking ridiculous why didn't you pray for yourself Pastor that running Sunday I said no it's also handled it by you you're believers this is what I'm talking about not knowing what we have so I just got a hold of her and went to the office with her mother and as I kneel down she just kneel down and she knelt down and then I prayed for her I said God even when she doesn't understand I want her back in her right mind and I want to talk to her about salvation now I'm fed up with these people who just come and brought the power brought the power and go and live for the devil I'm not excited because they are healed you rather die sick and go to heaven than leave health and go to hell so I prayed for her in a moment like just the split of time she was delivered and she was saying where am I and she was laughing and then I said now calm down you know that you have been transported over 300 kilometers to be brought here because all the preachers in the Kampala could not cast out his devil they took you to a number of churches and they have brought you here oh yeah where am I said you were here in Pursuit you are not in the company so I said now do you know why those preachers could not cast out those demons and then I I remember that statement the prophet says God is in times himself from the whole world empowering himself into his bride [Music] denominations are finished then what they are doing they just mascara they even training people to act like they were sick and they were healed they are doing things in tricks just to deceive the people they are dying they are finished true Revival is now around the world because the word is going to form itself into the fullness of God and God will take care of every problem and I want to promise you you are not going to be sick when we go home no that tabernoko this body a body has thou given me I didn't come looking for sacrifice for this for that but a body has thou prepared for me and you are that body so I talked to this girl about Jesus and she melted down with tears say I accept the little Pastor I'm even ready for baptism I said Thank You Lord I'm not excited just because people are healed I'm not even excited the lemon walk I had I thank God the elderly man I talked about I prayed before has been out of the church 15 years he just came back in his February to repent so brother sister thank God yes if you catch the revelation of peace you have got the greatest blessing you are the in the most comfortable position when you receive this word and when you cherish it when you value it when it becomes your life because it will become your power Your Glory your future your everything yeah without this you are not lost completely nothing amen but we found God he came our way we thank God we know where we are standing we are not going to sit there and stare don't sit and stare like the disciples will say we believe in God where God has sent a prophet and they were looking at Jesus they didn't know who well God has set us a great man God has sent us a great man a great prophet May Messiah is here who is the messiah yes and what is the message of Malachi for whom did he introduce are you ready to live there at our office of God With Us God is with us in our church our pastor is a good preacher we hear good testimonies in the church they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony not others testimony there you are you are testimony you are testimony and what is your testimony the testimony of Jesus Christ is the spirit of Prophecy so your testimony is that you are dead and Jesus Lives in You [Applause] not your testimony as a human being you are dead he lives so that's when you qualify to prophesy again the testimony of Jesus Christ is the spirit of Prophecy hmm so he says and after Jesus had so proven his Messianic sign that was that Messiah yet in the first of all that they saying show us the sign when you say Show Me A Sign you are an unbeliever because actually you are supposed to become the sign because you should be broke before you show signs you are not supposed to see signs but you are supposed to show signs and before you show signs you are supposed to be the sign the super signed what is this person God in a man so struggle to become this person and then you will become the sign to those who want signs but for you you want this person manifested and that's where your comfort is only is not just because your feet you can jump up and make push push press-ups you have good biceps and you can do this you can lift this business is running very well well enough time before the people I can attitude what is very well I'm a group orator blah blah notice that the sign is not even holding a message book it's not even holy in the Bible the sign is where the Bible becomes life in you when you become the message manifested [Applause] and that's what the devil doesn't want us to come to praise God there's gonna be a people come to that and I want to be one of them Hallelujah you believe in God you believe in Jesus who was with us believe in our in Jesus who is in US you believe in praying being prayed for believe also in praying before you you say believe also in praying yeah yeah who is going to do a religion for you in your house I want to pray for you before you sleep we'll pray for you before you eat I will pray for you in the morning we'll pray for you I was preaching somewhere I think when I was there something I was talking about how we want everything to be done for us the pastor has to study the message for us study the Bible for us and for you you don't study the message you don't study the Bible the pastor has to do everything and every single question Pastor can you answer me this I have this question what about this what about 70 Church ages what did the prophet say this what about this church order whatever what do you do right who is going to be a religion for you hey Lord be to God I don't know why you love this prayer it's not a good brother thank you brother he's not a very good brother but he loves you blessed be the animals yes something in you must be watered must be nurtured must be growing you must see it grow you must feed it you must seek more of it you must expand it it is your life it's your future if you are everything God has given us it is there take it where there is water take it where they can help it well it can be Avengers where it can gain strength okay that's why you find people you know they are working there they are there in the offices they do three jobs a day and run here and then they can't come to church [Music] and then they come to ask the question which was answered last Wednesday night who is going to do a religion for you who is going to study the Bible for you you are asking a silly question uh-huh and you are a very mature person how do you tell me hey what about this this Quest the scripture that says women if you don't cut hair should that be a question you ask me [Laughter] hey God expects you not to sit and sounds good makes some sense God expects you to be active that's why he says you already got the faith when you receive the Holy Ghost but now you know you don't know how to operate to act upon that who is going to act upon it for you who is going to go Interruption on your behalf who is going to be changed on your behalf who is going to be changed for you you need it to go there yourself yeah and that's why you people should begin to speak to God when you speak to God and you must you perfect in prayer then you are no longer going to pray you are going to begin to speak that's the final standard we are not going to pray we are going to speak but before we come to that level of just speaking the word you shall say to this mountain amen not pray thank you into existence he didn't pray it was the stage of Say Amen but before he could say how many times did the brother Branham first go to the woods and pray and wait upon the Lord pray and fasten for Faith meals it didn't come just just that easy seat and stare let me bring this also here maybe you put on your listening issues when you come to judge someone opens the prayer for you pray good praise for you when they are going to preach the word good they pray for prayer requests good the preacher praise and preaches good after preaching he prays good when do you pray and this is the House of Prayer and then you go back home and you give the past a call Pastor pray for me I'm having a headache I have a problem this this problem has come this problem has come can't you pray does God have grandchildren does God have babies all of us are children isn't it and he gives ear to all of us so what is happening Satan is there that's not very good preaching but there is a problem there is a complacency there is a weakness there is a resignation resigning into threat sitting there and giving yourself over to circumstances God knows he knows you are capable of doing something should be ringing in your heart now telling you that it's about to go home it's about time we are going home it is time to graduate from prayer to the spoken one unless you qualify unless you pass the examination pass this fast [Applause] so if you can't even pray how will you speak and yet you are supposed to come to that because in the beginning what's the word what was the word let there be [Music] the logos wow so the logos is getting formed in you so how are you going to come to that to say Let There Be when you can't even pray why did Jesus pray ER although he was a son yet land he obedience by the things he suffered and he was setting an example for you otherwise how could God pray go to the mountain and pray and wait upon God God waiting upon God yay God waiting upon you God is praying to who and then from there you come and say no man should eat on you anymore no fruit and a trip Drive he didn't mean to pray because he has qualified he has finished that he has passed he has graduated do you know that's the reason the devil fights prayer oh you can say Amen to the word you can maybe study the Bible but you go to prayer oh no no no no no no where are those family holders Brothers who prays in your home who prays for your children who prays for your wife who prays for your husband who prays for you he is there that our Heavenly atmosphere in your home because how are you going to rule out that Rapture will take place when you're in your house right and yet there must be that Heavenly atmosphere because God is there [Music] let's work out wake up out of this slippery Slumber this complacency this looks I was breaking somewhere and I was talking about how that God spews you out of his nose because you are looking otherwise you are supposed to be permanently in the mouth of God a fire a believer you remain in the mouth of God but when you are lukewarm we quickly I I can't I can't I can't right yeah and when God spills you out you lose the anointing to do because you are boss the man in the mouth you are both in the hand and the handful feels the mouth speaks God speaks with the mouth full of feelings with their hand so how is the hand going fulfill when the connection to the intelligence they are not controls the hand to fulfill it you have lost it [Music] spewed out you are confused you don't know where your bearing is um [Music] praise God lord the middle God so time to graduate from a church member from a good believer from a guru Christian to God in flesh time to graduate from a prayer life to the spoken word but before you come to the spoken word you are not just going to jump the queue or jump there it is going to be a graduation a process and that's why the difference making us so weak you can't even pray five minutes but you can be on the phone for hours you can listen the news for hours you can be on social media for hours you you have friends here friends here and Tick Tock and what's up and listen to Facebook and so these are that and all the time the message you think and you're looking thing and you're looking thing what about the heaven thing do you have your connection with God is that God reforming in you until you feel him so real and is that the relationship between you you know you know when you're just getting married and that intimate closeness and friendship and relationship and warmth of love that hot love is that there in your life between you and him because the bridegroom has come in you and is residing in you and you are the bride um because it is that love that will take you home without perfect love you will not enter there now who's love not yours because you don't have a perfect love it is his it is him [Applause] and you have to begin to realize it to feel it to experience it until you can even love your enemies [Music] when you no longer even look at them as anything dangerous because they actually are promoters we thank God for our enemies oh my brother Abraham today you are preaching something how how can you say thank God for my enemies thank God for you are do you know why he has not taken away the devil yet we should thank God for the devil [Laughter] because without the devil you wouldn't be saved you wouldn't be here you don't even have that power he has given you that power because of the devil you know if you want to see the the weapons of America you don't find them in Lima you find them we are the enemies they bring them here for what now you see all the weapons of God is Warfare in his Armory I hear because the enemy is here do you know why the Bible says you you you you you you you know he he'll prepare a table for you before you are enemies and he wants you to enjoy the food when the enemy is looking out laughs he will not take them away he'll keep on it he'll protect them he'll heal them he wants them to be elephant his belief because they are you are promoters when you are sick they are the ones who challenge God on your behalf let's see he's good he says he believes this time see he's going to die and then he's going to say okay so there you are promoters amen blessed be the name of that yes do you know why Joshua when he made that angel he said are you for us or for our enemies then you say nay neither and that was God himself so yeah I'm even for your enemies Joshua I have to give them Breath of Life they have to be there so that you become a conqueror how can you conquer when there is no enemy how can you defeat the enemy when there's an enemy no enemy how can you be an overcomer qualified to sit with me in my throne when there's nothing to overcome so he makes sure you're always surrounded with enemies and that is this good plan and you wonder why they hate you they always there blessed be the name of the Lord okay so it's about time that they we the True Believers in the end time recognize recognized and started acting on the sign that God has given us the sign that proves that God is dispensation office has changed this is the reality that we must Embrace if we are to amount anything and he comes here in the message I think I will just finish quickly today he says all these things that we could speak of for hours the expressions of God to Sherman race all these have their part they play it well every flower every tree every Sunrise every sun is it everything plays it it's part well but all of those expressions of God making known to us and giving us an example and that he was going to make a great expression someday an internal expression that he sent us his expressed image in the form of his son God sent his son in the express image of himself what he thought of us so we when you see the image of Christ that's what he thought of you he changed his cast he became man he become one of us from God the internal father from The Great Creator who before there was a war revealed all the time space there was not even a meter or a light meter neither was there any atom or a molecule he was still God and He will always be God and then he comes down and says um let me leave this he says and then he went and then he was so mindful enough to make an expression to us knowing that he's so great yet he he come down in the form of his Humanity to express what he was he become a man of son acquainted with grief lived a a human life he had no place to lay his head he was expressing what if what God was in other words that is the final image of God the prophet talks about the Corporal image of Jesus they are seated and you are going to have a body changed and who is God who is Jesus God isn't it I was one time asking the church I said he says he had overcome as well I grant that he sits with me even as I overcame and I've sat with my father in my Throne so were they sharing the throne [Music] huh a big white throne and here the father sits on the sunny seats and then he says when you overcome you're also be granted the opportunity to come and see it with me in my throat like I overcame and I'm sat with my father so are we gonna be three no and it is there the Bible says God was the head of the Sun Christ is the head of the church and God was the head of Christ as Christ is the head of the church now when Christ has sat he was the body and the father was dead and when you sit you are the body and the Christ is the head one from I saw one yes yes sat on the throne amen glory to God [Applause] one body so now that is God's final expression of what he wants to be in a human body looking body look at how God treasured you not look like an angel but look like you the final yet he created you in His image but not the physical he created you in His image in the spiritual but now he creates himself in your image in the physical Hallelujah amen oh that you can really be husband and wife yeah same material born of my bones Flesh of My Flesh look at that and then he chose of all the trillions and trillions of stars and planets he chose here on Earth this is where his blood it dropped amen and this is the only star that he redeemed yes and all other stars will collapse and the Bible says all the stars were collapsing from the firmament flowing but this one will not collapse oh think about how he thought about you the final expression of his appearance like a man but before he becomes a man which he was he had to purchase you being restored back to his image personal Hospital right hmm I wish I was brother Chad come and take over brother and bring this out clearly Hallelujah he was expressing what what God was you see he laid a plan down for us all that where we could too could look at this small expression and see God this is small expression of your smaller tiny short body that may not be very very beautiful yes maybe you are not even handy sir don't care about hand something so leg summoning socialness whether your head is not doesn't matter whether you are just 50 pounds or 100 or 200 no problem he makes sure he fits and that's why when he he brought the final mystery of our inheritance the title did the book he brought it in a form of a little compressed smaller book and a little book in the Angel's hand he said go and take it and eat it so it is eatable by you [Applause] it disappears in you Final Destination the devil will never get a hold of it again it's now in you swallowed amen hahaha praise God Amen you could look at this small expression and see God and then we could look up and see God's Great Expression and have the Assurance so we look at how we can condescend and become too little and yet we see him as a very great awesome God and we have assurance and you walk with your shoulders High and you have your face on my first who is gonna scare you certainly whom do you think you are oh yeah if I I was in my father when we chased you from heaven I'm going to defeat you here I am not an amateur in this I am in my mind but not in his mind that he has now put in me I know better now I know where I came from where I'm standing and what I'm holding on and when we come to that the devil begins to tremble now who final expression God in a man final standard against the devil Hallelujah says God it was a paradox how God could become man and die that was a paradox how are the great God that filled always personally all eternity could come down and be man in order to die to serve human his own creation how God became one of his own Creations to save cause he created his own body he created his own body yes Jehovah the father dwelt in fullness in Jesus Christ his son Jesus was the body of God God was represented in the Tabernacle the Flesh of Jesus Christ and how that that one that Fearless person Lord in that eternity become one man amen become one man you see what I mean I'm finishing friends he comes here he says now I think he's in the message the world became flesh in the early trip he says now if that same spirit that say it let there be light and there was light and that said let there be trees and there was trees and if that same mind that was in Christ being in you how much could it say let there be no cancer is it hard to be spoken if you know that it is solid it's real stanky voice yeah and he leads you to say let there be no pain here let there be no cancer here that there have been no this no doubt same logos that spoke and things were created the beginning of the creation of Christ I mean the creation of God Jesus it's the beginning of the creation it's now the com the completion of the creation the Omega again [Music] he says he could say that there have been no cancer and it will be gone let the blind eyes be open and they will be so see it is your thought but wait a minute he said have faith in God for verific you see you must have faith in God and who is God the word and where is the word here time is coming you are going to have faith in you because you are God so now have faith in this one here not in you worshiping yourself and trusting yourself and but being the Tabernacle of the god here if you say if you shall say to this mountain be moved on black double cast in the suit and don't doubt it in your heart you are not good you are hurt but believe what you shall say it will come to pass you will have whatever thou says is that right you shall have it now the prophet says not me having it that is not Christ you amen you shall have it what power see what power he has given to the church but if it becomes a real revelation of God that you see it before it happened and express it in word form now the real revelation of God where we are going now is that before you speak the word you see it you already see yourself healed amen amen you already see yourself of the wheelchair walking you already see yourself strong and let it tumor gone you already see yourself delivered and then you say let there be a Deliverance this is wonderful friends that you see it before it happened and express it in word form and that word takes a hole and becomes material becomes tangible yes becomes material materializes into reality amen a thought expressed oh my how God see your heart and your mind this is so and filled with God is Spirit until your thoughts become his thoughts amen there you are when you are mind and you are leading and you are guiding becomes a direct place or a direct expression of the holy spirit that is moving your motor being oh my what kind of people we should be that is a question you should answer if the very Holy Spirit has so embodied or empowered that you don't use your own thoughts you don't use your own mind remember this is cancer remember this is the leukemia remember this is asthma remember if you don't use your own mind remember the doctor said this we are superior than the doctor that man in you that man whom you are dying to give room that good he's the one who created the doctor so come on go beyond that leave that office come here amen you have forgotten who you are [Music] amen don't talk the language of the Jews talk the language of the believer amen the language of the Bride the language of God oh he says what kind of church should we be he says you don't use your own thoughts you don't use your own mind you don't use your own opinions but the Holy Spirit has you so built until your thoughts and your being is God is Spirit expressing itself through you what kind of a church would we be what kind of people would it be this morning maybe this evening if this burningham Tabernacle let us call it BCF this evening was so filled with the princess of God why when you don't even use your own mind didn't even use your thoughts didn't even have no you I don't know ultimately ultimately I don't know this of your own but just to be laid by the spirit amen friends time is coming you will not even need anybody to lay hands on you who lay the hands on Jesus you are going to start creating your own healing where you are seated you are on Deliverance you are on Victory you are only strength transformation graduate now from prayer at least you do the prayer examination and pass because you are not going to come here until you graduate here but this is where we are coming to amen and this is my focus yes no I'm not just going to be happy praying for the people I don't care whether I'm praying for how many and they are getting healed that is not graduation that is not promotion that is retardation I want to come to a point where people will be delivered as we preach the word people are just walking up throwing away their crutches because it is there they are speaking it it's there they are they are having God the reality is here [Music] I am getting tired people bringing you everywhere come here brother I want to pray you pray for me prayer request this pray for me on the phone pray for this pray for you pray for God time is going to come when you all become Gods who will pray for God God he doesn't need prayers now God speaks the word well this is a new doctor no this is what we are eating this is the message now that's the reality this message brings us to and whether the devil wants or not we are gonna get there [Applause] Glory oh God maybe your pastor should just help you put yourself right and then everything begins to work here are the Dynamics you just put the car had some problem maybe the wire was cut here then we put it right and then he put the key and start the cargo I don't have to drive the car for you oh let's put it right glory to God and he says and they are the sons of God led by the spirit of God and when the human element goes out when the human element goes out there's human feeding the human reasoning opinion feelings the way I see it I felt this I felt it is [Applause] the American element the intellectual element goes out replaced by this financial element [Applause] so when the human element goes out and the spirit of God fills the fat currency that can't see I'm reading for you the prophet the human element goes out and then the spirit of God fills that vacuum so in other words creative workers God what God doesn't want to come and struggle to enter God is not a get Crusher he's not a house breaker he's a gentleman he waits at the door not only should there be a vacancy in your heart but there should be an invitation coming Lord come and have your way take overload I'm tired with this useless stupid head of mind making rounds of foolishness reasoning this arguing this knowing this knowing nothing tomorrow it will be a bunch of rotten I want you so that even when I was to sleep I'll have the earnest of Resurrection I will have the assure so anyway I see blessed the assurance Jesus Is Mine I have a fortress yes oh what a forward test of Glory divine test it here yes so the spirit of God feels that if I can say where you empathize yourself amen then we'll be then when the church in its power of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ walks in his steps in his power in his thoughts in his being in his moving you see what I mean congregation says amen I don't know about BCF amen then your thoughts become what and ones become material what is become material that's when the church is in its power listen concludes I believe it's on its Road that's what I'm believing into it's coming I can feel it I can smell it we are going somewhere no wonder you've been yearning for something isn't it you feel like you have not made it you feel like something is there you want to get somewhere yeah and you're always telling the devil there's something I must get to now we begin to see it is that when the church will be so wrapped in Christ so wrapped in Christ the Holy Spirit mankind is so away from theirselves hey so away from them they are slaves that they don't see themselves you'd only see yourself yes that's the word so away from yourself that you don't see yourself you see God you see Christ you see the word and what you see speaks you you hear it you believe it you are not hmm they don't have no and then but to serve God and their thoughts and then move on they refuse the things of the world they just move in the spirit living the spirit move in the spirit walk in the spirit to fulfill the love Christ then the love of Christ in the human heart moving the holy ghost that great wonderful church will come we'll go forth with power and deity because deity will be revealed in human beings by the Holy Spirit bringing it to pass bringing it to pass the thought of their mind that is the office you're believing Christ who is Grace you believe in Jesus has said he saved you that is what is done now come here what is the final office God in him so when you believe God in you you will be so away from yourself flow away from your mind because you will be dead to not even be your mind think about that when it is not even in your mind anymore even your opinions your feelings nothing is working that's it's not it's there but it's ineffective paralyzed you see when you have a hand which you cannot do anything overtaken overwhelmed subdued amen then he comes down on in the message conference with God he says what are we his mouthpiece we submit ourselves to him and our words are not our words take no thought what you shall say cause it's not you that speaks it's the father that dwells in you he speaks so that same father that the disciples say show us your father now the prophet is telling ask the daddy father now dwells in you man you don't have to say oh show me the father father show me show me show you what right what do you want him to show you God is purpose we find it here in sending the Holy Spirit was one purpose that God himself might dwell in his church and continue his plan through the church continue his plans through the church that is the purpose that God was in Christ continuing his plans through Christ out of Christ into the church continuing his work through the church so he came out of Christ eh since the prophet is speaking not let me repeat that that God was in Christ continue his plan through Christ out of Christ into the church Christ is the one now in the church so that of Jesus Christ Jesus Christ of Nazareth empty praise God oh where is he he's in a church he's in you and you are looking for him at an empty office dispensational change you believe in Christ believe also in in this world this is the final stage this is where he is he's here not here here so when the devil troubles it doesn't trouble your mind it troubles your heart when he is no longer there he's not yet there you will get troubled then you are looking there you are looking for a solution from a wrong resource right right no wonder when Titus the Roman general came and the Jews gathered in the temple they thought God was going to protect them because they are in the temple they didn't know that the dispensation of God protecting a temple had gone that's why the veil of the temple was rent and them high priests knew these things not a bogus thing from the day we crucified that man this is a burger thing because we saw how they Veil that separated the holy of holies from the common view so they could whisper to one another we are here but we know we are nothing right yeah bogus where was God we cannot say it's lightning we cannot say it's the devil can the devil come and stay at the holiday they must be God himself amen so that means god is no longer here they knew that's why even the denominations one man one woman preacher came to me and said pastor I want to tell you something I said the day you prayed for that blind woman and she saw and we we started coming and peeping and seeing he says we have told one another all denomination is now no that God just passes by our churches but he stays with you oh yeah they know Nicodemus confessed no man can do these things without amen amen we know we know they knew they were prepared so these nominations are just masquerading no wonder they are swallowing every Tommy wrote they are supporting any pervasion they have nothing they lose nothing they miss nothing they have no relationship with God so he left the dominations now he left the office of heavenly father he left the office of Christ hey now he's in the word incarnate [Music] hey man what incarnate that's where he is and where is that office in you if he is not yet in you younger man younger woman brother sister here pray to him tonight because this is the season that God was in Christ continue his plans through Christ then out of Christ into the church continuing his work through the church and now we know what the holy spirit is we found out last night that it is God then he comes down here may I say it like this all that God was he born into Christ because he emptied himself and poured it into Christ so he left to that office praise God Amen and Christ was the fullness of godhead body and all that Jehovah was he poured into Christ all that Christ was he born into the church not into one individual some great super no one some great Messiah some great grand brother somewhere in Africa America where Europe some great man we are looking for there is a brother in South America there is a brother in Nigeria there's a brother in Uganda there's a brother in
