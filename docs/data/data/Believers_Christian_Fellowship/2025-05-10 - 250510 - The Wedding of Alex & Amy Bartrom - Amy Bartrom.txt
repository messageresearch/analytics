[Music] Dearly beloved, we are gathered together in the presence of God to join together this man and woman in holy matrimony. me. It is an honorable estate instituted of God, signifying unto us the mystical union that is between Christ and his church. It is commanded in the scriptures to be honorable among all, and therefore is not by any to be entered into unadvisedly or lightly, but reverently, discreetly, advisedly, soberly, and in the fear of God. Into this holy estate, these two persons come now to be joined. We have gathered as family and friends of this man and this woman to lend our support and goodwill to this holy union. Who will give this woman to be married to this man? You can be seated. Alex Christopher Bartram, will you take Amy Elizabeth Preston to be your wedded wife, to live together after God's ordinance and holy in the holiest state of matrimony? Will you love her, comfort her, honor and keep her in sickness and in health, forsaking all others, keeping yourself only unto her so long as you both shall live? I will. Amy Elizabeth Preston, will you take Alex Christopher Bartram to be your wedded husband to live together after God's ordinance in the holiest state of matrimony? Will you love him, comfort him, honor and obey him in sickness and in health, forsaking all others, keeping yourself only unto him so long as you both shall live. I will. Let's all bow our heads together and pray. Dear Lord Jesus, as we've come together, Lord, we've gathered on this special occasion to see Brother Alex and sister Amy joined together in the holy union of marriage that you first instituted so long ago in the Garden of Eden. And Lord, we pray your blessings would be upon this ceremony, Lord, that your Holy Spirit would be felt, that you would be present to bind this woman and this man together. And may you bless all that we say and do. May it bring glory unto your name. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. And I'd like to speak for just a moment on the covenant of marriage. And I'd like to begin by just talking about covenant in general just for just a moment. Uh in the beginning, the the Bible starts in Genesis with the story of God creating the heavens and the earth. And we see him forming everything that he formed. And he created the Garden of Eden. And he placed a man there. and he put a man under a covenant. And it says in Genesis 2:15, "And the Lord God took the man and put him into the Garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it." And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, "Of every tree of the garden, thou mayest freely eat. But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it, for in the day thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die." So God placed man to rule over this garden, and he placed him there to dress it and to keep it. But he gave him a commandment and he gave him this commission, but it was under condition. You can have anything you want in here, but don't touch this tree. So that was a covenant with God, a man, but it was a conditional covenant. Then there was another covenant that he made one time in Genesis 9. After the flood, he made a covenant with Noah and every living creature. And that covenant was that he would never destroy the earth again with a flood. And he made a token, a sign in the heavens of his covenant that he would keep his promise. And that covenant token was the rainbow. So that when it rains, the rainbow is the token of God's covenant that he's going to keep his promise. So a covenant is a pledge. It's a promise. It's an agreement. And so God has been getting in covenants with man all down through time. Then later on in the book of Genesis, he would come into another covenant with another man. And that covenant was with Abraham. Only this time, this wasn't a conditional covenant. Because we know that Adam was under a conditional covenant. When Adam broke the conditions of the covenant, the covenant was broken and now he would die. And now he would no longer be ruler over the earth. But when God came to Abraham, he comes to Abraham and says, "I give you an unconditional covenant." And here's what Paul says in Hebrews 6. For when God made promise to Abraham, because he would swear by no greater, he swear by himself, saying, "Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee." And so after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise. For men verilely swear by the greater, and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife, wherein God willing more abundantly to show unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath, that by two immutable things in which it is impossible for God to lie, we might have strong consolation, who have fled for refuge, to lay hold upon the hope set before us, which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast, and which enterth enterth into that within the veil. So when God made a covenant, he based the covenant on two immutable things. One, his counsel will never change and one, his word would never fail. And he made an oath based upon himself. Here's what the prophet of God says. He says he had a covenant with Adam, the first man on earth. And that covenant was on conditions. If you do so and so, I'll do so and so. And Adam would have something to do in order to keep his covenant alive before God. He had to walk in God's ways, keeping all of his word, not breaking one word. But then he made another covenant, and that was with Abraham. This covenant was not on conditions, but was unconditionally. God gave the covenant to Abraham. No strings tied to it at all. Unconditionally, not I will, I have, I've already done it. So that's the difference between a conditional and an unconditional covenant. But what you guys are going to enter into now is the marriage covenant. And you guys are going to make a covenant with one another. Brother Alex, you'll make a covenant. Sister Amy and Sister M. You'll make a covenant or a pledge back to Alex. And this is an unconditional covenant like the one God made with Abraham. We already read part of that when I asked you your intent. When we first got up here, I asked you. I asked Alex. I said, 'ould you take uh Amy to be your wedded wife to live together after God's ordinance in the holy state of matrimony? Will you love her, comfort her, honor, and keep her in sickness and in health, forsaking all others, keep yourself only under her so long as you both shall live? And you already answered positive to that. You said you will. That promise that you made wasn't based on any conduct of Amy. It had nothing to do with Amy except she was the object of your pledge. But it was based on your promise alone. It wasn't based on how well Amy performed or on anything any merit of yours. It was based purely on your pledge to her. That was an unconditional covenant. Later we'll come to the vows. When you make a vow to one another and your vow will say that you you promise to take one another to have and to hold from this day forward for better for worse for rich or for poor in sickness and in health to love and to cherish till death do us part according to God's holy ordinance and there too I give thee my pledge. That also is an unconditional covenant. It doesn't say I will if you will. I promise. If you promise, all you said was, "I will. I will take you to be my wife. I will from this day forward, for better, for worse, under every circumstance, I won't change my pledge." This is a mirror of the pledge that God made to us. And that pledge is based on one thing. It's based on love. It's a pledge based on love. In the book of Malachi, they wondered, they were asking God, "How do you love us?" The Jews had a question. They didn't understand God's love. He says, "I love loved you, sayeth the Lord. Yet you say, "Wherein hast thou loved us? Was not Esau Jacob's brother, sayeth the Lord, yet I love Jacob." And Paul picks it up in Romans 9 and he says, ' And not only this, but when Bre Rebecca also conceived one by even our father Isaac. For the children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth. It was said unto her, the elder shall serve the younger, as it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated. And this is what the prophet says according to the scripture. says, "Let us examine the first phrase, as many as I love." He's speaking here in the book of Revelations. In the Greek, the emphasis is upon the personal pronoun I. He does not say as many would feel. He should say as many as love me. No, sir. We must never try to make Jesus the object of human love in this verse. No, it is the many that are the loved ones of God. It is his love in question, not ours. So once again we find ourselves gloring in his salvation, his purpose, his plan and we are confirmed even more strongly in the truth of doctrine of the sovereignty of God. Later he goes on to say this love is elective love. It is his love for his elect and his love for them is apart from human merit. For it says that the purpose of God stands in election which is exactly opposite to works or anything man has in himself. Because before the children were born, he had already said, "Jacob have I loved, and Esau have I hated." So God's covenant with man was based off God's love for man. God's love for his elect, for his chosen. And Alex, your pledge to Amy is based on love. Amen. I remember so long ago, about five months when you two met at a coffee maker in our house, and everybody could see that a flame had burst and erupted into a bonfire. And by the end of the evening, it was obvious that the sparks were flying. And so, here we stand just a mere five months later. And within that time, of course, you had known each other before, but you hadn't started your relationship until January 1st, 2025. And I'm so privileged to have seen it. We were all whispering and giving each other eyes and actually moving around you as you took up all the space at the coffee maker, oblivious to the rest of the world. But that was wonderful. But it was that spark that was that knowing. It was that connection that began that that knowing, that love. And in five months time, you've got to a place where you'll make an unconditional promise for life. That you've gone from just knowing one another and knowing about one another to actually building a relationship to where you're so convinced that this is God's plan for you. You're so convinced this is your wife and you're so convinced this is your husband that you'll stand before friends and family and you'll make a pledge. You'll make a promise and that promise has no plan B. There's no escaping that promise. There's no clause in the vows for I will unless you do. I will until you do. But that's not what you promised each other. Your promise is I will in sickness and in health, in good times and in bad times. I will. I'll be faithful to you. I'll be true to you. I'll stay with you. I'll forsake all others and stay with you until one of us leaves this earth till death do us part. That's the only way that this covenant can be broke. And you made it based on love. Love made you so confident that you would be willing to take a lifelong pledge pledge to one another. Amen. That's the power of love. And that's human love. And if that's if that's how powerful your love is for one another, how much more powerful is God's love which is permanent and perfect and he was able to make a pledge before we were born and came to this earth that he will love us and he will never forsake us and he will never lose us. So your pledge is just mirroring God's great pledge. Amen. the the condition for the for the pledge is based on love, not on merit or behavior. When uh when the flames erupted at the coffee maker, it wasn't because Amy turned in the resume and she had all the qualifications. You didn't tick off all the boxes. No, there was something else going on. You found your counterpart. You found a match. You found a complimentary piece that fit. And you begin to realize it. It become became obvious. Amen. So it was something more than accolades. It was something more than achievements. It was something more than degrees, financial status, or position in life. That wasn't based off merit. It wasn't based off performance. It began with love. In 2 Timothy 1:9 it says, "Who hath saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began." In Deuteronomy 7, God speaks to the children of Israel in the Exodus says, "For thou art a holy people unto the Lord thy God. The Lord thy God has chosen thee to be a special people unto himself above all people that are upon the face of the earth. The Lord did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because you were more in number than any people, for you were the fewest of all people. But because the Lord loved you, and because he he would keep the oath which he has sworn unto your fathers, hath the Lord brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of bondman from the hand of Pharaoh, king of Egypt. So why did God set his love on them? Not because they were the most, not because they were the greatest, because at the time he called them out, they were slaves. So it wasn't their merit, but it was his love that he set upon them and his promise and his oath. And then the unconditional covenant that God gives to us is not based on our strength because we have none. His covenant and promise to the seed of Abraham is based on his strength, on his unfailing commitment. And so your covenant to one another is not based on the strength of the other. So Alex, your covenant to Amy is not based on her merit or her strength and is not tied to performance, failure, or success. It's only tied to the merit of your love and commitment to her. So you're not asking her to keep your covenant. You've promised to do it based on your own strength and your own love. But Amy, you'll ple make a pledge back to Alex. And you're not asking him for strength to keep the covenant. You've promised to do it regardless of his merit, regardless of his conduct, regardless of his behavior. And you promised for life. That's the power of love. That's what binds you together. That's what gives you the courage to make this kind of covenant. Ephesians 2:8 says, "For by grace are you saved through faith, and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God, not of works, lest any man should boast." This is grace. This is God's unmmerited favor to us. Not because we would get things right, because we always got it wrong. Man has always failed. That's why God would have to have an unconditional covenant because he knew we would not always get it right. But he was pretty sure because of the fall, we would always get it wrong. So, he couldn't make the covenant based off our performance and our conduct because then the covenant would be broken. So, he had to base it on himself, his promise, his strength, and his love. That's why you can't base your covenant on the performance of one another, but only on your promise to each other. And in doing so, you'll reflect the great love that God has for us. That he loves us in sickness and in health. He loves us for rich or poor. He loves us when we do well, and he loves us when we don't do well. He loves us when we're performing well. He loves us when we're underperforming as well because he set his love on us because his love is elective. Alex, your love for Amy was elective. You chose her. Something about her fit you and you knew she was the one. And you chose her and you proposed to her. But Amy, you had to accept his choice. It had to also be your choice. You had to choose back. No matter how much he loved you, no matter how much he was willing to make a covenant with you, you had to have faith that he loved you. You had to have faith that he was the one and that you were his counterpart. and you had to accept that invitation. It's the same thing for us in Christ. In Ephesians 1, it says, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ, according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love, having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will, to the praise of the glory of the grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved. He didn't choose us because we were great, but his choice made us accepted in the beloved. God is only looking for one thing from us, and that's to accept his love for us. To have faith in his willingness to make a covenant with us and choose us. And that faith that we have in us is an expression of the faith of Abraham, to believe God, to receive his word, and to receive his covenant. So then for us that are in union with Christ or want to be in union with Christ, he has made a pledge. He's made a promise for the seed of Abraham and he's only looking for somebody who will accept it. Somebody who will receive it. His elect, his love, the recipients of his love. Alex found that in you and you were very willing to accept. I believe Christ has found that many of us and we were very willing to accept. He found his counterpart, the token of his love, the object of his love. He had made a promise and something in us could accept it. And so what kind of love should we have for Christ? If he had this kind of love for us, what kind of love should we have back to him? I believe it should be an unconditional love. Not just because he showers us with blessings or because everything in life goes right or because he always makes everything work out. But I think we should love him even when things don't work out. We should love him in good times and in bad times. We should love him in richer and in poor. We should give back to him the same kind of love he gave to us. Not just wanting him to give us t tokens and affection and blessings, but he loved us. He first loved us so that we could love him. And so God gave us an unconditional promise, an unconditional covenant. And I want to give him back love without condition. Alex, your pledge to Amy will be an unconditional pledge. But I think in response, Amy will give you an unconditional pledge. and in good times and in bad times when things go well, when things don't go well, when you when you bless each other and sometimes you'll disappoint one another. But don't forget the power of love and the power of your covenant. That Alex, if you're disappointed, if something doesn't go right, don't forget your covenant. Don't forget why you made the covenant. And don't forget, your covenant wasn't based on anything that Amy would do or not do. It was only based on your love for her. And you are very willing to make that covenant. Same thing for you, Amy. There may be times of disappointment or discouragement or times when things go well and times when they don't go well. But don't forget the strength of your covenant is based off your love, not performance, not merit. There are other people that can do great things and have great achievements, but that's not why you loved her. Not for her achievements, not for her merit. You loved her because you loved her. Period. Amy, it's the same thing for Alex. You may find somebody who can do something that he does better, but you didn't do you didn't love him because of his performance. You loved him because of him, and you were willing to enter this covenant. So, if you still are in agreement and you want to make this covenant, it'd be a pleasure for me to help you exchange your vows. Now, if you'd like to turn and face one another. Alex, if you could look at Amy and repeat after me, please. I, Alex, I, Alex, take thee, Amy, take the Amy, to be my wedded wife. to be my wedded wife.

Lord, may you shine a bright light in them, and may you bless the fruit of their union. May you bless their home and all that you have for them to do. May they go forth from here, Lord, as one under your shelter, under your protection, and may your Holy Spirit be their guide in all things. We ask it, Lord, in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. For as much as you, Alex and Amy, have consented together in holy wedlock, and have witnessed the same before God in this congregation, and in so doing have given and pledged your vows to each other, and have declared the same by the giving and receiving of rings. I by the authority that is vested in me as a minister of the word of God pronounce you husband and wife in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. What God has joined, let no man put us under.
