========================================

AMEN. THAT'S THE THAT'S THE PROBLEM. AMEN. WITH SO MUCH WHAT'S CALLED GOSPEL PREACHING IN THIS DAY BECAUSE THEY'RE IN THE WRONG DISPENSATION. AMEN. THEY'RE GOING BACK. AMEN. WHERE THE APOSTLES WERE WITNESSES. THERE'S NOT A THING WRONG WITH ANY OF THAT. BUT THE PROBLEM IS THERE'S BEEN ANOTHER DISPENSATIONAL CHANGE AT the end time. AND WE ARE NOW TRANSITIONED FROM CHURCH AGES TO END TIME. AND IN THE END TIME, there was ANOTHER WORK FOR CHRIST TO DO. AND IT was fulfilling the role OF KINSMAN REDEEMER, JUDGING AT THE GATE AND TAKING BACK THE BOOK THAT ADAM LOST. AND WE LIVE IN THAT DAY. AND WE'RE WITNESSES OF THESE THINGS. &gt;&gt; THESE ARE THE THINGS WE TESTIFY. THESE ARE THE THINGS we witness. This is what &gt;&gt; THIS IS WHAT'S BRINGING LIFE TODAY. &gt;&gt; IT'S ALWAYS THE WORD FOR YOUR DAY THAT BRINGS LIFE. THE DISPENSATION OF CHRIST. IT'S THE SAME JESUS CHRIST THAT PAID THE PRICE 2,000 YEARS AGO IS THE SAME ONE WHO TOOK THE BOOK IN OUR GENERATION WHO LOOSED THE SEVEN SEALS AND BROUGHT IT DOWN TO MAN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And ye are witnesses of these things. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WHO ELSE IS GOING TO WITNESS IT? WHAT OTHER CHURCH AGE? WHAT OTHER DISPENSATION? WHO ELSE ON THE PLANET IS GOING TO WITNESS WHAT OUR DISPENSATION IS AND WHAT MONUMENTALLY SHIFTED IN 1963 AND WHAT CHRIST IS DOING NOW? WHO'S GOING TO WITNESS IT? &gt;&gt; If you and I DON'T EAT THE BOOK AND WITNESS AND PROPHESY AGAIN, THE WORLD IS STEEPED IN DARKNESS AND NOBODY KNOWS WHAT CHRIST IS DOING TODAY. ALL THEY KNOW IS A HISTORICAL JESUS CHRIST, BUT THEY DON'T KNOW A PRESENT TENSE JESUS CHRIST. AMEN. WHO IS THE REDEEMER WHO BOUGHT BACK ALL THAT ADAM LOST? AND WHEN HE BOUGHT BACK ALL THAT ADAM LOST, HE GOT HIMSELF A GENTILE BRIDE. AND IN ORDER TO FINISH THE REDEMPTION, HE'S GOT TO TAKE THAT BRIDE. AMEN. AND HE'S GOT TO SEW HIS SEED INTO THAT BRIDE. AND SHE'S GOT TO REPRODUCE THE SON OF MAN AGAIN. &gt;&gt; IF WE DON'T TESTIFY, WHO WILL? &gt;&gt; LUTHER'S AGE COULDN'T DO IT. WESLEY'S AGE COULDN'T DO IT. THE LEODYSIAN AGE, THE PENTECOSTAL AGE COULDN'T DO IT. AMEN. WE CAN'T WAIT FOR SOMEBODY IN THE FUTURE TO DO IT. YE ARE WITNESSES OF THESE THINGS. &gt;&gt; What you have HEARD AND SEEN IN DARKNESS, AMEN, TESTIFY IN THE LIGHT, WHAT GOD HAS REVEALED TO YOU IN YOUR INNER EAR, AMEN, OF YOUR SOUL. SHOUT IT FROM THE HOUSETOPS. AMEN. BECAUSE WE'RE NOT LOOKING BACK TO 2,000 YEARS AGO. BUT THERE'S A PRESENT TENSE MOVE OF GOD. THERE'S BEEN A DISPENSATIONAL CHANGE IN OUR GENERATION THAT'S BROUGHT US INTO A WHOLE ANOTHER RELATIONSHIP WITH CHRIST.
