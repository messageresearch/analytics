yesterday today and forever god we trust you and commit ourselves unto you and ask that you'd keep each of us lord in jesus christ's name we pray amen amen thank you for praying with me on that let's read revelation chapter 5 before we're seated and look at verse 1. and i saw on the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the back side sealed with seven seals and i saw a strong angel proclaim with a loud voice who was worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in heaven nor on earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon and i wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look there on and one of the elders saith unto me weep not behold the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof and i beheld and low in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood the lambs that had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent forth unto all the earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne amen god bless you god bless the reading of his word as you're seated and then when we come to this i want to do just a little bit of review this will be part four of the unexpected fulfillment and i want to do just a little review from sunday and then move forward as we were but when we when we come to this revelation chapter 5 brother venom calls this passage the most sublime scripture in all the bible amen because the lamb is stepping forth to take the book and we know he teaches us that this book was the title deed to all of creation and this book was the title deed that adam lost amen so you have to recognize that that god never really wanted this book he didn't write the book for him amen he was the creator of all things he doesn't need a title deed for what he created amen if you create something you don't need a title deed for that to prove ownership you're the one who made it amen you could always make another one you don't need a title deed he didn't need a title deed but he created all of his creation amen and he put a man over all of it amen and he gave him the title deed to all creation so that he could rule all that god had created and he was ruling it as a god upon the earth until he fell by disobeying the word of god and when he did he lost the right amen to the title deed and and so it went back into the hand of the one who gave it and so because satan couldn't get his dirty hands on it it went back to the original owner and now god's been holding it but god doesn't want to hold this book amen he gave it to man and he wants men to have this book praise god so you have to realize god is not wanting to hold the book he's only holding the book long enough till the worthy one can come and take it amen so you've got to be able to cross the checklist you have to be a kinsmen redeemer so you have to be a near kinsman check amen so he's holding it until somebody can check the boxes on the list you have to be able to pay the price of redemption and jesus was the only one able to pay the price of redemption amen for he was created amen he was created in the womb of mary and he was the born virgin born amen he was pure and unadulterated and clean and lived a perfect life so his blood was the only human blood that could atone for all the other human beings so he was able to pay the price check he was able to meet the qualifications check and and he wanted to do it amen check final check and that that that title deed book amen was in the hand of him waiting for the one that can check all the boxes and come and take it out of his hand amen god has been desiring somebody to take that out of his hand praise be to god amen so we know here that a strong angel proclaimed with a loud voice who was worthy to open the book and to loose the seals and no man in heaven when the search goes out in heaven and earth and under the earth they were looking for a man there was no man it didn't say anything about angels there was all kinds of other created beatings there in the heavenlies amen and created beings on the earth but none of them the search wasn't through any of them the search was through man no man in heaven no man on earth no man under the earth they were searching through mankind to find the man that could take the book and there was no man in the search that was found worthy to take the book until a man stepped forth from the throne from the midst of the throne and it was the man christ jesus as the lamb that had been slain before the foundation of the world and he was worthy to take the book he was the near kinsman he could pay the price of redemption he met the qualifications to be a kinsmen redeemer and he was willing to do so so that's when john was told to weep not because there is one here that is going to take the book i want to read a few quotes out of the breach brother branham in paragraph 156 in the breach he says he saw one sitting upon the throne with his book and his hand and his right hand think of it now and then in this book was the title deed to redemption and it was sealed with seven seals and then an angel come forth a strong angel proclaim with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book to take the book who was able to open the seals who was able to open this book the angel asked it john saw it and he said now who is worthy let him and brother venom stop and said oh my maybe i'm just feeling this this away what's he feeling what's he getting excited about amen because when it came time to take the title deed book there has to be a strong angel that would call for a kinsman redeemer to come forth and the scene's already been played out in the bible amen so when it comes time for the kinsmen redeemer to take the book the first thing that has to come forth is a strong angel has to has to say who is worthy to take the book now brother branham is here in the breach and he's saying who is worthy to come and take this book amen he's coming to the preaching of the seals when he preaches the seals somebody's got to come and take that book that can loose those seals before brother branham can preach the seals so here he is in the breach the night before he's beginning the seals and he's saying who is worthy and there's what he says i want to read it again so we can catch it in context and it was sealed with seven seals and then an angel come forth a strong angel proclaimed with a loud voice who was worthy to open the book to take him to take the the book and who was able to open the seals who was able to open this book see the angel asked it john saw it and he said now who is worthy let him brother ben says it like that let him oh my maybe i'm just feeling this away amen maybe i'm just feeling this this away what's he feeling he knows it's time for the seals an angel has to say who's worthy that's what initiates the movement friends and god is reflecting on earth what's been happening in heaven and now there's a strong angel proclaiming let him come forth who is worthy let him let the worthy one come let the kinsmen redeemer let him come forth maybe i'm just feeling this this away friends i say no you weren't just feeling it this away amen god was displaying what he was coming to [Music] then again in the breach he says but john wept because there was nobody found nobody could do it and john wept here's what i think he wept for because if no one was worthy and could open this book of redemption the whole creation was lost here is the book here is the title deed and will be offered to the kinsman redeemer that can meet the qualification that's god's own law and he can't defile his law defy his law rather see god's god required a kinsmen redeemer who was worthy who was able to do it who had the substance to do it and the angel said now let that kinsman redeemer step forward oh praise god you know we have to have our eyes open to what's happened in our day because if not we're still thinking what will happen will come something will come something will happen friends it's already happened amen maybe i'm just feeling this this away but let him come forward now and you realize when john began to weep he says what was he weeping for he meant he was weeping but the man said this is why i think he was weeping because if nobody was found worthy to take that book amen when when the angel proclaimed who was worthy listen now there had been 2 000 years and for 2 000 years nobody was stepping forward and nobody was stepping forward and the book was in his hand and nobody was moving nothing was happening amen and and there's nothing going on amen for 2 000 years but the time that it's time to take the book a strong angel has to proclaim who's worthy and john begins to weep because he realizes if nobody can take that book when it's time to take the book all of redemption is lost and here's the seventh angel on earth standing here in the breach the seventh angel the last one do we agree on that there can't be an eighth one so here's the seventh one and he's 50 some years old and he's the last one and this has to happen while he's on earth so you realize friends while that prophet is on earth the seventh angel messenger while he's on earth these seals have to open this has to transpire christ has to come and if it doesn't happen all of redemption is lost friends it is all lost if it doesn't happen while that seventh angel is on earth it's way bigger than we realize it's way more involved than we ever thought amen all of redemption was hinging on what was taking place in that seventh angel's ministry all of redemption was hinging on the fact that christ would come the lamb would step forward during the seventh angels ministry because it has to happen during his ministry while he's on earth it cannot happen after he dies so can you see there's a strong angel proclaiming let him come forth if there's one that can do it let him come forth because it can't happen after i'm gone it has to happen while i'm here if the seals wouldn't have come open friends why would we in the same the seventh angel died there would be redemption would be lost all that christ paid for will now be lost so much bigger than we ever thought and we thought it was pretty big so much more intense than we ever realized he was weeping because if nobody came forth at this time if nobody came forth at that time all of redemption is lost in paragraph 299 of the breach he says talk about a jubilee amen talk about a time when the lamb walked forth see the books even sealed in heaven the mysteries are say is my name there i don't know i hope it is but if it is it was put on the book before the foundation of the world but the first thing that represented that redemption come the lamb that had been slain from the foundation of the world and he took the book glory opened the book and tore off the seals and sent it down to earth to his seventh angel to reveal it to his people can it happen later it can't happen later it's got to happen while the seventh angel's present he opened the book so the lamb had to come forth he had to open the book tiller off the seals sent it down to earth to his seventh angel to reveal it to his people and and if you read in your church or your seventh seal book if you pick up your seven seal book there is a an edit in there there's a parenthesis where they edited a statement and it says in their congregation greatly rejoices and if you listen on to the tape when brother branham comes to this part he said he opened the book tore off the seals sent it down to earth to his seventh angel to reveal it to his people the people erupt in praise why are they erupting in praise go read revelations 5 and if you read revelation 5 you'll know exactly why they broke out and greatly rejoicing congregation greatly rejoices why they had to because the scene was unfolding friends there you are oh my what happened the screams the shouts the hallelujahs the anointing the power the glory the manifestations and then there's another injection of an edit and it says congregation continues to greatly rejoice why it's revelation chapter five amen it's the breach brother ben's preaching in the breach standing in the breach and what is a breach a breach is made a gap between two things that can be a breach but a breach is also a bursting force or a coming forth a breaking force something is happening in the breach said an old john who had been standing there our brother crying why he said everything in heaven everything in earth everything in the sea heard me holler amen blessing honor and might and power be to him that lives forever and ever talk about a happy time when them seals broke john must have looked in and seen past the curtain of time and said there's john oh he was so happy he said everything in heaven he must have really cried out didn't he everything in heaven everything in the earth everything beneath the earth every creature and everything else heard me saying amen blessings and glory and wisdom and power and might and riches belong to him amen so what does the lamb do when he steps forward he takes the book tears off the seals throws them down to the seventh church age messenger who reveals it to the people now you see how critical it was that the seals opened while brother brennam was alive what other option is there let's go to first corinthians praise be to god i want to look at this from some statements that i made on sunday and i want to look at this through the scripture from this perspective first corinthians 15 and verse 12. now christ be preached that he rose from the dead how some say among you that there is no resurrection of the dead but if there be no resurrection of the dead then this christ not risen and if christ be not risen then is our preaching vain and your faith is also vain yea and we are found false witnesses of god because we have testified of god that he raised up christ whom he raised not up if so be that the dead rise not for if the dead rise not then is not christ raised and if christ be not raised your faith is vain and ye are yet in your sins then they also which are fallen asleep in christ are perished if in this life only we have hope in christ we're of all men most miserable what is paul preaching paul is now showing that christ had to die to pay the price of redemption but if christ died and paid the price of redemption but nothing happened after that then your faith is in vain and you're yet in your sins and those that died in christ have perished because there there is more to redemption than just paying the price so jesus paid the price of redemption nothing needs to be added to that price the full price was paid the full price was paid nothing needs to be added to that price but other things need to happen in the full cycle of redemption now christ he needs to raise again to prove that he was the one worthy to pay the price and if he didn't raise then those that sleep in christ they have perished and your faith is vain and you're yet in your sins so if he you know if you just stopped at calvary and didn't catch the next part in the plan and path of redemption and prophecy then everything is perished if he just died and didn't resurrect it then then you're yet in your sins but because he died and he resurrected now that you know that there's hope for a resurrection that the promise of life has been restored and we above all men are not most miserable we're not saved but doomed to die we're not saved but no no salvation of creation no resurrection no restoration back amen will never walk upon the earth again as they did in the garden of eden if he just died you're paid for everything's paid for but nothing's brought back to its position so there has to be more this this plan of redemption has to keep unfolding the fullness of redemption to come to a full restoration of what's been lost and then brother branham can come and take a a statement like he made in the breach concerning revelation chapter 5 amen brother i'm saying in revelations chapter 5 that john was weeping amen because if nobody could claim to take this book all of redemption is lost he said how could all of redemption is lost he's already paid for it but he's paid for it but he hasn't claimed it yet it's paid for but not claimed so if he doesn't claim his redemption it's all lost it's like if you have something in the pawn shop you send in the check to pay the price for redemption and say i've sent this check in here i'll come and claim my redemption if you never claim it it wasn't redeemed fully the process isn't finished amen until it's claimed it's paid for but not claimed and it was paid for and never claimed was it redeemed it was partially well how do you have a partial redemption redemption is bringing back to its former state redemption means bring it back to the position it was in before so in order to complete redemption you've got to pay the price amen the one who paid the price has to resurrect to show that there's a power of restoration of bringing life back amen to bring it all back the way it was and then now he has to do a work of intercession amen because he's got to redeem those who would not fully believe the word is that right because in the seven church ages amen they would have partial revelation of the word they would hold on to the partial but there's many things that were contrary to the word amen they would still believe in trinitarian baptisms and the trinity doctrine and they wouldn't believe in holiness and all of these things they were they were not fully believing the word so because he had to fully redeem his bride he had to stay there in the role of intercession to cover for the sins of ignorance but if he never comes to claim his possession is redemption finished it's part of redemption and now through seven church ages he's there interceding amen mediating for the sins of ignorance amen so that his bride even though even though she is disbelieving portions of the word she is still redeemed because he's covering for her sins of ignorance and the portion he's revealed she's receiving that portion and grabbing hold of it and believing what's unlocked and disbelieving the part that's still locked because he's covering for the sins of ignorance but at this end of the seven church ages he's going to fully restore the word so that now you have to believe what's unlocked just like in every other age you had to believe what was unlocked and when you believed what was unlocked it was counted unto you for righteousness and you were part of redemption and he was covering for you but now he's come to the time when there's no longer partial but he's going to fully unlock and so when he fully unlocks he no longer needs to cover for ignorance now when you receive the fully unlocked part you received him and you're in redemption and now when he comes to fully reveal the word he comes to claim what he has redeemed because he's grabbing a bride to sit on the throne with him that's why amen the kingdom couldn't set in when christ died and when he resurrected you know i mean how hard would it be for him to come in the resurrection and show everybody the proof and evidence of his resurrection and stand before them how hard would it have been for him to take the throne of david right then they watched a man get crucified they watched him die they knew and if he could resurrect and prove to him that he's the one that died he could take the throne right then amen they tried to put him on the throne before his resurrection and after the evidence of resurrection but that's why after the resurrection he only showed himself to the disciples not to anybody else because they wouldn't want to take him and put him on the throne but he couldn't take the throne yet amen there was still half of him that hadn't been manifest yet and he had to wait to the female part to be manifest to be united back together amen so he could take the throne with the other part of himself which was his bride his wife and so for 2 000 years he's laying there covering for her covering for her covering for her covering for her until he can come and claim her because before he sets up that throne amen during the millennium he's got to have her with him and then they return back to set up the kingdom so now we understand by the message why these things have had to be the way they are that's why so many people they want to say all you need is this aspect of the gospel and if you get this aspect of the gospel that jesus died jesus died for your sin then everything's fine but what about the resurrection paul said it was needful too and without this this doesn't do you any good is that what paul said we're not making things up this is what paul said if he didn't raise again then you're still in your sins and your faith is in vain so you say all we need is calvary but no you need calvary and you need the resurrection according to the apostle paul who is the man that says i i i know nothing among you but jesus christ and him crucified paul's not saying the only thing i preach is jesus christ crucified that's the subject he's preaching as christ and that christ was crucified he's preaching christ that's what he's preaching because he's the one who preaches resurrection he's the one who preaches restoration he preaches all these other things is that right so when we stop the gospel here then we among all men are most miserable because he's come down to pay the price of redemption so that he can do the work of redemption so that he can claim what he redeemed it's the full picture friends and he's got to do it all and if we leave any of it out guess what all creations lost praise god let's go to revelation chapter 10. revelation chapter 10 verse 1 and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the sun and his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the earth i just want to stop there for a moment you know that the title of the sermon tonight is the unexpected fulfillment so when you read revelations 10 just as a human being in a carnal mind without knowing the revelation of the word when you read revelation 10 verses 1 and 2 what would you be looking for what would you need to see in order to say this scripture has been fulfilled the carnal mind amen they're still looking for an enormous jesus christ to come down and so big that he can stand on the sea and on the land at the same time and that there'll be a literal cry that thunders out and everybody hears and they're looking for a literal fulfillment when it's spiritually fulfilled there's an unexpected fulfillment to revelation chapter two there's an unexpected fulfillment to revelation chapter five and an unexpected fulfillment to revelation chapter 10 it's not the way the carnal mind thinks it's going to be they're looking for an image amen a giant one feet like brass in a rope rainbow over his head amen they're looking for the battle of armageddon they believe that there will be a jesus sitting on a horse with a sword coming out of his mouth and he's he's running through the tanks and through the the army and the guys with m16s and all that and with a literal sword sticking out of a literal mouth he's cutting their heads off is that what we believe we need to send it as a mighty angel put one foot upon the land upon the sea what did we see how did we see it with what eyes did we see it see it's fulfilled in such an unexpected way not the way the carnal mind could ever put it together not the way the carnal mind could ever interpret these words you could read the words with literacy you could have intelligence enough to know the definition of each word but you have no idea how this is going to be fulfilled until god brings the fulfillment and he witnesses in your heart that that's the truth and then you say i see it with what eyes did you see it do you believe the mighty angels descended with one foot on land and one foot on sea do you do you believe he's cried as when a lion roareth amen when did you hear it with these ears and when did you see it with these eyes i mean how can you testify that it's happened with what witness can you witness that the only way is where the inward voice the the still small voice down with on the inside that says that's the truth amen he says going on to verse three and he cried with the loud voices when the lion roared and when he had cried seven thunders uttered their voices and when the seven thunders uttered their voices i was about to write and i heard a voice from heaven saying unto me seal up those things which is seven thunders uttered and write them not so now there's still an unexpected fulfillment of this now the carnal mind that's expecting him to come down as a giant image and stand with his legs spread way out to the sea and way out to the land in a giant image amen they expect him to roars when the lion wore and seven liberal thunders to thunder out and not realizing those seven thunders are sounding on earth one night monday night tuesday night wednesday night thursday night friday night saturday night sunday what was it it was the it was the sounding of the seven thunders why did the seven thunder sound because he come down any and he shouted with the loud voices when a lion roars and then seven thunder sounded right in a row what were we expecting when i was a little boy i can tell you what i was expecting because i i used to love the book of revelation it was a book i was attracted to as a small child i began reading the book of revelation when i was just a boy and i read it all the way through multiple times before i was a uh very much older and and i i had no idea what i was looking for i mean i didn't know idea what this would i was expecting the same thing everybody else expected a literal fulfillment of these scriptures that we live in the day that these scriptures are past they're in the past friends and what did we see we saw a little man from kentucky with a seventh grade education and then come to the pulpit monday night and say something happened in that little room i had it all wrong i was going back to old notes and i thought maybe this and i i was reading amen you know different books of different wines and then he came and he revealed it to me amen and turned me completely around and then i traced it down through the scriptures and now he starts bringing it he starts bringing the interpretation of what a white horse is amen and what a crown was given to him and what it means to have a bow with no arrows and what he's going to do and he goes right down through the scriptures and what's happening on monday night march 18th or whatever day it was amen the thunder was sounding right then it was an unexpected fulfillment but it was still a scriptural fulfillment and the seven thunders uttered their voices told them to write it not verse 5 and the angel which i saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and the things that there and are in the earth and the things that therein are and the sea and the things which are therein and that there should be time no longer well when that voice sounds that's it time no longer it's done right we can all read the words i believe it's properly translated who believes it's properly translated but what did it mean time no more amen brother branham said that this is the opening of the seventh seal and seventh seal is the end time seal the end of all things amen time no more amen brother bram says it's marking the end of the end starting the beginning of the end time cycle starting the end of this then the end of that then the end of this and he explains it like a roman candle going on first it shoots out one star then out of that comes five and he's saying what is it the end of denominational systems that was the first thing to end right there at the sounding of those seven thunders the end of denominational systems the end of denominational ages then the end of this and the end of world gentile power is the end of a gentile domination the end of this and the end of this and the end of this and the end of this because why because the mighty angel had come amen he had descended amen with an open book in his hand he had roared as a king amen the king coming looking for his queen seven thunders uttered their voice and he said let there be time no more and it started the ending of everything that's the truth but that's not what we expected with the denominational reading of the word i say god help us not to ever have another denominational reading of your word there are still things i don't understand and there's still denominational ideas in my head and i want god to get every one of them out of me by the revelation of the true word the ability to read and understand language is not enough to know this bible it is not enough that's been the failure all the way through and it's still the failure today if we're relying on the ability to read if we're relying on our intellect to understand what the words actually mean and putting the meaning of words together and getting a literal interpretation of the word we will fail like everybody else has always failed amen that's not the way to understand the bible the bible is given by divine revelation upon the word amen [Music] praise be to god let's keep reading verse 7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets brother branham again in the breach he says and when the seals are broken the mystery is revealed down comes the angel the messenger christ setting his foot upon the land and upon the sea with a rainbow over his head now remember this seventh angel is on earth at the time of this coming [Music] listen it's either true or it's not true we can't stand in between it's either the truth or it's not the truth the prophet even knew what he was talking about or he didn't know what he was talking about he declared to us the time of the fulfillment of these scriptures he was manifesting there the actual fulfillment of the scriptures was being manifested and declared before everyone's eyes but you can only see it with a different set of eyes you can only hear it with a different set of ears and so we have to make sure that we're looking for the unexpected fulfillment not the expected fulfillment if everybody knows how it's going to happen i'd look for another idea we start talking about future events i mean we love to talk about that i talk about that with brothers we love we love to bounce it around and talk about it but when most everybody else has the idea of how it's going to happen i'm thinking no that's not it i don't trust my own ideas i don't trust anybody else's ideas god interprets his word by bringing it to pass when he brings it to pass there's something down inside the elect that says that's it praise be to god now in the feast of trumpets i want to start talking on this and a direction here he said in the feast of trumpets he said how will the messiah the people that's believing him know it unless they're constantly in the word to know what he is daniel said the wise shall know him but the foolish the unwise wouldn't know they shall know their god now how he shall appear in the last days is to bring the people back to the word so that the bride will know her husband know her mate the revealed word that's why this has to happen so this is why he says he shall appear in the last days has he appeared he shall appear in the last days is to bring the people back to the word so that the bride will know her husband her mate the revealed word now listen when you talk about a mate a mate is a matching part your mate is a matching part when you find you know when you find you have a sock and the sock is lost in the wash you're looking for the mate to this sock so if it's a blue sock amen the gray sock is not a mate all right if it's a blue sock the blue sock of another brand is not a mate this is why when you first start teaching your children especially if you have sons to fold the laundry you sleep seeing a lot of non-mates mated together because they don't care there's two socks pulling them over throw them away and you get them out and one goes halfway up your calf and the other one's down around your ankle you're like what's wrong with my socks it's not a mate a mate is a matching part he's appeared in these last days is to re bring him back to the word so that the the bride will know her mate her matching part the word coming to the word the eagle to the eagle that she will recognize her matching part she's got to be brought back to the word so she will recognize her matching part her husband her mate which is the revealed word so if the revealed word is her mate then she must also be if the blue soccers are made then the blue sock must be your mate if the revealed word is her mate then she must be the revealed word [Applause] oh i like it simple friends i like it simple let's look at second corinthians chapter 11. ii corinthians 11 and 2 for i am jealous over you with godly jealousy for i have espoused you to one husband that i may present you as a chaste virgin to christ but i fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled eve through septility to your mind should your mind should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in christ so the apostle paul now is is he's got a duty and his duty is to espouse a virgin bride to christ and and he's worried about her staying pure he's concerned he's jealous over her with godly jealousy because he is a spouse to one husband that he might present her a chaste virgin he's nervous that she won't keep her chastity he wants to make sure he presents her a chase of urgent that she won't be beguiled like evil's begotten so this is paul this is this is what paul is anxious over in the first age that he is espoused a bride to christ and he wants to present her a chaste virgin so he's trying to get her to stay with the original word and there was other voices already creeping in in that day and he's trying to get them to quit listening to those voices and come back to stay with the original word that they originally received because he wants to present her a chaste virgin he doesn't want her to be beguiled by leaving the word the same way eve was begotten by leaving the word so paul was here to espouse a bride and to keep her chased by keeping her with the original word but we know that that that church eventually failed by the word and so set up the cycle of the seven church ages brother brown says in marriage and divorce he said and the bride will be a lovely little lady of the word paul was wanting paul was wanting to present to christ a chaste virgin what would take her chastity by leaving the original word so now christ god is going to present the bride will be a lovely little lady of the word because she'll be brought back to the original word amen shall be purified by the washing of water of the original word to bring her back to an original word position to original word state by the washing of the water of the original word the pure word to bring her back into a virgin condition and the bride will be a lovely little lady of the word unadulterated and not touched by any man's organization any man-made theory she'll be purely unadulterated bride of the word amen amen i hope you get that out on the air she will be the pregnant daughter of god let's go to galatians chapter 4. verse 19. we're listening to the apostle paul again in galatians 4 19 or yeah 419 he says my little children of whom i travail in birth again until christ be formed in you so paul is travailing again and he's trying what's he trying to produce he's trying to produce a man a chaste virgin for christ but he's also wanting christ amen to be formed in them who i travail in birth again until christ be formed in you he was trying to present a chaste version of christ to bury the two amen so christ can be formed in them and we're going to find out this is the exact thing that brother branham brings us right back to amen brings us back to the original word to wash us from all the prostitute spirits amen to bring us back to the by the original word by the washing of the pure word to a pure condition to be presented to christ amen so that christ can be formed in us to this end time church because that was the goal for the first church but she fell so there's a restoration back to the first so that they can do what the first church failed to do in the pergamon church age out of the church age book he says from a little group of the true seed of the word god will present christ with a beloved bride now this isn't brother brennam speaking this is the part of pick up your pen and write when the angel told him to pick up his pen and he picked it up and he just began to write when he was done he went back and read and this this is a part that's it's italicized in the church age book so from a little group of the true seed of the word god will present christ with a beloved bride she is a virgin of his word she is virgin because she knows no man made creeds or dogmas by and through the members of the bride will be fulfilled all that was promised of god to be made manifest in the virgin the word of promise came to the virgin mary so now he's running a parallel tract between mary and this end time bride the word of promise came to the virgin mary but that word of promise was he himself to be made manifest so what's going to happen in this day when he presents christ with a virgin bride amen amen she is going to be impregnated amen she is going to be what came to mary it was he himself to be manifest how was it manifest it was manifest in mary amen the word came to mary it was in mary how much of the word was in mary all the word was in mary all of that promise for that day was in mary and it began to grow and it began to come and finally it came forth from mary and when it came forth from mary it was immanuel it was the sun that was with us the sun that was born the fulfillment of the word through mary and god and god is running a parallel tract here he said the word of promise came to the virgin mary but that word of promise was he himself to be made manifest so the word that has come to us in this day what is it i mean is it doctrines is it understanding is it is it more teachings no it's he himself to be made manifest that's what's come to us in this day is he himself has come to us to be made manifest god was made manifest he himself acted at that time and fulfilled his own word of promise in the virgin it was an angel that had brought her the message but the angel's message was the word of god isaiah 9 6. he fulfilled at that time all that was written of him because she accepted his word to her the members of the virgin bride will love him and they will have his potentials for he is their head and all the power belongs to him they are subject to him as the members of our bodies are subject to our heads notice the harmony of the father and the son jesus never did anything until it was first showed him by the father john 5 19. this harmony is now to exist between the groom and his bride he shows her his word of life she receives it she never doubts it therefore nothing can harm her not even death for if the seed be planted the water will raise it up again here is the secret of this the word is in the bride as it was in mary where's the word at where is the word it's in the bride what's what is the word he himself to be made manifest where is it it's in the bride that's why she will be the pregnant daughter of god because she's pregnanted with the word she's carrying the life of the word within her the bride has the mind of christ for she knows what he wants done with the word she performs the command of the word in his name for she has thus saith the lord then the word is quickened by the spirit and it comes to pass like a seed that is planted and watered it comes to full harvest serving its purpose those in the bride do only his will no one can make them do otherwise they have thus saith the lord or they keep still they know that it has to be god in them doing the works fulfilling his own word he did not complete all his work while in his earthly ministry so now he works in and through the bride i want you to catch that part above all else he did not complete all his work in his earthly ministry what he didn't get it all done he didn't get it he didn't complete his work all of his work in his earthly ministry and so now he works in and through the bride who's working where he's working through her where is he at in her she has the word just like mary had the word where's the word the words in her where is he working in her he didn't finish his work now he's working in her who's working he's working where is he working in her where is he at in her where is he working in her where's the manifestation in her praise be to god so what are we looking for in the son of man ministry where is it amen when it says in the days that the son of man revealed in the coming of the son of man where is it we saw it revealed amen which is the ministry of jesus christ himself brother brennan said the son of man ministry is the ministry of jesus christ himself we saw that in that man in brother branham but but brother branham told us amen that it manifests so that it could unite the head and the body amen so they could come together to do what to reproduce the son of man again where is that revealing of the son of man today amen where is it it was the coming of the son of man so we've got the coming of the son of man so now where is the son of man because when we first saw the son of man it was in a form of jesus christ of nazareth now there's been the coming of the son of man and a revealing of the son of man so i want to see him if you want to see him don't look for the previous manifestation that that's an expectation there's a fulfillment of that prophecy but not the way you expected it did god fulfill is he fulfilling his word is luke 17 30 fulfilled and being fulfilled absolutely is the cutting of the son of man being fulfilled absolutely how how's it being fulfilled well you know it's fulfilled and brother branham so the son of man came and then went he's still here who's here the same one that was the mighty angel that came down where is he he's big enough to put his land his foot on land and seat so you can't hide him in your pocket where is he at he's in her [Music] he didn't complete all his work while in his early ministry so now he works in and through the bride she knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must now do but he will now fulfill through the bride that work which he left for this specific time oh praise god i want to move like lightning but i got to stop i got to go slow when jesus was here and it come time for his manifestation he comes to jordan when he comes to jordan then then john the baptist the forerunner is here and the forerunner is here is declaring the coming and when the forerunner is here he's pointing to the coming so that all can recognize that that what was prophesied is now here he saw the dove descend and rest upon him and he makes a declaration behold the lamb of god so the forerunner now points to what he was in for running and after he points to what he's four running then he knows shortly after that it's time for him to decrease so that this can increase we've seen a repeat of that and then then jesus goes off to enter his ministry but first thing he has to do is he has to be tested by the word so jesus goes why is he he's the last adam amen there's been many that's tried to be restore what adam lost amen there's many sons of god that have come down and done mighty works for the for god moses came down noah came down david came down amen but they failed they failed they failed because they were all hybrid born but now comes one comes from the hand of god amen through a virgin birth and now jesus christ is standing here the last adam amen and the original adam fell by the word amen so this adam now has to be tested by the word and he goes to the wilderness to be tested by the word and he doesn't fail by the word and all through his life he's destined and he doesn't fail by the word but if the bridegroom has to be tested by the word what does the bride have to go through so there's a testing time friends there's a period of testing will we stay with the word or will we do what the first eve did what we do with the first stage then the second age and the third or will this bride stand she's predestinated to this stand but in order to prove that she's predestinated to the stand she must go through the word test she must be tested by the word and so now he's finished the atom part and now he's doing the eve part because friends it's not you and i that's standing this test it's him and us it is him in us he's fulfilling the other parts let's go to colossians chapter one colossians chapter 1 verse 26 even the mystery which has been hid from ages and from generations but now has made manifest to his saints to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory where is he at he's in her where is he working from from her who's he working through he's going through her he's manifest him now he's manifesting her it's him and her doing the manifesting of she it's he who's manifesting she because you can't do it amen no human being can do it it takes him himself to do it that's why he's finishing his work now in her and christ is the mystery of god revealed brother man says look christ in you makes him the center of the life of the revelation christ's life in you makes him the center of the revelation christ in the bible makes the bible the complete revelation of christ christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing listen listen we're not making this up the prophet of god is saying this he says christ's life in you makes him the center of the revelation christ in the bible makes the bible the complete revelation of christ if you take christ the anointing out of the bible the bible's not the complete revelation of christ so there's a book sitting on the shelf and that book sitting on the shelf has the potential to be the revelation of christ but it's just ink blots on paper friends you take off the material bible and if you don't have christ the anointing in this bible then you don't have the complete revelation of christ christ in the bible makes the bible the complete revelation of christ you can't just take a bible and leave christ out of the bible and read it with no anointing of christ and have this be the complete revelation of christ it's only the complete revelation of christ when christ is in the bible amen that's why when brother branham saw the opening of those seals he says my bible became a new book to me because now the mystery of the entire bible is unlocked now christ in the entire bible makes the entire bible the revelation of christ i mean look at a prophet who's been reading his bible all of his life and a true prophet of god receiving true revelation on the word and tying together all the loose ends at the opening of the seven seals his bible became a new book to him because now it was the full revelation of christ in the bible made the bible the complete revelation of christ see why me intellectualism fails and fails and fails and fails and cannot work has to be by revelation i'm afraid too many times we try to make this we try to make this message intellectual like a really good bible study can make somebody a believer a really good bible study can convince somebody that you're right but cannot make them a believer how many people through bible studies and teaching were convinced that we were right amen get baptized come to the church believe the word and a few few years later months later weeks later however they take off and go living for the world and reject it and call it they chose they never came to the ceiling amen they never had a they never had the revelation of the word that this is christ so we've tried to intellectualize the message just preach the message and the believers will believe amen that doesn't mean we shouldn't be true to the word and it shouldn't do bible studies we shouldn't teach we do all of those things but none of those things will produce believers amen believers are produced by god amen so now christ in the bible makes the bible the complete revelation of christ christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing oh praise be to god see what god is trying to do god is not trying to get a better understanding of the bible god is trying to get christ in you to be the revelation of the whole thing what whole thing this whole thing christ in you makes you the revelation of the whole thing see what god is trying to do amen what is the new birth then well brother branham what is the new birth it is the revelation of jesus christ personally to you amen now you joined a church you shook a hand you done something different you said a creed you promised to live a code of rules but christ the bible he is the word that was revealed to you and no matter what anybody says what takes place it's christ pastor priest whatever it might be it's christ in you that is the revelation that the church was built upon praise god and things that are to be is now if we are those attributes of god we cannot live by creeds we cannot live by denominationalism we must live by the word because the bride is part of the bridegroom like any wife is part of her husband therefore we must be that word bride and what is that word bride the manifestation of this hour the bride not a creed or a denomination but a living oracle of god a living attribute of god displaying to the world the attributes of god in the formation of the bride that's to be expressed in this hour that we're now living he didn't finish his work he's doing it now what is the word right the manifestation of this hour the living or oracle of god expressing to the world the attributes of god now in the message it is the rising of the sun he says now this is just a short sentence so stay tuned catch it let's dial in turn up the hearing aids and dial it all in pay close attention focus how can the bride come and fail to manifest everything that was promised of him and the groom come and he wouldn't be the bride i'm going to say that again how can the bride come and fail to manifest everything was promised of him and the groom come did the groom come has the groom come and the groom come and he wouldn't be the bride has the groom come where is he he's the bride where is he hiding in her amen the word would come in the fulfillment where was it hiding in mary the word has come to fulfillment to this day where is it hiding in her how could the group come and he wouldn't be the bride he didn't say be in the bride be the bride let's turn to second kings chapter two second kings chapter 2 in verse 9. we're going to talk about elisha and elijah verse 9 and it came to pass when they were gone over that elijah said unto elisha ask what i shall do for thee before i be taken away from thee and elijah said i pray thee let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me and he said thou has asked a hard thing nevertheless if thou see me when i am taken from thee it shall be so unto thee but if not it shall not be so and it came to pass as they still went on and taught that behold there appeared a chariot of fire and horses of fire and parted them both asunder and elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven and elisha saw and he cried my father my father the chariot of israel and the horsemen thereof and he saw him no more and he took hold of his own clothes and he rent them in two pieces and he took off also the mantle of elijah that fell from him and he went back and stood by the bank of jordan and he took the mantle of elijah and felt that fell from him and he smote the waters and said where is the lord god of elijah and when he had also had smitten the waters they parted hither and thither and elisha went over and when the sons of the prophets which were to view at jericho saw him they said the spirit of elijah doth rest on elisha they they this is exactly the fulfillment of the prophecy amen fulfillment of what elijah told elisha elijah asked elisha what would you want he said i want a double portion of the spirit that's in you and he said you've asked a hard thing but if you see me go amen it'll come upon you amen so elisha was there when he went up in a whirlwind and when he went up in a whirlwind his mental he left he left laying there amen and elisha saw him go so now elisha has a double portion of the spirit and he goes forth and he takes the man on he smites the water and it splits and he walks across and all the prophets that are jericho all the preachers that at jericho they say that spirit of elijah now rests on elisha you got it that's it now look i'm going to go verse 4 15 again and when the sons of the prophets which were to view it jericho saw him they they said the spirit of elijah death rest on elisha and they came to meet him and bowed themselves to the ground before him and they said unto them behold now there be with thy servants fifty strong men let them go we pray thee and seek thy master lest per adventure the spirit of the lord had taken him up and cast him upon some mountain or unto some valley and he said he said you shall not send he said don't go and when they urged him to he was ashamed he said sinned they sent therefore fifty men and they sought three days but found him not and when they came again to him for he terry to jericho he said unto them did i not say unto you go not they comes forth now elijah is now gone he saw him go elisha knows elijah is gone elijah knows a lot elisha knows elijah's gone amen and he comes forth and now they see amen that the spirit of elijah rests upon elisha but they they don't understand what's taking place and they're still looking for a physical body they're looking for the physical body of elijah amen they don't think they can go on without it they need a physical something and they don't realize that elijah was standing right there with him and he was in elisha and they're looking for elijah that's why when they ask elisha if they can go elijah said don't go elisha knows where elijah's at amen he saw that physical body go but that spirit came back and elijah was there with elijah there was no reason to go looking for anything else and he proved it by being able to take that mantle that office of a prophet the smite the one depart him amen exposing the 12 stones doing the same thing that elijah had done before in revealing the word and they recognized hey you're doing just like the prophet did hey but we need something we need something physical this has to be christ this is the holy spirit but we're looking for a form don't look for a form don't go looking anywhere else we know where he's at they took 50 men they went looking for three days they come back he said did i tell you not to go see we're looking so many people are looking for something physical they want the physical this and the physical that they're looking for christ they're looking for the groom and they don't know where the groom is the groom's come and he's the bride elisha brother said elijah and elisha is christ and the bride elisha standing here with the same spirit that was in elijah is now here amen in full measure in his bride amen and somebody's going off wandering in the wilderness looking for the groom to come looking for his body looking for something physical and they don't realize the life that was there is here amen what was there in that manifestation is here in this manifestation it's a continuation but it wasn't what they expected and they they were looking for the wrong thing because they didn't realize that what they were looking for was standing in front of them we'll go hunt up elijah one of the spirit of the lord dropped him on a mountain we've got to go find him and elisha knows what's right here elisha knows he says don't go don't waste your time you're running all over the place for nothing he's right here oh so many people are looking for this looking for this looking for this something will come a great thing will happen he's right here the groom is here he's come he is the bride praise god and choosing of a bride brother branham says we find today the modern church of modern world church the world church and also the spiritual church are both pregnant to give birth to sons and one of them a denominational birth is going to give one day one day to these days one of these days at the world council of churches which will produce to the world the antichrist through a denomination that's exactly the truth i may not live to see it i believe i will but you young people remember that you heard a minister say that that's finally wind up and that's the mark of the beast when she forms the world council of churches and she gives birth to her son the antichrist the other is pregnanted by the word of god and will bring forth the body the finished body of jesus christ which is his bride praise be to god an invisible union brother brandon said do you remember when it went down the grain began to ripen then you find before that grain can ripen everything in that stalk has to be dead hallelujah can't you see where we're standing life is in the grain again what is it just exactly like the same grain that went in the ground the same jesus in bride form what are we looking for amen if you go go looking for that amen that that mighty angel that came down he had to come down when the seventh when the seventh church age messenger when the seventh angel was here on earth so go looking for him don't go looking for him he's here don't go hunting don't go for seeing don't put off in the future he's here in bride form let's go to revelation chapter 10. i'm just going to finish with this revelation chapter 10. revelation 10 and 8 and the voice which i heard from heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth and i went into the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and i took the little book out of the angel's hand and i ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as i had eaten it in my belly it was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings i'd like to say it this way in revelation 10 8-11 the journey of the book has ended the final destination of that book was in her the book that adam had that adam lost went to the hand of the original creator been holding it there for six thousand years amen waiting for a kinsmen redeemer the kinsmen come he paid the price of redemption he resurrected to prove the restoration of life amen come down through seven church ages and at the end of it all mighty angel comes down with an open book in his hand and there's a voice from heaven telling john which is a type of the bride go and take that book that you couldn't look at that no man could look at read that look upon it touch it there was new we were absolutely this book was off limits to mankind but when the kinsmen redeemer stepped forth and the mighty angel brought that little book down and tore them seals off and threw it down to a seventh church eight messenger who revealed it to his people they were there gobbling up the book what book went from adam to god from god to the lamb from the lamb to the seventh angel into you and i friends and it's the final destination of the book amen god had a plan for that book and that book was the revelation of jesus christ and it's made manifest in this day and where is that little book where can i get that little book amen each one of us had had to take our place and go to the mighty angel that we recognize as here now with the open book and take the book and eat it up and now we've become the book this is the mystery of god revealed in this day what is being revealed that christ is going to have a bride and that bride and him are going to be united as one and they're very soon to be restored to the throne of david where are you you're here revealing the bride part of that book the book is journeyed and journeyed and journeyed but now there's a resting place for that book in the end time bride and she's here to prophesy again what's she going to prophesy she's going to prophesy that book that's the book of redemption that's the plan of redemption from before the foundation of the world and she's here prophesying again the revelations of that book what are we looking for friends what's what do we do what am i watching for it's all around us friends it's going on all around us how could the groom come and not be the bride he's united with her and won what was john doing within that book he was becoming one with the book amen he was receiving the revelation of christ and becoming one with christ now if you want to know the words in the book it's being revealed and it's being manifested through those who have eaten the book those who have eaten the book are revealing the contents of the book it's standing before our eyes it's daily walking through the markets daily walking around coming to church driving down the road what is it the content of that book as being the revelation contained in that book is being made manifest in a many member bride which is the body of jesus christ that's being completed today because adam's body wasn't complete till his wife come forth and we were united back together then adam was complete christ wasn't complete till his bride's come out and been united back together then the body of christ is complete because these two are one the two are one i had to say the book is finding its resting place now god didn't want that book god wanted man to have that book and i say today god wants you to have that book that from adam to god from god to the lamb from the lamb through the seventh angel messenger to me is that too much to believe is that impossible is that not a living reality it may be too much for some to believe but i believe it i've eaten it it was sweet in my mouth bitter in my belly i'm prophesying of it again tonight amen this is a living living oracle of god testifying of a living book she is him what are we looking for let's not run around like those looking for elijah but let's recognize what's standing right here i want to read one more scripture as we close musicians you can go ahead and make your way up if you don't mind first corinthians chapter 15. first corinthians chapter 15 verse 9 for i am least of the apostles that i am not meat to be called an apostle because i persecuted the church of god but by the grace of god i am what i am you know what i'm not worthy to be a bride i'm not worthy to be the manifestation of christ on earth i'm not worthy of that are you worthy of that if you raise your hand come see me after church but by the grace of god i am what i am i cannot deny what i am i cannot deny what's been revealed i cannot deny what my heart resonates as this is nothing but the truth i cannot deny it but by the grace of god i am what i am not merit not worthiness not ability we've got none of those things friend we're the least likely amongst them all as least likely as an ignorant fisherman was the day god chose him amen but i was already in that book before i was the ignorant one before i was the the backwash of society i was already in that book and i believe it that by the grace of god i am what i am let's all stand when god first will say wrote that book because it's not paper we've got i think sufficiently god has showed to us that we have to stop thinking carnal earthy thoughts it wasn't paper friends amen it was the mystery of god it wasn't paper it was the record of christ amen it was the revelation of jesus christ it was what was in the back part of god's mind from before the foundation world it wasn't paper friends but when god first had the fondness nine he knew what the destination of that book would be he knew that you would be here and that book would be in you amen and so we've been ordained to this hour we've been equipped for this hour we've been called to this hour amen there's nothing to be nervous about there's nothing to be afraid about all we have to do is keep feeding on the word and letting him manifest himself it's him manifesting himself as her it's not you being her it's him being her we've got to get our thinking right amen all we're doing is surrendering to the life that's come to us and the life of the word that's in us when we were surrendered to that it's him displaying her through you it's not you displaying her you can't do it you'll mess it up again it has to be him playing both parts amen of the drama he was here as the bridegroom now he's here as the bride because why could the groom come and not be the bride he can't come and be the groom again he's already been the groom now it's act 2. and how could the groom come and be the groom again he's done it but now he comes and he is he's the bride and then the next time it'll be bride and groom to restore the kingdom act three oh praise god i thank god for this word friends the book is finding its destination let's pray lord jesus we thank you for your goodness lord for your mercy that you've extended to us for without you lord we can do nothing but with you all things are possible lord in ourselves we can be nothing but failures but with you we can be the bride we can be the manifestation of you upon earth if you live through us without you all we could be was a hypocrite an empty sepulchre something that's whitewashed and pretending that's not what will get it done in this hour lord but with you we can be the manifestation of this hour god i pray that you would take these humble vessels that you've ordained before the foundation of the world and that you will do in them and through them things that we've never thought of lord to manifest yourself in this hour may the content of the book be on display in our lives lord show yourself show yourself to this generation and show yourself through these vessels lord god we trust in you to do the work that you've promised to do in this day you're looking for preeminence so that you can do it lord we're asking that you would take preeminence in us we're giving you preeminence so you can do what you've ordained to be done in this hour through these vessels that the supernatural might be manifest through the natural that the real reality lord may come through this reality and it may be on display for always surrender to you and ask that you would do this work in jesus christ's name take us from here as we walk in this life may you walk in us and live in us manifest through us because there's only way that it's possible as if it's you
