========================================

he puts a song of praise in this part of my god is good all the through the darkest night his light will shine god is good god is good all the time amen has he been good to you all things are possible oh [Music] god bless you all good evening as we it's wednesday service we thank each and everyone for coming tonight and i wish i was sitting there but brother chad since he has a wedding coming up so i said thank but not thanks so all right so we're going to be musicians thank you we want to have a little just a little thought and little bible study a few verses we're going to read together and see how the lord would lead us into that and let's just go to the book of genesis the book of genesis chapter 3 verse 22 324 so excuse me my eyes sometimes are bad with you know i'm using here if it's flickers as we go read the word of god genesis chapter 3 verse 22 to 24 in heaven myself it says in the lord god said behold the man is become as one of us to know good and evil and now lest he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat and live forever therefore the lord god sent him forth from the garden of eden to till the ground from whence he was taken so he drove out the man and he placed at the east garden of eden cherubims and a flying sword which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life it's about our heads and about a prayer precious loving father we are here lord as your children and father we have gathered with one motive that you will speak to us and father although tonight you might be using this vessel of clay father we depend upon you myself lord waiting to hear from you along with my brothers and sisters as we have read these words lord our little mouth can read it and with a literal knowledge we have of the vocabulary and reading the phrases and sentences but it takes the holy spirit to bring the breath of life to us and father we ask that you will bless this gathering how long it will take lord a few minutes or we depend upon you we just ask that you will come and nourish it and feed us in jesus christ then we pray you may be seated i told you my laptop is dying on me so after we read the scriptures in the book of genesis chapter 3 22 3 24 it's the saddest place to read when you start reading the book of genesis i remember i don't know how most of you grew up but some of some of the children here the grown-up have been in the message for a long time i had a catholic background so as i was becoming a teenager growing up and having the opportunity to read the word of god to find the bible because in the catholic church you don't have the bible you have catechisms there is a book written with mind of man and brother friend god might need if you need some help and as i was getting to come to the knowledge of what what is god who is he what is he doing just opening up the book of genesis i started reading how god was the creator how he created he could speak there was nothing to begin with everything from the beginning was void empty our mind could not even grasp what void means because there's no eye to see anything there there's no understanding no mind there but the mind of god just god himself and this just starting reading that beautiful story on how he was opening up speaking light into existing and he was able to see the light and he saw that he was good and that that gave me just another a joy to keep reading the word of god from genesis and you go on to how he after creating speaking the lights he would create the firmaments he would divide the waters he would dry the land and as he was going through those steps he was naming giving the names to those luminaries and lights and the lesser light the the bigger lights and as he was naming them he was positioning them and as you go through the reading how god is just bursting and just creating and setting everything in place from from nothing in going in and then coming to creating man giving man an opportunity created him in the in the the the first chapter we saw that the prophet of god said that when he created man man was just man was it let's let's go to that uh genesis one yes uh pray for me my my laptop is is bothering me it's getting me nervous and then in genesis 1 26 god he goes and god said let us man in let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over the ever creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth in 27 he goes so god created man in his own image in the image of god created he male and female created he them in 28 in 28 god is giving them a commission god is giving them a commission he first he blesses them and god said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have the dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fall of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth and after reading as i was just coming to the reading of this beautiful book about god and how he started creating the universe creating the heaven the earth and the trees and the fruits and the the the birds and so reading that from genesis 1 and then we come into genesis 2 finding that after creating men in genesis 1 just in genesis 2 we're finding that there was no man to tilt the ground he said but he just created men in genesis 1. and the prophet of god said say that the man was created in genesis 1 was the spiritual spirit man he could not tell the ground he was a spirit man that could not die they could not they could not fall so he was commissioned to lead the earth to be a lesser god on earth and for that god had to put him into a body closer to the the kingdoms that he was overseeing and after reading that you were reading that okay man is now being formed by god he's being put on earth now god is waiting for men to as the bible says that he has he did not have his uh the help meet his wife and as the story was unfolding that okay god reformed now he took a rib out of man he is now bringing to adam and the saddest of the story starts in genesis chapter 3 1. i wish when i read that since i was a kid i said why would this happen just so soon the god i know that god is almighty god is full of love i just read the entire book of genesis just a chapter 1 and chapter 2. now the saddest of all stories starts in genesis 3 1. it bothered me as uh as i was growing up in my teens and growing up into even my 20s before coming to this message said why why would god how how could this happen so genesis if genesis 3 1 did not occur probably the remaining of the bible would not have would have been written differently or maybe the bible would have stopped in just genesis 1 and genesis 2. but as i was asking myself those questions i said how would could this almighty god this whole loving god leaves such something as this in the bible is this to happen to his creation and i said not only if you go into i cannot use my uh my my laptop anymore just keep praying for me yeah he praying for me it's uh so it's it's it's like you you have a book you are reading a book and then the book is telling you the good stories and when you come to the anticipation that the story is about to to start they don't tell you that hey find another book find the the volume too so it it it bothered me a lot and and not only that if we go so not only that let me use just my notes here so god who was almighty why didn't he stop the serpent i said why didn't he stop the serpent how could why didn't kevin prevent all those things because he was so mighty why he was so loving and then even sending them nicely out of the garden of eden he's not even doing that he sent them out and he's driving them out driving them out and even placing cherubims these are mighty angels trained angel to protect the tree of life so giving no room no way for men ever to come back to him as i'm still going here so fighting with my uh my my laptop laptop and not only only sending driving them out putting cherubims there he didn't only stop there he's even putting a flaming a flaming sword to keep from the way the tree of life from his only presence and if you go in the book of exodus you know that when god asked moses to to mimic from from the vision he gave him of the tabernacle where he wanted to come and dwell among them to to to commune with them so remember that he asked them he asked moses to have an ark and on top of the ark of the covenant he would he would put the mercy seat and then those cherubims would have those wings and covering the mercy seat which and then god said that when he would come he would be above the mercy seat meaning that those cherubims not only were keeping the way of the tree of life from the tree of life they were keeping men from the very presence of god and it i could not reconcile this almighty god in this loving god letting his children go through that way it was for four years it was a shock after he left the catholic church it was a shock i said how could this happen how would this god how would i know this and then the message come our way and when the message came away my way so the prophet of god says that just coming back to what i was referring earlier he said before this in the resurrection of lazarus 53 so i might back up some of the things since my laptop is kind of acting good now he said before he was this man he was a spirit man so the man of genesis 1 27 28 before this he was this man he was a spirit man god made the first man in his own image how many how many says that's right well what kind of image has god got he is a spirit is that right and we say right so he made a spirit man before he made a flesh man so that that makes me understood now okay from genesis 1 it's the spirit man in genesis 2 is the man that was in flesh then he put five senses to contact his earthly earthly home and we know that god now commissioned men in in genesis chapter two if you have that we can go along said little study here chapter 2 15. keep praying for me that's this laptop made me so nervous just the enemy but but we're here to hear from him amen and 15 said and the lord god took the man and put him into the garden of eden to dress it and to keep it so we hear that there is a commissioning there there's a commission there that god is giving to man the man he created now he couldn't find a man to take the ground he formed this man now he's commissioning man to keep to dress and to keep the garden 16 and the lord god commanded the men saying of every tree of the garden thou may may freely eat now in here the prophet of god it says that this is the beginning of the law he said this was the law and you will see what the law can produce the law can only produce death but as we proceed he said but one of the true seventeen one of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat or shall not eat of it for in the day that thou eateth thereof thou shall surely die and the lord god said it is not good that the man should be alone i will make him a help myth there was a promise there given to man and then in 19 and out of the ground the lord god formed every beast of the field and every fowl of the air and brought them on to adam to see what he would call them and whatsoever adam called every living creature that was the name of so we see here the harmony between the lesser god and the great god the great god is asking adam to name the animals and adam is doing exactly the way the greater god gave him but if you read the 20 20 said and adam gave names to all cattle's cattle into the fall of the air into every beast of of the field but adam for adam that was not found and helped meet for him seems like there was an ask from god in all in an open test test to see because god wanted to see how he would name them but in the in the same time there was a an unveiled or covered a a veiled or covered test if from those cattle beasts adam would find a helmet because in twenty he's read it again and adam gave names to all cattle into the fowl of the air and to every beast of the field but for adam there was not found and helped me for him did he mean that adam was to search first and see if we would find something someone similar to him something hid there so there was a test but adam passed the test because adam as we heard last sunday did not rely on his five senses if he would have relied on his five senses there were a couple among those animals very very close to him very very close to him and the prophet god goes and tells us that just remember just remember the bible said the prophet declared that this is about the serpent seed he said now let's watch this a minute he's he's describing the serpent he's smart crafty yet he is called the serpent but remember he was the smartest thing there was and the more like the human being than anything else that was on the field closest to a human being he was not a reptile the curse made him a reptile and he was the bible said he was the most beautiful of all now the prophet is talking about the male now mr serpent he's calling him mr serpent so mr serpent was the most beautiful how about the mrs sir miss serpent she was there too because when adam was naming them let's just just put that those animals could be all over the place in the garden of eden maybe one would have been in crydosville maybe miss serpent and quite as well miss the serpent maybe bill fountain now as adam was calling them was bringing them together he would say you your speech is there you are of that specie you or miss serpent you are missing putting them together it seems like he it seems like he was marrying them because himself he couldn't find a health meet in whatever pertains is applied to mr serpent is also applied to miss serpent she must have been beautiful crafty and even the curse didn't take all his beauty away yet the glorious colors of the snake is beautiful and his grace and his sureness now this is not the grace of god the prophet of god is saying and his grace the serpent's grace and his sureness even the curse did not move it off but you remember god told him that his legs would come off and he'd he would go on his belly and you can't find one bone in a snake that looks like a human being and that's the reason science lost it but there it is but before we continue that the grace means commonly it refers to a smooth and pleasing way of moving this is what the word grace means because we know it is unfavorable unmerited favor that's the religious reminder the religious way of what grace mean but grace you that the prophet is referring to is the smoothness and the pleasing way of moving or a polite and thoughtful way of behaving the serpent was a very polite very smooth pleasing now if this is a this applies to mr serpent he must have applied applied also to mrs serpent insuredness as you know what english is your language means the quality of having or showing good powers of judgment now this beast was the closest to man they could have a good power of judgment so meaning the test of adam was not just an easy test of naming animals even to see if mrs serpent could could could convince him but he didn't rely on this five senses that's what when the supersense kicked in he knew that this is not of my race and the prophet of god says that god hid it from the eyes of the boys and prudents and promised to reveal it to the sons of god in the last days so if this is revealed to us we're living in the last days when the sons of god would be made manifest when god's a son that rejoiced with him before the foundation of the world when the great revelation of the godhead and things would be brought down in the last days this is the day we're living in the greatest day that when god's sons are rejoiced with him before the foundation of the world when this great revelation of godhead or all things would be brought down in this last day he said he would manifest these things to the sons of god that's the reason he's manifesting it to us he said that's the reason that god is opening these things to us god is bringing his sons into manifestation then reading the first the first part of the the of the book of genesis seeing how from the great creation the majestic and creations of god and how he was speaking creating and then men come into existence and seeing that the enemy came and marred this couple in the garden of eden i thought it was the end of it i said why would god let let this just happen and stop all the anticipations but let's read in the book of genesis chapter 12 just a little bible study tonight and god will speak to us genesis 12 just two verses there and then we'll go to 15 12 1-2 now the lord had said unto abram get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and from thy father's house unto a land that i will show thee and i will make thee a great nation and i will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing and even the little uh thought a title of our thought tonight is um thou art a blessing and i am that shield let's go to genesis 15 1 through 7 or 8. and this will make more sense as we read it we know that after reading chapter 1 chapter 2 of genesis all anticipations were up reading chapter 3 verse 1 the saddest story ever started there and then god is bringing coming back now in genesis 12 giving a promise to abraham calling him in 5 15 after these things the word of the lord came unto abraham in a vision saying fear not abraham i am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward and abram said lord god what will thou give me seeing i go childish childless childless and the steward of my house is this eliezer of damascus and abraham said abram said behold to me thou has given no seed and lo one born in my house is mine heir and behold the word of the lord came unto him saying this shall not be thine air but he shall he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine air and he brought him forth abroad and said look now towards heaven and tell the tell the stars if thou be able to number them i'm pretty sure he saw the stars sitting here in lima today and he said unto him so shall thy seed be and he believed let's let's not read that over again and he believed in the lord and he counted to him for righteousness and he said unto him i am the lord that brought thee out of error of the chaldees to give thee this land to inherit it so we see god shifting now after man has fallen man that was created to take care to lead the earth with his bride they fell was that the end of the story no we're going to be seeing how god is going to be rebuilding the same man to bring him back to eden again and the prophet of god said this this is in the identified a masterpiece the prophet of god said see the love of god because when i read chapter one in chapter two seeing the great things he was doing and then the enemy came to cut short his work i wandered and said almighty how his might could not have stopped this enemy how his love could not even for have forgiven or protected his children but god was so loving that he had a plan for me and you and the prophet of god is bringing this plane he said see the love of god after man had fallen and deliberately opened the door to the enemy and he had come in and marred him and set death in him still god was not willing to be defeated he came down and started all over again so god is again what seemed to have been fallen in the book of genesis one and two god is rebuilding he's determined and the prophet of god says he was going to make that man again that gave me hope said he put adam on in a covenant if when we read in chapter 2 you remember he put adam on a covenant do this and not this this and not that touch not handle not taste not but we find out when he started again he started with abraham and in abraham he started him on an unconditional covenant the first man adam was given a law to live by do not touch that touch not but the second man god is rebuilding he's starting him on an unconditional covenant not if you will i have already done it i've blessed you and you you and your seed and so forth after you it was an unconditional covenant that he started with abraham and the reason he starting with abraham giving him an unconditional covenant is because god found that man cannot keep a covenant you and i we cannot keep a covenant he takes god himself to keep his own covenant and when he called abraham just think about abraham like you and me maybe maybe a farmer a hunter when he called him what he expected and wanted from abram was for abraham only to believe and he gave him that opportunity that that that ability to believe him because he was not going to force him and by simply believing what he called him he called him for the rest was upon god he was determined as we believe his word the remaining of what he will do with this bride that's god's determination he will accomplish it without your input and my input in the same uh quotes we're going to have a couple of quotes here and there and in scriptures in the masterpiece now we find that the entire dilution world come along and destroy the whole thing because the covenants that was made was made conditionally if you will not do this or if you will do that god the great sculptor seemed that men could not keep a covenant he just can't do it there's just no way and then bro the prophet of god is sneaking in something and i'm leaving it this inside when i read it it's applying to probably some of us here but it's applying it to me first and he said on an interview a few months ago a few moments ago i was speaking to a person in the room that's present now said but brother branham i have so many things that i know that's wrong and a godly little woman i think the same about myself and i know some of us here think about themselves the same way that brother rehm i have so many things that i know that's wrong in a godly little woman i said but look sister you don't look at yourself it's just what you desire what your desire is and what you try to do and if you really love the lord you try to serve him with all your heart and all your mistakes is hid in the blood of the lord see he made a way and remember in the book of genesis 3 24 there was no way back they were driven out driven out the cherubims were there the flaming sword was there but we see that god is going to me making a way to go back to to to the garden of eden the prophet of god continues so he begin now taking men from his covenants of saying that if you will and he begin with the man called abraham and gave to abraham a covenant unconditionally every time he would start a massacre peace satan would get it but when he started with abraham he said i have already done it now this is unconditionally not that you will i will but i've already done it now this sculptor which is god himself is determined to have his masterpiece if god is determined to have his masterpiece who's going to stand against it now god is going to be showing to the devil to the enemy that the first one you marred it but this second one you were not married and the prophet of god is going to be telling us how he's going to be building rebuilding this mass of peace that was fallen he said he was going to be calling abraham starting with faith after abram he has isaac with love after love he has jacob with grace after grace he says joseph joseph is the perfection so he's going to be first rebuilding the foundation to put this masterpiece on and he said the masterpiece the bodywork the masterpiece had two portions if you remember the first portion was the foundation which had faith love grace and perfection all of them of god the faith of god not my faith not the faith of abraham the love of god the grace of god the perfection of god not your perfection and then the body work was to be by the prophets which are the word so this the re the man that god is rebuilding was to be the word himself as we know that the first couple was kept behind the word and when they just moved a bit satan found a way to to go back in to destroy them but this last this last masterpiece will be the word himself so the prophet of god says in abraham was the foundation of faith now watch every masterpiece is put on a foundation angelo's monument of moses is on a three or four foot piece of marble it's got a foundation so god in preparing this masterpiece he put it on a foundation of the patriarchs in the patriarchs foundation first we have abraham isaac jacob and joseph the four corners and now abram was the foundation of faith the foundation laid we have as he goes again and he said the work the body work to defeat this enemy was to be the eyes of the prophet meaning the body word the body work of this masterpiece of this man that he was rebuilding rebuilding the man of genesis 2 was to be on the foundation and built with the word himself in the book of ephesians churchill he said to him that overcometh and this is in revelation 7 let's read revelation 7 first revelation 2 7 sorry 2 7 he said he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will i give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of of the paradise of god meaning that the way to the tree of life that was blocked from men to go to return back to now that way is going to be open and given to the overcomers and the prophet of god said that what a thrilling thought this is that tree of life in the garden of eden which could not be approached unto because of the fall of adam is now given to overcomers the flaming sword of the guardian guarding cherubims has been sheathed but it was not sheathed here air its blade was bloody with the blood of the lamb let us meditate upon this truth a world as we consider why the tree was denied to adam and his descendants but now aloud again to you and me he goes again the foundation was laid by the patriarch but the body was built by the word which was the prophets and here comes the head of it jesus came on the scene there when this head piece was put on it we find in him the entire handiwork of god we find in him the perfect reflection of the word he was the word the fullness of the word now again god has the perfect masterpiece again as isaiah said behold my servant my masterpiece i have portrayed through all the ages of this perfect coming one so coming back to the man that was in the genesis 2 that man when he fell there was no way back probably all the generation thought that there was no way to go back to the tree of life no way to go back to the presence of god not knowing that god had a plan that he would it would he would take 4 000 years to rebuild that man and he started with the foundations as we mentioned here faith and goes into love into grace into perfection and then the word comes and then we saw that word that man standing on earth after four thousand years of the fall of adam and from that man because the man that was in in the garden of eden was also smitten when god put adam to sleep to take a rib out of him and to form his bride the bride that fell the prophet of god goes that now we could go on go on and on with that but i believe you have the picture of what i mean now god building back his masterpiece let us not forget that in the beginning when he smote the side of adam he took something from his side now the smiling of christ was for a cause was for a cause that he might take from him want to be a family the bride so as the first adam was smitten to take a bride out of him this second adam was to be smitten on calvary that you and i can come can come forth so when his masterpiece was perfected then he had to smite it to take from him not another peace not another creation but of the very same creation my brother don't think bad at this but think a minute if he took from him the original creation to make the bride for him he's never made another creation he took a part of the original creation then if he was the word what must the bride be so the bride must be the original word the living god in the word now there's some qualifications for the masterpiece adam within the spirit of genesis 1 28 27-28 he was both male and female that was the adam the spirit man that man was perfect but that that man could not be masterpiece so to be a masterpiece it takes the perfection living in the clay your clay in my clay that's what jesus had to come and be born in a body like you and me to be that masterpiece that obeyed all the word of god and remember that man that was created in the image of god in genesis was the spirit man who both was both male and female that could not fall because the spirit cannot die but he takes the spirit living in the body of the human body in the clay to qualify for the masterpiece so you are here to be the masterpiece that masterpiece of jesus of christ on earth because his word is living within you and me and in the same same same method i've been uh showing in and i had something that i would have brought here but things shuffled last last night his life matched all the peoples it pleased god to smite him and now why did he smite him for the same cause he had to smite adam now we seem stricken smitten of god and afflicted the perfect lamb of god for sinner slain a perfect masterpiece it has taken him four thousand years to make this masterpiece now he's been for nearly two thousand years making another peace a bride for christ and other peace and that's you and me and what is the method he's been using to make another and a masterpiece he uses first the foundation with four corners and we see that the first the masterpiece the the rebuilt man of genesis 2 when he came living in flesh jesus christ the second adam the foundation was prepared by the patriarchs and then the body work was his own word prophets upon prophets this second masterpiece that is smith that is pulled out after he was smitten on calvary it has also four corners has the four gospels and also through the churches the prophet the word it's built word upon word and he had to be the prophet of god said that this mass of peace was to be cut that's smiling he calls this the cut he said it's like a diamond cut that can only be the diamond can only be cut by another diamond he said she is smitten from the church now this is almost isaiah 53 when we go to isaiah 53 it says he is despised and rejected of man a man of sorrow and acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he has borne our griefs and he carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of god and afflicted now the prophet of god is taking this is on the the mayor on the second adam when the the bride was pulled out of him after he was smitten the prophet of god is applying the very same scripture that was that's applied to jesus christ is applying it to the bride saying that she is smitten from the church from the church body smitten with her master for the same purpose she is the word just the same as joseph who was joseph joseph was one of the foundation the perfection of the foundation smitten just the same as joseph was smitten for his uh from his brethren because he was the word and jesus who was the entire the the entire fullness of the word of god was smitten for his brethren because he was the word the bride is smitten from the church because he is the word there are your stages again one two three see just exactly the word living in action the bride the bible bride not some men made bride the bible bride smitten and afflicted of god no beauty we should desire her that's isaiah 53 so everything he was you are whatever he is this bride is she is him as the prophet says the prophet of god is applying isaiah 53 the same it was applied to jesus himself it's applied to his bride today no beauty we should desire her but yet we we did esteem her smitten and afflicted of god that's right she stands alone she's smitten from all the denominations according to to revelation 3 she's smitten out of the laodicean church age that's that she was raised up in she was raised up in in the laodicean churches but now she's smitten from her from there what was it the word of his mouth identifying his bible bride to her groom is him so wherever he was you were there you were wherever he is you are you are at the store any place you might be he is there with you because you are one with with christ with your mail she stands alone as the prophet says like the bridegroom rejected of man despise and reject of the churches the bride stands that way what is it it's his masterpiece see it's the word that cannot go through make the it's the word that he can work through to make manifest and in the again in the same message he said so i told you that it was just bible study tonight and quotes the word has become flesh exactly like he promised in luke 17 malachi 4 and all c that's right revelations all true life that was in the stark castle and husk is now gathering in the seed ready for the resurrection ready for the harvest the alpha has become omega the first became last and the last is the first the seed that went in has come through a process and become the seed again say the seed that fell in the garden of eden there was a seed that fell there when men died and died there come back again from that imperfect seed that died there that's the prophet saying it from that imperfect seed that died there come back the perfect seed the second adam and in one in corinthians 15 4 45 you don't have to turn it says and so it is written the first man adam was a living soul the last adam was made a quickening spirit so the first adam did not have the quickening spirit it was made a living soul that's how he could die because in revelation 16 3 says and the second angel poured out his vowel upon the the sea and he became as the blood as the blood of the dead man and every living soul died in the sea but the quickening the quickening spirit cannot die so god has to take from the foundation from the word to build the man that would be the quickening spirit in not only the living soul he says the first eve that fell and was using the second reformation the second coming as bringing forth a child and now now has become the true bride again the seed right back with original word again so when the prophet god says the first eve that fell was used in the second reformation that this reformation not reforming its forming for the second time forming one more time so the first eve that fell was used in the second coming in the second formation that's the one that's the reason the prophet of god will always say that the reason he said that his bride that that that he has come in the formation of his bride because he's coming in the second formation meaning the the first formation of of of eve of the the woman out of man was in the garden of eden the second formation is when he's bringing because the first man jesus the second adam came jesus is bringing the first the the bride in the formation the second coming of jesus is the formation of the bride the coming in the second formation of eve let me read it here the prophet of god said that it in the messy things that are to be to clarify this you at one time was in your father in the gene of your father now he didn't know you at that time neither did you know him at that time but you see then you were put in the bedding ground in the womb of mother through a holy wedlock and when you become a person expressing the image like your father then there's a fellowship now the only way you can be a son a daughter of god because you have to have eternal life and there's only one form of eternal life and that's god's life only one form of eternal life that's that was god there to be a son of god you had to be in him always the gene of your life spiritual life tonight was in god the father before there was even a molecule see and you are nothing but the manifestation of the gene of life that was in god as a son of god now you are expressed after his word has come into you to light up the age you are expressing god's life in you because you are a son or daughter of god therefore you get what i mean you are now made you are sitting in this church tonight because your duty is to express god to this nation to the to and this people in this neighborhood where you associate he was the fullness of god bodily therefore when he came to the earth and was manifested in flesh you were here in him because he was the word in the beginning the word was god the word was the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us the word was made flesh therefore you walked with him when you were in him when you he was on earth you suffered with him and you died with him he was buried with him and you are now risen with him and manifested attributes of god now if you if we are those attributes of god we cannot live by creed we cannot live by denominationalism we must live by the word because the bride is a part of the bridegroom like any wife is a part of her husband therefore we must be that word bride and what is that word right the manifestation manifestation of this hour the bride not a creed or a denomination but a living oracle a living attributes of god displaying to the world the attributes of god in the formation of the bride that's to be expressed in this hour that we're living in meaning that the second coming of christ it's within the formation of his bride on earth this formation is his second coming when we see the bride being formed with the same spirit with with the same word so you are now the sons of god in the redemption by power now we are sitting together in heavenly places not we will be in the millennium we are now right now with the sons of god right now we're sitting together in heavenly places in jesus christ not just in the church we are in christ the resurrected lord jesus is here he's here in his power he's here in his redemption power he's here for the exodus and here to bring every church member into fellowship with him so his word is being ministered his revelation has come to bring every church member to bring every church member into the fellowship with him he's here to bring every sinner no matter how how low you are he is to bring the power of the resurrection into your life and make you a new creature so we see that the first the first man fell but god has the plan the plan was to rebuild the same man to give him the opportunity to give him the way give him the way to the tree of life where he will never die and he sent his word he built that going through the foundation of faith his own faith of his love of his grace in his own perfection and then he gave his children the word the prophet of god says again the spoken word so still good on time the first son was spoken seed word of god he was given a bride i'm just reviewing the spirit now is picking it up picking up what i said see a bride to produce himself she felt see that's what the bride was given to produce himself again another son of god but she fell by high breeding see produced himself but she fell caused him to die the second son was the second son a spoken seed word of god was given a bride like adam but before he could marry her she had fallen also for she was put to a free moral agency like adam's wife was to believe god's word and live or doubt it and die and she did then from a little group of the true seed of the word god will present christ a beloved bride a virgin a version of his word and through them and by them will be fulfilled all that has been promised for his word in the virgin who knows no man-made creeds or dogma dogma the word of promising himself like it was in mary god himself made manifest he will act himself by his own word of promise so to fulfill all that has been written of him and he did when he came from the virgin womb type of the spirit womb now so will the virgin now accepting his word be it unto me as thou has said they will love this group the prophet of god says this group will love him they will love him they will love his word and will have his potentials for he is their head and they are his subject subject to his head headship of christ was his notice what harmony jesus never did anything until the father showed him first harmony between god and christ see john 5 19 so will the bride and he shows her his word of life he shows her and she received it she receives it she never doubts it nothing can harm her not even death for if the seed be planted the water will raise it up again and here is the secret here is the secret the word is in the bride and the mind of christ so once you receive that word it grows as you feed upon it you grow into his image and you grow into the mind of christ because remember elisha elash had faith and he followed the elijah he got even the double portion which was the the type of the word the double portion of the spirit of elijah but when he got tested by the children his word the word within him has not matured yet because he did not have the mind of christ if he had the mind of christ he would not have pronounced death on the children so this bride not only she has his word she is growing and maturing with the word of god to have the full mind of god within her because with the mind of god she will know what to do with the word and here is the secret the word is in his bride in the mind of christ to know what he wants done with the word and he does it in his name she has thus saith the lord they do only his will no one can persuade them different they have thus saith the lord or they keep still then they will do the works of god for it is himself in the continuing in them continuing continuing his word to fulfill as he did complete in his day just think of abraham when god called him as he he responded and believed that the promise that god gave him garu now was determined to fulfill to bring to start rebuilding that man that was lost in genesis 2. he was rebuilding that man so it was no longer abraham abraham works or accomplishment it was god who was determined who was setting the tone so the man that was to be rebuilt was hinging upon the life of abraham and today the god is rebuilding is building his bride that has has pulled from the body of christ and that work is hinging upon you by taking his word excuse me i uh let's let's stand i had broken up my computers and things changed but and the prophet of god said this is brother chad will be coming getting ready give for the broken up and musicians you might come as well in the message of perseverance if men and women could only think that tonight that the word of the lord is truth there's nothing else all eternity hinges on the word of god it hinges upon you you taking the word of god and believing it let's have a word of prayer precious heavenly father we thank you for these few broken up words lord lord i know that didn't come the way i anticipated with the computer crashing here and but i know that you you will give enough grace lord to each and every one father that [Music] was able to listen to these broken up words to find father what you meant to them tonight and father i do truly believe lord that you will mend it lord you take this broken upwards lord and just mend it the way that you you know how to do and we don't think thank you in all circumstances father and father we love you knowing that you have sent your son father to take us lord way to way back to eden his own blood sheathed the flaming sword that was turning in every direction for us lord we know that you are here feeding us lord day by day and you know lord that when we look at ourselves we might say we have too many things wrong with us even at this moment lord in with this broken up lord and message am i asking myself the same will say too many things but father your prophet said he doesn't look at you you won't look at me you will look at that desire within within your children within me to serve you and father we we love you we know that you you are god and you make it well you make it right and father if there was anything lord that was it not lord was not said under your inspiration that father you will plunge it in the blood of jesus christ and you know our intention and motives lord and we want to serve you all the days of our lives and we thank you for this opportunity for giving me grace before my brothers and sisters lord to to stand lauren to lord to hear from you and father we know now that that man that we thought for him there was no way back to eternal life you rebuilt him again father through the ages through the patriarchs through the prophets and we saw him father standing on earth lord two thousand years ago you smell smoked him on calvary and from there you for 2000 years you were forming that rib you took out of him which is this bride the bible bride the word bride that you are now rebuilding by the same method father we thank you we know that you are here lauren and we thank you that that story did not end up justin in chapter 3 lord is a sad story but we see the beauty of it father as we we can see through the ages that you were rebuilding that man the quickening spirit not only the soul but father the quickening spirit when we we thank you we we love your father we commit the servant in your hands let your name be glorified in jesus christ samuel amen amen thank you how many are glad he determined to have a masterpiece amen i appreciated the thought i appreciated my brother emmanuel sharing his burden in his heart it just struck me so much the unconditional covenant was because god determined it wasn't just because we were failures it wasn't just because we were failures but it was we were failures but god determined he was going to have a masterpiece he could have given it up on the fact that man's a failure he's never going to get it right we're finished we're doomed there's no way back to the tree of life but he determined he's going to have a masterpiece and because he determined who could resist his will amen who can resist his will you know that in romans it talks about how can the he that is created say to him to create it why thou made me thus and in that notion you take it as a negative notion you know why have you made me uh uh you know and the evil way not to believe but let's take it on the positive [Music] he's made me a believer he's put inside of me his predestinated sieging of eternal life i'm a believer and who am i to say why hast thou made me thus why even speak back just accept it and say god i believe it and i receive it in jesus name lord i'm as unworthy as anybody else is unworthy i mess up just as much as anybody and fail like anybody else but the desire of my heart is something you put there it's your determination not mine where did that desire in your heart come from his determination to have a masterpiece to have a bride not our willpower not not our determination but his determination and who can resist his will and who can say why has you made me thus might as well just say i accept it i accept what you've done and i believe it in jesus name let's sing brother ben [Music] myself show me myself [Music] and let live [Music] myself show me myself [Music] and let there's one quote that brother manuel read from that was so notable to me i know it i've heard it but i wanted to go back and study and read it again but it shows brother brenna's mentality about the word bride what he thinks about the word bride and how much she is him because in this quote brother branham is referring to revelation chapter three and in revelation chapter three it says behold i stand at the door and knock and brother ben over and over says see he's outside of his own church he's been cast out he's been kicked out of his own church but in this quote that our brother read tonight brother brother uh brother manuel read that brother branham says now look look she's in revelations chapter three she's kicked out of the church she's smitten out of the church who was spitting out of the church jesus christ the word who is the bride the word if the word was kicked out amen she's the word she's smitten outside of the church brother brother branham's mentality so ties the bride and groom together as one when he saw revelation 3 that jesus christ is on the outside knocking he realizes that the bride also in laodicea is smitten outside of the church amen i think our brother brother branham finally came to the revelation not finally but he came to the revelation in the end time the same revelation that god had when he made adam in his bride and he looked down and he said i'll call their name adam [Music] that the word has been so restored and so brought back under a prophetic ministry that what god saw in the beginning when he made adam and drew out his wife and united the two as one and called their name adam at the end time he's repeated the same cycle and come back so much so that in scriptures in isaiah 53 referring to jesus christ he refers him to the bride and and revelations chapter 3 referring to laodicean church a jesus christ on the outside he'll refer it to the bride let's not in our minds put ourselves in a place the prophet didn't see us and the word doesn't put us if isaiah 53 applies to him it applies to me if revelation 3 applies to him it applies to me because god has taken what was once two and he's put them back together and made them one and it's not for us to say why have you done this why me why this festival i mixed with me it's not up to me to say why have you made me thus it's up to me to say you did a good thing you did it of your own choosing you did it of your own determination i could never do it i could never get it right but because you determine i believe it and i accept it [Music] quit questioning why just receive what he's done what's your desire where is your heart what do you believe and why do you believe it because he determined that he was going to have a masterpiece and she was going to be him can we comprehend it not with these minds when we look in the mirror does it always make sense no but it's what he determined and i believe it and i receive it that's his plan it's his will and i say be it unto me according to thy word it says bow our heads and pray lord jesus we thank you for your word we thank you lord for our brother emmanuel and the thought you placed in him and the word you delivered through him god how how closely you see your bride to your bridegroom how effective your uniting work was your masterpiece the second building of the masterpiece that had fallen lord you've completed your work lord you're displaying it now [Music] help us to get so in tune with it lord that we don't question it anymore we just receive it lord we just receive it in your name we believe it lord like abraham believed when you promised him your seed shall be like the stars in heaven how could a man comprehend that amen looking up at stars amen and comprehend that his seed will be as the stars in heaven but he believed you and it was imputed unto him for righteousness and just as unbelievable as that was to a carnal mind now the carnal mind you're speaking a perfect word amen we may not be able to figure it out any more than abraham could figure out how his seed will be like the stars of heaven but god may my response be just like abraham's response may i just believe you and take you at your word if you said it in your word your prophet brought the revelation of it let me just receive it like abraham received the promise and may you do the same thing for me you did for abraham may you imputed unto my righteousness because i believe you lord god we thank you for giving us faith we thank you for being determined lord you were more determined than we were you were more determined than our willpower you were more determined than our strengths enabled us you were more determined lord you were so determined you made a way that would overcome every one of our failures so it wasn't based on us it was based on your word let your promise be manifest in us now lord let it live in us let it live through us lord let us be the fulfillment of that promise of that word we ask it lord as we go from here let us live that life by faith let us walk every day in that word let us not question anymore but accept it and move forward and allow you the preeminence that you deserve may your word live through us may your word rule every moment of our life we ask it lord in jesus christ's name as we part keep us lord use us for your glory in jesus christ's name we pray amen god bless your friends me more like thee [Music] jesus make [Music] that's filled with oh just make me more like thee [Music] jesus make [Music] me oh give me [Music] and make me more [Music] jesus make [Music] me give me [Music] there's never been a day like [Music] this day see there's never been a light that shines so bright lights [Music] there's never been a day [Applause] there's stay one more time oh there's never been a day [Music] there's never been [Music] there's [Music] this glorious blessing and honor glory and power riches and wisdom and strength glory and power riches and wisdom and strength [Music] [Music] sits at the right hand of god the right hand of god to the new let's sing it again glory and power riches and wisdom and strength [Music] glory and power riches and wisdom and strength [Music] who sits at the right hand of god [Music] [Music] of god [Music] of all the glory you alone are worthy of all the praise [Music] [Applause] [Music] honor we bless your name [Music] worthy of all the glory [Music] you alone are [Music] worthy [Music] your name [Music] you are worthy king of kings lord of lords you
