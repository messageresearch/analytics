oh well the sun is up now i can go free the chains that were holding me i can no longer see heard a long trumpet sound declaring my jubilee all that i once had again is restored to me because the truth is revealed he's opened the seals now and for always the sun is up we'll walk in the light such a beautiful light comes where the two drops shine all around us by day and by night it's jesus [Laughter] [Applause] [Music] proclaim jesus his name jesus [Applause] such a beautiful light it comes where the two drops shines all around us [Applause] one more time we'll walk in the light in such a beautiful life comes where the two drops of mercy are bright shines all around us by day and by night amen and i am jesus has changed my whole life if anybody asks you just who i am you can tell them i am everything one more time [Applause] [Applause] [Music] just who i am you hallelujah praise the lord i mean you can be seated for just a minute thank you musicians can go on and be dismissed but god bless you sister rebecca it's good to have you here now that you're engaged rebecca kadema she wasn't here for the announcement only her picture so god bless you it's good to have you here we're happy for you and so hopefully we get to see your fiance soon amen i just wanted to uh take a minute and we didn't have a chance to have a memorial service or anything for sister betty stoner the family did something very private by the graveside and so i just wanted to take a moment as a church just before we move on and just reflect on her life and thank god for the portion that we got to share with her i know there's there's several of you who didn't get the chance to know sister betty but i know there's many who did there's many who went to church with her for years knew her from way back uh sister betty's brother harry's been believers for a long long time and they've journeyed they meant through this life together and through the message together and with many of us and i myself didn't know sister betty really really well until like the last six or seven years and i got to know her better and better and really enjoyed sister betty sister betty was full of life and she told you what she thought and she meant it and i liked it and so i would go visit her from time to time and angie and i would go visit her and she always remembered the last time i visited how long it had been since my previous visit and sometimes it got a little too long and she was always nice but she always reminded me how long it had been we always had a good time with sister betty and brother harry and love them very much and we know it's hard for brother harry to be alone you know sister betty one time she was in the hospital she had gotten sick and she was in the hospital and i went to visit her and i remember i think it was sister marsha hollander told me that back in the tabernacle that she used to play the organ and she could really play the organ and so i told sister betty i said sister betty i heard you used to be a good organ player and sister betty she was laying in the bed she just looked up like this rolled her head up and she goes yeah i was pretty good said praise the lord just be honest you know but i just love that i love that about sister betty i remember when she had to go to the nursing home for a little while and uh while she was in the nursing home angie and i were asking is there any books you'd like do you like to read anything can we bring you anything she was oh i love to read and we said what would you like to read she was spoken word books the only book she wanted was spoken word books and i said praise the lord that's a believer amen that's a believer she wasn't looking to be entertained brother ben said the holy ghost is entertained by the word and so she wanted spoken word books so we appreciate her life the testimony she had her years of faithfulness you know for the last a little over four years she's been bed fast because of a broken hip that didn't heal exactly right and she wasn't able to bear any weight on it and so she would just get up for short stints in a chair and i'd go visit her and year after year for for four years she was always scheming trying to plan a way to get the church she always wanted to get to church she was i just lay here and think and she had lots of time to lay there and think and she thought maybe if they could slide me down on the board maybe if i could get in the chair and maybe she was always trying to figure out some way to get to church before she didn't give up she didn't throw in the towel she kept saying i'm going to get back to church i'm going to get back to church and she was always wanting to find a way to get back to church and i say god bless her sister betty god took her home but she she went home fighting she went home fighting for the word fighting to be in fellowship biting to me she didn't just give up it had been so easy to give up and say well there's just no way but she would lay there for hours trying to think of a way to get back to church i say praise god god let me be that kind of a believer all the way through where i never give up i never roll over i never just give in to my circumstances but i'm always striving to be in fellowship to be in the word to serve god man we want to just say we love brother harry and appreciate the sacrifice the last several years especially for his wife when she was bedfast couldn't do anything for herself harry did it all he was her primary caretaker and we just want to say we love you brother harry and appreciate your life and the sacrifice for your wife it's a real testimony for the rest of us it's a real testimony of love and endurance it's a real testimony of the love of christ and the love of his bride from one another we just want to say it's been a good thing we appreciate sister betty's life we're thankful that she's gone on to the sixth dimension we're thankful she doesn't lay in a bed anymore she's not in the body that's deteriorating year by year she is free from the bondage of skin and bone she's free from the bondage of hybrid flesh and she's now our sister's now running barefoot in that place brother branham went when he went beyond the curtain of time and someday sister betty will greet us all but the sad thing is i only knew her when she was elderly so she may have to introduce herself to me and say don't you know who i am i'm sister betty you knew me as sister betty stoner and i said oh god bless you sister betty amen let's just all stand i just want to pray and thank the lord for sister betty's life thank the lord for the ability to share in that life i also want to mention to you that i got word yesterday that brother ron peterson the pastor evening like tabernacle has come down sick with coven 19 he's tested positive for it and he went into the hospital he's hospitalized now with double pneumonia and then there's there's others in the church that are sick and others in the church his family and then the church that have tested positive i believe for covenant 19 at least that's the word i got and so we can pray because we know what that's like we in this assembly we know what it's like to have people in the assembly loved ones and people we cherish very sick with double pneumonia we've had cases in this church double pneumonia coven 19 in the hospital and there's several people here who know what he's going through and you've you've already walked a mile in those shoes and you know what our brother's going through and you know how to pray and us as an assembly we know how to pray for that assembly because we know what it's like we know the devil can try to bring fear and all the negative news and try to disrupt our faith but how we have to hold on to the word and watch the word pull us through and god did it for us and he can do it for our brothers and sisters there so i want to remember to pray for them as well let's just bow our heads dear lord jesus we thank you god for the privilege lord of knowing our sister betty for we believe that you deposited a portion of yourself and her before the foundation of the world and our love for her was more than just the flesh lord it was that life on the inside and while we know that that life continues on our sister betty is not dead she's alive she's only passed from one dimension to another she's only moved from this journey further in the journey lord that you've ordained for her and now she's at rest and we're thankful for them and god we were left behind lord let the positive effect of her life continue on the ways in which she cheered us up and influenced us and encouraged us let those things continue and god we just want to band together in his assembly and hold up our brother harry before you lord no doubt he's lonely lord he lost a life companion and lord he cared for her so well and i just pray that you would care for him now god that you would provide his every need that you would be a friend that sticks closer than a brother and god that you would anoint us as his family lord to minister and to his needs now god we pray that you would bless us as we all strive to live a life as faithful sister betty's to strive lord to be in fellowship to be in the word lord to have our focal point on you no matter what our condition is let that be our testimony as well and god we want to pray for our brother ron peterson and the whole assembly at evening light fellowship god you brought us through you lifted us up lord when there were so many here that were sick and some that were so seriously ill in the hospital and god we know by experience that by your stripes coven 19 is healed that by your stripes double pneumonia is healed we know it lord we've experienced it we've seen your word work and we know that it will work for our brothers and sisters we pray that your testimony of healing power would continue on in their lives god we pray that you would heal our brother ron and raise him up lord for your glory that you would deliver lord those that are afflicted in the church and and god encouraged their faith lift them up shield them from all the fiery darts of the enemy that would bring doubt or fear and god let your your faith be poured into their heart may they stand fast on the promise and watch the word work while we pray as we move into the reading of your word lord that you would just bless us now that you would just anoint us to receive your word for it by your word we live lord it's your word in us living off the word you're giving to us we pray god that you would just speak clearly to us lord deliver your word into our hearts lord and may we grow from that word and live the life you've called us to live that we can be the manifestation you've called us to be in this hour god bless us now as we look into your word in jesus christ's name we pray amen unless if we could turn to the book of revelation chapter 10 together i'd like to continue on in part four with this thought we had of do not fear his voice i'd also want to say we had a wonderful time brother sam pitzenberger's graduation yesterday as the graduation open house and it was good to see chris sister christie's family who came in and it was really a blessing to see the weather so nice because the forecast for days had been horrible the forecast that morning was horrible and the morning started off horrible and but i know there was many praying they were praying i was praying others were praying and god just moved everything away and they had beautiful weather and that was more than a coincidence friends that was god's love for his children amen so god bless you let's look here at revelations chapter 10. let's start reading at verse 8. and the voice which i heard from heaven spake to me again and said go and take the little book which o which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth and i went into the angel unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and they shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey i just want to pause for a minute and look at this we read these things so many times that we we just start reciting in our head and moving on but there's so much that can be said in just a phrase and he went to the angel and he says give me the book and he says take it and eat it up so although the angel is the one that has the open book and we must go to the angel to get the open book the way the angel command the commandment is very interesting he doesn't say open your mouth and i'll shove it inside of you so you go and take it and he says take it that's you take action you take it and eat it up those are things that john had to do the angel couldn't do that for john the angel could open the book he could bring it down he could make it available amen he could even send a voice from heaven encouraging john to go and go go and take the book amen but there's something that john has to do and he has to recognize how important the commandment is and he has to say give me the book and then the angel says fine take it come and get it get it jump higher you see what i'm saying i don't think god was playing with him but the point is he had to take it and eat it up not just take it and say i got the book but he had to get the book on the inside of him so there was some action he had to take there was something he had to be deliberate about praise be to god and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and i took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as i had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said to me thou must prophesy again before many peoples nations tongues and kings god bless the reading of his word as you have your seats this is a super familiar passage of scripture and it ties in to what we've been talking about the last several weeks and we're going to continue speaking on these things lord willing and and brother bam says in things that are to be we've read this quote a few times now so it's becoming very familiar that if we are those attributes of god we cannot live by creeds we cannot live by denominationalism we must live by the word because the bride is part of the bridegroom like any wife is part of her husband therefore we must be that word bride now every statement brother venom makes it's just the word coming forth and it's so rich and it's so full and it means so much that sometimes you can hardly get through a sentence without it just blossoming and opening but he says we cannot live by creeds we cannot live by denominationalism and and we have to understand that it's got to be the word amen not the denominationalism and denominationalism is a spirit not the title over a door so sometimes we think we can we can be mistaken in the fact that we go to a message church that i'll never be caught in denominationalism but you can have the spirit of denominationalism wherever you are right and then you can accept creed amen wherever you sit you can accept creed and you can you can live by denominationalism amen sitting in any church amen you could do it sitting in brother branham's church while brother branham's preaching and it wouldn't be his fault because the denominational spirit wouldn't be caused by him it wouldn't be his fault and so we we realized the bride cannot live by creed she cannot live by denominationalism but she must live by the word amen and the word is a person right it's more than just ink on paper the word is a person i was telling somebody last night and and i don't really want to get into this now but god says says it so i'm going to say it i thought i'd get into it next week but lord have mercy if you watch if you watch the jews there's a certain ritual that the jews have amen every year where they take the tour out and they dance with the torah and and it's very symbolic and it has a lot of rich and deep meaning but you can see how they have so much love and respect for the word of god amen that they're they take the the scrolls that are rolled together and they encase it in a in a certain encasing and and they they they wrap their arms around it and they dance and they all sing and dance amen to the dance of the torah and the symbology is rich and the symbology is good it has wonderful symbology but the thing that struck my heart when you watch them dancing is they love the torah they love they love the scrolls they love the word of god but they don't love jesus christ and so you know they were loving the torah they they they have such respect for the scrolls and for the word of god that when the jewish scribes would even scribe out a line amen they would wash themselves change them clothes go and they would write i mean it wasn't a trivial thing it was a very serious thing and it needed that level of seriousness and that level of consecration and the word was kept in a special place and the scrolls were laid up and they were protected and they were transported from place to place by being carried and all of this carries rich symbolism amen but the the point is when jesus christ showed up that was everything in those scrolls in a man they wanted to throw a rock at that man while dancing with the scroll i hope you understand what i'm saying we love our bibles we love the message but don't dance with the message app amen dance with the person of the word see what i'm saying and i love the message app and i love my message books but don't dance with the book dance with the person of the word the message is not 1200 sermons the message is jesus christ so we can have the wrong focus we can slip into denominationalism and we can say i just love the message i just love playing that tape i just love hearing that voice it's so soothing to me and all of those things are true and all of that is right but if you reject what he's saying if you reject the revelation of the truth that he's bringing what good is it to love your message app and reject the person of the word that is here manifesting himself everything that that prophet preached is here now manifesting through the bride and if you reject that we've become we've come to the same place they were in jesus day dancing with the scroll covering the scroll protecting the word honoring the word loving the word loving the temple and rejecting the person amen who wrote the book moses moses comes along and and he's given instructions to build a tabernacle that matches the tabernacle reflection of the one that's in heaven and he gets those instructions and those instructions come from god and god wants to build a reflection on the earth and it's gonna it's gonna be a way for the children of israel to know god better because he's going to display himself through these three stages moving to the inner court he wants a place where he can dwell with his people so they're setting all of this up and they build the tabernacle they get everything just right they donate the gold amen they they beat it out they make all the they make all the altars they make everything that they're supposed to make embroidered cloth they build it all and when they get it all right according to the word for their day the presence of god comes down and dwells in that tabernacle because that tabernacle is the manifestation of the word for their day amen and god lives in the manifestation of the word for that day that makes sense but when they begin to reject the word he would send more prophecy bring correction they begin to move away and they took what moses wrote and made it a tradition and when they made it a tradition they begin to add men's understanding to the word and really when it really comes down to it they were really they were really taking that word and trying to make that word fit their desire that's really exactly what happened because one person wanted to be bigger than the other person so he would make the word match him so that he can have his own sect and become a king and he's the one with the right interpretation and these other ones they want to they want to live a a compromised life so they take some of the word and interpret it a certain way so they can start living a little bit of a compromised life and so they take the word that god gave amen to moses moses took that word and wrote it in a book amen and now they began to take the words that were in that book and through their own interpretation they began to divide themselves they meant so that they really could fulfill the lust of their own flesh through pride or through selfishness or through self-indulgence or however they began to take the word and they were missing the person of the word and started taking the writing on the paper on the parchment and making and taking that writing on the parchment and they may have the phrase exactly correct and not change the phrase but when they take the phrase and apply it with a selfish heart or with pride they change the intent and meaning of the word amen is that right and they would still dance with the book and the pharisees would dance with the book not liking the sadducees and the sadducees would dance with the book the herodians would dance with the book the essenes would dance with the book they were all dancing with the book but who was dancing with the person of the book oh praise god nothing's changed if if we can gather any lesson nothing's changed every spirit was alive then is alive now nothing's changed and i love the message i love the books i love the tapes i love my message app i love it all but i want to dance with him i want to embrace the person of the word the life that's coming through all of that the life that gave that revelation the life the life that was in that prophet i don't want to just embrace the prophet but i want to embrace the life that was in that prophet i want to dance with the word but not holding a paper book because the paper book will go nowhere when the destruction falls upon this earth the paper books will be burnt amen the message app someday will come to nothing the printing presses will melt everything will come to not but the word will continue on and if i'm embracing the wrong thing amen i could find myself lacking in that day missing something because i was embracing amen i was embracing the mechanism by which the word came without embracing the word praise god we can do this with our local church we can do this with a minister we can do this with brother branham we can do it with the books and the tapes we can start embracing the mechanism by which the word is portrayed or displayed and not embraced the word himself and we get caught dancing dancing with a minister dancing with the church i go to so and so church it's such a wonderful church i think you should like your church i mean i don't think you should think you're in the worst church you know i think you should i think i think when god places you there it should be a fit and you should say i love my church you should say that but don't don't be dancing with the church dance with christ amen don't everybody should love their pastor and they should think he's the best pastor in the whole world [Laughter] but don't dance with the man look beyond the veil dance with the word don't be don't be taking the book and holding it up in front of your friends and say oh i love the pastor oh i love the preacher oh i love it so wonderful it's so wonderful amen that's just the paper the word was written on that's just the mechanism that he's using to bring the word go past the paper and go to the person that gives the word and dance with him praise be to god amen they come to the temple they you know they had the tabernacle in the windows they had the temple amen that solomon built and everything was set in order and the presence of god came down amen so that they couldn't even minister anymore the presence of god was so thick and everybody that would look to this temple would be delivered because solomon's temple amen became the manifestation of the word in that day but there come a time when they turned temple worship into denominationalism and creed the very thing that god gave them the very thing that the very place where he dwelt the very place of his presence became a creed in the denomination and when it became a creed in the denomination the shekinah glory of god lifted and moved away from that tabernacle amen and god god so wanted them to recognize that his presence was not always attached to a previous dispensation right because knowing where god was doesn't do us a lot of good we need to know where god is so knowing where god was amen god when they begin to turn from the life when they begin to turn from the person amen and they they began to turn from the person where did they turn to they turned to the temple and it looked so good because it looked like we're being real believers because we're coming to the temple doing what he told us to do offering a lamb offering a turtle dove offering of this but but but god says you do it without sincerity your heart's far from me you serve me amen in form and in fashion amen but your heart is far from me amen now you're walking past the golden pillars amen and you're looking at the beautiful artifacts around the temple and you're rubbing amen the beautiful masonry on the wall and you're loving the temple but you're not loving the life that's dwelling in the temple because if you love the life that dwells in the temple when that life moves somewhere else you move with it amen because you love the life you don't love the temple it's not the stone work we're in love with amen it's not the embroidery on the curtains it's not the altar of incense amen all of that was meant to point us to who was behind the veil amen we were supposed to love the one that was behind the veil but they started loving the veil so much so that when god rent the veil inherits temple from top to bottom they were so in love with the temple and so in love with the veil rather than recognizing that the mercy seat was empty they stitched the veil back together and kept loving the veil dancing with the book loving the veil having all the ceremonies of worship and it looked so good but it moved from a live worship to a dead worship when the sukkah glory of god moved on and now it was dead because there was no life in that temple the whole purpose of that temple was to give a revelation of god and god was dwelling there with his people when they changed the purpose of the temple remember god didn't change the purpose of them but they changed the purpose of that temple and they made it a way where they could live selfishly and live to pride and still come to the temple and pretend everything was all right i tell you as as god lifts us up in revelation as we get nearer to the final end of all of this i promise you there will be no place to hide no hiding behind religion no hiding behind mom and dad no going to church and raising your hands and singing and feel like everything's all right the only way that everything's going to be all right is that the same pillar of fire that lived in that temple lives in this temple and nothing else will do not another no form no ritual no listening to three tapes a day and reading all 1200 messages and reciting it verbatim that won't do any good amen wherever that life is there is life when the life leaves it becomes death and the only thing that's going to be all right is when the life that was behind that veil is behind this veil and then you're not dancing with the paper you're dancing with the word you're not dancing you know with your phone i just love the message you're dancing with the word because the word's in you god so made his message clear that he allowed not one stone to be upon another stone in that temple amen the tabernacle was lost solomon's temple destroyed herod's temple destroyed why god is trying to show i'm not there i'm not there i'm not there god bless us and help us reciting bible verses it's wonderful memorizing the word it's important but we can do that and not miss and miss the person of the world the message came the forerunner came to show us where the shekinah glory of god was and it was manifesting through a little man with a seventh grade education son of man ministry a son of man revealing the son of man what was that the son of man jesus christ himself god amen manifesting in present tense amen and showing us where the shekinah glory of god was and that came so that the body would unite with the head so that there would be an invisible marriage union amen so that now that life that was in that prophet now comes into you and see because they begin to love the temple more than they loved the person the temple became an idol and god had to destroy their idol because they were loving the building and not the person we understand whatever whatever causes whatever takes our affection away from the present tense word is our idol because the present tense word is where the glory of god is is where the presence of god is is the proper place of worship is where god is working and where god should be worshipped and anything that takes us from that has become an idol and so we don't want to be idolaters we want to be believers so let's make sure that we dance with christ praise god let's get back to this quote and things that are to be it's like any wife is part of her husband therefore we must be that word bride see you can't say that you love this and don't love the word bride and you can't say you love this and not love the present-day manifestation of christ in a veil which is the word bride you can't tell me that you love malachi 4 and reject revelations 10 8-11 something doesn't compute you can't tell me you love the word and and reject the bride age and the christ and the formation of the bride and christ in bride form you can't reject that and love this because what you're doing now is you're dancing with a book but this book won't rapture you the paper you tear it out and eat it will it won't change your body amen but the life that wrote this word and the life that comes and reveals it will change you from glory to glory and so we say we love the messenger but declaring that we hate his message because his message his message was the coming of the lord his message was the bright coming of christ that was his message so how can we say we love the messenger and hate his message see we without even realizing it we love whatever it is about that previous dispensation that makes me feel fine the way i am without changing is really what we love to say i love my bible but i don't love the present tense manifestation of jesus christ because the present tense requires a change in me because if i'm going to be the very life of jesus christ then some things in my life have got to change some things have got to fall off because if jesus christ was living in his flesh he wouldn't be doing this and it requires a greater consecration a greater sacrifice a greater death to self a greater surrender to a spirit the real manifestation of this word requires a total selfless abandonment and an absolute preeminence from him and we say we reject that but love this and dance with the word and love the message but really this is just me brother chad i could be a million miles from right this is just where i feel really what we want is we want to be able to identify malachi 4 and and show all the miracles in malachi 4 and the manifestation of jesus christ and the perfection of the word and begin to love that ministry which was the ministry of christ it was true nothing wrong with that but love that ministry but reject the present tense ministry then you have to ask yourself why would you reject the present tense if you love that so much because this is a continuation of that like this is the same thing that was right he just pulled it out of that tabernacle and put it in this tabernacle but what's the difference there is no difference it's the same person it's the same lord jesus christ it's the same person of the word he's moved from that tabernacle of the seventh angel and he's moved into the formation of his bride amen and now to reject that when you say oh i don't reject the people when you reject that whole truth when you reject it that's true when you reject that christ is in bright form when you reject that you move to the bride and would you reject all of that my question is why what is it i mean what kind of why what is it that we're attaching to the past so much that will reject the present day amen unless amen holding on to the past is somehow a covering for my failure in present day because that's what it always was for the jews that's what it always was they turned the past dispensation into an idol amen when moses took that serpent and put it on a rod the brazen serpent it was the present day truth it was the word made manifest on that pole and he told moses amen everybody who's bit by the fire servant when they look on that they shall live and they looked and they lived but generations later there comes another prophet who's got to take that same thing that was god in their day that would bring total deliverance now it was bringing them to bondage because now they were worshiping the serpent on the pole and they were not worshiping the god that was behind the veil they were worshiping the serpent on the pole they had turned it into an idol and now a prophet had to come and smash that thing and grind it to powder why why is there uh why is there uh such a pull in mankind and the devil working on the nature of man to always go back to the last place god was amen and begin to to rub the monuments and kiss the feet and go back to holy places why if if everything that was in that vessel is here today and i loved that why wouldn't i spend all my time and energy in this see what i'm saying like no rejection of the past manifestation like for now if we would find noah's ark and really uncover it and find it and you could go tour it give me a ticket give me a ticket because that's what god did this is the very ark this is what he built according to the word of the lord i want to see how he pinned it i want to see how he pitched it i want to see what the rooms were like i want to see sign me up give me a ticket i'll go visit it and when i visit it i'll have tingling sensations being in it right but that ark won't save me today so there's no disrespect for the ark there's no lack of love and affection for it amen sign me up i would be there i'd be in line i want to look at it i want to crawl all over it i want to i want i want to know right that's why there's tours going back to the holy land all the time amen i would like to go sometime myself see and feel the atmosphere the environment and look at the places and see the actual distances and what it looks like from this mountaintop i would love to go do that and i would go out of respect for what happened there that day amen but what happened in that day was the word for that day and going back and laying in the tomb where jesus was supposedly laid will not change me one drop and going down and touching the place where his blood spilled on the ground won't change me one speck amen the only thing that will change me is finding whatever life went out there at calvary when i can find that life and unite with that life that'll change me [Applause] so idols are so much different than what it's not a little statue you put in your house in light a little incense and you say i'm not an idol worshiper i don't even have a statue do you understand what i'm saying but we take the things of god and turn them into idols and hold on to past because it frees us from the responsibility of the presence because the challenge of the hour has always been the word of the hour the challenge of the hour listen i'll tell you friends people keep sending me clips and i get this and that i get clips all the time of charismatic and pentecostal people talking about how wonderful brother branham was and he was a prophet they're looking back and saying god was working in that man he was a true prophet of god i get clips women preachers charismatic movement people they can identify that there was a prophet there and that god was working in that man but they have no idea where god is now so being able to recognize what happened that's wonderful we appreciate that but my salvation comes in recognizing what's happening where god is today and that's what i want to give my whole life to and i don't want any religion i don't want any religion to become my covering because my covering is the revealed word for this hour my clothing my covering is the revealed word for this hour and i want to be covered in him clothed in his righteousness which is his word today and living his life with the life of the word living on the inside and i don't want to make anything an idol my church my favorite preacher i don't want to make brother branham i don't want to make anything an idol i want to worship the true and living god and the true and living god is alive and well and on earth today but he's hidden behind a veil of skin and i want to get in behind the skin with him and i want him behind my skin so so we find now that that we have got we have got to stay tuned in to where christ is in the wilderness journey they had to move when christ moved they had to follow that pillar of fire because life and leadership was coming from the pillar of fire it wasn't coming from the the last dispensation or the last move or the last camp right i mean they if you think about they set the tabernacle up on dirt it was set up on dirt and they set the holy of holies and the holy of holies was over top dirt desert sand dirt whatever was there they may have cleared it and leveled it i don't know what all they did but then on that they would have set the the ark of the covenant and on that ark of the covenant the presence of god would come so the presence of god was on this spot on the planet earth you got that right and when that pillar of fire left the shekinah glory of god the presence president's lord and moved on they had to pack everything up and turn their back on that spot and move on and not build a temple in that spot and remember where he was you see what i'm saying they could go and touch it and pick up some sand and put in little cruise and carry with them everywhere they went but if they didn't keep following that light that sand wasn't doing them any good so the word is more than writing the word is more than preaching amen the word is a person and the person is alive today and he's preaching his word today that's what i said don't fear his voice don't fear his voice where is his voice the prophet told us where his voice is his voice is in his bride there was a time that isaiah's prophecy was prophecy and it was laying in a book a virgin shall conceive laying in a book and you could love that word and read that word and say oh a virgin is going to conceive god is going to come i just love that prophecy i love thinking about it i love looking forward to it i love dwelling on it and meditating on it and looking at it and teaching i love it but there come a time that that word came to life inside a little virgin girl in nazareth right and she had a visitation of an angel who come and told her you're the one of that word and that prophecy now was inside of her and they were mocking her and laughing at her and disbelieving her story and the same time going home and opening up isaiah and reading and saying i just love this prophecy someday the virgin's going to conceive oh praise be to god and they had different interpretations someday the virgin nation is going to conceive no one individual virgin's going to conceive the virgin daughter of the high priest and blah blah blah oh i can't wait for that day and then daddy daddy did you hear that mary next door who's supposed to be getting married joseph did you hear she's pregnant and she's got some funny story that an angel told her and that this is going to be the messiah that's not true what are you doing for devotionals tonight dad i'm reading out of isaiah a virgin shall conceive do you see my point friends it's so easy to miss where the life is because it's behind the veil and it's so easy to see where it was it's so easy that other people even non-elect can see where it was but it's so difficult for the world to see where it is because that's given by revelation there was a time that god himself gave abraham a promise you shall bring forth a son and that was a beautiful promise and sarah and and abraham they wanted that word they wanted that promise so sarah injected herself into the mix in her mind to find a way to bring about the promise and this this whole thing with hagar happen in ishmael and all that but there come a time when god's promise came to life and manifestation inside sarah and that couldn't be rejected because that was gone to reject that was to reject god to reject a pregnant virgin girl from nazareth was to reject god and dancing with the scroll you see how dangerous denominationalism is how deadly it is that's why my brother said above everything pray for revelation pray for revelation denominationalism and creed come from cain amen because abel was willing to wait until he knew how god wanted to be worshipped but cain just wanted to worship god the way he wanted to worship god according to his desire and it wasn't that he wasn't going to make a sacrifice it wasn't that he wasn't going to put an effort he was going to put in a great deal of effort make a huge sacrifice work hard amen and really really offer worship and cain offered worship cain worked diligently to bring forth his sacrifice and bring forth his offering to god but that's not what god wanted it's what cain wanted and i wonder how much of our worship is worship that we like preaching we like music we like a schedule we like like i wonder how much of our i wonder how much of our worship is worship that we like abel didn't give the worship able light abel gave the worship god wanted so denominationalism is not going to the baptist church or the pentecostal denominational is finding a way to worship that satisfies me do you understand what i'm saying amen finding a way to worship that satisfies me that i like this is it like like i can't stand when that preacher starts harping off this and this and this well can you raise your hands and say i surrender all i'll worship you the way you lie or go find a preacher that won't harp on the things that you don't want him to harp on and i'm not even i'm not even talking about the other things that have preached it could be true as true could be and there could be nothing wrong with any other ministry what's wrong is our desire looking for something that matches our desire and when it matches our desire we'll start dancing with that another church another preacher another ministry or no ministry at all and back to the prophet why what's the motive behind all that i just want it pure i just want it pure and undefiled and i your ears aren't pure and undefiled that may be pure word coming off of that tape but it's not pure ears that are receiving it you need more than that you need a revelation from god [Music] i reject ministers they all mess it up well that's the truth i don't think there's a ministry alive and won't don't say that's true i messed it up but that's the path that he chose that's the method that he chose because he's not going to do it by a perfect preacher perfect church perfect tape he's going to do it by a perfect revelation of a perfect word that's coming through all those mechanisms so that we never dance with the mechanical device we never dance with the veil we never dance with the tabernacle we dance with the word oh i hope you understand what i'm saying i'm saying it as polite and kind as i can because it's something it's not this isn't something you can say oh man i can think of examples there and i can think of examples there if you can't find an example here then you've missed the point of what i'm preaching our tendencies are to denominationalism our tendencies are to fall back on something previous or somewhere else or something solid we can touch look at turn on those are our tendencies to look for something solid a person a ministry a tape a book something that i can dance with but if you're going to dance with christ you're going to join him in an invisible union it's the invisible union it's the private connection between you and him only and nobody nobody else is invited and nobody else is welcome it's you and him alone where something comes in and changes you and and you know that something happened and you've changed and you've met the person of the word you may not be able to describe it you may not put it in language that makes sense to another human being none of that matters but you've had the experience of meeting a supernatural god that has wrought a change in my life in an invisible union and then you dance with that and what is that that is the word made manifest for our day what is the veil the veil is the bride amen there's a promise in the new testament we talked about last time a promise of the apostle paul and the apostle paul is saying i travail i travail with you in birth again until christ be formed in you what's he saying he's saying what is what is paul's ministry about what is he working for what is he writing to the corinthians what is he preaching he's travailing until christ be formed in you so there's a prophecy there that that christ will be formed in you christ in you the hope of glory that's why brother ben will come right back to that scripture amen when he preaches christ is the mystery of god revealed and he goes right back to colossians said christ in you the hope of glory and so that laid there as a prophecy amen and it was never fully realized it was only partially realized down to the church ages because they had a holy ghost and portion or a dip in the spirit or a portion of the spirit why did they only have a portion of the spirit because they had a portion of the word and if you have a portion of the word you get a portion of the spirit because the word and life are the same thing that makes sense so now there's a time looking ahead to a prophecy when it's not going to be partial but it's going to come in fullness one of these days there's going to be a manifestation of this promise that he will have a bride without spot or wrinkle that she it'll be christ in you the hope of glory amen you've been you've been espoused into christ but there's coming a time that you'll be married to christ there's come there's a time when all the laboring of paul and all the labor of luther and all the labor of wesley and all the labor it's all the labor is going to be done and christ will be formed in the bride and those are wonderful scriptures and wonderful things to talk about and wonderful things in the message amen but that word has to come into a womb that promise just like isaiah's promise had to come to life in mary amen the promise that abraham had to come to life in sarah amen and the promise in the new testament has to come to life in this day in a bride and to reject that is to reject this but every morning i dance with my book i dance with my book but i'm waiting for the future for something to happen reading the prophecies of a redeemer coming to redeem israel looking at christ going to calvary nailed on gagatha preparing the passover feast looking back to a deliverance out of egypt and knowing that someday they'll come a deliverance out of their condition and not realizing that that passover lamb was hanging on that cross right there walking by wagging their heads carrying the scroll with the word written in little boxes on their forehead walking by with the word rolled up in little scrolls and little boxes strapped to their forehead walking by and wagging their head others he saved himself he can't save if thou be the son of god come down off of that cross with the word they so loved the word it was scrolled up and in a box strapped to their head and there was the word being crucified the word bleeding the word dying for the deliverance that the passover lamb was foreshadowing the whole feast that they were preparing amen he was god's lamb for the passover feast for the family and they're over here slaying lambs at the same time god's lamb is dying but they loved the ritual so much that they rejected the manifestation and what went back to the ritual right why did why did the pharisees loved the ritual so much because it empowered them it gave them purpose it gave them power but god forbid you would take all the power out of the pulpit and put it back in the pew god forbid you would do it without the priesthood god forbid that the lamb of god would come god forbid he would come and not inform the high priest that year and not go to the sanhedrin and announce his arrival and ask for their permission to preach and ask them to be partners with him in his campaigns god forbid it would come humble and lonely and go to individuals who were cast out and set aside you see this message came not to promote the priesthood but it did come to promote a priesthood the priesthood of melchizedek [Applause] and those who are born again by the word born again in this day the tabernacle of melchizedek because it was the high priest that came down the tabernacle in flesh and now there's a ministry now of melchizedek and the ministry of melchizedek is going on in kings and priests you are a king and a priest today now over a spiritual kingdom and a priest after what order because in the original order was priest after the order of aaron the aaronic priesthood then it became the levitical priesthood but now it's the melchizedek priesthood amen and the only way to be a priest in the melchizedek priesthood is to have melchizedek living inside of you and you become a king and a priest see when god called out israel he wanted a nation of kings and priests is that what he wanted he wanted a whole nation of kings and priests but they rejected that and asked for a prophet and when he asked for a prophet they asked for an order because brother ben said they wanted something they can do anything not to face god as an individual and so they wanted the order because they they could keep the order but facing god as an individual was too much to ask for and so now they get the order they get the rituals they get everything they get a priesthood they get it all but that's not what god wanted god wanted them all to be a nation of priests he wanted them all to be princes he wanted them all to have their own land remember when god comes in when god comes in and divides up the land through through moses instruction through joshua he doesn't come in and he's not setting up lords and this lord gets all of this land and everybody on the land are his subjects to feed him and serve him that's what man does when he gets land but when god gets land god says everybody gets their portion because he wanted everybody to be a king in the land the prince in the land right he wanted he wanted everybody they get their portion according to the size of their family not according to their rank their seeming rank in society it had nothing to do with the rank in society they all got an equal portion because they all got a portion related to their family size and that land represents the word and god didn't give the word to a couple preachers and those couple preachers have so much territory this is my territory and under here i got my people and my people can live on this land and the whole mechanism is to serve the king at the top or the lord of the land that's what the priesthood became in the old testament that's what denomination became in the new testament this is my territory we lutherans have this much territory and everybody on this territory is serving the palace of lutheran keeping the system going keeping the machinery going keeping the army fighting keeping you know building the palace so that we can say we're the greatest kingdom oh god smashed that thing so you come and send a prophet with a seventh grade education who refused donations he refused to be tight in denominations who took the path of rejection and he took all of the limelight off of himself without denying his position and without belittling his place in the word and he took all of it and he put it on the bride see when joshua went into the land joshua because he was the one dividing up the land amen joshua didn't make sure that he got prime real estate because that wasn't god's method god wanted everybody to be a king and a priest that was his original plan i want everybody to be a king and a priest and what does god want today he wants a nation of kings and priests he wants sons and daughters who are connected to him individually he wants he wants you to be a king a priest to intercede he wants you to be a king he wants you to have a portion of this land a portion of this word and you know it's yours you know it belongs you know i i have arrived to my place i'm not serving somebody i'm not serving a church i'm not serving a ministry i'm not serving a movement i don't exist you see you don't exist to keep the doors of this church open if god wants to close and look close tomorrow you don't exist to keep this ministry going that's not your purpose this building is to serve you and this ministry is to serve you not vice versa if we get it out of kilter we're going right back to denominationalism where we're all working to keep the program going keep the doors open keep the ministry going keep moving moving moving moving build another block and a higher wall forget all of that stuff the ministry amen the the all the efforts of a building and a place of worship and a place of fellowship and a ministry and and several ministers of misery it shall all be doing one thing encouraging you to take your portion of the land and live as a king and a priest in the word to say i can pray for my sick baby amen i can intercede for my loved one i can reach god i can come in contact face to face with god you know if we if we preach any other way then we've missed amen we've missed the day that we live in this isn't about amen a ministry anymore the ministry is in the bride and within the bride there's apostles prophets pastors teachers they absolutely amen they teach and they they they do the word absolutely that's what we do as a unified body of christ amen but we're not here to keep the pastor of the apostle a propped up and going he's just here as part of the body as one of the tools amen as one of the team members but what's the objective what's the goal what day do we live in we live in a day amen where there's messiahs upon the earth there is a restoration of the word to bring back gods upon this earth gods in flesh not not a god with with little minions around him but that they come out become a kingdom of kings and priests [Applause] that you yourself realize i'm a prince with god i have dominion i have authority i have the word the message came for me the message speaking of me the word is talking of me i'm not plugged in to move the program the program is here to get me in my position that's the whole point friends amen for each one of us to find our position in christ and stand in that position amen not to keep something going along fill a position have a role that's all you know there's necessary things there are necessary things in having a church there's necessary things in organization there's necessary roles to fulfill but that is all here to serve a purpose and that purpose is to get the bride to rise up and take her place it's about amen it's about the manifestation of jesus christ in bright form not the manifestation of jesus christ in pulpit form [Applause] you understand i i hope that you see jesus christ behind this pulpit because i see jesus christ in the pew and when i sit in the pew and somebody else is behind the pulpit i see jesus christ in pulpit and i see myself as jesus christ in the pew so it doesn't matter if you're in the pulpit or the pew there's no difference we've got we've got to move away from denominationalism and realize that if there is a manifestation of jesus christ on the earth i'm it i cannot er there's no possibility of passing that off somewhere else and living comfortable there's no saying there's a manifestation in jeffersonville there's a manifestation over in this big city there's a man there's no comfort in that friends there's no peace in that there's no rest in saying i see god over there and i see god over there that's not the day today is the day to have god in here and to become the messiah to become the god upon the earth little g because he said the he says you call them god whom the word of the lord came to who did the word of the lord come to came to a prophet right that mighty angel took that book christ took the book tore the seals off threw him down to the seventh church age messenger and he gave him to the church is that what the prophet said well just look at the sequence of events so why do i want to hang on to the seventh church age messenger and make an idol out of that because what was given to him was given to the church so i'll go there and say i think you have something for me do you understand yeah i we're all stuck in this condition human beings prone to keep falling back on these old habits but i tell you if worship if your worship to god and devotion happens on sunday morning or on wednesday night you've missed the whole plan of god you've missed the whole thing if you go to church that's not an evil term i still say we're going to church but if you realize if we don't get our mind wrapped in the right spot if we're always going to church then all of a sudden the church becomes the place of worship the building itself and the people we gather with and that's the place of worship and we do worship god as he comes forth in his revealed word but if we're just always going to church we've missed the fact that we are the church and god's provided place of worship and this hour is in christ jesus how do you get into him by one spirit we're all baptized all right okay so now the proper place of worship is in christ jesus so where is christ jesus in the church i in him and him and me what day will you know that this day so the proper place of worship is not in your pew although it's not wrong to worship there the proper praise of worship is in your soul when the seed in you the life in you and the life of christ which is the same thing makes a connection in your soul that's the proper place of worship that's the only provided place of worship in this day that is the tabernacle that is the temple see god is a jealous god and this day is not like any other day when god foreshadowed what he's doing he foreshadowed it all the way back in eden when he put a son of god on earth but part of that son was his wife mystery of the seventh seal and he pulls out of the man the woman forms her and presents this woman back to the man right and what were they in eden co equal this message is to take us back to that that's a big statement and it's a big statement because we can say it here in church when we go home and we're like uh it's me you know like the same guy who messed up yesterday and i'm gonna mess up tomorrow and that's why we can only have this by faith not by what we see by faith we believe in god is calling us back to what he foreshadowed and we know we we cannot come into a perfect display in hybrid flesh but this word has come so strong in this day and so much of the holy ghost is available full measure comes down that that measure of the holy ghost quickens our mortal body and actually brings begins to resurrect our body now into a resurrected condition before the complete body change because we are changing from glory unto glory so it's no longer acceptable to say well you know i'm in hybrid flesh you know i got these problems and you know my mom and dad and blah blah blah the level of the word today should be taking care of all of those problems one after another and bringing that body lined up and subject to the word so we know that there's a time for a perfect manifestation but we should be growing into a perfect manifestation not sitting and waiting for a perfect manifestation to come someday every revelation every bit of the word unfolding all of the unlocking of the word should be lining this flesh up to jesus christ's word and manifesting who's on the inside and when the word comes listen i if we could just change our thinking if you'll notice i haven't read a scripture and i haven't looked at a note since i got up here because this is all straight from heaven because i never planned on saying any of this but when that word comes friends the word the revelation comes it doesn't come inside of you and build another building block that revelation comes to unlock the word that's already on the inside amen faith is there a perfect body is there everything that we have need of is already in us before life's journey began it's locked in the dna of god that's down in the soul and so the revelation of the word is coming sounding a certain sound amen so it can get a harmonic frequency out of the dna i understand that's why we have to keep moving when the light moves that's why we can't go back and dance amen with 1200 tapes and say i've got the message i've got the message if you don't have the one who gave the message you don't have the message if you don't have connection with the mighty angel you don't have the message you can have every book you can put them under your mattress you can sleep on them at night you can eat the very literal pages out of your bible but if you don't have the mighty angel who brought the open book you do not have the message if the message isn't in you you don't have the message and so what's the word do do i have to understand all these things and if it's so complicated it's not about understanding all these things it's about the revelation of the word taking your bible and showing the day that we live in here and here and here and here what's it doing why why do we have to go through all the old testament stories why do we have to show the seventh seal and genesis and then have a cook and then song of solomon and why so it can unlock that seventh seal that's down inside of you so it's more faith and more faith and more faith what's the preaching of the word doing unlike unlocking the potential that's already laying on the inside so that it doesn't become i need the preacher to give me something to add to i'm going and asking god to open up so so that i can live to my full potential you realize luther could not live a sanctified life because the word of sanctification wasn't being preached but luther had the seed of god on the inside do you understand that brother said luther had the same holy ghost you've got yes that's a tough one to swallow but luther although because brother ben said if luther and wesley and them if they reformers would have went on further they would have got to this why because they had all of this down in the sea gene of god but only the portion for that day could be unlocked by the word for that day so the word for that day unlocked the manifestation for that day because the word unlocks the potential so when a message of justification comes a revelation of justification now they can begin to live a manifestation of justification but he can't live the manifestation of sanctification although it's in him do you believe that was in him it was in luther if luther was the seed of god all all that was in god was in luther amen in portion that's why if luther would have went on he'd have been sitting in the sea here preaching in the pulpit here and so that's what's so dangerous about denominationalism when the lutheran stopped they stopped the potential in the manifestation for that day because god was bringing another level of revelation amen to unlock more of what was laying in that seed amen so the church the bride could have a greater manifestation to move from stock to move to tassel what brought it from stock to tassel the revelation of the word for their day then moved to the pentecostal age and now to here so the lutherans are still dancing with their book and the wesleyans are dancing with their book the pentecostals are dancing with their revelation of the book and people in message churches are dancing with 1200 tapes do you understand what i'm saying not belittling anybody i'm pointing the finger at us let's dance with the word the person of the word that wants to live inside of his bride why why why does it have to be so hard why such rejection and ridicule and scorn and why why can't we just preach a simple message like every other church preaches and just be normal and be accepted why why can't we just stick in 1963 and stay there why do we have to be pushing the edge of the light why why can't we just be happy with 1200 tapes and books and god sent a prophet why why can't that just be satisfying to us the same reason the wesleyans had to preach more than the lutherans that message was given to us and that message brought the full revelation of jesus christ it's in the message if it's in the message it's for me if brother branham preached it it's for the bride there's a reason he said it there's a reason he preached it there's a reason it's on tape there's a reason it's in a book there's a reason we have it not so that we can play it safe stand back don't get too close to the edge so that we don't fall off so we just stay within a certain uh a certain segment of the message that's declared safe and honorable but there's more potential the message came to unlock the full potential of a full bride who will be who will be him she will be so much like him she will be him my brother said i believe that i believe i'm just going to stay here i'm just going to stay with my tapes i'm going to dance with the books and someday when god wants that then god will turn me into that how did god move lutherans to wesleyans he opened another portion of the word how did he move lutherans to pentecostals he took another portion of the word and how does he move his bride in the program he keeps taking that message and opening it up and opening it up not a new message not a new messenger the prophet and the bride and the spirit have to be saying the same thing amen we cannot add to or take away we cannot add to or refuse to look at amen we cannot add to or stay away from because it's dangerous and somebody else went down that road and they fell off a cliff and died sometimes i think adding to is deadly but sometimes what about staying away from is that could that be deadly too god was displeased with israel because israel didn't fully possess their land and you know because it got hard possessing the land that was great we got land milk and honey milk and honey we're on our way to a land with milk and honey i'm gonna get my own part i'm gonna be a king but you're gonna have to fight for every inch you're going to drive out the inhabitants fight it off from raiders god has opened up the land for us he's taken the seals off the book and opened up the entire bible the message came amen not to start a new denomination with a new tabernacle a new temple and new dimensions on new land so that we can build new walls out of new doctrinal beliefs so that we can do the same thing the lutherans the wesleys and the pentecostals did but it came to open up the land it came to open up the bible so that we could have the whole thing someday god's going to crank that great lever in the sky and my body's going to change brother madam said the rapture is a revelation and a revelation comes by the word it's not going to be the magic moment when all of a sudden god does it all he's doing it now he's resurrecting us now he's rapturing us up now he's changing us now we're moving from glory to glory as he opens the book and shows it to us now why is it so hard because canaanites never wanted to give up their territory to begin with brother said those were demon powers canaanites and philistines and hittites they they're in the land trying to keep you from possessing the land because when the bride fully possesses the land and catches the full revelation of the full word and who she really is then the rapture will go is that right the raptures come but we're taking the land so the rapture can go amen see denominationalism starts off playing it safe then builds a wall then defends its castle and then declares war i'm not interested i want the word i want every morsel and portion that's for me i want every crumb i want every piece of land i want every leaf i want every blade of grass i want every stream i want everything that god has opened for us today i want it today first it is the revelation of that word that will quicken my mortal body how do you know it's quickening it now sometimes it's not a good thing to be raised in the message and there's certain things that are wonderful about it a lot of heartache that you're spared a lot of but it's so much easier then for it to become a ritual a religious motion of action just this has become normal but we got to push past all of that and say i don't want what's normal i don't i don't want to believe what i've been taught to believe all my life i want to believe him i don't want to embrace a set of guidelines and doctrines i want to dance with him i want to know him on a personal level i want him to quicken me to life and i want to dance with him not my church not my family's religion i wonder how many people are message believers because their whole family is message believers i wonder how many people go to a church because they all their life went to that church hey that's religion but what we want is not religion we want him say lord i don't want to dance with my church and i don't want to dance in my family's tradition i don't want to dance with generational belief i want to dance with you i want to dance with the person of the word i want to rejoice in the word for my day i want to see it i want to know it i want to be it see friends this

become a reality until you know that i am she yeah well brother brennan was preaching about he was preaching about me when he said the bride the formation of the bride christ and the bride he's talking about me all that scripture that all that that foreshadowed all the way back in genesis chapter three saying that there's going to be a seed of the woman come forth amen isaiah declared it and that all the prophets declared it all come down to mary and mary screamed out and says i am blessed among all women i am the i am the place of this prophecy being fulfilled today from genesis 3 amen isaiah jeremiah all the way through they were prophesying and testifying that there was one coming and now that coming was coming inside of mary and mary could stand up and say i'm the most blessed among all women god has lifted me up he looked at my lowly condition and he is he he has lifted me on high can you say the same thing all those prophecies of the new testament all that paul was laboring for all that was supposed to happen in this day it's right here it's inside of me say god how do you know by revelation god reveal it to me let me come into that union and give my whole life to that word help me god no more religion no more denominationalism but when i lay down at night let me be whispering i love you lord as i fall asleep when i wake up in the morning let the sweetness of his presence be be with me let me be saying i love you lord when i wake up in the morning throughout the day let him be the meditation of my mind the desire of my heart the reality of a love relationship with the person not a devotion not a duty not a place of worship not a form of religion but let it be the person that i danced through life with the person of the word what did we think the full reality of the world was going to be like big giant meeting big displays of great power those things may come they may or may not i don't know but it's going to come down to the individual connected with god knowing who he or she is with absolute confidence in god and in their position and whatever he wants to do from there he'll do signs and wonders ridicule and scorn whatever he wants to do from there he'll do but what he's trying to get is preeminence christ in you the hope of glory in this hour it's the only thing that matters go past the veil don't dance with the books don't dance with the congregation dance with him the person of the word let's all stand musicians if you could come let's just bow our heads and pray lord jesus we thank you for the reality of your word lord it's so true and it's so raw that it leaves us all unveiled lorne we are uncovered and naked before you lord jesus and god that's the way we want to be no religion no covering we only want to be covered by your word for this hour god if there's any here lord who has been embracing the building embracing the tapes embracing the books embracing a physical bible but have not yet embraced you the person of the word i pray god that you would quicken something inside of them now draw them lord and pull them to yourself so that they'll move past the outer court past the holy place past the golden altar of incense and they'll move all the way into the shekinah glory god let us have reality not forms but reality let us be the word for this day god we give ourselves to you afresh i give myself to you lord forgive me for my distractions lord forgive me lord for all my fears and anxieties and complexes let me die to them lord keep preaching your word to break me away from everything of the flesh to bring me lord more and more into that manifestation of that perfect word god i pray to unlock lord the mystery of what you're doing in this day unlock it to us lord and let it become a living reality inside of us god i love you with all of my heart i desire more than anything else more than a reputation more than a building more than physical anything i desire you lord may that be the desire of all of our hearts loren just you just to dance with you let us not repeat the sins of the past through the old testament and new testament but you're calling for a bride to come and unite with you a king looking for his queen and lord your word is what's identifying us your word is what's calling us your revelation of you is what we're embracing god make it a living reality god we surrender all afresh to you we sacrifice all wrong thinking we sacrifice all wrong understanding we come to you as your sons and daughters lord you desire to live through us live through us now lord manifest through us lord all that you brought in that message all that you were trying to do and accomplish is on earth today i pray that you would accomplish it lord your prophet was here pointing to a word born bride let us be that word born bride you were the word so we must be the word let us be the word and unite with you the word let it be more than phrases lord more than doctrines more than teachings let it be a living reality of the seventh seal unveiled to us oh we love you lord jesus work in every heart working every life root out lord all hurt and all bitterness root out all covering

ear and reveal the mystery of who we are to us lord like never before let our security come lord not from a form or a ritual but let our security come from your private revelation to us of who we are and let that be our security our identity that holds us in this dark hour we love you lord i ask that you take these words and make them live in our hearts change us from glory to glory quicken us to where you want us to be i love you have your way lord you've had your way you've had your way in the preaching for this was your way now i pray you have your way in our hearts lord because that was the whole purpose not for good preaching but for an embracing of the word let us embrace you lord jesus we love you take us as we leave from here lord let not these words fade away but drive them deep into our hearts and bring them into a reality in jesus christ's name we pray amen of god in his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you oh hallelujah one more time the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these [Applause] [Applause] god bless your friends i love you all and god just had some things to say this morning [Music] and i pray you understand my heart i'm a message believer through and through but because i'm a son of god i'm a message believer there will be many self-proclaimed message believers that were self-proclaimed with an intellectual faith in the message but the real message believers were ordained to be message believers before the foundation of the world because god's objective was not for you to believe the message god's objective was for you to be the mess god's whole plan was not to get you to believe in the opening of the seventh seal the whole plan comes down to this you being the revelation of the seventh well i believe this and i believe that and i believe that that's wonderful if it's intellectual if you pieced it together through what was preached or what you were read that will do you no good but the reality of who you are [Music] will draw you to this light and this light will quicken the full potential of who you already are the message didn't come to make you bride to make you a son of god the message come to identify who you already were and it came to unlock the potential that's in that word the most important thing is to be a son or daughter of god to come from the mind of god that's what he's after sons and daughters of god himself in flesh in this day manifested in bright form that was his objective and he's accomplishing it in his people don't just be a message believer don't just be in love with the bible be in love with him and let him be alive in you that's the whole purpose of the whole thing friends god bless you let's sing again me and me and shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of god oh hallelujah hallelujah [Music] asked be given unto you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened [Music] hallelujah kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall be added oh hallelujah [Laughter] had it all but what i need is still empty and [Applause] for more [Laughter] i've had it all [Music] is [Applause] [Music] i
