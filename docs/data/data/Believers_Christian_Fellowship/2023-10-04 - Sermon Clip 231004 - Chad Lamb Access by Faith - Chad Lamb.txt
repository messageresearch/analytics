========================================

1900 years of all kinds of Theology and movements but still in the darkness of all of it you promised that you would appear here in the last days in the Sodom day and you would make yourself known to the children of Abraham the called the elected and here you are tonight after 1900 years you are just as much alive tonight as you was when you talked to the woman at the well if he's just as much alive as he was amen then that means the power is here amen but we have to have the same access she had to get the benefit of him being here it's God manifested in flesh now in the flesh of his bride for the bride and the husband is the same self flesh these two are one and this is what I want to hone in on and the church is becoming the bride amen are you becoming the bride and the church is becoming the bride all all the time by believing the word what's her access to be bride her access is Faith amen the ability to believe the word is what's putting her in the bride what's changing her from church from denomination to bride how is she making this move how is she moving from denomination into bride she's moving that way by believing the word what's her access to brideship her access is by faith it's not going to a message Church it's not getting along with the Saints it's not agreeing with the pastor that's not access believing the word is access and the church is becoming the bride all the time by believing the word I'm becoming the bride all the time because as he shows me the word there's something in me that says Amen to it amen that's the truth that's the truth I didn't know that before I never saw that before somebody turned to a Bible and they opened the Bible and they showed me something I never seen before but there was something in me that said that ain't nothing but the truth what is that that's my access to be bride not good works not good deeds not going to the right place not a mental agreement with all the right things not dressing right none of that is my access that all is secondary that's a manifestation of the faith that I have in my heart but what's my access to be bride my access is faith in the word and the church is becoming the bride all the time by believing the word so that the word in the church becomes the same the word in the church making it the bride the last sign God identifying himself the word in the church we are not bride because we claim to be bride I'm not bride because my lips can say it I'm bride because my faith in my soul can receive it and believe my access is faith
