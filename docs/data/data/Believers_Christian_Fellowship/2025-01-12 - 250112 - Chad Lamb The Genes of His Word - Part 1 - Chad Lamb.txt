and he's got three girls so far amen it's wonderful the way God works I think it I think that's just the way it is amen praise God H it's good for you isn't it Jackson he grew up in testosterone and now he's got something different in life amen it's wonderful God's bless him with three beautiful girls amen uh while we're standing let's turn to the Book of Matthew Chapter 13 together I want to remind you that brother Stan price will be here Lord willing this Wednesday to minister for us and brother Stan's a pastor down in uh in Florida it's nvar Florida near Fort Walton Beach been a pastor there for a little while so we're looking forward to having him join us uh also uh want to remind you brother Gabe Smith is out I I heard the prayer for him we want to remember him he's got two services today he and his family are together they'll be traveling back uh this evening so we want to pray for them also wanted to thank all the brothers who helped clean up the snow and the walkways and all that during the service last Wednesday we weren't really getting we weren't really expected to get what we got and so some of the deacons and trustees and even some of the younger Brothers had to slip out help clear the driveway or the the sidewalks and salt and so we just want to say God bless you we appreciate you for doing that for us amen amen let's look at Matthew 13: 24 together Matthew chap 13: 24 another Parable put he forth unto them saying the Kingdom of Heaven is lik UN to a man which SED a good seed in his field but while men slept his enemy came and swed tears among the wheat and went his way but when the blade was sprung up and brought forth fruit then appeared the tears also so the so the Servants of the householder came and said unto him sir this not thou so good seed in thy field from whence then haveth it tears he said unto them an enemy has done this the servants the servants said unto him wilt thou then that we go and gather them up but he said nay lest while you gather up the tears you root up also the wheat with them let both grow together until the Harvest and in the time of harvest I will say to the Reapers Gather ye together first the tears and bind them in bundles to burn them but gather the wheat into the barn further down in verse 37 he gives the interpretation of this uh Parable he says in verse 37 he answered and said unto them he that Seth The Good Seed is the son of man the field is the world the good seed are the children of of the Kingdom but the tears are the children of the wicked one the enemy that SED them is the devil the Harvest is the end of the world and the reapers are the Angels amen may God add his Blessing to the word as you can be seated keep your Bibles open we're going to flip over to another verse so we know this Parable really well and the in the parable he begins to talk about a man sowed seed but there come up a a diverse crop amen and there was two seeds seeds that were swn and he tells us here the interpretation he that sowed the good seed or what would be the wheat is the son of man the field is the world the seed are the children of the Kingdom but the tears are the children of the wicked one and Satan swed them so we we know this is a picture of the world of the earth that we live in and the in the uh sewing of the mixed seed that took place all the way back in Genesis and so that's one aspect of the seed that we want to look at but if we go over to Luke chapter 8 let's turn together to Luke chapter 8 in Luke chapter [Music] 8 uh verse 4 Luke chapter 8 verse4 and when much people were gathered together and were come to him out of every city spake a parable a swer went out to sew his seed and as he sowed some fell by the wayside and it was trotten down and the fowls of the air devoured it and some fell upon the rock and as soon as it was sprung up it withered away because it lacked moisture and some fell among the thorns and the Thorns sprang up with it and choked it and others fell on good ground and sprang up and bare fruit H 100 fold then he goes down to give the interpretation of this in verse 11 he says now the parable is this the seed is the word of God on so we've looked at two Parables and in the two Parables amen Jesus uses seed in two different ways in the first Parable he SWS the seed and the one who SWS The Good Seed or the wheat is the is the son of man the one who SWS The Bad Seed or the tears is is the devil they're of the wicked one one are children of God some are the wicked one and so he's using the seed to speak of people that were swn into the Earth then the second Parable the seed is the word of God so as the word of God goes and it falls in different kinds of soil four categories of soil the thorny places the byways and all of this amen but some fell in good ground and the good ground now is the people the good ground now are the children of God Amen so the question is are you a seed or are you good ground and the answer we know is yes amen that's always the way it is God's always using these Parables to teach a a lesson and he wants us to catch a spiritual lesson so but I want to look at this uh this subject of seed today for a little bit and my my title comes out of this uh quote and I'm going to read you the quote out of God's only provided place of worship says he had in his heart before the foundation of the world a son because he is a father but it was still in the genes of his word still in the genes of his word and he created a man and he had to put him on free moral agency but the man fell but the great sculptor God who made man from the dust of the earth he did didn't settle for that he started making man again and he talk talking about the process coming back from through the prophets from Noah to Moses and he's looking for this man he's trying to rebuild Amen to a Son of God because that's what he had in his mind from the beginning he wanted a Son of God to inherit all of creation and he want his family to be upon the Earth but he says I'm going to go back to this first sentence he had in his heart before the foundation World a son because he is a father but it was still in the genes of his word and I started looking at this statement and it really started to it really started to to mle over in my mind so the title is the uh the genes of his word the genes of his word and I just want to look at that amen because uh so when we look back at the the the the parable of the seed either way we look at it whether the seed is the people or the seed is the word falling into the good ground which are people the seed contains within it the genetics amen this is where the word Gene comes from amen and I think it's so interesting that brother Brenham finished his ministry in 1965 focused on the C Gene he didn't really talk about it before and we know that the that the message is building to something all along it's building it's building it's building and bringing us greater Revelation and more clarity all the time and we know that the prophet is getting greater Revelation and more clarity all the time and he comes to this time amen when when when really there was things going on in the natural world in the scientific world and in the message countdown brother benam tells us that God allows man amen man's achievements to go ahead to show what God's achievements are so he talks about the the age of the automobile going from horse and buggy to automobile amen because we were going to be moving into another Revival and then going into the airplane phase and he he discusses all this at countdown because the airplane amen the wri brothers flew their airplane and took to the air man took to the air amen just before the Pentecostal Revival broke out and isza street so he's showing this achievement in science showing what God's going to achieve spiritually and then brother B says now we're to the astronaut age they're going to they're going to shoot a man outside the atmosphere he's going to go outside the atmosphere of the Earth showing that there's going to be people that are going to be able to lift up out the atmosphere of this Earth beyond the gravitational hole beyond all the laws that have bound us so far Amen in this age there's going to be a people that shoot up through a great power amen and get outside the atmosphere of the earth praise be to God Amen and so he's teaching us this this principle but things began to be discussed around the time that brother bam was here and they just started into this idea of genetics this whole science of genetics starts in and in studying the Gene and Gene mapping and and discovery of DNA and how chromosomes come together and make DNA DNA and how Jo genes work and it was just an infancy there we've seen an explosion of that understanding since that time and brother manham is able to pick up on terminology amen that you wouldn't think a seventh grade educated hillbilly preacher we start talking about something that was just a new scientific discovery but he's recognizing the new scientific ground is showing that God's bringing us into a greater understanding of who we really are Hallelujah and in 1965 he really it becomes the year of the SE Gene I mean that's just me saying that I I don't I'm not trying to label anything but but that's when he really starts to lay this down and talk about the seed Gene the gene of God a spiritual seed and all of these things and so there's such a there's such a powerful truth laying in here that we want to see amen so we know that when that seed went into the ground in the first Parable amen the the the son of man SED good seed and then a wicked one seed another seed we know that in the process of time under the certain conditions that there's genetics inside of those seeds and the genetics within those seeds amen when they get in the right condition they're going to reproduce whatever whatever is embedded in the genes of that seed is what it's going to manifest yeah right so be the wheat seed or the what he calls The Good Seed it begins to manifest what's already on the inside of it amen as it comes through the growing season or through the growing condition but also the tears which he calls The Bad Seed or the children of the wicked one amen they're going to under the same growing condition they're going to manifest what's inside of them amen they they can't change what they are oh praise God this is what this is what the whole understanding of genes is all about they were all already pre-programmed in their DNA those little seeds they couldn't change what they were it was already inside of them this is amazing I I I just looked up jeans uh for a moment I mean on the internet just to get some sort of definition and there's all kinds of information but it it it this the expression it's in your jeans means that a person has an inherit certain traits or characteristics from their parents and we know that brother M discusses that we were all aware of that amen that the the genetics we have come from our parents and so that's why family strains tend to look alike they have certain characteristics that are similar and and you can all you can name a family name and say that's just this family that's just ABC family and everybody knows what you're talking about because ABC family you know they all go to bed early they all get up early and they all tuck their shirts in and they all do this then you say that's XYZ family and XYZ family never on time and they don't and it seems to affect the whole family because you know one group's fun the other's not fun and so one family gets invited to work days the other F to get to parties so so we put them together so we can all you know enjoy each other but there's just certain characteristics you know and we know you know you know it's not fixed we know that there's variables and there's all kinds of ingredients that come down through grandparents and all that and because you can have ABC family that gets an XYZ planted right in the middle and God does that on purpose because that's what we need amen but the reality is those things come through the genetics right I I told you years ago I think I I I think I shared this with you years ago uh I read a book and the book was on the I'm sorry I can't remember the exact I think it was called the Minnesota project I think that's what it was and in the Minnesota project what they did is they they and the reason I did it is because of what brother BM said about jeans so I went to the Lo local library now listen we used to not look up Google I mean we used to actually go to the library right and when I first started doing this as a kid we we actually would pull out index cards out of the library on a certain sub I mean we didn't even have a search program on the computer I don't know how we made it in life I don't know how we know anything how is it we know anything it was a lot harder back then so when I would study things out in the message it was in the library I used to go to the library all the time so I went to the library and I was studying genes and genetics and all of that and I come across this book that was fascinating and I'm I'm pretty sure it was it was I don't know if was titled the Minnesota project but it was discussing the findings of the Minnesota project and it was about twins and what they had done is they found a whole series of twins that have been separated at Birth and adopted into separate families and they were identical twins and they had been and they grew up in different environments they grew up uh in different uh uh uh with different kinds of parents uh situations uh financially they raised in different uh classes they were they were they they and started putting them together and studying them so they would find them through birth records and they would put them together and the interesting thing in the Minnesota project was that no matter how they grew up when they put them together they acted just the same one child would go to an I mean if I mean you could probably find it on Google Now in 30 seconds and they probably got a YouTube video that explains everything in 10 minutes what I had to read a whole book to get but it's interesting because there was even times that these twins were given the same name by their adopted families they were G separated as infants they were given the same name there was two in particular I remember they both got the name James one was James the other was James they GRE up they both became firefighters they both married a woman and the first woman they married they had the same name I can't remember her name and they both had a dog and they named the dog the same name it's crazy there was two two women in the UK that had been separated but they found them together and they brought them back together when they brought them back together they styled their hair the same way they like the same kind of clothing they made the same choices in clothing and they both had they they held their finger out with a little Crook in it when they drank and they both noticed it across the table when they met for the first time so they realized uh and the the whole premise of the book was what affects you more genetics or environment that was the whole premise of the book and what they found out is the most powerful influence in your life is genetics it's not that environment doesn't have one and the the really evil Wicked kind of environment can actually taint the genetics it can actually do do some destruction but just in the normal process of normal life the strongest power on you is genetics the reason you are the way you are you react the way you act many times the strongest pull on that is genetics amen and so when we bring it now into the message the strongest pull on us is the genetics of God that's why a seed had to be planted in us there had to be something more powerful than a natural Earthly life there had to be something more powerful than our willpower and our ability sometime down the road to make the right choice amen God wasn't going to base it on this natural life and this Natural Choice and this natural willpower of a natural mind to do natural things amen but he embedded part of his genetics inside cuz he knew the most powerful force would be genetics we know this in life and that's why they that's why they use genetics and study genetics to get better crops and bigger cattle and all these other things because they know the most powerful voice is genetics praise be to God Gene genes are segments of DNA is what it says which is a a biological blueprint for proteins that form the building blocks of the the cell so you're made up the way you're constructed the way you're built is because of your jeans right the color hair you have the color eyes you have the stature that you grow to many things are are are affected by your jeans and when we go back to the two firefighters named James they both struggled with weight when they met one was about 40 or 50 pounds lighter than the other but only because he worked super hard to do it it didn't come natural for him it was very difficult so there are factors that you can there are factors amen that works together with genetics and they environmental factors and choices you make but the underlying power is genes God Amen brother B says uh in the message modern events made clear by prophecy he said but the real ordained of God that real Gene that real germ a soul of God that was in God before the foundation of the world remember you that's really got the spirit of God in you tonight you were here in Christ because he was the fullness of the word amen that real germ that soul of God that was in God before the foundation of the world what kind of genes are in that God's jeans and things that are to be says now the next thing you receive was the baptism of the Holy Ghost and Fire now God when this Millennium is over God is going to give the world a baptism of fire it's going to blow the whole thing up the heavens and earth will be on fire Peter said so and the thing will have a baptism of fire renovation of the whole thing and then there'll be a new heavens and new earth that's when that's when where where dwelleth righteousness that's where we are that's where we are amen if we've had the baptism of fire that's where we are amen the new heavens and new earth amen we have become from Mortal beings from time beings to eternal beings when the word of God lit our souls and we became Sons and Daughters of God with the attributes the gene of God in us to be Sons and Daughters of the father God in heaven crying Abba Father so now we find out that we come to this life with a gene embedded in our soul amen those who are the predestinated elect of God they have the genetics of God embedded in their soul amen and a certain time God will send the fire of the Holy Ghost Amen to spark off or light up or or or or bring life or Quicken these are all terms that we use amen this Gene of God this genetics of God that's embedded there to bring it to life to it starts to multiply and starts to work in our lives amen and many times God will use the word to do that and so now we know that the seed that was sown are the children of God but then the seed that was swn was the word of God because the word of God is also part of God amen amen what is that c Gene inside of you part of God what is it it's the word absolutely it's the thought Express it's the word amen what is the word the word is God what is it it's a it's a part of God's thinking it's a part of God's expression it's a part of God and so when that word comes into you what is it amen it's it's part of God it has genetics inside of it amen the true word of God has the gene of God with it that's why it's a seed amen that can fall into ground and that seed when it falls into the wrong soil will never germinate and produce because it takes a certain EnV enironment it takes a certain uh it takes a certain set of of of happenings amen for that thing to germinate and take off if it falls into the Stony ground it it it doesn't work it sprouts up and then it's plucked away when it falls into the Thorns when it falls into the byway but but where that seed begins to grow and reproduce itself is when it falls into the good ground cu the good ground is a match for the seed and the seed is a match for the good ground nothing else is a match so what is in that seed the genes of God so that's why that seed brother REM says in power of transformation or power to transform me he preaches it a couple times under different titles he said the power is already in the seed to transform itself into whatever the life of the seed is it's already there amen so when your parents came together to form you there was 23 chromosomes that came from your father and 23 chromosomes that came from your mother they came together and bound themselves together in what is a DNA strand that DNA strand became the book of your life it has all the information of your life is coded and written when those chromosomes came together all the information that would make up you your body your stature your height your temperament your eye color your hair color your your everything else when it came together there and listen not one bit more information was added cuz it was all there it's just been the rest of your life unfolding what's already there amen it's there it's just unfolding what's already there amen and so when this first quote that I went to to get my title when brother venam was saying uh uh that God had in his mind a son from before the foundation of the world it was in the genes of his word that means it's already in his word amen all it needs is that word needs to fall into the right soil at the right time amen the right season of growth under the right conditions with the right moisture and the right light and the right everything and when that seed falls into the right conditions at the right time it'll produce what's already in the seed amen it was already in God's mind it was already in God's mind when he spoke it when he spoke the word the power was already there for it to transform itself into what it already was when he said through Isaiah 700 years before Mary was here he said a virgin shall conceive inside that word is the power to reproduce himself it contains the very thought the very Gene of God to transform itself into what it is it just has to fall into the right good ground at the right season amen and the right growing condition when God determined because every seed has its season remember brother man taught us you don't plant wheat the same time you plant your corn everything has a season and it matures at a certain rate and it's harvested in a certain way and there's certain characteristics to every seed and so is the word of God when the word of God Amen when he speaks his word that seed has a certain time to come forth under a certain growing condition and when all the conditions are met the power is already in the seed amen amen so what do we need brother Chad we need to be a seed am right guess what you can't control that you can't you have no control over that that's something God determined before the foundation of the world Amen and you also need to receive a seed because these two things need to come together because the seed children of God are the good ground where the seed word of God is going to produce itself so these two things must come together in the message things that are to be he says now the next thing you receive was the baptism of the Holy Ghost in fire oh I already read that sorry God's only provided place of worship The Headstone crying what Grace Grace pass from death and Creed into the Living Word of the Living God God's only provided plan for his age his sons in the word age what age are we living in the word age his sons in the word age quickened by the spirit like a spark that's lit off of something to make it alive and seated now in Heavenly places in present tense already alive and subject to every promise in the word Amen brother B tells us that that you and I with the the portion of God that's planted in our souls you and I could never have come forth in any other age that's what he told us because we were predestinated to come forth in a certain age in a certain season amen so God Amen planted certain genetics in us that would only come into manifestation in a certain season and what season would that be it would be this season the word age the end time the Harvest Time the bride age the free age the abrahamic age everything brother B the astronaut age everything that he labels it at he's showing us we're in a specific time we're in something that's an amazing we're an amazing period of time and in that amazing period of time he planted seeds before the foundation of the world that he knew would grow in this time and it would take a certain environment a certain place for the seed inside of you to grow God and it could only respond and this is what brother said it could only respond to the water and things for that age so it couldn't respond the seed that was in US couldn't respond until we found the matching growing season yeah that's why we went to churches and there was something inside of us brother bam said that little seed was was there and it was somehow working in the background now don't ask me to understand this I don't understand it but it's absolutely the truth because there was a spiritual life already planted down in there though it had to be quick and it wasn't dead amen because eternal life doesn't die it's a portion of eternal life but it was dormant somehow and inactive in some way amen but brother Brenham said you remember you would go to church and church you were looking for something and and others could do something you couldn't do he said that was that little spark of life down in you then but yet it wasn't alive it wasn't active it wasn't ruling your life yet amen but he says then you and he has different ways of explain but you went from this to that to the Methodist to the Methodist and and what was it there was something inside of you there was a craving amen and nothing would meet the craving amen but then you heard the eagle scream and then you realized whatever that was screaming is the same thing that's inside of me amen you know it wasn't it wasn't the eagle we know the story The Eagle in the chicken yard it wasn't that the eagle had to go look in a mirror and look up it wasn't that the eagle had to look at its wings when it heard the scream it it hits something on the inside of the eagle and the eagle recognized the scream right amen and was motivated to leave the chicken yard that was that little germ of life in us then am moving or wanting to move wanting to express but it had to be a certain season and the only kind of rain the only kind of water the only kind of light amen is the message of the hour Amen to bring it to life and to cause it to grow to form manifestation so when we come in contact with the life for this hour which is the Life of Christ the word the message amen when that life light word hit our life yeah quickened it amen like a spark that's lit off of something in the Rapture message brother man said the very Word Church all of these I'm quoting from her from 1965 the very Word Church means called out of as Moses called a nation out of a Nation the holy spirit is called a bride out of a church a church out of a church members from every denomination making up a bride tree it's in the tape the bride tree a bride coming out call and that's the one that the bride tree is the bride rather is the one that's going to be in the Rapture that alone nothing but the bride the elected ones forn by God from the beginning the fathers spiritual genes oh I want to be the father's spiritual Gene why do I want to be that amen I want to be that because without that there's no way I can express what he wants me to express yeah because I can only express the genetics that are inside of me amen amen and and show us the father and it will suffice us from 1962 brother BR says what does the seed do look at a little little apple tree out out here you people raise a lot of apples look a little apple tree when it's no more than that we call in the East a sprig a little tree about like that do you know that every Apple that will ever be on that tree is in it right then amen if it isn't where did it come from where did it come from and that apple tree that's going to produce you hundreds of bushels of apples where did they come from when you set that little plant out about like that just out of an apple seed and it's a set out there and every Apple that'll ever be on there it's got in it then potentially hundreds of bushels of apples that you'll collect off of it and it ain't a half an inch high so he's talking about a little sprig that just come out of the ground yeah there you are where does it come from it's in the Apple then and when you are planted into his death burial and Resurrection planted in Christ and receive his holy holy spirit life in you everything that you've got need of all the way through the Journey is in you right then for you become the seed yeah amen it was already planted now listen I don't want you to get confused it can be confusing following Brother Brenham through because sometimes when you lead early in his ministry amen he tells you you become a son or daughter of God you become a seed when the Holy Ghost comes into you but when he gets to the end of his ministry he doesn't say that he said you always were a Son of God you just didn't recognize it until the Holy Spirit awakened you awakened that life that was already in you so we got to follow the message through amen so that we find out so that we grow as the Revelation grows amen because at the end of his ministry he was trying to bring us to a greater understanding not a denominational understanding but a true understanding that that God planted his life in your soul before the foundation of the world because he had a purpose and a plan in doing so and he knew it was the only Power that would produce what he wanted to produ amen but that seed was waiting to come in contact with another seed another life another part of God and when those two parts of God come together it quickened amen amen so now at receiving the Holy Spirit life in you everything you have need of all along the way through the Journey is in you right then for you become the seed when brother man talks about that little apple you take a little apple seed and you lay that apple seed down on the table and you explain that to somebody what is that apple seed that is 5,000 bushels of apples yeah right like no way that's an apple tree with 5,000 bushels of apples yeah you could take it crush it yeah slice it open look at it under a microscope you can't find the bushels you can't find the bark you can't find the leaves you can't find anything but it's there amen amen when you come on this life what was in you a son and daughter of God was in you but you could slice it dice it open and inspect it and you couldn't see it right amen and sometimes as we're growing even when we become mom you plant that little seed so say you believe me at first you may not believe me you do scientific experiments and slice it open and look under Amen in every which way and you can't see anything that I'm telling you there's nothing that I'm telling you that looks like the truth when you look at that little black seat but say you trust me and you put it in the ground and it comes out then all of a sudden it comes out this little spendly thing there's no apples on it there's no bushels there's no nothing you can just pluck it up and say he's a liar and throw it away yeah that's right cuz he told me that that's an apple tree and if I plan it I'll get an apple tree and I'll get 5,000 bushels 10,000 bushels or whatever no you got to let the thing grow amen you got to let it grow because an apple tree's inside and mean when that little sprig comes out that's green and tender and barely amen looks like almost almost like a little whatever other any other plant that's out there any other weed amen it comes up it doesn't look like an apple tree with a potential for 10,000 bushels but you got to believe it's there amen you got to let it grow and when it grows it's got the potential inside of it for all of that amen and if it wasn't there it'll never be that yeah but if it's there it's got the potential to be all of that if you let it grow and watch over it as grow and over time it'll develop and it'll put out Limbs and it'll become an apple tree and if you give it time it'll Bloom and if you give it time it'll bear apples amen and you go out to the first season when you begin to Bear apples and you go and you collect all your apples off of this apple tree and you got one bushel he said that man lied to me he told me that was an apple tree with 5,000 bushels that'll produce 5,000 bushels but the first growing season only gives you a bushel a bushel and a half see you got to let the thing grow to its full potential amen amen he said now in the message the stature of a perfect man he said it's like a sycamore tree trying to manufacture apples it couldn't do it see although it's a tree but it can't manufacture apples right it's like a church member trying to be part of the Bride although it's a church member to be bride you have to have the genes of bride sycamore tree is a tree it'll grow it'll have bark it'll produce leaves it'll suck up water it'll do so many things that the apple tree does but it can never be an apple tree right because apple tree genetics aren't in the sycamore tree it says it's a tree but it can't manufacture apples it's like a mule trying to manufacture wool trying to be a sheep he's a mule you see he can't manufacture wool he can't do it wool is a gift to a sheep not to a mule he might try to act like a sheep but he's still a mule so he says well I can eat like a sheep I can do this like this sheep and no matter what you can do you've got to be a sheep in order to have wool why because of gen gentics again in Statue of a perfect man he says and let me stop here a minute the Sheep doesn't manufacture wool he has wool because he's a sheep a lot of people try to say well I'll try to get good I'll try to do this don't manufacture nothing no you can't do it a sheep doesn't isn't asked isn't expected to manufacture wool it Bears wool and it doesn't because it's a sheep and when you're a Christian you just bear the fruit of the spirit you don't manufacture it you don't try to make it up don't make yourself something that you're not you just become what you're supposed to be and then it takes care of itself have you heard people say well I tell you I joined a church I really ought to quit this lying you're trying to manufacture something again now you can't do it so there's no need of trying to no more than a mule can make himself have wool can't do it why because a mule has mule genetics and a sheep has sheep genetics amen an apple tree has Apple Tree genetics a syore tree has sycamore tree genetics in the message El Shai from 1960 says what is sin unbelief so when you kill all unbelief why you know that's God's word right then that that he's the same yesterday and forever so all the promises are yours walk through the land it's all yours it belongs to you just enjoy it it's yours God gave it to you the grace of God give it to you it's all yours when the sin question is over you receive the Holy Ghost everything you have need of in life's journey is right there in the Bible for you everything you have need of so when you've received the Holy Ghost and that spark uh the spark is lit and and and the the life of God is embedded in there has come to life and listen everything you have need of in life's journey is there it's already there and everything you'll do for the Lord is there right amen it's programmed in there the fruits of the spirit are programmed in there it's not something that we take and pasted on ourselves amen it's something that has to be a natural flow if it's not a natural outflow then it hasn't come right yet amen amen you can take an apple tree and before it Bears apples it's an apple tree it's ordained to Bear apples but he may get amen may maybe get a little insecure about not bearing apples yet and then he's in the Orchard and everybody else is bearing apples so he can try to you know take some fishing wire and hang some apples off himself so he looks like an apple tree hey that's not going to cut it friends what is that apple tree need to do he needs to have faith in the genetics that's inside of him and in due time the apples will come out amen we don't have to get ahead of the program friends don't feel pressured to be anything that you're not just relax and Trust TR God Amen because if you're a child of God the life of God is going to come out it'll come out amen but when we try to manufacture what we do is we stun our own growth because we get all twisted up inside and we're trying to be something that we're not and actually the best way for things to be produced in our life is for us to actually relax relax and trust God and let the natural process of the spiritual genetics begin to work in our lives that's right so that little poor little apple tree sitting there with all these little apples hanging on his limbs everybody knows he didn't Bloom you have to bloom before you get out I mean and the and the apple trees that have been around for a while they're looking at him and they're going oh poor poor guy I remember when I taped apples to my we've all lived the same kind of Life friends and they don't condemn him because he tied a few apples in the night to his limbs because we all tied a few apples to our limbs when to look like everybody else so we heard some phrases so we just repeated them and when we got in the next Fellowship we didn't even really know what they meant but it sounded really good and everybody got excited when this brother said it so I'll say it I love when the devil's exposed amen and there's an insecurity because he hasn't bore app yet and the question is am I really an apple tree am I really an apple I don't have any apples am I really an apple tree oh praise God that's where we have to know the experience we had with God Amen that God tells us who we are not anybody else that and we don't even have to wait till we see signs of it amen Mary went out confessing that she was bearing CED the Christ child before she felt one thing cuz she believed the angels message to her amen and when we come in contact with the Living God through this message amen and we're awakened to who we really are we have to believe it amen and believe that whatever God planted in me to believe this word I believe it I believe I'm part of this I believe I'm a Child of God I believe this message is for me that God called me to be his bride if I don't have apples yet I will have Apples because he predestinated me to bear fruit there'll be apples on my tree but I'm not going to fake it I'm not going to tie on apples yeah and no matter how insecure I feel and listen friends if you're the only one in the orchard without apples you're going to feel a little insecure but you got to keep going back to the truth that's on the inside and Trust the process let's go to Matthew 28 I want to read a couple scriptures here in Matthew and then in John Matthew 28 brother B told us that the Holy Ghost is the power to make the word live so it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost that actually quickens the life that's inside of us and it keeps drawing the life out of us amen it quickens the word it makes the word live so what was it that was in you from before the foundation world it was the word so what makes the word live the Holy Ghost ghost yeah so when you Reed the baptism of the Holy Ghost what did it do it woke you up to who you really are it gave you Faith to believe that you're a son or daughter of God it changed you your thinking your outlook on life the direction you're traveling in it changed you amen and you recognized who you were amen and then then that Holy Ghost is still the power that brings the word to pass amen what word the word that's embedded in your soul Matthew 28:18 28 and 18 says and Jesus came and spake unto them saying all power is given unto me in heaven and in Earth go ye therefore and teach All Nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you and lo I Am With You Always even to the end of the world I love this scripture and the reason I love this scripture is he says you go do this right you know what he told them to do was like really hard he said go therefore and teach All Nations how are these fishermen with no Financial backing with no education might not know any other languages how are these people going to go teach All Nations like sometimes the the the expectation is so high but he finishes it up with now lo I am with you always you're not going to do this by yourself you're not going to do this without my power you're going to do it you're ordained to do it he says I've ordained you amen that you'll go and bring forth fruit and your fruit shall remain they were ordained it was in their spiritual genetics to go and take the message of Calvary and spread it over the world it was already in them and he told them to go do it he spoke the word over them but he says you're not going to do it by your own power you're not going to do it by yourself but lo I Am With You Always even to the end of the world don't worry there's a power to make the word embedded in your life live and that is the power of Christ Living inside of us it's the power to make the word live and so God has already put it inside of us in our genetics and the spirit of God is here to draw it out of us and make the word that's in us live yeah so go bear fruit right that's what you're supposed to do yeah go bear fruit that's a commandment to you go bear the life go bear the fruit go live the life of Christ but you're not going to do it by yourself don't forget he's with you amen amen let's go to John 14 John 14 and John 14 I'd like to read from Verse 18 says I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you amen let's go to verse 20 at that day you shall know that I am in my father and ye in me and I in you let's go to verse 23 and Jesus answered and said unto him if any man love me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our Abode with him where is the power that makes the word live it's in me so my brother said when you receed the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you were quick anded like a spark lit up of something everything you have need of is in you for the journey from then on Amen because he already programmed you through the spiritual genetics to do the work for this age amen and then he supplied the power to bring that program to life amen amen let's go to 1 John 4:4 there's some things that I find to be so helpful to me some understandings that the prophet of God gave us for this age that we live in because if we if we don't understand certain things about ourselves then we have a hard time correlating the things that he told us with the realities that we see so we're the sinless Spotless virtuous bride of Jesus Christ amen we we are we are Christ on Earth we're here to manifest the full nature of Christ but yet we still live in sticky caer nature have flesh and he says it it'll trip you up and so it's so good to understand the way that we live and 1 John 4 I want to read verse 4 he said you of God little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world Amen think about that ye are of God little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world what were they overcoming they were overcoming the Antichrist spirit and how are they overcoming the Antichrist spirit that was in the world because greater is he that was in them than he that was in the world Amen that's how they were to overcome amen let's go to Romans chapter 7 together Romans chap 7: 21 Paul says in 7:21 I find then a law that when I would do good evil is present with me for I Delight in the law of God after the inward man but I see another law in my members Waring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members oh Wretched Man that I am who shall deliver me from this body of this death I thank God through Jesus Christ Our Lord so then with the mind I myself serve the Lord law of God but with the flesh the law of sin so the Apostle Paul is explaining to us that this this body of flesh is a body of death right brother brandham i' I've read this the last two times I preached this quote in the message and knoweth it not when he starts to talk about the outside man and the senses of the man see taste feel smell here he says now that is the evil one on the outside so the question is where is the world greater is he that is in you than he that's in the world Amen maybe the influences the world maybe the evil one like brother M said the evil one is the one on the outside amen and that's the one that must be overcome that's the battle that must be fought because the Battle Ground is now in the mind of man and we know amen we come into this condition because of hybridization in the beginning and and there was a blending of man and animal and it Mex messed up the whole thing and now the evil one is the outside and I'm going to explain that uh hopefully here in a couple scriptures but I want to read this quote First this is from 1964 out of questions and answers says somebody told me he had one time was converted receiv received the Holy Ghost and I said to him how you getting along and this is to the Indian friend that he had he said pretty good and pretty bad this is the Indian he called Chief this is after he received the Holy Ghost he said pretty good and pretty bad I said well how do you mean pretty good pretty bad and pretty good he said well since me received the Holy Ghost he said there's been two dogs in me and one of them black dog and one of them white dog so they argue all the time they growl and fight at one another and said the white dog wants me to do good and the black dog wants me to do bad said well Chief which one of them wins the fight he said that depends on which one Chief feeds the most so I think that's a good answer here see there just depends on the Waring of the body that's in you it depends on which one you cater to which nature you cater to the carnal nature after the things of the world or the spiritual nature after the things of God that does it I'm so thankful that that's in the message yeah amen I don't know you but I'm so thankful that's in the message because we've been born again we've been made new new creatures in Christ Jesus all things are passed away All Things become new but yet I'm struggling with things that I don't want to struggle with I'm I'm fighting against and resisting thoughts and feelings and emotions and things that want to take me the wrong way and there's a sticky over nature brother said that'll always bother you amen and the outside man is the evil one right but don't forget greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world amen amen why what Spirit do we have brother benam said that human Spirit you have is a natural Spirit a spirit of the world it's a worldly spirit it's a spirit that was given to you to interact with the world he said it didn't come from God but God permitted it is that what he said and when you die it'll go and be no more so where is it where is it it's in the outer man yeah right amen and so when we start to think about this scripture greater is he that is in you than he that's in the world I say praise God greater is he that is in my soul than he that even were the spirit of the world that I have even in the flesh that I got through hybridization even in even in this uh uh uh evil one that I dwell in inside of he that is in me is greater than the outside man uh let's go to 1 Corinthians chapter 9 1 Corinthians chapter 9 I'm going to begin reading from verse 24 this the Apostle Paul now he says know you not that they which run in a race run all but one receiveth the prize so run that you may obtain and every man that striveth for the Mastery is tempered in all things now they do it to obtain a corruptible Crown but we an Incorruptible I therefore so run not as un certain so fight I not as one that beateth the air but I keep under my body and bring it into subjection lest that by any means when I have preached to others I myself should be a Cast Away Paul I think recognized the fight yeah and I think he recognized where the fight was and I think he recognized where his enemy was and I think he recognized what he needed to do to overcome he needed to be diligent he needed to be in training he did he just couldn't let this body do whatever this body wanted to do he couldn't let this mind do whatever this mind wanted to do but in order to get Mastery he had to be temperate or have self-control in all things and he had to bring his body into subjection amen amen because that's where the enemy is and that's what brother Brenham says that's what he shows us in this little Parable he tells about Chief when Chief has the Holy Ghost now there's two dogs fighting inside of him a white dog and a black dog one wants to do do good one wants to do bad and he said which one wins the fight he said the one that I feed the most brother R said that's the way it is in the world Amen the one the nature we cater to to the most and this is what Paul's showing us that if we want Mastery if we want to win the race and win the prize amen we've got to be temperate in all things and we've got to bring this body in this message in this verse verse 27 he said I keep under my body that means to bruise or to beat Black and Blue yeah so Hey listen that body you dwell in is not your friend he ain't your buddy right and the things he wants aren't good for you and the things he tries to convince you are true will destroy you amen the enem is closer than we think right let's go back to First John and I want to take a look at this and I hope this helps 1 John chapter 2 first John chapter 2 verse 15 says love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man loved the world the love of the father is not in him so he told us not to love the world but look at what he says in verse 16 for all that is in the world so now we're going to find out what's in the world what's the world and what's in the world the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes the pride of life those are all things that are in my outside man but those are the things that's in the world but the things that are in the world are the things that I struggle with in my outside man the lust of the eyes the lust of the Flesh and the pride of life all have to do with the outside man yeah so he talks about the world he's not talking about out there I mean go down the street and you go to this side corner and over there's the world stay away from the world right but all that is in the world is the lust of the eyes the lust of the Flesh and the pride of life where do I struggle with that what address do I drive to where I struggle with the lust of the eyes the lust of us the pride of life what evil Place do I drive my car to park and go inside of that I struggle with this I struggle with that right here here in the evil one that I dwell in so the world is not as far away as you think so don't love the world or the things that are in the world but greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world amen amen let's go to Galatians 5 I know we're flipping back and forth but it's fun this is our Bible amen this is our sword this is this is our strength this is what gives us life in this Bible is everything we have need of to overcome in this journey because it's the word and it can all be quickened by the spirit Galatians chapter 5 verse 16 it says this I say then walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh for the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the Flesh and these are contrary the one to the other so that you cannot do the things that you would but if you be led of the spirit you are not under the law I say praise be to God what do I need to do to have victory over this evil one is to walk in the spirit amen when you read that the flesh lust is against the spirit and the spirit is against the flesh that's what Chief was describing yeah with his two dogs amen analogy that's what Paul was talking about when he has to be temper WR keep after this body that's what he's talking about amen and so we know that the that the victory is in the spiritual walk the victory is in the inside man cuz what is the walking in the spirit what is where is the spirit amen it's in the Inside Man where is overcoming it's in the inside where is everything you have need of for this journey inside where's the greater one that's greater than the world inside where's he at inside but I have to walk a spiritual life so that what's inside can dominate what's outside amen let's go uh uh where let's go to Ephesians Ephesians chapter 3 Ephesians chapter 3:14 says for this cause I bow my knees unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in Heaven and Earth is named that he would Grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the Inner Man so how are we going to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the Inner Man where's my strength going to come from by my spiritual life in the inner man that Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith that you being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with All Saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height and to know the love of chist Christ which passes knowledge that you might be filled with all the fullness of God now unto him that is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that worketh in us not on us yeah in us not to us right in US greater is he that is in you why because before the foundation of the world he planted a seed of himself self am Amen in in due time he sent the water of the word the light of the hour the spirit of God to come and Quicken that to life and now I can be strengthened by strengthened the Inner Man by the spirit and now unto him that is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that worketh in US amen unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages World Without End amen amen amen what do we what do we say all this for what are we going in all this for because greater is he that's in you that's he in the world amen amen whatever you're struggling with whatever you're going through whatever you need there's something in you already to overcome that why because it's programmed into the genetics of God right amen but when we get in the struggle sometimes we go to the wrong places I mean sometimes we want Google to answer the question listen I'm not condemning you I want quick answers too I Google everything if I want to know how many teaspoons are in a cup I'm not going to right but that's the world and that can't give me strength and that can't answer my questions and that can't solve my problems amen but there's already something embedded in meise God Amen and it it's it's a it's a gene let's call it a gene a gene is just a certain segment of the DNA and that Gene has the information to do whatever kind of function or work that it needs to do in your body amen there's genes that actually uh control how many white blood cells you make there's genes that have to do with your immune system there's genes that that actually replicate that and build those proteins so that when your body gets in need of something this Gene activates and that that Gene activates and when it activates it brings all the materials together amen it rolls together a protein it sends it down to become a white blood cell and that white blood cell goes out to fight the infection that's in your body amen it all happens automatically and how much do you think about it yeah yeah unless you have an autoimmune disease you don't ever think about it right yeah amen and it's happening because it's already in your genes it's already there when there was a need in your body there's already something in the program to meet the need yeah amen and the same thing's true spiritually you God put a portion of himself amen that portion he put of himself contains everything we need to manifest his ordained purpose in our life and when we come against obstacles what we need is inside of us amen and we might need to hear the word preach Amen to unlock what's inside of us we may need to have amen an understanding I don't know how I mean it comes in many different ways but the reality is it's not the words from the preacher that does it it's the words that the preacher that may awaken what's in you but the overcoming comes when you're strengthened with might in the Inner [Applause] Man and he overcomes in you with his mighty power in you yeah that's why we can't go to everybody else to be delivered we can't go to everybody else for all the answers there are gifts in the body there are people that you come to that'll give Godly counsel but that counsel is always by the word the word is always there to trigger something inside of you that says that's nothing but the truth and the spirit of God goes to act upon that and bring that out of you and bring it to life amen it's not what somebody else did for you it's what God did in you right and that's why it's it's so important that we stay focused on the inner man because that's where overcoming really comes from not the honter man this is let's go back to Romans now I don't really have this in my notes I just feel like going and looking at it in Romans chapter 7 we read about Paul's struggle about who can deliver me from this oh Wretched Man I am who can delivering me from this body of death then at the end he says but I thank God through Jesus Christ Our Lord and then he goes to chapter 8 and chapter 8 is the answer friends amen he said 8 verse one there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk after the F who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus had made me free from the law of sin and death for what the law could not do and that it was weak through the flesh God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and forc sin condemn sin in the flesh that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for they that are after The Flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace because the carnal mind is enmity against God for it is not subject to the law of God neither indeed can be so then they that are in the flesh cannot please God but you are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of God dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his and if Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by the spirit that dwelleth in you he says he'll also Quicken your mortal bodies when brother bandom comes to this he's not just talking about the future when you'll have a Transfiguration or a resurrection he's talking about now when it will Quicken your body why did he say he says how do you know you used to smoke you used to drink you used to be addicted tobacco you used to have all of these lust problems didn't you but what happened now because the spirit quickened your body to what to manifest the word amen by what power by the power that's in you amen so so what is the answer to walk in the spirit what Paul was realizing that he must be tempered in all things and control this flesh and keep it subject that this is the evil one this is where the world resides this is where I'm struggling with the world sometimes we think we think if we don't go to bad places we didn't go to the world well of course that is the world it's a manifestation of worldly things absolutely it's not a wrong statement but sometimes if we if if we keep our kids at home we kept them from the world but you can keep them home and keep them in the world right cuz what is in the world the lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh the pride of life yeah now don't get me wrong I think we should keep our kids amen from worldly influences absolutely amen especially until they come to the time that they have the Holy Ghost for themselves we have to take responsibility for him because their little Spirits pick up on all those wrong things so we're responsible to keep that separated from them amen so don't misunderstand what I'm saying but we have to understand that the real power is not going to come from the boundaries that we put up amen that's just temporarily there to hold those influences off of them and keep them free from it as long as we can until they can be born again by the spirit of God and then the Overcomer is on the inside of them amen but we have to understand that and understand where the enemy is and where the power to overcome is if we don't understand where the enemy is then we don't realize what's passing through our brains is what's tripping us up right and we also don't realize amen that what God is stirring by his spirit in my soul is what I'm Overcoming By so then we we get tripped up and don't knowwhere we're tripped up and then we run to somebody else to try to save us and we're getting all messed up because greater is he that is in you there's a seed in you amen there's a life in you to bring everything in that seed to life and the message leadership the prophet says what what a rebuke to Christianity we're supposed to represent God in eternal life there's only one form of eternal life and that's God he alone has eternal life and we are products of his because we're genes of his Spirit then we should conduct ourselves women and men like the Bible said for us to do not Jezebels of the street and rickes of the organization but Christian gentlemen Sons and Daughters of God born of the spirit of God manifesting the light in our days and scattering it it comes and this is a a a message from 1954 I want to read you this quote from the message called show us the father he said that's the way the man is that's born of the spirit of God when he takes God's promise into his heart and look the only thing that God does is plant you in Jesus Christ by the Holy Ghost and everything you have need of in this Earth's journey is in you when you receive the Holy Ghost amen the only thing you have to do is draw and push out I tell you what's the matter with Christians tonight you're not drawing dividends on your baptism of the Holy Ghost draw in and drink and drink and drink and drink till you push out salvation push out Divine Healing push out the baptism of the Holy Ghost just drink and drink and drink and you're planted by the inexhaustible Fountain of Life which is Jesus Christ he that's thirsty let him drink him that Hearth say come whosoever will let him come drink from The Fountains of Water of Life freely amen what a beautiful thing of him here God in his word God's got to keep his word what do we need to do we need to drink in the spiritual life what empowers our spiritual life the word of God Amen brother said the Holy Ghost feeds on the word amen we've got to drink in and receive the word receive the spirit of God Amen re receive the things of God and keep drinking in and let that produce what's on the inside and push out everything that's in the word we can't hang it on the outside like an ornament it's got to come from the inside but guess what it's there it's already there he says in Statue of a perfect man again he says well now that's the way it is trying to manufacture Christianity Christianity you can't do it the first thing you've got to do is be born again you've got to be changed and when you're changed you become a new creation now you're getting right now you don't have to worry about the feathers it'll take care of itself when you're born again he said it's like a crow trying to take peacock feathers and and put peacock feathers and be a peacock he said they'll just fall out you can't or a dove amen trying to uh uh somebody trying to emulate a dove and a crow trying it's not going to work amen but you don't have to worry the feathers will take care of themselves you don't have to say well I want to do the works of God I got to do the work the works of God will produce itself in your life if you just drink from Christ why because it's already in you again in the Statue of a perfect man he says after you've done come from here to here to here to here what are you talking about stature of a perfect man growing up Faith Temperance uh longsuffering all of these things virtue he's talking about growing he says when you done come from here to here to here to here to here now you're coming into the full stature now of a Son of God but you got to have this plus all of this and you can't even start till you get this he's pointing down to Faith now remember the black bird with peacock feathers don't forget him don't try to add it till you're actually born again CU it won't work and you can't make it work it'll come to this or this here it'll crumble somewhere but when you get down here a genuine Born Again Dove then you don't add nothing it adds to you see comes on up all right coming into Perfection now he's talking about stature for man growing growing into the very likeness of Christ amen starting and and coming through these virtues these virtues are already in the seed amen amen you say well I just need more Temperance I can't go any further until I get Temperance Temperance where you going to get Temperance where are you going to go find it amen go go go buy another dose of it go get somebody lay hands on you for it where are you going to get Temperance from Temperance comes from the life of God inside of you we just got to drink and push it out remember you're an apple tree there's going to be apples on your tree amen there's it's going to get there the fruits will come don't manufacture don't get nervous don't get Hasty be patient and keep drinking in the word amen keep surrendering and and the trumpet gives an uncertain sound he said if the Church of the Living God God is the Church of the Living God it'll put forth the word of the Living God you don't have to add peacock feathers nowhere and even feather in there will be joined to a peacock you can believe that and every feather that's joined into the Church of God will be the word of God you will never inject anything else but the word amen because the nature of the spirit puts out only the word so what is the nature of the spirit do inside it pushes out the word praise God in the message God hiding himself in simplicity says you don't ask sheep to Bear wool or manufacture wool the Sheep don't have to manufacture wool so now my master wants me to have some wool this year I got to get busy no the only thing he has to do is just remain a sheep that's right the wool will automatically it will he will bear it because and we're not asked to manufacture fruits we're supposed to produce fruit bear fruits we are supposed to Bear fruits and as long as you are a fruit tree of God with God's word god word will vindicate itself it'll bear fruit as long as the word's in there amen and Jesus said if you abide in me and my word in you ask what you will it shall be done see you don't manufacture it you work you you work yourself not up to it it's just actually there and it goes on and on why do we keep listening to tapes why do we keep coming to preaching why do we why because we're walking in the spirit because we need to nurture this life on the inside because it's the life on the the inside is where the overcoming power is and where God is working mightily in us to produce his own life not from the outside in From the Inside Out amen listen if we want abundance of apples on an apple tree then then you know you have to start with an apple tree can't start with a pear tree or a peach tree have start with an apple tree tree amen and if the apple seed goes into the ground and under the right condition it comes forth and begins to grow listen every Apple that'll ever be on that tree is in that tree then it's in the sea but the way you tend the life of that Apple will determine how much it'll produce yeah amen that Apple needs water that Apple needs light that apple tree needs nutrition and there's times that the apple tree needs pruned you just let it go wild and don't tend to it and'll never reach its full potential but in order for it to reach its full potential it needs a husbandman it needs a farmer and every once in a while that Farmer's got to whack a few limbs off praise be to God Amen when God comes in and he does a pruning on us and wax a few limbs off amen it's never to destroy us amen remember when Jesus says amen the husbandman of the vine amen when the vine bears fruit then he purgeth it yeah that it might bear more fruit amen he didn't Purge it because he was angry you bore some just a little fruit I didn't get no he purged it so it bear more fruit and there's times that God will come and Purge our life trim off dead trim off extra trim off access trim off anything that's not what he wants amen why because what he wants us to do is bear fruit it needs a little tending amen if if we're going to get all the fruit that it has the potential for when you look in the Natural Life of Sheep amen you want sheep to produce wool when you want wool production and you want to use the lamb then you've got to take care of the use they got to have water they got to have nutrition they got to have a peaceful environment in which they can grow wool you can't stand there over every day over them and say bear me wool and wool doesn't grow you whack them over the head with the stick they're never going to Bear wool that's right amen amen amen but if it's not a sheep it's never going to Bear wool anyways so if you take something that's not a sheep let's say you take a goat you put it in the pen and you say if I just give this super tender loving care the best nutrition and the best love and I massage it every day and I play classical music you're not going to get any wool amen it's not a sheep y but if I take care of the sheep the Sheep will produce wool amen cuz it's in the Sheep to produce wool amen if I don't take care of the sheep it may produce wool but it won't produce as much wool cuz it won't be healthy this is why our spiritual health is so important I mentioned to you the immune system that works in your body produces red or white blood cells they go out they fight infection they do all the things that they're supposed to do I don't know about you I mean I never have you may have but I never woke up in the morning and says Gene number 342 you need to get into action I feel feel a little tingle in my throat I'm activating you now it just does it automatically because that's what it's there for there's a need and it goes into action and a need and I don't control my immune system my immune system just works but I can do things that have a positive or negative effect on my immune system amen right y if I eat horrible if I sleep horrible if I abuse my body if I do all these things then I have an immune system and my immune system is going to try to do what it's going to do but it's going to be less effective in doing what it needs to do I'm going to be sicker all the time right but if I do the things that that I knew to take care of my body if I do the right things my immune system will work more effectively if I get good sleep if I have good nutrition if I have exercise if I if I have good water if I have all the good things I need I have a good atmosphere and less stress and all of these things if I get in that good atmosphere then the the immune system that's already there and already designed to work will work more effectively amen isn't it super simple yeah there's a spiritual genetics inside our soul that to overcome every obstacle in our life but the way we take care of our spiritual life it can make it more difficult more effective or less effective and we all know that's the truth yeah it's just simply the truth if we we binge eat on garbage and worldly entertainment and things of the world and our conversations are never centered around the things of God we haven't taken time in meditation and in prayer Devotion to God and feeding on the word amen then we're going to keep being spiritually sick all the time right amen amen it doesn't mean we're not a son of God it doesn't mean the seed's not there it doesn't mean you're not supposed to be the brid tree and you're not supposed to bear fruit but the problem is you still have an evil one on the outside and that dog needs starved amen that's right that's the reality that's why you know you could we could go along and we can make all kinds of rules and say don't ever watch this and if you're going to watch any YouTube amen make sure it's only these sites and only for 10 minutes and blah blah blah blah blah listen I have no desire to pleas that but the reality is if you stay away from those things or limit your time on it for what you need and you stay focused on the spiritual side you'll be spiritually healthy that's why there's a Temptation sometimes to make regulations and rules amen because you know the reality that if you do do this you're going to suffer if you do this you're going to be blessed yeah amen right it's just the truth if I avoid fellowship if I stay with my mind twisted up and entangled in things of the world if I feed on things that feed the lust of the flesh the pride of life the lust of the eyes amen and then all of a sudden I come into a spiritual obstacle I've not been walking in the spirit I've been tending to the Flesh and these two are at war with one another I'm going to be struggling spiritually why and why am I struggling so hard spiritually because we got to walk in the spirit and we shall not fulfill the lust of the Flesh and not a law not legalism reality the truth the true understanding that it's already embedded in me it's not that I'm broken or I'm wrong and I need God to come fix me what I need to do is I need to eat right sleep right exercise right amen and it will work that's why Paul said that he said Christian must be temperate in all things why because I've got an objective I've got a goal he's run a race he has self-control and so it's already what do you have need of it's already inside you it's already there friends but I've struggled with for the for years the answers inside you right I can't seem to overcome this the answer if you're a child of God born again Again by the spirit of God the answer is inside of you the Overcomer is inside of you he that's greater is he that's in you than he's in the world he's already there yeah that's why the thing that I can do if I as your brother and your friend and your pastor could ever encourage you in any way I would encourage you to spend as much time with the Lord as you possibly can we live in a world that's full of distractions and it's it's it's designed that way we're never going to change it we've got to work we've got to tid family we got to mow grass you got to shovel driveway at this time of year there's things that absolutely you have to do that take your time and attention there's no way of getting around it and you shouldn't feel guilty for doing those things God planted you in this life but we've got to be temperate in all things and understand that if I'm going for Mastery if I'm going to live for Christ if I'm going for a healthy spiritual life amen then I've got to feed I've got to drink I've got to take in good water good nutrition good light I got to have rest if your body going to be healthy you have to have good rest if you want sheep to Bear wool they have to have rest how am I going to come to rest I only can come to rest in the presence of God when I take time out of my day sometimes I I so enjoy talking to some of the the folks who have served God all their lives and they're at the end of life I remember my wife and I we were speaking to Betty Stoner one time and many of you remember Betty she was 90 some years old when she passed away and before she did she fell and she fractured her hip and she was bed fast she was stuck in bed she couldn't get out of bed and but she told us we were there visiting and she said oh I love to read so I'm thinking oh I know what I'll do for Betty we'll get some good books and we'll find some stuff and you know cuz she's stuck in bed so we asked her sister Betty what is it you like to read you know we'd like to get you some books she goes oh spoken word books huah what was her favorite thing to read spoken word books not a novel not a love story not an adventure not a Sci-Fi and listen I'm not condemning if you read anything else I read other things and enjoy it so I I for recreation I love to read a book I'm not that's so you understand you love me I love you you know me I know you but when she said that all of a sudden my heart just did something exciting me she lived her all of her life and come to the end of her life and she knew the thing that was most needful you go talk to the old-timers that have been in this message for 40 50 60 years they're always talking about the message they just listen to they're always talking about the book they read the message they listened to I think maybe they learned something you get to the end of life you don't have the physical strength you had you don't have the mental strength that used to have you can't cover everything in life by your youthfulness weakness starts to creep in and it will for all of us and as weakness Creeps in we begin to realize I can't do what I used to do I can't care for myself I can't make it happen I don't have what I used to have I don't think like I used to do I don't act like I used to do what is it I need more than anything I need him more than anything I need he that's greater in me than he that's in this world because this guy is letting me down what I used to depend on to earn my Amen to fix things that were broke to overcome challenges in my life I used to depend on this flesh I used to when I was in my 20s when I was in my 30s I could work around the clock there was days that I put in 40 some hours at work and I never slea and I was still fine and my my Montage was always work harder if you got a problem work harder you need more money work more hours if you got to overcome something you just work that's all you got to do is work amen what happens when you can't work anymore you realize for many of us in our youthful years we were relying on the outer man we were relying on our own intellect and our own strength and our outer man and we could always overcome obstacles because we were still young and still vibrant and we could still think and we could still process we could still do that's why the most glorious time in a child of God's life is when those leaves are changing colors cuz maybe they've learned a few things along the way I can't walk like I used to I can't overcome I can't I can't build a house anymore can't R roof my house I can't fix my car like I used to I amen so what are we left with I need God I need the spirit of God to lead me every day of my life oh God help me to get there now am I said God help you if you're 15 16 17 19 20 21 God help you get there now because God never intended for man to shift for himself he wanted to be completely relying upon God where is your overcoming power in you amen where is he that overcometh in you how will he overcome by might in the Inner Man where is everything that I have need of coming from that which is inside of me you know what I need to do more than anything more than get up early and work more hours what I need to do is get up early and talk to him longer spend more time aligning my thinking with his thinking read his word pray meditate just think on him listen to good things listen to sermons listen to music do something to defeat the Inside Man so that I could drink and drink and drink and then I'm not God there's nothing for me to put on on the outside there's nothing for me to correct or make happen what needs to happen will come from the strength from the inner man greater is he that is in you than he that's in the world that's nothing but the truth friends and the evil one is that body you live in and the world is influencing that body in your mind all the time the lust of the eyes the the lust of the flesh the pride of life so where am I going to overcome it not through more mind not through more intellect not through more willpower there's the problem where am I going to overcome it with the Inside Man am man that apple tree what is that apple tree going to do the only thing he can do stay in the presence of the sun suck in the water and the nutrients from the ground and just push out whatever's on the inside that's all that apple tree can do that's all that sheep can do is feed on the good grass that the Good Shepherd leads him to because the Good Shepherd knows what grass produces wool and what grass makes him sick right if the Sheep's left to himself he'll do things to himself amen that causes him to not bear wool not be healthy not lamb but under the good Shepherd's Care amen he provides good pasture with good food good nutrition good light good clean water for what so that that sheep can do what it was born to do said God help me give my soul everything that it needs to do what it was born to do it's born to do it amen and that apple tree all it has to do is grow up that's all it's got to do grow up stay in the light drink in the water bring in the nutrients push out the life in the spring push out leaves Bloom bear fruit do it again next year and again next year and again next year amen and at the end of the life of that apple tree you got 10,000 bushels all that was in the seed from the beginning has been made manifest and what did that tree do just took in the light took in the water and the nutrients and pushed out from the genetic life that was inside everything God wants us to do is already inside of us the works were finished before the foundation of the world we were created in Christ Jesus and the good works which God before ordained that we walk in them it's already seal it's already known God already knows what he wants you to do and he's put it inside the seed inside of you and the message you must be born again he says I hope the word's not boring you born Christians grow into the stature of Christ as they live they're born again and their lives begin to shape like a baby it takes form and begins to grow first thing you know here they are in the full stature amen there you are day after day year after year they stay the same now come back to the word if you abide in me further now he says but be born of the spirit and grow into the stature of Christ you see brother D growing into the stature of Christ in another message he says and as we went through it this morning you can't expect a baby to be born a man it's got to grow to it and we grow in Christ to the full stature not somebody get converted tonight and tomorrow go to preach the gospel we grow up into manhood into the stature of Christ amen amen we have to grow into the full potential of that seed amen it doesn't happen instantly sometimes we get frustrated because we don't see enough fruit in our lives well what are you going to do about it we get frustrated I don't see enough fruit in my life or somebody can start condemning you because you don't have enough fruit in your life the reality is what are you going to do about it I mean go buy some and hang it on the tree what are you going to do how are you going to Bear more fruit there's only one thing you can do draw more water amen take in more sun let photosynthesis go to work in your Lea draw in the minerals and nutrients with the water from the ground amen if you need to Bear more fruit fruits inside of you the fruit's in you receive what God is sending you receive this message take time to actually drink it in not Sunday and Wednesday only that's not enough time to Bear the fruit of Christ in this world Amen we need time with the Lord with the the word every day brother B said a a a Christian prays and reads his Bible every day he has to why because there's got to be something to feed that life inside of him to give him strength now listen I'm not also saying that to condemn you either I've skipped days brother brandham skipped days I got it on tape brother Neville asked him to come hunting and he gets to the pull pit he says haven't even opened my b for two or three days why cuz he was down hunting and what does he do when he hunts spends time with the Lord so it's not about I read in my Bible every day check off the list I'm it's not that friends that's not the that shouldn't be the mentality that's right it should be I need more of that life yeah amen I need more water I need more light I need more nutrients I need to be in that presence so that my spirit can relax because at rest I can bear wool at rest I can bear fruit I need to connect with him so that my spirit can calm down I need to connect with him to get the light and to get the water everything that I need of to bear fruit I can't just produce and I just can't say fruit magically appear it doesn't work that way but if I can get myself in a healthy spiritual condition by walking in the spirit I won't fulfill the lust of the flesh I won't be dominated by the Black Dog the outer man and the white dog will begin to win the fight it's so simple that we neglect to do it right it's so simple but it has such power we just need to feed Peter tells us as newborn babes we should we should desire the sincere milk of the word we need to how does a baby grow by eating Peter tells us in second Peter to grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ we're intended to grow grow into the reflection of Christ grow where is it it's in the seed gen that's in your soul where's the power going to come from where's the intelligence where where is everything it's already inside of you we just got to keep it in the right conditions for it to grow and it'll produce everything he intended it to produce don't look at yourself in a stage of growth and say I'm not just because you look like a little sprig that's coming out just because you haven't bloomed yet just because you don't have as many apples as the neighbor has listen you know what's more important than any of that is recognizing you're an apple tree yeah you may be next to the other you you know Sister self-righteous and she tells you how many bags of wool the farmer got off her this year all the great things she's done for everybody and gets up early and bakes bread for her whole house and polishes her husband's shoes and takes care of everybody and and you look at her big bag of wool and you look at your little bag of wool say I haven't done much for the Lord you know what that's not the most important thing to realize the most important thing to realize is I'm a Sheep amen I'm a sheep yeah I may not bear as much wool I may not look make it look as good I may not but I'm a sheep and it's inside of me to Bear wool yeah I've been born and predestinated and come into the Earth to Bear wool so what do I need to do maybe I just need to change my diet amen my exercise routine my best times why so that I can bear all the wool that's inside of me to bearen if we don't take in any of the spiritual Life of Christ we have no Christ to push out don't take in nutrients and water and Sun the plant has nothing to give out if we don't bring it in we have nothing to push out we need to focus on bringing it in and then let the genetics of God work everything out you know when you're a 10-year-old boy and everybody around you has a gross spt and you're the shortest 10-year-old boy that you know you know what you want you want the genetics in your body to start making protein muscle in tendon and Bone right now and if you could will it to do so you would but you can't will it to do so the only thing you can do is keep eating and be patient because some grow up before others and some get tall than others amen and it doesn't matter what you will to do and it doesn't matter how much you desire it and you can pack in all the vitamins that your stomach can hold till you're sick of vitamins and you're only going to be as tall as your genetics allow sorry sorry I hate to disappoint the what is it the vitamin company but if I want to get there I need to eat I need to sleep I need to excise I need to do the things and then my body will take care of itself that's right and I'll grow into the stature God's ordained me to grow and I'll eventually hit where God wants me to hit and I'll be as tall or somewhere in average of the other guys there's nothing you can do to make it happen there's nothing you can will it to happen the only thing you can do is stay with the natural process of life and it will work amen the same thing with our spiritual growth just stay with the natural process of spiritual growth and it will work friends it will work I hope of anything I've been like a a coach today encourage you sleep eat amen do what you know to do feed on the word of God listen to the Messi read the books let your favorite books be spoken word books not fantasy novels or this or romance or make your favorite books message books am make your favorite favorite thing you listen to not a podcast somewhere that somebody does to help you with make the favorite thing you listen to the message of the hour the voice of God in this day make your favorite time that quiet time before you start your day or quiet time at the end of the day or middle wherever you have it does make your favorite time in the time that time where you slow down and you get your heart in rhythm with God because if not it's out this world gets it out of rhythm work and stresses and family situations they get you out of rhythm amen make your favorite time of the day when you stop and you get back in Rhythm cuz that'll bring you to rest and what it'll do all of those things will just allow what's already inside of you to produce itself amen I going to read this last quote as we finish and the message things that are to be brother benam says now the only way that you can be a son or daughter of God is because you have to have eternal life and there's only one form of eternal life and that's God's life only one form of eternal life life that was God there to be a Son of God you had to be in him always the gene of your life spiritual life tonight was in God the Father before there was even a molecule and you are nothing but the manifestation of the gene of life that was in God as a Son of God now you're expressed after his word has come into you to light up this age you expressing God's life in you because you are a son or a daughter of God therefore you get what I mean I want to read that sentence again now you're expressed after his word has coming to you what allowed you to express when his word came into you to do what to light up this age you are expressing God's life in you because you're a son or daughter of God not because you decided to but because it was already inside of you therefore you get what I mean you see you are now made you're sitting in this church tonight because your duty is to express God to this Nation this people this neighborhood where you associate wherever you go God knew that you would be here because you have to be one of his genes or his attributes you had to be if you ever if you've got eternal life then it's always was eternal life and God before there was a foundation of the world knew that you would be here and when the word or the water the washing of the water of the word fell upon you it was expressed in a being now you have fellowship with your father God just as you have with your Earthly father you're a citizen of the king not a citizen but you are children Sons and Daughters of the Living God if it be that eternal life dwells in you how did it get there he put it there what is your duty what did brother said our duty was your duty is to Bear wool I could be a farmer and go to my sheep and say your duty is to Bear wool so bear me some wool like you realize your duty is to express God do you know what a difficult task that is how do I know exactly what he wants to express in his how do I know exactly how to what's the right thing to say what's the right way to handle the how would God your duty is to express just the same as the disciples Duty was to go into all the world and teach them baptize but the same promise they have is the same promise we still have amen your duty is to go on your your duty is to express ask God to this nation and this people and this neighborhood where you associate yeah how am I going to do it Greater is he that is in me than is he that's in this world he not depending on me to do it by myself he's depending on me to yield to his way so that he can do it through me let's all Stand Together I want to leave you with this saying this statement you can do it amen if you're a child of God predestinated born to express God in this hour that you live in in this nation this neighborhood where you associate if that's God's call on your life to be the Bride of Jesus Christ to overcome where e fail but to be predestinated not to fall the same way she did you can do it how do I know you can do it because you're an apple tree it's in you to do it because you're a sheep it's in you to do it how do I know you can do it cuz you you you're genetically programmed to do it by the gene of God you know what all you need is water light nutrition and rest if you get all of that it'll just come out prise God Amen God bless you all I hope you're encouraged amen start your day in prayer pick up and read the word of God and let God flow right through US amen let's bow our heads together dear heavenly father we thank you Lord for your good word and God we're so thankful for this message that puts in perspective Our Lives Lord Lord Our Lives before the opening of the seals was mysterious misunderstood we didn't know whether we were in or out or up or down or we didn't know how to deal with the outside man versus The Inside Man the black dog and the white dog but God you came and you peeled off the layers of confusion so that we could see the truth God now that truth has been given to us for a reason so that we can rest in your process and Trust in your ways God I believe that I'm speaking to True seeds Lord true sheep that you've called to Bear wool to manifest your life in this hour and Lord it's such a difficult task to manifest your life to reflect you to be Jesus Christ on the earth lord it's more than we as human beings can accomplish our minds can't even fathom how to accomplish that God it's beyond our thinking it's beyond our willpower it's beyond our ability but God we're not depending on any of that we're trusting in the seed that you planted in our soul before the foundation of the world that you've genetically programmed us to be you in this age to manifest you reflect you in this world so God I pray that you'd help us to continue in the way of life that you spelled out for us to continue to drink in of your spirit to receive your word to pull into our souls all that you provided for us in this hour for you've led us to good pastors you placed Us beside Still Waters you've given us everything that we need to grow help us to take advantage of all that you've given to us to lay down our hearts and rest in your presence knowing that you have everything taken care of we don't have to stress we don't have to be nervous we don't have to be anxious because you're a heavenly father that has planned out our lives may we rest Lord and then this good grass that you've given us in this message Lord your revealed word may we eat it Lord in this still water this clean fresh water of your spirit that's been restored in this hour may we drink it in and may all those ingredients go together and and and be reproduced as your life flowing from us God I pray you bless your children may we go from here encouraged Lord
