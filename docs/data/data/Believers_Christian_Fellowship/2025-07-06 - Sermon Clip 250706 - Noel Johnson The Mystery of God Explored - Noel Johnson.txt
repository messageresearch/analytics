========================================

When Adam fell, he lost the title deed. That went back to God. In the book, and I don't know how to explain the book, but he said in the book was also all the names of all God's children that were to come into manifestation. So God took the book. Adam, Satan could not take it because he had no rights to it. So God had to watch over down through time to make sure that all of his children came into manifestation. That's right. Right? And then he had to watch over them. He had to lead them and he had to guide them so they could fulfill God's plan for their lives. Um and then when you begin to understand that the title deed, well, when you get into into into Revelation, John, you eat the book. What is the book? The title deed of redemption, the title deed to the earth, title deed to the rulership. So where is this title deed now? In us. Amen. Everything Adam lost as a result of the fall, we possess. But it'll only operate on our ability to believe it. The more that you understand God, the more you can take and you can begin to to apprehend and and and and over time I I mean, I've seen this manifested in different in different occasions. I know we were in Jamaica once and there was a hur tornado hurricane that was coming and it was going to go right over the top of us and we all prayed and we said well Lord if it comes right over the top of us there can be a lot of destruction so Lord would you just kind of move it for us we didn't ask for it to go away we just asked to move so instead of taking discourage all of a sudden it made a jog praise God because that's the power we have. I know. I was with my brother in Arkansas, I think it was, or one of those states down there. There was a tornado coming and we saw it coming and we looked for a place. Where could we go? Where could we hide? What could we grab hold of? And so I just says, "Well, Lord, just let it go around us." So it went from one to two, went around us, joined back together, and continued on its journey. I'm not trying to brag, but I'm merely trying to say that power we have. But and sometimes when we pray, we we don't realize what we are praying. We don't realize that here again it's God using our voice to be able to speak to be able to to achieve what we want. But you know, I begun to apply that in other areas of my life. If I get up in the morning and aches and pains that come with um maturing um I can look at myself and I can say, "Oh, it's going to be a terrible day. Oh man. Oh yeah. Oh, I overdid it yesterday. Oh, it's gonna be a horrible, horrible, horrible day. Well, I've just spoke it. Enjoy it. But I get up even with the eggs, same aches and pains. I say, "God has given me another day to enjoy him. God has given me another day to enjoy his presence, another day to worship him, another day to get into the word, another day to see his beauty all around me." And so now I've spoken that I expect a good day because I spoke it. Amen. Whatever I speak, that's what I expect.
