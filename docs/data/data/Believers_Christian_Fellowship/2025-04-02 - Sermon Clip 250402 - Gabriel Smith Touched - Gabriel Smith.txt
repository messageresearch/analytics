and so she didn't even want to touch his shoulder his hand his foot cuz he may feel it but she said if I could just barely touch that just to himm and not disturb him that's how low she was that's right but it was at that low moment where she had the greatest faith and so many times in life God breaks us down to where we get to the lowest of the low but that's where he wants you and you say why because because we are so she she had to spend everything because she had to get rid of all of her sufficiency when when when the cupboards was empty and every she every homeopathic right when everything was spent and there was nothing left that's what God wanted her and you say well why would God allow that to happen because she had to be just like all of us look some people could just believe it and move on others of us are so stubborn that he has to break us down to such a place to where we have nothing left when we're at our lowest it was so low look where when she got on that ground and where do you think she was at she didn't been I don't believe she been over and touch to him because the Bible says that the people were thr in him that means choking him and and when he said when he stopped and he said who touched me look the the the the multitude choked the word and the disciples rebuked the word but she and her littleness touched the word and when she touched him with something that could not be felt by man virtue left him am when he was not phased by the multitudes but when this little insignificant when she touched him she was able to pull something from him God got her to that place so that she could be totally emptied out the same way he gets us to those places because he he wants us totally emptied out
