========================================

see our superficial forgiveness is like this I forgive you but in your mind wait till God gets you or I forgive you brother that's all right I forgive you but oh God's going to get you that's the wrong forgiveness that's not forgiving from the heart forgiving from the heart now comes shoulder-to-shoulder with the brother and say God this is forgiveness yeah listen this is the reality friends God I'm willing to bear the consequences for their action as payment for their release and I'm not asking you to punish them to make them pay set them free and don't judge them because of me because I forgive them and in that kind of forgiveness now youve become the intercessor and you stood in the Gap if you're going to take the consequences for their action then you're going to take the conse qu of Your Action you're not going to pretend to take the consequence of Your Action hoping that God makes them pay for their actions that's not bearing the price of their forgiveness that's superficial that's mental that's not the reality the reality is I'm not going to ask God to make them pay either I hope they don't have to pay I set them free and I want them to go free I want them to prosper I want them to be happy they have no more obligation to me and God please don't judge them for what they did to me because I forgive them for what they did to me if you judge J them for something else they did if you judge them for what they did to you that's fine but please don't judge them for what they did to me I set them free that is pure true forgiveness and if you can't do that you have not come to forgiveness from the heart yet and don't feel horrible if you're not there it doesn't come easy friends sometimes we got to go back and say God I need your help I'm not able I can't get over I can't get free I'm not able to Bear the consequence of their action I still want them to pay if you still want them to pay even though you're not going to make them you're just trusting that God will do it we're not there yet because how did Jesus forgive us father forgive them Father I take all the consequences for their actions upon myself forgive them they don't know what what they're doing do you realize what a powerful statement that was that day on Calvary the question is are we going to be Christlike or not this comes down to reality I said this is powerful this is deep this is not trivial this is not surface this is not mental this is the depths of reality
