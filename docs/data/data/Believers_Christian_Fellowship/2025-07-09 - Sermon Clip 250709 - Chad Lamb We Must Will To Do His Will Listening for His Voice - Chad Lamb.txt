========================================

And brother Bam said, "I was nervous and I done it in a catch of a moment when Satan caught me." I'm so glad he told us these things because I've been caught in a catch of a moment before. I've been caught all nervous and tied up in my mind and say something, don't even know why you said it or do something, don't even know why you do it, and you react to a situation. Amen. And and almost always it's this old outer man trying to save itself. Save itself from suffering. save itself from whatever. Amen. It's usually this old outer man trying to save itself. Amen. And that's what brother Ben Brandon was going through. Amen. But but the thing that got me is he knew that he was condemned when his wife asked him the question, but he tried to go on. But when God spoke to him and brought it to his face, Amen. that man wasn't dodging it anymore. When God brought it right to his face, Amen. he repented. Amen. That's a son of God. That's a man who will lay down his will for God's will. It doesn't mean you will never make a mistake. And you and I won't ever get things wrong and we won't get caught in a catch of a moment and we won't have all the same things that other human beings have. But when God brings it to our face, there's something inside of us says, "God, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, God." And we'll we'll we will bring our will subject to his will. Amen. I'm so thankful for that. So thankful God has people on the earth today that will do that. Amen. So, it's not just making a mistake. You remember, uh, I read here just a few weeks ago the interview of Sister Bruce. I pulled it up. Sister Bruce was struggling because of her mistakes. And she said, Sister Bruce says, "I make so many mistakes and I fail so many times." Does anybody ever felt, don't raise your hand, but anybody feel that way? Amen. And this is, this is Brother Bram's answer to her. That's why Christ had to die so that you with your mistakes wouldn't be lauded to you. See, he took your mistakes. Your desire in your heart is to serve him. And Sister Bruce says, "Yes." All right. That's what he died for so you could serve him. See, not your mistakes are not looked not lauded to you. He's your propitiation. He's your sin offering. Your sins are not known. You're not a sinner before God. Christ took your sins and became you because your desire is to serve him. Is your desire to serve him? Is your desire to lay your will down for his will? Amen. You don't get it 100%. I don't get it 100%. But nothing changes that desire. Sometimes I get tripped up in a nervous condition when I get all stumbled around. But that never changes what's in the depths of my soul. I want God's way to be my way every day of my life. I want him to have his way in me. I don't want to fail. I don't want to make mistakes. I don't want to make the wrong decision. I don't want to go the wrong way. I don't want to bring a reproach against his name. But I do all of that. But that's the reason he died because he knows we're just human beings. So, we got to quit looking at every failure and start looking at what's the desire of our life and what are we living for. Amen. And say, God, if I got off the trail, bring me back on the trail. If I made a mistake, bring me back, God. Bring it to my face. Speak to my heart, Lord, that I can repent and lay this will down for your will.
