so dark and it all falls apart I'm glad Jesus lives down in my heart amen aren't you glad Jesus lives in your heart as we look around and see everything falling apart you can be seated we got a number of things this morning we want to go through here a couple of things I I just [Music] been struggling with her to give this testimony or not because I don't want to take too much time but I I just something just burning in my heart and um if a neighbor that recently her husband passed away from cancer and we got kind of close to him they're in his last couple of months that he was alive and he'd done some farming and he he told me that he had a while back he told me that he lost his wallet in the field when he was farming and they'd done they'd quite extensively looked for it they brought in dogs to sniff for it and all different things and you know kind of forgotten about it and uh she told me she said I just want you to go ahead and farm that land over there and when when I went over to plowette last Saturday she had told me before I went over she said you know Richard's wallet's over there in the field she goes see if you can find that and you know when she said that I she she said it in my mind I just dismissed it I said it's 20 acres there's no way I'm going to find a wallet in 20 acres and uh so as I as I went over and began to plow her request just was burning in my heart I don't know how to explain it other than that and this this testimony for me is deeper than just the testimony that I can even tell you but this is just burning in my heart and I I stopped as they come around the end of the field and I just bowed my head and I said Lord if you'd help me find that wallet I can't find that wallet out here but if you'd help me find that wallet I think it means something to Mary and uh and so I just kept plowing and you know it just goes to show the expectations when I prayed all I can tell you is both the unction to pray and the faith for the prayer I instantly knew I was going to find that wallet in 20 acres amen and I found out later he lost it 13 years ago and and I knew it had been some time they hadn't farmed it for a few years and and so as I was as I was going and I was just watching kind of as I was plowing brother Ron and I was plowing and and I was watching the dirt that was turning over to the side from the previous time I went around I thought you know the Lord's just going to turn that wallet up there on top of that and I'll be able to find that and you know there's a lot of real small rocks that look like wallets in a field and I and I was just kind of expecting and as I was every time I'd come around I'm listening to a message and just praying and not really thinking about it all the time and I'd come around this one end of the field and it just kept I kept remembering and I'm like oh I gotta look I gotta look and so I was thinking well the Lord must be trying to tell me it's down here at this end of the field and uh Saturday I plowed part of it and then Monday I went back and you know brother Jean preached on Sunday from spiritual to full manifestation I didn't think about this until later but as I was plowing on Monday I was clear at the other end of the field I was almost to the end of the field and brother Ron in the furrow as I you know you're not paying attention to where you're driving in the furrow where that's rolling it over but I just happened I turned back around from looking to plow and as as the tractor was coming down the furrow just before it disappeared in front of where the tire would be because it has big tires on the front I saw something Flash and I just knew I was like that's a wallet and as a try to make this a little shorter I I got out you know stomped on the brakes I go around there and I got and I just I saw it was a wallet and like all I wanted to know is like whose wallet is this you know you're just you just under that expectation at the same time almost disbelief like there's no way because if you understand farming a little bit like when you're plowing the plow rolls the dirt over immediately onto the previous and this wallet was buried seven inches deep in the ground closed and when the plow went over it the dead Furrow that's the one that rolls over and it leaves the trench for you to drive in the next time that plow went over the top of the wallet perfectly peeled every bit of dirt off the top of the wallet and left just a little Mark in the wallet just a tiny little scratch in the top of the wallet and it caused the wallet to open up so that the light from the Setting Sun on Monday would shine on the plastic on the inside so that I would see it and just a number of things I you know I'm looking at it just in disbelief this is crazy and then as I'm plowing them the more I'm going around and I'm I was thanking the lord obviously I'm like Lord that that was miraculous but really the testimony for me was not in in finding the wallet but it was if I could express it this way it was in God teaching me something about faith because I'm ashamed to say that many times God puts a little unction in your heart and and you just kind of brush it off but Saturday uh something was just real about it and the other thing was this wasn't something for me I wasn't asking for a need that I had Lord would you provide this need where it was a need for somebody else um and there was something real about the faith and as I went around that field like I knew I was going to find that wallet and you say how can you know that I don't know but it's just the simple Faith amen and we're looking for simple Faith to drop into our hearts and so hopefully that'll encourage somebody this morning Mary couldn't believe it she said how did that happen she said that was 13 years ago she couldn't remember exactly when it happened and as we opened the wallet up and kind of went through the contents there was a picture in there from his children one of his children from 2010 in January and of course the picture was no good but we could see the writing of the ink on the back of the picture so we knew that it happened in 2010 and she said how can that happen and it's just been an opportunity for us to last several months to witness God's power and Life to them as a neighbor and just praying that God will continue to let give us that opportunity to be able and what a witnessing testimony that is to say because God cares about a little widow woman amen and you can go right into the scripture and you can begin to show God cares for those amen sometimes who you would think would be just maybe just somebody that's insignificant but when you gotta got something in your heart God cares and so if God puts a need on your heart for somebody just pray you'll take it to your heart and that God would be able to give you Faith to be able to believe for that because one of these days we need faith for a body change amen and I believe that that's the kind of Faith we're going to have something that just transforms from me to he bless the Lord [Music] oh bless the Lord rape oh bless the Lord who Reigns my life with so much power he can make a perfect heart old as the Lord [Music] [Music] [Music] with so much power he can live a perfect heart oh sing that again [Music] [Music] [Music] with so much love he can make one more time can you bless him this morning [Music] [Music] he raised my life with so much [Music] he can make a perfect heart praise be to his name are you happy this morning to be in the house of the Lord the prophet of God said that we are only Mortals once [Music] we are Mortals once before this service end we might end to be mortal and to be immortal and while we are Mortals this is the grandest opportunity that your entire body while you're still healthy you you while the voice could still sound God bless you musicians thank you you may be seated just for a little while the word of God has become so real so precious than when I am even in the basement I'm saying God even if this body will never be able to speak let the wars of the basement testify that I Heard a Voice I heard someone who loved you I walk around even the little trees in the backyard I speak I said even when my voice will no longer speak you testify that once I believe that your creator my creator and I love him anything around me around you should hear you in your best today God bless you we don't want to go into that and we just want to greet your this morning and I have greetings from our pastor brother Chad he stoled me and I said I'm gonna do it he said please greet all the saints from me and I said I'm going to do it brother so they just finished their final service today it was morning on our time and it's their afternoon I think we have six or seven hours difference so they are ready to come back home tomorrow starting tomorrow but I think we will I will ask you once again if you would stand would pray for our pastor and brother Jonathan if you would stand how many appreciate our pastor I'm taking this opportunity because he's not here so I don't want to embarrass him and I can tell you that's me absent the word of God in simplistic living in a man he the god the life of God within a man I'm not lifting him up has drawn me closer to him than ever before and I just want you to hold him you don't know what he might be what he's going through he is exhausted completely exhausted in the body I told him this morning like a little joke I said now Leo the two-thirds of your being could rest now they can enjoy their normal life for a little while his very life has been squeezed for you and me every single day and God has been sorry or at this place done it has to be a true Revelation but you can see him coming up walking up and down every day at this very sacred Pulpit I'm here standing with fear with trembling because this is not a man's job we cannot speak God's word God's word is God how can a man speak God they will take God to speak and to prove his own word just let's have by God's grace the reverence of what we have heard [Music] that's whole let's put every every every ounce of your being that you have today tomorrow doesn't belong to you but we're not here for fear or fear of hell no that's a that's a that's a religion we're here because we have a husband there's a love somewhere inside of a believer and we will discover what a Son of God is what a daughter of God is if God would allow us time while we're going to be praying for our pastor and brother Jonathan also remember my sister-in-law those that know brother Nick and sister Anna Maria they are in Florida my sister-in-law is sick so she has been along some three treatments and now she wants to do the natural ones that she has called in a prayer requested the congregation she said her home Church that you would remember her in prayer and if anyone else we can we will never get tired of coming to God to praying praying is a fellowship with God I don't want to fellowship with him just once a day twice three times pray every time I speak like a foolish speak to the rocks said you rock listen a Son of God is here speaking his creator let's bow our heads and pray precious Heavenly Father we are approaching you right now father with fear and yet with the greatest joy ever put upon the heart of man and father fear because your Holiness father is in such a way that your Prophet said that even the angels are dirty to you as we come father we do not come because there's anything good in US were coming because We Have Heard we have been revealed to something that someone took my place our place to impute at his own righteousness the righteousness of God that you have imputed to each and every one of you believe in children this morning coming with that reverence father that something that died for me that you did deity bled for me and father we just want to give you again another opportunity that Lord is this breath is still within us this voice could still be could still sound that we will let you know from the bottom of our horse that we love you that we cherish you we thank you for this opportunity father bringing your servant father brother Chad Lord we're not looking at a man but father we have recognized by your grace a portion of your gift in that person in that vessel and father we reference that gift there we respect it and we recognize you this morning as I told him in a little joke that let God invade you with his strength this morning that he will pour upon you that will find yourself back again that you can feel your feet you can feel your your arms and father we commit him to you for the labor of him with brother Jonathan as they were away father with their families that are caring for them that have stayed faithful to your word because we know father if their families would not stand for you they could not even be where they are father because they come in as a combo of your blessing bless them Father strengthen them and father give them a safe safe trip back relaxing home as we are anticipating Lord the great report of your your presence among them father we also bring my sister Anna Maria's Lord request to you this morning we are believing just like little children right now father I don't have to explain it because you said it that's what I'm holding on to you said by your stripes we are healed that's more than the sufficient Lord we love you we thank you commit her to you we know that you'll fulfill your word we bring all those fathers that have been Under Pressure different Lord situation circumstances Lord you touch each and every one of them you are so powerful that you can father heal everyone on this world you can do because that's who you are but father we just asking that you'll give us Faith who can tap into that nature of divine God bless the Lord the service this morning as we are setting ourselves aside father Lord this morning you know all all I did is just to bring the dust to you made out of this body that's standing giving it back to you that you would use it father I don't know how in any way father to speak to your people a few words that will encourage us that will father just give us to love you more in our lives we thank you bless the service now commit everything to you in Jesus Christ ever pray amen God bless you and let's turn to the Book of John chapter 15 thank you for keeping you standing up but you know what that let those legs exercise one day they will be cold someone has to carry them somewhere let them glorify God is just standing to read his holy and precious word we're living in the greatest day that when he opens he he unveils himself it's something becomes a reality the world is not the world is fake but your or not of this world use those legs because they are not meant to be here John 15 starting with the first verse and it's just uh as scripture that you are familiar with it's a little bible study I've been going through and just helped me if you I know you have prayed for me you're poor if you don't pour I just call Brother John back and I walk back and said sit down so please Paul he goes and this is as we're reading it as brother shot has mentioned one time many times and we have mentioned the word of God becomes so real that when you're reading it you want to rehearse it over and over I would have started and said I am I I am I am three times just so I can know who's speaking the one who's speaking he's the Creator himself so we're reading this is the grandest opportunity the creator has given you to read his word to read about him said I am the True Vine and my father is the husbandman every just let's this is not we love some but this is his specific every and he told you in the first one that I am the True Vine and my father is the husband man now listen the work of the husbandman this husband man is a faithful husbandman because one day on Calvary the Lord Jesus was hanging there only with one scripture left One Promise from a man that who saw corruption corruption himself from the mouth of David David saw corruption but the word he spoke out that I will not see my Holy One seek corruption the Vine stood on that word and he knew that my husband is is faithful and he fulfilled that one scripture and now this husband man is going to make sure that every he has a job every every branch it's not a group every branch in me that beareth not fruit he takes away and every branch that beareth fruit he purges it that it may bring forth more fruit now you may be said it because it might be a little bit lengthy just asking for God to bless the reading of his word and in verse through it says now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you so if this word now pertains only to those 12 disciples two thousand years ago then Judas is going to be inheriting verse 4. but we know that he did not inherit verse 4. so if this now is not the now 12 2000 years ago because that would put us all outside it will only have 12 people even Judas included because he spoke to Jesus Judas as well but this is the now of 2000 years ago this is right now because if you do believe that this is the right now then the verse four belongs to you then the remaining of the scripture reading belongs to you if it only belonged to the 12 disciples we would stop here we said praise God the 12 disciples were spoken to they were clean Judas included let's close the book and go home this now is right now and right now it has to be opened to you you know that many people live but they don't live right now they live in a mirage of yesterday but never realized that they live right now we are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you what does the cleansing his word the word of Noah the time of Noah will never cleanse you the word of the time of Moses will never cleanse you you will gain some knowledge some history there's only one specific word that will cleanse you it's the word of your time abiding me and I in you so we're in verse 4. abide in me and I in you that's the little title of our sermon this morning and this is all God wanted by creating man he wanted this portion of this verse he wanted you and I to abide in him and he can abide within us within each individual as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can he accept he abide in me well brother and sister this should give at least every single person the rest to rest from every trial every trying you're trying to achieve something just take your hands off say you know what no it says no more can he except he abide in me pushing trying to get something done trying to prove something you can do nothing this is the greatest invitation that God has ever given to man to abide in him in this great Jehovah to abide within you I am the vine now he has to tell us he was speaking about every branch now he's going to openly tell us what branches are with our Pentecostal maybe background or Baptist background we know that the branches speaks of man but we want to hear it from his own lips I am the vine and ye are the brain branches he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me ye can do nothing he is insisting again without him ye can do nothing just take out your the paper maybe a notebook write out every every achievement you want to achieve on this Earth anything you can do you can achieve meaning it's empty because what he wants to do through you it only comes one way when you are abiding in him that's when something real something real of your own purpose on Earth happens when you are abiding within him six says if a man abide not in me his cast forth as a branch and is withered and Men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burnt this is very critical because when we don't know how to check if a man is abiding or is not abiding we don't know how to check when he's already cast out it's a branch or not we have no idea when he's withered when he start start withering withering the only time we notice is when he's already picked up by mind of man When someone tells you someone said this a group of people said this so we're only realizing at the fourth level the three levels before we don't know and Once the mind of man picks you up it has only one destination fire to be burnt seven says if he abide in me and my words then he is clarifying now that abiding is not just a little single place or some some proverb it's when his words when you are abiding in his words you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you here in is my father glorified that he bear much fruits so shall he be my disciple it's it's as I told you it's just a Bible study and it's precious I just if we would take time to go through every word in this scriptures would take us months here they're so precious and the prophet of God said this in the mess in the Paradox in 1961 a little quotation that took my breath away simple but it has to be something that God opens up to you he said you are not here here just to eat and drink and to sleep and to get up and work and then go back eat and drink and sleep again he summarized Our Lives you're not here just to eat and drink and and to sleep and to get up and work and then go back eat and drink and sleep again you are here to be Sons and Daughters of God you are here to take your position and place in Christ this is the prophet saying he said and I am here this morning to call you I would want you to take this calling from the prophet personally to you this morning you are here to be Sons and Daughters of God you are here to take your position in place in Christ and I am here this morning to call you Sons and Daughters of God entitles a lot for instance if I only say a mother what a mother means I would explain probably a few attributes of that but I cannot fully grasp it because I'm not a mother meaning when you say a mother they are just a whole lot to that it's not only because she has children sitting by her no there's there's a more than that Sons and Daughters of God it encompasses a lot we will see as we will be going down if we'll get to it in another message the prophet of God said God put you here to be Sons and Daughters of God and if you fail to get that you fail to receive the very purpose of God the very purpose God put you on Earth to be that's right no matter how honest how decent how moral you might be how good you might be What a fine sociable fellow you might be you'll still miss the calling unless you serve the Lord Jesus and become a son and a daughter of God no matter how good a neighbor you might be how good anything excuse me good anything you may be that's all good and we appreciate that but my brother until you become a Son of God you fail to answer the purpose that God put you on the earth to be you remember the in the Book of John first one John 1 10 through 12. Jesus was in the world as I might be reading it to my read if you want John you suggests to give the background John 1 verse 10. Jesus he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came unto his own this is two thousand years ago he then he came on to his own and his owner received him not but as many as received him to them gave him power just listen what it takes to become Son of God or a daughter of God it's it's not just a simple slogan it takes power not of men the power of God the prophet of God said we can enjoy blessings that's the difference between blessings and the power of God he said the power of God when he comes I have no life within me now to become a son of daughter of God you don't call yourself you cannot make yourself it will take the power the same power that created the Earth the Heaven and Earth that same power had to be included to make you a son and daughter of God because it encompasses a lot as we will be going through that you will find out a son or daughter of God it is a people that's back with God in Fellowship again Aaron Aaron in the Old Testament had that opportunity once a year to experience what a son or daughter of God was once a year he says but 12 John 1 12 but as many as received him many remember that many will receive him where during this time when he came his own received him not very few had that opportunity to receive him but these many is not them it's right now this time and I would like I'm inviting you to receive him but as many as received him to them gave he power this is God giving power to a person a human being said you know what I want you to become son and daughter to me and you cannot do it on your own here's my power it takes power to do that if he gives you power he knows there's another Power there that you have to overcome else he would not have given you power he gave him power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name now coming back to our scripture reading of John 15. the prophet of God said that in letting off the pressure he said now we know that this world is a creation and before the there can be a creation there has to be a creator of that creation and this Creator expresses himself in the creation this creator God expresses himself in his creation we will just hold on that and this Creator expresses himself in the creation if we did not even have a Bible we would still know the truth just as we do the Bible only sets it in order it's not the Bible that gives you the truth to know that God is God because job didn't have the Bible but he knew how did he know he only looked at the botany life a tree and a flower and the Bible the prophet of God says it only sets it in order every human being every human life there's a way they can know if they can only surrender to God to know there's a God somewhere without the Bible even those that can only have the the Quran in their in in in their their homes somewhere there's a way for them to know that there's God the Bible will only set that in order and you will study nature there's a great thing in nature everything that I look at and God has made he is the author of nature nature runs in continuity all nature runs about the same you notice everything as I have said I believe last evening that nature testifies of God we know that God expresses himself in his creation the Creator himself and nature testifies of him the creation testify of the Creator the Creator expresses through the creation if you never had a Bible you could still watch nature and know that this Bible is the truth meaning there's no way to hide out no way to hide out even even Jesus himself when he came on Earth I don't because in that time the scroll the Torah the Old Testament as we call now was a specific book that only the priests would carry it was not at any any any everybody's availability so even when Jesus came on Earth he had to borrow it he has to ask it was given to him in the temple when he wanted to read the book of a scripture of Isaiah 61. they had to deliver him the book The Scroll he didn't have it himself he didn't own it simple people could not own this the Bible as we're owning it today it used to be precious Jesus himself he had he didn't have it they had to give it to him in the temple and after he read it handed it back to the minister why because in the volume of the books he was contained the book spoke of him now we're looking at so nobody can justify himself for not having the Bible or not having or not having the Bible because nature testifies of him we can see again as the prophet of God says that just going to the our scripture now so we've seen the chapter 15. but God has created his creation he has created luminaries the Sun the moon the stars he expresses himself through his creation he has created the animal life He has expressed himself through uh lamb A4 Bullock goat sheep He has expressed himself through the fowl of the air you can say the ego darling in in pigeons he also expressed himself in the botany life and for this reading of the scripture God the Lord Jesus is bypassing all those creations that men could see I see a niggle flying I see the Samoan hen standing there those that could give more meaning to little humble simple people but the Lord Jesus is coming down to a level of he wants and this is a critical moment after he has spent the Passover his last passover with his disciples in John 13. in John 14 as we have heard him many times that he went to prepare us bodies missions bodies now it's chapter 15. God is Not expressing himself Through The Luminaries the Stars the Moon the sun is not expressing himself through the Eagles but he is coming to express himself through a botany life that even a simple a simple peasant could get him what his meaning he's coming here laying himself down he said I am the True Vine not I am the Vine I am the True Vine I looked up the word true it says in the Greek blessing it says it's that which has not only the name and risk resemblance but the real nature corresponding to the name in every respect correspond corresponding to the idea signified by the name real true genuine true is opposite to what is fictitious it's opposite to counter counterfeit it Opposite to imaginary opposite to simulated or pretended it's opposite to what is imperfect it's opposite to frail it's opposite to uncertain meaning when he says that he is making sure that we get it he is the true the certain the perfect the genuine the real one why because there's a false one he does not leave his children in confusion he said I am the True Vine meaning that there is also a false one the prophet of God in the fusion Church age he said there is a true church in a forced church I told you this is a Bible study one verse will take us probably I don't know how maybe we'll spend we'll finish with only two or three verses yes there is a true and and you know those that sleep I always have a little note here put your name and then I'll give it to the deacons so we can make sure that we we balance on that side um there is a fourth one and the prophet of God could tell us how the false one what it is because you don't want to take my little mind I have none here the prophet of God says there is a true church and a false Church there is a True Vine and a false Vine now let's find out what is the false Vine so we can we can at least understand what the true one how would would it look like he said see how it started out in the early church it was called Deeds look how this false Vine comes in our lives it comes through Deeds very very innocent unseen undetected then it became a Doctrine going step by step it became the standard it became the unbending way you can no longer bend it look how this false Vine presents to us to every individual now the True Vine has sent us his prophet to uncover the false Vine he comes in as Deeds something that you do you start doing maybe because someone was doing it maybe because you saw it somewhere maybe you thought it because we know maybe you had the desire for it you will see that the desire the word lust and desire are the same word the only thing is lust is a desire of man which is different from the desire of God anything that's man inspired men's desire it might not look like sin is lost it becomes this true this false Vine comes in sneaks in as the Deeds this helps each and every one of us because now we can start looking inward forget about the one sitting on your side in front of you in the back let's look inwards what Deeds do we have what is motivating us what is what is driving our entire purpose of being of living Deeds unsettled it became a Doctrine you can start speaking about it you can start maybe presenting to someone else it becomes presentable it becomes something to speak about from something a subject it became a standard it grows up and finally it becomes unbending way you cannot bend it anymore it finally took over and God was pushed aside look at this false Vine it came in as a deed look what is happening the True Vine God is pushed aside because there's another Vine coming in oh aren't you glad that God has sent you this precious message how would you how would you know how do you know how to live oh it started so small so quietly so inoffensively I like these precious words from God's mouth himself it looks so good it doesn't look bad it seemed so sound because it's become a Doctrine you can speak about it you can present it we know that in the Garden of Eden the same false Vine came in Adam so bright the Deeds were came in and then we start growing as a Doctrine and she could share the doctrine with her her husband partaking of the force of Art then it caught a hold and like a python like that deadly snake it squeezed out that very breath and killed all the spiritual spirituality there was in the church oh that false Vine is subtle look where the Prophet is starting with the Vine the fourth one coming in as deed Doctrine standard it becomes unbending way shizad the True Vine outside so sound so inoffensive quietly so good oh that false Vine is subtle it is like an angel of Light listen how the prophet described describes him it's like an angel of Light until it gets a hold on you are we still there the prophet of God's by God's divine revelation is uncovering this false Vine to let you see who Christ is the true man why did he say that he is the true vine the prophet of God says this in the resume of the church he said we learn in no uncertain terms that this false Vine is the vine of Satan so Jesus by describing telling I am the True Vine he's telling you to watch out there was a Vine of Satan up there there Gathering is of him oh it's becoming a church they meet in the name of God look how close this false bind is they meet in the name of God in lie that they are Christ what's a force Vine is becoming day this fourth Vine is becoming day they preach they teach they baptize they worship they partake of various rights given by Christ to the church yet they are not of God it becomes not a people but since they say they are God will hold them responsible and each and in each age he speaks of them and to them they remind us of Balaam he had the prophetic office he knew the proper approach unto God as demonstrated in the sacrifice of the clean beasts yet he was not a true Prophet for when God told him not to go to honor balak with his presence he sought to go anyway for he was motivated by his lust for gold and Prestige I remember Brother Kyle preaching that on Wednesday the the the the Balaam was looking at the children of Israel they had the same same sacrifice they had Bullocks they have everything just was just similar same way no different difference but what they forgot to see was that smitten Rock that shout in the camp that light that was there they couldn't recognize that so this false Vine is always on the same Trail and the prophet of God say notice they look the same they are anointed the same but noticed by their fruit how do you know it by their fruit we don't speak fruit fruits all alive so the prophet of God is showing us the characteristics of this Vine and you know what it always grows right alongside the True Vine very very sneaky your eyes and my eyes will never detect them there's no power in us to detect it takes the power of God to come and detect them you see Adam and the serpent they were closer together Cain and Abel same room same roof Esau and Jacob Moses and Balaam Jesus and Judah even from the same tribe the church and the bride closer together we don't want to spend too much time on that we come now on the second verse he said every branch in me that's a John 15. every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away it shocked me to know that could some Branch be in him in that bearing fruit could Branch be in this True Vine and not bearing fruit that that the husbandman has to take it away that's a shocking in this very true vine there are branches because the husband man has to go every inspect to everyone every every branch within there's some there that will not bear fruit that will for which the husband men will have to intervene to cast it away in there that is I'm still wrapping my my mind around that and the prophet of God in the the message serves we would see Jesus he said now when he was on Earth he said I am the vine and ye are the branches now the vine doesn't bear fruit the vine only puts the energy into the branch and the branch bears fruit you don't gather fruit of the of the Vine you gather it off the branch every branch in me that bringeth forth not good fruit he cuts it off the husbandman does that something is in this True Vine that is not appropriate not in the false Vine in the True Value he cuts it off prunes it the church and and anymore and he goes He said I am the viney or the branches and every branch that brings the fourth fruit is pruned and fixed up and purged so it will bring more but the branch that does not bear fruit is plucked off it was where nothing the false mind in the true word now the branches is the one that bears fruit not the Vine so with the church is left as the branches so your eyes and my eyes is the only eyes that God has on the Earth your lips and my lips is his branch he energizes it to bring forth fruit in our ears is his ears our hands to do good is his hand our feet or his feet to carry us to church and to do good bless all the feed that beareth good Tiding so he's talking about the branches here just let's be have a time just to digest what the word and the prophet I was telling about this branch because it's every this there is no way to hide behind any person behind the husband behind the wife behind the mother a father there's no way because this husband man will make sure that every branch is checked every branch is checked is it producing is it bearing fruits or it's not the book of Hebrews you don't have to turn I can read it just to ensure that this is every branch it's the opposite of some or all every bridge this branch will have to be checked this Branch here will have to be checked not by the preaching will be chipped by the fruit if the fruits are not found on this branch there's no other way but being plucked It Off that's the only way to remain in that vine the True Vine Hebrews 12 4-7 said ye have not yet resisted unto blood this is Paul speaking striving against the sin he's telling us that each and every one of us we have not resisted unto blood resisting against the sin what is sin it's unbelief unbelief will come in every fashion every single day to knock at your door and Paul said we have not resisted unto blood striving against this unbelief of this day and ye have forgotten the exaltation which speaketh unto you as unto children my son despise not thou the chest chastening of the Lord nor faint when thou are rebuked of him look who is doing the chastening it's not Satan chastening you the Lord himself will ensure that every branch is chastened will ensure that every branch is rebuked I wish it was a party but this is not a party joining for whom the Lord loveth listen to that want God to love you listen to what he's going to be doing for you for whom the Lord loveth he chastenth and scourgeous every this is not a few every son whom he received every when we're reading something like this and forgive me if maybe I'm acting a little strange here but there's a lot of reverence and fear inside not fear of hell fear that father if I cannot live it to it what would be my purpose on Earth to come to eat to drink to sleep to wake up to go to work come back again and sleep again that would be a waste and God cannot create you for waste there got to be something So Glorious so precious for which your life is here seven says if he enjoy chastening God deals with you as with Psalms for what son is he whom the father chastenth and not there's no way to escape and it's for your good and my good his chastening it's at every sun and every Doris door and you will see why he has to be at the door of every son and every every dollar because it's molding something it's taking you off out of a shell that he can expose you to his son s-u-m-s-o-n the prophet of God in the restoration of the bright tree 1962 goes God is the husbandman of this tree but Jesus told us in 15 1. he takes care of it he watches over his heritage listen to the duties that the husbandman has in this True Vine he's not just getting them together let's this let's get them grow let's get no no no no no no he is watching over his heritage what is his heritage his own word this sons and daughters they only have one end goal they are to become no less than the word itself that's what's the Son and Daughter of God is he said I'm a son of God you want to say that you are word God's word I'm a daughter of God I am God's word that's the equal sign and for you to become that word that word is the creator it's life it takes God's power to make you that word the prophet of God says he watches over his word that's his Heritage he watches over his heritage he watches over his word to confirm it to watch it see where he can get he is going to restore Sons and Daughters of God is full restoration this wipes out all the denominations they're not sons of God sons of God might be their in potential but until they will meet the word of their day and they are identified with it they become a part of it they become one with that word then they are Sons and Daughters manifested by God he said so when these churches begin to organize it's talking about the denominations and things like that he just prunes them off and the church goes on see what he's doing something were found in the True Vine seemingly is pruning that the husband means pulling that off when the Lutheran said we're going to become an organization will be big will be as big as the Catholic all right he just prunes them off he just prunes off the branch because once they were in Luther were in but look where those that came after Luther they were in the method of Luther Luther message Believers were cut off don't you think that message Believers of end time that won't remain in the vinyl will be cut off but he won't be here for my for these people here now that's that's outside for this one everybody is in and Wesley took it right on raise up raise up another prophet ride on raised up another Prophet then soon as Wesley died Wesley was in but those that came in the message of Wesley Wesley died the great prophet what did organize it on Camp Pentecostal soon as he did die he pruned that off it's raising right on up he's going to restore sons and daughters and he said not where does the fruit grow it don't start down here at the bottom it starts in the top where does the sun hit the tree first in the evening light the top of the tree not down on the bottom branches but up there in the top of the tree is where the fruit ripens at so we can we have at least an idea what the True Vine is we know what it stands for we're not the false Vine and how it sneaks in we know that this is this covers every not a bunch not some every every son and every dollar each individual I'm included now we come down to the verse 3. now you are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you the prophet of God says there has to be the cleansing first because you will see that there is a great invitation in verse 4. that great invitation God Jesus could not could not break his own law you can never have fellowship with him outside of the shed blood of Jesus of his own blood body and innocent has to die before he can cleanse you can come into fellowship and remember that as he's inviting you to abide in him him abiding in you what is it for this is for a content for a continuous relationship it's a continuous Fellowship we will see it how it started in the Old Testament to have it the prophet of God says there has to be a pleasing first and that's what the church today and what I want to point to that we need a cleansing you will see that invitation it's so simple he said my word has made you clean abide in me I in you it's a process it takes a lot in between these two verses between three and and four there are a lot there he said before anything can begin from God we've got to have a purging and when we look at and see things that is now under the present conditions existing the way they are we can see that we got to have something to happen before God can continue his program something has to happen a purging a cleansing before this great invitation ever given to man for men who was once lost and worthy could come into the holiest of the Holy and this holy of holies of the Holy could dwell could abide in man something has to happen in the questions and answered answers 59 the prophet of God says now watch I'm going to take like this bottle he's taking a little bottle and it's laying out there in the chicken yard and it's all full of Filth I pick it up we know that that's justification I'm going to use this sinner listen to that he's picking up that Barrel there that's filthy dirty because he has an intention he has a purpose he is going to use that sinner God didn't bring you to this message just to be a believer just say hey Hallelujah everything goes because he wants to use you each and every one of us there is a specific service that God has intended ordained for you that the other fellow cannot do every one of us because there's no one who can replace you no one who can replace brother Chad here no one who can present my brothers sisters back there or me there is a specific purpose service that is all has been only entitled entrusted to you and God wants to use you that puts you at the same level with the prophet with the preacher with the pastor with everybody because you are ill don't look at your body or flesh don't look at how much you you wasted time more thing just know that this is God's word and his word is telling you wherever you are receive it it's yours God has a use of you he wants to use you and there's something specific that only you could be the best in that the prophet of God says I'm going to use this sinner and the next thing I do if I am going to use it I will have to cleanse it the very cleansing that God is doing right now day in and day out he cleanses you through on Wednesdays he cleanses you on Sundays he cleanses you at home as you were walking or working with the message reading your Bible he's cleansing you for a great purpose and then if he cleanse it what do I do to it sanctify sanctify it Sanctified means he wants to impute you his holiness it's a nature a divine nature of God on you before he can use you cleansing you and taking his robe of righteousness of Holiness just this fits you brother we're not just simple men and simple women in this world you've been called you've been ordained toward the robe of deity that's son and daughters of God you've been ordained you've been elected to wear a robe of deity on Earth in so much that people around you will never understand who you are remember one day I was reading somewhere I think maybe brother Billy Paul gave a testimony the one time he went in his father was the brother Brandon was at the table in a little room meditating Billy Paul opening slowly the door to sneak in to see is to see what's going in going on there he saw his daddy then in his mind he started thinking because of what he saw the day before the healings and things in the campaign Trail in his mind he said God is this my daddy or or it's you his dad was looking on that side with the scriptures reading and this is Billy Paul maybe few few yards away few feet away I might say is this my daddy oh God it's you inside of him and the dad who was working meditating here Tundra and said Billy it's your dad it's a man wearing the robe of deity that you can you cannot tell who who it is is it man we said God both that's what God wants to in wants to do with you your days are the most glorious day that ever lived on earth your feet are the Most Blessed the feet that would walk into someone's home let's go back to this he said the word sanctify means clean same thing as holy holy in Hebrew words the sanctify is in a Greek the word sanctify means clean and set aside for service this bride every member of it is to be put to service there's no nearer portion and bigger portion every member of this bride is going to be put to the service he said but then blessed are they that hunger and thirst for righteousness for they shall be filled then they will they are put in in service so as in verse 3 the Lord is declaring ye are clean by the word I have spoken to you it has to be something that if you are the one he's speaking to you will respond to that you will say that's me it's not for somebody else if you have received it if you have accepted if you if if within you God God give me the terminologies within you you are assured that this message came for me this came waited that Moses could not sin entirely that Isaiah could not see it entirely that any other Prophet they desired they longed to see this day and here I'm living in this day this is for me if you are convinced that this came to you then receive that cleansness and once you receive that you are candidate to the verse 4. the prophet of God said when Peter had been called and justified by Believing on the Lord Jesus Christ and in John 17 17 Jesus Sanctified them through the word there's nothing outside of this war that will ever sanctify you that it will ever make you ready for your robe of deity there's nothing else you will see that if we have time here to go in the Old Testament they had the um the uh the ashes of the red Aether which was called the water of separations it's not even water it's it's ashes you touch those ashes you are you are a sinner you are unclean it has to be sprinkled upon you you have to be under the ashes then you are Sanctified you are clean any other shape of you coming in contact with the ashes you are filthy unclean the only way this word could sanctify you it's when it's there you are there it's sprinkling over you you can sit close to it you can walk closer to it you are unclean that's the way it used to be in the Old Testament you cannot touch the the ashes of the red April which was called for the water of separations you touch it you are unclean let the priests sprinkle it over you then you are clean the only way to be clean let this word be all that you can do what do what does the word say what I'm here it's there what does it say then get sprinkled then it will clean any other shape you want to touch it to manipulate it to your own way just touching you or made unclean he was the word so he Sanctified them he said father I sanctify them through the word you've got to accept it you're cleansing the prophet of God says if I was a young man this is a message a man running from the the presence of the Lord if I was a young man and looking for a wife to be married and here stood a girl that met every qualification that I thought it took it took to make a woman why morally she was a queen and lovely and a fine personality a real Christian everything that I could think of to make me a good wife no matter how much I say she is perfect she is exactly right she isn't mine until I accept her and the responsibility of her being my wife that's the same thing with the message you might say it's right or this and that or the other and say I sympathize with it I believe is the truth but you've got to accept it and it's got to become a part of you this message got to become a part of you and you are part of it you've then it's yours when you marry this certain woman that you have chosen you are one and that's the way you are with Christ when you see him manifested and made real then you are a part of him and he is a part of you and together you are a part of the message this message is no longer writings it's me you're talking about the message or you're talking about me that's who I am it's the word it's life we know that before we can go to the abide that's we haven't even gone into our subject yet but we're still here God knows so and Jesus would tell you that no more can you do could you do except he abide in me you will remember that even the Lord Jesus himself who lived fully the sonship he lived every day being a son of God that's our example as I told you in the Old Testament Aaron had experienced that just once a year people did not know because when he when he was walking in you remember he had to be pomegranate and the belt as even his walk that's the only way they would know that Aaron is still alive is the way he was walking into that invisible place if he did not walk the people would start mourning outside it was by his walk inside not laying down walking inside the bells were set to such a way that a sound was coming from the Bell would you imagine if Aaron was not walking in the holy of the holies if he was not walking in death was in it was sound proof there's no other way to know whether he was alive or not whatever was happening there was a secret even if you would have asked him he would not explain it it would tell you there's a part of Mana there there's a little white hanging there he will not explain but life was inside they only discovered that with the rod which was another branch of an almond tree that branch a natural Branch went back to what it used to be that's when this Branch a son and daughter of God once it goes into that Holy of the Holy that's where the abiding is they could go back to what they used to be a son or daughter of God is adamant before the fall you said I'm a Son of God I'm a daughter of God you mean to say that you are in the condition that Adam was before the fall or he had only one reliance God said God said that's what son and daughter of God is more to it and even when he was here he could tell you in John 5 19 you don't have to turn on he said then answered Jesus and said unto them verily verily I say unto you the son can do nothing of himself this son our example the lamb could do nothing of himself but what he seeth the father do this place what he seeth John 5 30 it says Akin of my own self do nothing as I hear his saying was connected with God his hearing connected with God that's what his son and daughter of God will be his saying will be connected with God his hearing will be connected with God in John 8 28 he said I do nothing of myself but as my father has taught to me hearing is connected with God seeing connected with God Doctrine anything he knows he's been taught by God Sons and Daughters will come to a level that all they see is God all they hear is God all they ever know has been taught by God not by any other source and then 15 5 goes I am the vine ye are the branches now is explaining as exposing us oh we are those branches of the True Vine he that abideth in me in I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing is I said this abiding there's a little condition there if you abide it's on condition I don't want to read through this but in the Old Testament just to resume it quick in the Old Testament when a sinner a sinner had the conscience that has been separated from God that he was he broke the fellowship with God now when he is coming back he was coming through the water of Separation within within the out of court sprinkled by the ashes of the red afro mixed with a cedar and his burned together he was Washed by the Water of separation to come into the out of court then he would go within the first Veil which is also called The Holy place he would walk there because there were seven strikes of blood of the Lamb he brought in that he was putting into remembrance that something paid the price for me it's not me I could not hear what I see there death struck this place on my behalf then he would walk into under the stripes there in the Holy place in the first Veil but for the second Veil which is the holy of the holiest it required a priest the high priest which was he was a deadly preparation an entire year of a man who has been dedicated called to just intercede for the sin of the people he had to make sure that everything he was living day by day or twist 165 days was not something that he would lose his life inside your Center you would go you do whatever you do leave her any way that anybody lives but this man was watching every single day this is natural every single day his motives his actions his thoughts wake up to make sure that there's nothing that he will be unaware of that would cause him to die there it would be his death and the sinner's death he wouldn't ensure that everything is combed through to come that one day to take the blood and to walk into the holiest of the Holy the prophet of God said the outer Court the light that was there was a firmament sometimes it would go dark that's why the the center in the outer Court was up and down they don't know what to do they're fighting with the word when the word said give tithing it's not for them live this way it's not for them they're fighting with that but within the holy place the first Veil the prophet of God said the word says that the word uh candlesticks they were burning sometimes they would go smoky you'll see a Christian who's been a Christian for years things they are doing the way they are acting you said something went wrong no you don't know which place they are out of Courts the light goes dark the firmament even in the inside the holy place the Candlestick would burn burn out smoky up and down but once you go inside there the light thereof was of this kind of Glory the supernatural light the prophet of God says little light Hanging On The Mercy Seat that will make that once you are in Aaron was not allowed into to to stay in because God has not done the propitiation work yet he has not fully atoned for the sin of the people he would go in and and come out and the prophet of God says out of in the out of court you were not in Fellowship you were in fellowship with the people there and out of court but not with God not with God you could be sprinkled with the water of separations but you had no fellowship with God you were in the process you could have fellowship with brothers that were in the fellowship in the out-of-quarter sisters you have fellowship with man but fellowship with God not yet and the prophet of God says now do not remain there in the Arab Court my precious brother or sister you've yet not approached the fellowship you can be in the Holy place the first Veil you have fellowship with brothers and sisters there the prophet of God said you have not the fellowship with God you're still not entered into the fellowship he said notice when you come in separation making confession all right you can fellowship with them you come in under the blood you can fellowship with them that's true enough but to fellowship with God you have to go into the presence of God and that's into the Shekinah Glory and one man once a year referring to Aaron was dressed to go in into she kind of Glory where that he fellowshipped with God face to face before he can go in Aaron was stripped of his clothes by Moses dressed up differently the clothes he had all year long regardless of his Holiness staying praying concentrating those clothes could not even allow him to go inside they had to strip every Clause every every every every piece of clothes on him to dress him up differently and you can come to the the temple you will see one person dressed up differently as we all come in the natural here if there's a wedding brother a brother could wear the same suit I'm wearing sitting up there during his wedding you can even come be have a confusion when he walks in who got married but for a sister I doubt there are two that would be dressing up the same way the same day Aaron has to be dressed up as a bride to walk into stripped from every piece of cloth they had he had on this was just the natural to go and experience one day of sonship and daughtership of God the prophet of God said one man once a year went in there Aaron but when our real sacrifice Jesus Christ died at Calvary he ran the Veil in two making a way with his own blood that whosoever will brother These Are Holy things that God has allowed our motto tongue to speak about when it becomes a reality when it becomes a a deposit of a revelation inside of you you said God you are allowing me to speak of what you did for me holy when Abraham Lincoln when when brother Graham says that a a black man because he fought for the black people here the slavery and when that slave would go there he would not even touch the Blood of Abraham Lincoln because of a reverence that he gave his blood for me when Abraham Lincoln was a sinner and this was a sin how much do we have to reverence the blood of Jesus Christ this is not something red we will remember it's one two thousand years on one little cross There Something red this is the very word that you have been presented today day their night this is the only blood that will cleanse you this word he's been so real to us in this place we've seen his glory he ran the Veil making away with his own blood this is divine blood this is the blood of life all life was contained inside whosoever will can come into this kind of Glory in the presence of the Holy Ghost and be filled with power of Pentecost as they did after the veil had been torn down yellow brown black white male female Gentiles Jew whosoever will there's nothing I can prevent anyone from entering in you did this you have no right I have no right whosoever will let him come and drink from the Fountain of the Lord when they come into that she kind of Glory Anointed with the Holy Spirit then they got fellowship with God again then they are Sons and Daughters of God you hear what son and doors of God it's when this group of people individual every one of them when they have Fellowship back with God again meaning we were before because you cannot come in today when you were not you have to be there before you can come back and fellowship again Sons and Daughters of God is a group of every individuals that have been cleansed by the word of God and returned back to fellowship with God again then he can dwell in them they can dwell in him it's a personal invitation John 15 verse 4. it's a personal invitation thank you brother John for the testimony you gave gave this morning it's the same God who does it simple way little thing little wallet God had to find that wallet because it meant so much for that lady God has to find that wallet God had to come down God had to walk God had to do what he did there coming every stone looking up his God doing that and God knew where it was and found it when you are into that presence your kind of Glory every move has a reason the prophet of God says allow me to read this a little bit lengthy I don't know what time it is we're going to be stopping somewhere in the hidden life 1955. the prophet of God said forgive me it's just something burning inside the thing is that sometimes I tell a wife people around that this could be my last breathing day you know what I pray and desire that God let us say I fall this body falls down it will be testifying of you and notice the dressing of this high priest before he could enter the Veil he had to be stripped and dressed right to go in that's what the church is today what it needs is a stripping what do you and I need it's a stripping and you you know I know you know what's stripping you need in your life because he cannot come closer to anything else but his work he's a jealous God he cannot if there is a deed a Doctrine standard an unbending way there he cannot be there he cannot be there because there's another Vine there in this Vine is humble he's loving in his jealous he will not come in fight with the other Vine who just stay away that's what the church is what it needs is a stripping of of all these little courts and things and dressed in the righteousness of Jesus Christ he had a pomegranate no I skipped there and ready to enter in his walk must be different brother if I walk the same way I was walking a week ago it's something I had to be regretful for my walk today has to be different from yesterday let me remind you we are only Immortals once don't forget that we're meant to be immortal we are only mortal once and that could stop in any time and while we're still Mortals let something of God himself write him in the sand of your life his walk must be different along the hems of His Garment he had a pomegranate and then a bell and as he walked his walk was so perfect brother and sister this isn't a natural a man who can walk in sin before the blood of Jesus was shed on Calvary perfect Aaron did meaning representing you and me our walk on this Earth has to be transformed by the power of God to become a perfect walk that you open your mouth your sister can realize it he's saying the truth your brother can say is saying the truth nothing but the truth not my mind not your mind not your what you know from your family traits family lineage his work was so perfect until the bells played holy holy holy unto the Lord if the outside would not hear that sound death has struck Aaron if my walk is not playing that sound death in the camp what we need today is not whether we are assemblies or Church of God or Oneness or whatever it might be I will walk ought to be playing to the public holy holy holy unto the Lord another thing he must be anointed before he goes in he must not only he was dressed up he made a preparation for this one day through the entire year he got to be stripped off dressed up correctly now he has to be anointed the anointing oil was made with the Rose of Sharon in the crushing of the Rose brought forth the perfume and they put it on the the oil that run on Aaron's beard plumbed to the Hem of His skirt covered all over with the anointing oil walking right living right moving right dressed right there he went taking before him the blood and as he went behind the curtain into the third room in the holy of the holiest there was a veil dropped behind him that the outside world could know could not see him no more no more not even a little shape of him not even not not even a shadow of Aaron and every man or a boy or woman or girl that ever is Anointed of God and Walks Behind that Temple the veil of God the Holy Ghost puts him in a secret place Aaron was in a secret place a son and daughter of God ought to be living in a secret place the world cannot see where you are they will never understand you the veil drops behind him in the world and all of its things are cut off behind him the world and everything cut off behind has no remembrance of what is outside the prophet of God says this that when put put Aaron's right in there a few more minutes put Aaron's rod in there and all the dead amountry but as it went under the Shekinah Glory everything it was was restored again a dry stick it was a branch but because it was in it we went to abide one night only just to abide one night it was restored back now when the Lord Jesus wants you to come and abide within him what is he wanting to do restore you back Adam a son or a daughter of God is a restored human being it's a restored deity the prophet of God says God was the great God and Adam was an immature God a Son of God a daughter of God is a restored amateur God in humility and simplicity he said and all the dead almond tree but as it went under the Shekinah Glory everything it was was restored back that's the way a sinner is when he goes under the Shekinah Glory of the Holy Spirit the veil dropped behind him everything that he ought to have been listen to that everything you ought to have been not from mind man's perspective from God's perspective everything you ought to have been a Son of God blooms out of him again everything you ought to have been there's only one thing that can restore it in your life when you become a son or daughter of God you go back to what you used to be what God intended for you the perfect one the Creator the one who knows everything what he you he ordained you to have been you find it when you become a son or daughter of God remember overnight it bothered blossomed and growed almond almonds on it fruits of the spirit love joy long-suffering goodness gentleness patience that's what we need to get in the third step the holiest of the Holy get over into the Shekinah Glory where that little sacred light I love that no not the light of the firmament outside not that the Kendall lights they could go smoky inside in the Holy place no but there was a little sacred light that no one else could see outside only Aaron saw it once a year but today he's giving you and me access into that to that little sacred light sacred light it was hanging over The Mercy Seat that nobody else could see it the congregation out and out could never see that they never knew because Aaron could not talk of what he saw inside he could not so the children of Israel never knew what was behind the veil the only time they couldn't know what was behind the veil was on Calvary so Moses no one knew what was behind there only Aaron once a year he could not talk about it little sacred light hanging over The Mercy Seat there was a wedding going on there between Aaron and the little sacred light in such a way that when the when the the this Branch Aman Rod was inside there was a little wedding there everything that it ought to have been was restored back in one night but he's not calling us for one night no he wants to abide continuously in you you in him in a continuous relationship continuous Fellowship you know the message has been we I don't know talking about myself it's been so crazy that whatever you are you speaking about it in the restroom in the shower every place there's something that you're finding yourself speaking the word unconsciously you've experienced that unconsciously speaking the words he wants us to abide in that place and he said that's the place to stay that's the place to abide brother and sister don't be out there out of the court in the outer courts not in the Holy place he wants us the prophet is telling us the inside the holies of the Holy third room that's the place to stay were the manna part of manner set down by the ark outside they will not see that manner The Outsider will get it and it will rot it will get to work on Tales the evening but there inside since it's been there it's fresh it's once you know what is inside the little place you have no desire to go out I assure you once a Believer gets inside that place under the shed blood of Jesus Christ you go into you discover what is inside there brother and sister the world has flown from you that's the place to live Aaron could only be once one day a year but God is inviting you to live there to stay there that you and that little sacred light you can be one the curtains is dropped behind you he said today people just have enough religion to make themselves miserable oh people just have enough religion to make themselves themselves a miserable knowing that they ought to do this they are trying to escape hell well if that's the way I felt about it brother I don't know what I would do oh get in with Christ Shadow from the things of the world for to commune with him is a pleasure how many could say Amen to that to commune with him it's a pleasure it's beautiful it's something that fills and satisfies the soul something that gives you peace that surpasses all understanding all the crosses all the crosses become flying wings you have a cross your bearing enter in it's going to be turned by the power of the Holy Ghost into a frying wing for you all the burdens are chariots Wheels you have a burden want to Will on your chariot God will has the power to transform that oh you can fly away my burdens are light yoke up with him the yoke is all padded with hallelujahs when you are once inside the veil listen to this when you are once inside the veil with him he becomes your life he becomes your life let me I'm going to be stopping at the verse six those were first five that I skipped a lot verse 6 he said if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and Men gathered them who's Gathering them mans men's idea men's idea picks you up factor factor searching engine fit backs you up the voice of the signs all this they pick you up because the men have to pick you up have to prepare you to be burning and cast them into the fire and they are burned but listen if you abide the prophet coming back God be with us give me a few more minutes listen 10 minutes what should be done if God God's word is in US in abideth in there it's just speaks for itself ask what you will and it will be given to you not that that's a found in John 15 7 if you want to mark it down see Jesus said if he abide in me my words in you not today one thing tomorrow next day something else and backslid and over here and down here and down there it shows you never got nothing to begin with if you you're one thing one day in the next week another thing else and next little Peckerwood I don't know what it is you'll translate that for me later a little pickle Ward comes along picks on a hollow tree you run after it and then next one over here Mission trotting don't know where you do belong then Christ do not abide in you his word isn't there because it's stable you never turn to Darkness in John to scripture second John 1 5 9 I'm going to read it for you whosoever transgresses and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ has not gone he that abideth in the doctrine of Christ he has both the father and the son now the branch and the vine I'm going to be reading this message here before we close now the branch and the vine is connected together the branch and the Vine and God has always tried to get a people that he could so dwell in listen to the desire of God and his purpose for you he's always tried to get a people that he could so dwell in that he could show his glory among his people if he abide in me in my words abide in you seven you shall ask what you will and shall be done unto you I didn't want to leave that up because the circle of our little subject verse 7. if he abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you your will will be nothing else but his fruit he said now it just can't go one time then of the next time if you're biting him abide means to rest there say right there that's what the prophet is saying and he said because it's no more for it's it isn't you no more it's the word that's in you and the word is God you will only ask what the word tells you to ask know the day you're living then and ask accordingly because you will only ask what the word tells you to ask you are not speaking your own word you're speaking his word God wants your hands he wants your eyes he wants your tongue he wants your lips he wants your ears once your hands and feet so he can bring forth fruit through you you are his workmanship if he abide in me and my word in you as we might stand let's stand up and musician you might make your way this way if he abide in me and my word in you then ask what you will it shall be done unto you uniting the bride back with the word that's what it is which is God we become a part of his word part of his life for we are flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone in life of his life then we can no more perish than God himself could perish that's what the Holy Ghost is the uniting the abiding produces that he said you become a living unit units walking on Earth with the life of God inside when you abide it takes the abiding not one day in one day out come that the veil would drop behind you the world forsaken completely you shut in with him there you'll be bloomed back to what you ought to have been son and daughters of God these are amateur Gods restored back they live where God lives they live in him and he lives in them it might be playing something and the world is failing apart the prophet of God says you want to know where the secret lies [Music] in all of this where the secret lies he said the power of visions and things is back to the word it's the word of God Jesus was the word he was the manifestation of God God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself and he was the word in the beginning was the word and the Word was made flesh and the word wants to be made our flesh let's bow our heads precious Heavenly Father we do recognize one thing
