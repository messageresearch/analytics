========================================

how were you sealed with the holy spirit not because you came up here and cried not because you came up here and shouted not because you danced around you spoke in tongues you have a ministry you have gifts of healing you have supernatural you have prophecy you have this that and the other you were sealed with the holy spirit under one condition after that ye have heard the words of truth the gospel of your salvation you believed do not allow somebody to tell you that it's anything other than that can it come with all of those things that i just described absolutely but you can also have all of those things i just described before this happens in and of itself there is only one evidence for the true baptism of the holy spirit receiving the truth for your age period that might make you jump and shout and stand on your head it may make a tear trickle out of the corner of your eye or it may have absolutely no response on you except for a changed life that it will have but that changed life may not even be represented in a physical viewing it may simply be that you changed within because again you take somebody that's born in this message in a real godly christian atmosphere and home they may already be walking the walk and talking the talk and may have all of you fooled but the only person they can't fool is themselves and they know they don't have the goods because they don't have the peace and the comforter on the inside but when they hear the words of truth and they believe on that they receive the comforter and the peace on the inside and they're the only ones that know about it and there's nothing external that changes that's why i say it can come with a lot of things or it may not come with anything outwardly but one thing is for certain you as the individual will know maybe nobody else will know but you will know that you have received the words of truth for your age and it doesn't really matter what everybody else knows and what everybody else sees and whatever everybody else thinks you're the one you're the one that has to know you're the one that matters
