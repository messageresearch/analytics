Rebecca Benjamin have made the long journey down to bring their little baby you guys can come on down amen so it's been hard for them to travel down the last little while through the pregnancy and then the delivery of their baby but praise God they were able to make the trip down and have little Jonathan Jason Benjamin dedicated I love this little guy's name Jonathan means God has given and

adorable and you can see they're doing greatest parents so far they're having well-behaved quiet and feared amen he's off to a good start amen let's turn our Bibles to the book of Philippians thank you musicians Philippians chapter 2 I want to remind you that we leave for our family vacation this evening so I appreciate your prayers we'll be back Lord willing uh Saturday evening and plan to be back in the service on Sunday um but on for the Wednesday night service when I'm gone I've asked brother Ben siebo to take the service so he's going to be able to do that for us to be praying for him and pray for us and we'll pray for you amen also I got a message from Brother Emmanuel brother Emmanuel and brother Randy science made it safely to the Congo they were there they they had a long flight long journey they got there slept a few hours and woke up and right into service right into fellowship and right in the service and they have a busy weekend scheduled and a busy month so remember to keep them in prayer I asked him to send us updates so hopefully I'll be able to keep you updated as we go along amen let's look at Philippians chapter 2 verse 5 now let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the Cross amen God bless you as you're seated keep the Bibles open we're going to go through the scripture amen and ask God to bless us as we look into his word amen I took for a subject humility for Redemption I don't even know if that's a subject we'll preach we just have to put a name somewhere amen but we've been talking about this subject of humility and Redemption and all of these things quite quite a while but the more we look into it the more it opens up the more we pay attention to it the more we realize that this is this is where we're at this is everything that that God is wanting to use us but what condition was me being to be used we know that God wants to do a work and he wants to do it in human flesh we know that we know that this end time that he's come but he's come in the form of his bride and he's here Amen to to display himself he's here that she amen will grow in His image and be so much like him she will be him amen and so but we we have to be in His image we have to be like him amen we can't just make claims and say that I'm the bride and Christ is in me but but she must grow into his very likeness amen for she has been predestinated to be conformed Into His Image praise the Lord and I'm so thankful for that so as we look at this I want to look at this scripture again and I want to look at this word humble where it says he humbled himself I think that's amazing he humbled himself it has to do with free moral agency has to do with the willingness it has to do with a choice he humbled himself and this word humbled uh in the Greek means the humble oneself to make low to bring low to level reduced to a plane and metaphorically this is definition 1B to bring into a humble condition reduced to meaner circumstances I.E to design a lower rank or place to to a base to be ranked below others who are honored or rewarded to Humble or abase Myself by Humble living this is what Jesus did to himself he humbled himself he brought himself low amen he brought himself down he brought himself in rank lower amen than others he brought himself to the lowest he brought himself level amen and and this is what God did this is what Christ did I want to look at this in Hebrews chapter 1 verse 1. I've got a lot of scriptures that I want to go through that's why I did a PowerPoint this morning so that I can keep going and we don't lose the time of flipping but just jot them down so that you'll have them and if you and if you did speed or sword drills and Sunday school class and you're fast you can keep up with me if not you can jot it down but I'm going to have it on the overhead Hebrews 1 1 God who at sun-dried times and in diverse manner spake in time passing to the fathers by the prophets hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he hath appointed heir of All Things by whom also he made the world whom being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person and upholding All Things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high and so this is the description of Jesus but there's a phrase I want to pull out this word express image amen he who in verse 3 says who being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person and upholding All Things by the word of his power and I want to look at this Express image uh it means it can be used for an instrument used to engrave or carving or stamping like an imprint I'm going to get down to the definition there that I have highlighted in the orange it says the exact expression the image of any person or thing marked likeness precise reproduction in every respect this is Jesus Christ the express image of God why because God is a spirit is that right God is the spirit so he has to make a reflection of himself upon Earth and Jesus becomes that exact image in flesh he becomes the stamped image amen and he's reflecting the exact image of God Amen so that if you want to know what God is look at Jesus Christ because he is he is the express image of God amen he's he's not in the same form because then he would be spirit and we couldn't see him does that make sense that's why you come into flesh amen amen and out from God come the word and he called that son and he took the word amen and he was in different forms coming down through but he finally came in flesh born of a woman and he was the express image the exact replica the perfect likeness of God himself this is what makes him God on Earth because he's the exact replica the exact uh a reflection and the the life of God the spirit of God dwelt inside him and fullness he says hear that Colossians 2 9 for in him dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead bodily so that means if I want to know what God is like I can look to Jesus Christ he's the expressed image he's the fullness of the godhead bodily amen and another scripture in second Corinthians 4 6 it says for God who commanded the light to shine out of Darkness has shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ so the the glory of God is seen in the face of Jesus Christ and this word face doesn't just mean this part of your body this word face in the Bible means your person your very person and and if I want to see the glory of God I can see it in the person of Jesus Christ he's the expressed image expressed image of God in whom the fullness of the God had dwelt bodily amen and in his face in the person I can see the uh I have the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ is that right so when we look at Jesus and we look at his life and we look at what he did what's he expressing to us he's expressing the very character and nature of God amen so so we find when we come back and look at at Philippians 2 5 amen this is the expression of God the way God is expressing himself on Earth amen and and God has the capacity to become humble such a strange thought amen he who existed before anything else existed he who existed of himself and by himself without any help from anywhere and everything that was made both in heaven and earth is made from him and by him amen they they they they were made and they exist and he holds them where they are he is above everything he's the creator of everything but yet he's able to come down he's able to come low he's able to be humble this this I find fascinating and Jesus was expressing the glory of God Amen the knowledge of the glory of God and his very person he was expressing characters of God hey many many men so Philippians 2 5 sound now we know he he made himself of no reputation took upon him in the form of a servant made in the likeness of man and and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient to death even the death of the Cross that's all describing Jesus who's the express image of God right but now he comes in verse the beginning he says let this mind be in you now all of a sudden now you are to become another reflection amen he was the very reflection of God now you're to become the reflection of Christ as Christ dwells in you and so he he he was the perfect image and reflection and Declaration of of the Unseen God became visible became tangible in Jesus Christ amen and now Christ is becoming visible intangible In You and I but we have to let this mind be in US amen we have to think this way we have to conduct ourselves this way this is the plan this is the path amen so when I begin to look at this uh a certain I say understanding begin to grow for me amen and it was this that in order to manifest Christ the first thing I need to do is make myself of no reputation that sounds easy I mean that rolls right off the tongue but that's one of the hardest things for a human being to do it is so hard in this word that says make himself of no reputation this word reputation means actually means nothing it means be void to be empty to be nothing he made himself void empty nothing he made himself absolutely nothing and took on him the form of a servant so if I'm going to follow after Christ I need to make myself I'm supposed to have this mind that was in him this is the mind I'm supposed to have which who being in the form of God thought it not Robbie to be equal with God Amen we know that this is part of the mindset understanding where we came from understanding that where we originated understanding that we were part of God and with God before the foundation of the world that's part of this understanding but being that that's part of the understanding it's almost like it's foundational for the next part Because unless you get the first part you'll never be able to come to the second part because only those that are part of God can take the nature of God and make themselves of no reputation because Lucifer can't do that humans of themselves can't do that amen because that whole nature of Lucifer got injected in humanity at the fall he found through the serpent a way that he can inject himself into the human race and with that he brought Pride with that he brought arrogancy with that he brought all of these uh other things self-preservation and all of these things was entered into Humanity right there amen and without without a revelation that I was before I came in Fallen flesh I was I was part of God I was one of his attributes part of his thinking he had a design and desire to express me in this life now I've fallen into hybrid condition but this hybrid condition will not Define me because my existence was before the hybrid condition so I will not let the Fallen nature Define who I am I will not let the flesh control me amen because this part of me that's been awakened by the baptism of the Holy Ghost has been quicker than life that part was somewhere before it came into this vessel and it was part of this God this divine nature this Supreme Being so there it carries with it characteristics from God so you can see how if we're going to let this mind be in US which was also in Christ Jesus you have to understand where you came from you have to understand who you are and also how you got into this condition and then you can make yourself of no reputation and then take on the form of a servant and then humble ourselves and then be obedient even unto death this is what we're supposed this is the mind that's supposed to be in US so we have so much fun talking about the first half that this mind being you which was in Christ who being in the form of God thought it not Robert to be equal with God but made him what this the first part was great I want this mind to be in me which also in Christ that I came from God that I was part of God and all of those that's wonderful amen but that's not the end of what Paul is trying to express amen if that's true about you amen then then if you're going to express God the way Christ expressed God then you better make of yourself of no reputation take on the form of a servant praise God and humble ourselves and be obedient praise God this is why brother bear says the path Up Is Down it's so clear to me in the scriptures and it keeps exploding everywhere I look he says second Corinthians 8 9 says for you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ that though he was rich yet for your sakes he became poor that ether is poverty might be rich this is this is the action that Jesus Christ took amen and if that's the path he walked what path should I walk now I thought of this humility for Redemption because the the path for our Redemption amen came through humility Jesus humbled himself made himself no reputation took on the form of a servant humbled himself and was obedient amen and what did he do that for to bring about Redemption and you and I how am I going to be a partaker of redemption if I come through pride and arrogancy and selfishness and self-will and all of these things and then also how am I going to perpetuate redemption or bring Redemption to anyone else in the world Amen if I don't come through the same characteristics because we want Redemption for our family we want Redemption for the last predestinated Soul we want Redemption for the world we want see we're not just here to get saved amen but but God has a purpose in our lives and we're here to manifest Christ and we're also I believe with all my heart that I'm also a door I'm also adore to Salvation I'm also a lighthouse that can point the way I'm also a gate that somebody can enter in by and find them their way to Christ why because I know the way because Within Me is the word amen Christ dwells within so I want to be a door I don't want to be a barbed wire fence I don't want to be amen an obstacle to Redemption I want to be a door to Redemption but if I am going to be an instrument that God will use for Redemption of loved ones Redemption of others that are lost if I'm going to be that instrument amen then I'm going to have to follow the same pattern because if Christ brought Redemption through humility through surrender through making himself low then how am I going to perpetuate Redemption through Pride arrogancy selfishness it must come to the same line through the same characteristics praise God amen so this is the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ he was rich yet for our sakes he became poor that we through his poverty might be rich you know I love that but can I replicate that can I can I replicate that can I lower myself for somebody else's salvation can I be of no reputation and humble and a servant so that somebody else can find Redemption I love that he did that that's beautiful for me and that that has changed my life but can I perpetuate it can I manifest it Isaiah 53 2 he says for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of dry ground he hath no form nor coming this and we wish when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him he is despised and rejected of men a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not and this is the path he chose this is by his choosing this is the path he chose and he stayed humble and he stayed a servant and he stayed submissive to the whole plan of God Amen and why did he do that for he did it for me amen and and now all of a sudden can I have enough love in my heart for Souls that I can follow his pattern can I really make myself of no reputation can I really Paul says I've become all things to all men that I might win some amen hey praise God and the message humble thyself but the man says look at Jesus nothing but one bundle of Love see he was God manifested he God expressed himself through him no wonder Miracles and things happen his humble life in consecrated life to come from being God to be a man here on Earth to express God through himself that's what made him what he was I've always said what made Jesus God to me was the way he humbled himself he was so great and yet he could be so small what this is what the prophet said what made Jesus God to me was that he could humble himself amen that we we can see a lot of people can do a lot of things amen but this this true humility is the nature of God so he God was expressing himself through Christ and so this was Christ but what is our what is our objective in this day amen to get saved live a happy life go in the Rapture but really we are to become his in his very image we're to become an expression of him on Earth through the bride so we must reflect his life we must reflect his nature we must reflect his glory and this is this is what made him gone to the prophet is that he could humble himself and maybe what would make us bride is that we can follow the same pattern amen maybe what we're we're looking for is the character I mean everybody wants to have power everybody wants to have what they call power everybody wants to have manifestations because if I have if I have powerful manifestations amen they can be a Vindication of me right that you can everybody wants to be proved everybody wants to be Vindicated everybody wants to be respected everybody wants to be held in honor everybody want you know this is just human nature that's just the normal basics of human nature but Jesus was able to go amen he was able to lower himself in such a way that he would be accused of everything he would be accused of being a devil he would be I mean even when he manifests the sign of the Messiah and he manifests amen the the things that that that that that declared that God was with him amen they attributed to the works of a devil not to God because and he was able to stay humble stay submissive make himself of no reputation amen praise God James 4 comes and says humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord and he shall lift you up and first Peter 5 5 says likewise you younger submit yourselves unto the Elder yay all of you be subject one to another and be clothed with humility for God resisted the proud and giveth grace to the humble humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you in due time this is always the path this is the only way that this will work praise God so I just want to keep moving there's some things that I want to get to I want to keep moving quickly and under influence he says see the the one over his feet government humility this is the Angels the cherubims that are in the presence of almighty God with the six wings two they cover their face two they cover their feet and two they fly with and he says that one was over the feet covered humility watch this servant now before God his face covered in reverence his feet covered in humility yes very conscious be very conscious of your littleness all of us is trying to be some big somebody I'm Dr so and so the great so-and-so of so and so you are nothing that's right you're nothing if you want to know how great you are put your finger in a pool of water and pull it out and find the hole where you put it in see there is nothing there and that's what we are God can do without us but we can't do without him who who are you see being conscious of how little you are the Way Up Is Down he that humbles himself shall be exalted he that exalt himself shall be abased amen this is a principle that holds true in life it is held true in my life is certainly held true in my life and I believe it always will amen he who humbles himself then God can lift them up but he who exalts himself shall be abased amen so the Way Up Is Down in Luke 14 says for whosoever exalted himself shall be a base this is Jesus speaking and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted so this is a pattern with God and God was able to Humble himself Christ came and made himself with no reputation this is the pattern with God but when we see Lucifer over in Isaiah 14 he says how art thou fallen from Heaven o Lucifer son of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground which did weaken the Nations for thou has said in thine heart I will Ascend unto Heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God I will sit also upon the Mount of congregation in the size of the north I will descend above the heights of the clouds I will be like the most high yet thou shall be brought down to Hell to the sides of the pit that's what Jesus said if you exalt yourself you'll be abased he's exalted himself he's going to be brought down to Hell to the size of the pit then look what he says I will and all of his eye Wills have no humility whatsoever I will set upon the Mount of the congregation first he says I will Ascend them to heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God I will sit on the Mount of the congregation I will descend above the heights of the clouds I will be like the most high God all of his eyes is exaltation I will lift up I will be above I will be great I I but when Jesus come to the place where he was saying I amen I will go down I will become nothing I will lure myself I will be a servant I will die you see the contrasting Natures we have between God and Lucifer I will become nothing I will get spit on I will be mocked I will be made fun I will not fight back I will subject myself to human governments I will subject myself to torture the Way Up Is Down amen so God came down and he lowered himself Lucifer was trying to exalt himself but God was as was coming down and lowering himself and the question is why was he lowering himself that that's a fantastic question amen and that comes to do with Redemption he was lowering himself so that he could lift me up he came down amen not just to come down but he came down so that he could come under amen meet his children so that he could lift his children into his presence he came down and humbled himself for for for Redemption he came down and lowered himself so that he could lift me up amen he didn't come for himself he came for others Lucifer was only interested in himself I will I will but when God said I will I will go down I will humble myself I will take on the form of a man I will become a servant I will kneel down I will undress myself and kneel down and wash their feet amen I will lower myself for what purpose so that he can come underneath and lift us up now the question is can I do that for my neighbor can I do that for my loved one can I or do I stand on the on the perch of the Bride and say you come up here and yeah you can be like me someday my goodness God never dictates that he never stays above and he never speaks condescending and when I was speaking to a brother the other day and I said it's amazing God has the ability to condescend Lucifer can't amen he can't condescend but God can condescend but God can condescend without being condescending he can come down amen and he can Jesus can walk among them the greatest of them all amen by him were the world's made amen without him nothing was made that was made then here that word was taken in the form of a flesh and he was walking around the creator of the earth amen and everything was sustained by him amen he was walking around they were rejected and he didn't set the record straight they were stepping on him and he never Rose above them he stayed in a condescending and condescension but he never became condescending he never spoke down to them he never spoke disrespectful to them even when he was before the council he never spoke condescending he honored them even the Pilate you know we've said this before when Jesus was in the courtroom that day amen he was the one who knew everything when he was in the trial that that mock trial at Cai emphasis or ananias wherever he was when they brought together the trial and they brought together the witnesses amen Jesus could have rose up and he could have told them what they had for breakfast and what this one said to that one and how much money you gave to this one and over here on this street you said this and your wife told you not but then you took the money and you came here and he could have exposed the whole thing he could have went down the line to the Sanhedrin and all 70 of those Elders he could have exposed their lives until every one of them was ashamed and wouldn't even stay in that room anymore he had the capability he was able he could vanish from their presence he did it before and passed through a crowd unseen to escape but here he come and he made himself of no reputation they would mock him till lies about him and he wouldn't say a word amen because he was doing that for you and I he wasn't defending himself he wasn't protecting his reputation he had so much reputation he didn't need to defend his reputation because he knew who he was he knew why he was there and he didn't need to defend himself he didn't need to set the record straight he could stand there and he could have exposed and Unwound the whole thing but he stood there for Redemption he was being humiliated slapped in the face mocked until they would the Roman soldiers would take him and plot a crown of thorns why did they put the crown of thorns on his head because the Jews made the accusation that he called himself King of the Jews and he was King of the Jews and they were mocking him as king of the Jews mocking the claims putting purple robe about him amen making a stick a scepter amen and putting it in his hand and they were making fun of him and he never said a word to him my goodness if somebody misunderstands one statement we make we want to have a court proceeding get everybody together and set the record straight why to defend our reputation but Jesus didn't have to defend his reputation in fact he made himself of no reputation took on the form of a servant and humbled himself and here he was had the power to change everything and expose everything and he did nothing he said nothing kept quiet he's taken the Pilot's Court in pilate's court he he he reveals how powerful he is and who's in control of the situation because pilate is frustrated he's stuck between he knows Jesus is innocent he's stuck between these power Rivals and the Jews have him between a rock and a hard place he doesn't want to he doesn't want to judge Jesus his wife has a dream says to have nothing to do with this righteous man he knows they've delivered him for Envy he knows all of this but they're pulling some political moves and he's stuck in this situation and he's so frustrated Jesus won't answer because he's trying to look for something that gives him justification to let him go he's trying to get out of the pickle he's in and Jesus won't say anything and then he finally says don't you know why don't you speak don't you know I have power to save your life I have power to have you crucified and Jesus simply says you have no power at all unless it were given to you from above he didn't defend himself he didn't he didn't get out of trouble he just let pilate know everything's working according to plan I have nothing more to say and he says but the greater condemnation is for he that delivered you delivered me to you you're playing your role you're doing your part and Jesus was playing his part he was being led dumb to the slaughter as a lamb not defending himself I tell you friends I I need more character because if that was me and I knew those Witnesses were lying and I could tell them where they lied and when they lied and how much got paid and who was wrong and who did wrong and who I'm telling you it's going to take a greater power I meant it's going to take the working of the Holy Ghost to overcome this flesh in me because I would feel so right such righteous indignation and such justification for setting the record straight but brother Branham when he was being lied about and withheld from the platform standing in the wings of the auditorium amen he could have went and exposed the entire life that these ministers were telling to the congregation saying brother Ben couldn't make it his brother's sick he can't be here that day standing in the wings with another brother encouraging him to step out and expose the whole thing brother bear said I can't do that he said that could hurt that man's Ministry that's the life I want to live that's the life I want to live I don't have to prove I don't have to defend I I don't have to to do all of these things amen that others feel are necessary and I felt it's necessary I don't want to do that I want to take him as my pattern I want his life to be in me and I want to make room for that life amen I want to I want to forsake everything else and I want to feed on the word and receive of that life until that life takes over and and I can follow suit with Christ not just for myself not so that I can get to heaven and get a merit badge and a pat on the back and say good boy I want to do it because it opens the door to Redemption to everyone around me because I can't bring Redemption through pride and arrogancy I can't bring Redemption I can only bring Redemption the way Christ brought Redemption amen and I need to make myself of no reputation and humble myself and take on the form of a servant for everyone that's around me praise God amen Paul gives us a couple admonitions here Romans 12 he says for I say to the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly according as God had dealt to every man The Measure of Faith you say I believe the message how do you believe the message was it your brain was it your Superior understanding the good genetics from a genius mom and a genius dad the only reason you believe this message that was given to you to believe because you had representation in heaven and you have a sieging of eternal life that can believe you have something in you to believe with so don't think we ought to think of ourselves more highly than we ought to we in the flesh are not powerful we in the flesh are not great we in the flesh are not special it's the sieging of God that's special and that's the original us anyways so that's the part that I want to lean to and give preference to and live for because that's was meant to be me from the beginning praise God he also says in First Corinthians 8 now is touching things offered into Idols we know that we all have knowledge knowledge puffeth up but charity edifyeth and if any man think that he knoweth anything he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know but if any man love God the same is known of him If any man think he know anything well you know when I come to the message and I started getting all the doctrines lined up and I went through the church age book I mean I knew something I knew things my my grandfather didn't know I knew things that the pastor in the church I attended didn't know I knew stuff is that right and you know what that knowledge did it puffed up oh God rich in Mercy he would pop our bubble from time to time he would take his little pin of trials and tribulations and every once in a while he'd just stick it right there and so that you wouldn't think of yourself more highly than you ought to and when you think that you know something then all of a sudden you know I'd go on my Rampage against all you know my co-workers against everybody and denominations and I I had the scriptures and I would go on my little war path my Rampage because nobody could stand Toe to Toe with me then all of a sudden God would bring me in contact with a real good Theologian and he would ask me some questions and in a few minutes I wanted to stop talking I was looking for the conversation but I was ready to bail in no time lord get me out of this where did he come up with those scriptures I've never heard those before and oh the mercy of God the grace of God when you think you know something we know nothing as we ought to you Amen brother Ben even when you come to the seals he says I know you're not getting it you're not seeing it he said frankly I don't see it like I ought to amen and I'm telling you this message all that God's revealed to us and all that God's shown to you I can still say I don't know it like I ought to you there's so much more it's so much deeper it's so much richer amen he's continually unfolding amen I don't want to get to the place where I say I know the message no and you know what I don't know the message and I didn't find the message the message found me but I am learning and I'm seeking and I'm wanting to know and I'm asking God to show me more the problem when we get to the place where we say well I know the message amen right there we begin to plateau because we've got this this sort of confidence amen and God give us Revelation by Grace Amen in that Revelation by Grace shouldn't bring us into a a sense of Pride and a sense of self-assurance where well I know well you only know what's been given to you no and you don't know yet how much you don't know [Music] I mean I believe I I feel like God has showed us so much and he's revealed so much and I feel like from where I was amen even just a few years ago to where I'm now amen it's drastic changes in Revelation amen but the problem is I don't know how much I don't know so if we draw a scale amen and our scale is from here to a hundred and this is the full knowledge of full understanding amen we grow so fast and so much we think we've grown from here to here and we're almost at the top when in reality we may have grown from here to here and that was tremendous for us it changed it blew our mind it changed our lives amen it changed everything around us but it might have been like one two clicks on the scale of God because God will be unfolding himself throughout eternity and we think we've been in the message so long that such great Revelation such good things we've been from here to here we have no idea what the Gap is that we still need to know so we don't need to be there's nothing to be proud or puffed up about the only thing we should be expressing is Extreme gratitude extreme gratitude for the grace of God and the mercy of God and we should humble ourselves and say no matter how much I know there is so much that I don't know that I want to know that I wish I knew and I'm dependent on God to bring it to me by revelation there's so many things I've studied and studied and studied until my eyes have gone cross I've read quote lists with hundreds of quotes on a subject wanting to know it and I tell you what no matter how much I read it it will not unlock to me it's going to take the grace of God to bring a revelation much study is not going to produce it right so we're at the mercy of God but we thank God for his Mercy thank God for his grace so we we need to follow Christ's pattern this is Paul this is what Paul says so I might also have confidence in the flesh if any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might Trust In the Flesh I more circumcised The Eighth Day of the stock of Israel The Tribe of Benjamin a Hebrew of the Hebrews as touching the law of Pharisee concerning seal persecuting the church touching the righteousness which is in the law blameless but what things were gained to me those I counted lost for Christ they doubtless and I count all things but lost for the Excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but none that I may win Christ Paul was proud and Paul at the time he was proud not proud at the time he's saying this he was converted but he had pride and he looks back on his list of things that he had whereof he could Glory of and he had a list that he could be confident and he said before and and that list when he met Christ became dung to him and God brought him down amen when he met the pillar of fire brother remember said he knocked Paul off of his high horse and he was rolling around in the dust of the ground saying Lord who are you and God brought Paul to humanity amen Paul could not continue on like this and bring the message of redemption to the Gentiles it would come with the wrong characteristics God had to get a hold upon and brother man says Paul when he saw that angel of the light above him and called it Lord he fell on the dust of the earth he recognized the humility I'm no more no wonder Isaiah could say woe is me for I've seen the Lord of God of hosts yet being a prophet and yet Paul being a great man a scholar but when he come in the presence of God he humbled himself he had to become humble he had to become nothing he had to Cast Away all he ever knew and all he ever learned to win Christ because God couldn't take Paul that way Amen to bring Redemption to the Gentiles because he had to keep the characteristics true he had to come through humility that's why Paul said I came to you with fear and much trembling not with the Excellency of worth why he had to come through humility because he had to keep the same pattern says Paul says in First Corinthians and last of all he was seen of me also as one born out of due time for I am the least of the Apostles that I am not meat to be called an apostle because I persecuted the Church of God but by the grace of God I am what I am and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain but I labored more abundantly than they all yet not I but the grace of God which was with me today I was wrong is what he's saying I was wrong and all my wisdom and all my education and all my understanding all my intellect and all my zeal I was persecuting Jesus Christ the Messiah the word that he claimed to believe he was persecuting and it humbled Paul and now Paul comes to the place where he's an apostle God called him to be Apostle he knows his position he knows his place but being called to be an apostle and an apostle to the Gentiles amen and knowing that he's a light to the Gentiles which is the Fulfillment of scripture doesn't puff puff puff up Paul because Paul was already a base and Paul says I'm not even worthy to be called an apostle because I persecuted the church but by the grace of God I am what I am I tell you I'm not worthy to be called as bride but by the grace of God I am what I am I can say I am by faith I can say I am because he's revealed it to my heart I believe that I am and I love all that comes with it amen but it cannot cause this man to get puffed up because I am what I am by the grace of God so now let me labor more abundantly because of who I am second Corinthians 12 he says unless I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations there was given to me a thorn in the flesh the messenger of Satan to Buffet me lest I should be exalted above measure God is so gracious that he cannot let his message be carried with pride and arrogancy amen and over exaltation of the man that God even though he abaced Paul humbled Paul Paul repented and rejected all of his past life because the abundance of Revelation was so great God allowed an Affliction in Paul's life a thorn in the flesh a messenger of Satan so that he would not be exalted above measure this is how serious this is that the message of Grace the Redemption message is carried in humility God saw to it that it would be carried in humility this is what Paul says First Corinthians 4 9. for I think that God has set forth us the apostles last remember his first will be last if you're going to be head of men you become the servant of all here he is the Apostle of Jesus Christ by meeting a pillar of Fire here he is the first church age messenger the messenger of grace to the Gentiles here he will be the man who will write most of what becomes our new testament and he says God has set forth us Apostles last as it were appointed to death for we are made a spectacle unto the world and to angels and to men for we are fools for Christ's sake but you are wise in Christ we are weak but you are strong ye are honorable but we are despised even into this present hour we both hunger and thirst and are naked and are buffeted and have no certain dwelling place and labor working with our own hands being reviled we bless being persecuted we suffer being defamed we entreat we are made as the filth of the world and are are the off scouring of all things unto this day amen that is not what you put on your tombstone you put he was a great man great father and but Paul is saying we have become nothing so that you can become strong we've become nothing so that you can get the Revelation we've become nothing that so you can be United with Christ he became nothing amen he became the the the filth of the world and the off scouring of all things into this day why did he do it he became that for their sakes he became that to bring Redemption amen he lost his reputation he lost his Prestige he lost his honor amongst all of his colleagues amen they lost everything and he gave it up willingly and counted as done Amen to win Christ but then he he he remained nothing in the eyes amen of all of those people so that he could bring Redemption to the Gentiles praise God what a pattern what a pattern in Acts 24 he says but this I confess unto thee that after the after the way which they call heresy so worshiped by the god of my fathers believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets this is the Apostle Paul standing in court he's being tried and being questioned and he says I confess unto thee that the way in which they call heresy is the way I worship the god of my father he didn't say it was heresy he said they call it heresy but he's also not defending himself he's also not trying to set the record straight and he's not trying to make them look bad so he can look good all he's saying is believing all things which are written in the loan in the prophets I I admit that I worship the way they call heresy but I'm believing the Bible amen we can say the same thing I admit amen that what we believe is called all kinds of things is that right call false Doctrine call false teaching call because it's called all kinds of things I admit that the way I worship God is called all kinds of dirty names amen but I still believe the Bible I'm worshiping with God according to the Bible and I'm not here to defend myself and listen I'm not here to defend the message there's nothing to defend the message is my defense I don't defend my Defender the word is my defense I'm not here to defend it I'm not here I'm not here let's just say it this way I'm not here to weaken the beautiful revelation of the word by becoming greater than the word what do you mean brother if the word needs me to defend it then I've become greater than the word but no that's not my job I'm not here to defend anything I'm here to believe all that's written in the law and the prophets and to worship God according to the word that's why I'm here praise be to go on so that was Paul the question is can we follow the same pattern you know I'm so thankful for the life of a prophet because we can see that brother Ben even struggling with his own Humanity following this pattern even after the seals the rejection was still eating at him and he wanted to leave the field and we know all of that standing in the Gap we've talked about so many times I'm not going to go into detail on it but but we know he's struggling with his own humanity and the rejection and the offense and and on he's wanting to go away and and he's not wanting to go live sinful and he's not one he just wants to get away from the pressure and God corrects him and and brings him back in line with the word and and he corrects himself and he and he goes right back to the very people that hurt him because he says I let the sick people lay he said I've got to bring a message he goes I've got to get out to the people what was he doing he was now willingly he was making himself no reputation he was taking on the form of a servant he was going right back into a painful situation right back into a difficult situation for their sakes because they needed healing they needed this ministry they needed this gift and he put himself right Back In Harm's Way for others he did exactly what Jesus Christ did he did exactly what Paul the Apostle did he did it and I'm so glad he was honest about it so we can see the struggle I'm so glad he came and told us everything so we don't think well you get the Holy Ghost and this is easy and all you have to do and you go no with the Holy Ghost amen as an adopted son who God had put the sword in his hand of the word it handed him the word amen he was still struggling with his flesh praise God but in the end he brought the flesh subject to the will of God he laid down his life once again he surrendered all over again I'm so thankful for that you know I fought a lot of wrestling matches with myself and son I'm a one and some of them I've lost but I want to lay this life down 70 80 90 years what is it anyways in comparison eternity if I have to live all this life rejected and Outcast and misunderstood and mocked so what we put too much value on the flesh there's very little value for the flesh what what's what has great value is the soul amen so I want to I want to look at Peter for a minute in Luke 5 when Jesus comes to Peter he's a fisherman and he has to use his boat to preach a message after the message he goes out and says take me out fishing cast down the net we know Peter says we fished all night but at Thy Word we'll cast down the Nets we did and they caught a huge catch of fish and this is where we're at in the story and then Simon Peter saw it he fell down at Jesus knees saying depart from me for I am a sinful Man O Lord this is how Peter begins his relationship with Jesus Christ an absolute utter humility recognizing he was vile he was a sinner amen and he didn't even feel worthy to be in the presence of the Lord he said depart from me for I am a sinful man what do you have to do with me what is the greatness that you have anything to do with me and look at the humility amen of Peter but the problem is Peter didn't stay in this position amen because as Peter became part of the ministry amen and and Peter began to receive a portion of the ministry and he went out and the campaign meetings and he was seen with Jesus and he was one of his chosen disciples and he would go and work miracles amen by the hands of Peter he would he would go out and pray for the sick and they were healed and cast out demons and they were healed and he was part of this great healing campaign that was taking place where 5 000 men plus women and children were gathered at one time amen this was huge and all of a sudden you see Peter begin to get lifted up in Pride Peter began we we have this scripture which I always find funny and when he came to Capernaum and being in the house he asked him what was it that you disputed among yourselves by the way he says when you guys were having that little discussion and disputing what what was it and and the Bible says he already knew what it was but they held their peace for by the way they had disputed among themselves who should be the greatest here they're walking with Jesus amen disciples they're in this great they're in this fantastic Ministry amen well known things are moving things are happening and we're they're with the main guy and they're the main guys of the main guy things are moving and and now uh uh they're having this discussion dispute along the way and Jesus knows exactly what it's all about amen and it was they were they were with him along the way they were disputing along the way about who would be greatest amen and it was worth arguing over to them until Jesus asked him a question what were you disputing over and then it wasn't worth saying anything anymore nobody felt like talking then because he exposed the whole thing they all of a sudden amen Peter went from just being in completely unworthy to be in the presence of Jesus Christ to in a short period of time he's rebuking the Lord that's what the Bible said he rebuked the Lord when when Jesus says amen the son of man will be go to Jerusalem be evenly mistreated be killed in the three days raises again and Peter took him aside and rebuked him the Bible said he rebuked the Lord saying far be it from thee for a thing like this to happen to thee amen and here and Jesus turned to him and said get thee behind me Satan I mean what a conversation this was the man that was so humble so broken amen that he would drop to his knees when he saw the miracle and said depart from me amen I'm a sinner I'm not worthy to be in your presence and now he's taking the Lord aside and he's rebuking him for something he said then he rebukes him again when they're in the crowd and the woman with the blood issue touched the Hem of His Garment and says and Jesus says somebody touched me and and Peter's rebuking him saying lord they're all throng thee what are you talking about and brother Branham dramatizes it right Billy Graham tells us more I mean he can read between the lines and brother man was telling us he said he was saying you sound crazy stop that that's a good question was Peter protecting Jesus reputation or Peter's reputation when he rebuked Jesus for saying that he was going to Jerusalem and be evily mistreated and fall into the hands of man amen was it Peter's love for Jesus or Peter's love for for Peter Peter didn't want this massive campaign this great movement that he was on top of he didn't want it to go away so all of a sudden Peter goes from so humble he doesn't deserve to be in the presence of Jesus to where he can dispute with all those around him who's going to be the greatest and even take this Lord aside and rebuke him for things he would say and try to get him to say things that doesn't sound so odd this is why Jesus looks at Peter and says Peter Satan has desire to sift thee like we and he said I have prayed for thee that thy faith failed not he never said I prayed for thee that this trial wouldn't come he never said and Jesus says I love it we've talked about it before but he says he says Peter Satan has desired to Sifty like we that means Satan come and ask permission and Jesus didn't say don't worry I told him no why because Peter needs to be knocked off of his high horse because Peter's going to be given the keys to the kingdom and he cannot carry those keys in that condition he cannot bring Redemption outside of humility he's got to be brought low even at the Last Supper when Jesus is speaking to his disciples and telling them what would happen the pride of uh of Peter rise and said Lord I'm ready to go with you both unto prison and to death and he said I tell thee Peter the shall not Crow this day before Thou shalt Thrice deny that thou knowest me then a little further he says then the Lord turned and looked upon Peter this is after Peter denied the Lord and Peter remembered the word of the Lord how he had said unto him before the Crow Thou shalt deny me Thrice and Peter went out and wept bitterly you know God is so gracious that he allowed Peter to go through this trial but he prayed for Peter that his faith failed not that he bypassed the trial because Peter needed to go through the trial Peter needed to come back to humility he needed to come back and realize that he's nothing on his own and and God is so gracious that he comes to him by the Sea of Tiberius and he restores Peter in Fellowship Peter does thou lovethstown me feed my Lambs does that love is thou on me three times because he denied the Lord three times three times he gives him Restoration and brings him back into the vision but now Peter's whole attitude has changed amen Peter is humble Peter is different when Peter goes amen after the after the uh Pentecost after the Holy Ghost Falls him he and John go walking Amen to the temple amen and they heal a man and when they begin to worship him he said don't look on us is that we've done this of Our Own Strength he said we've done this in the name of Jesus Christ whom you crucify now he's not willing to be proud he's not willing to be puffed up he's not willing to be in that position but now he knows who he is and he knows where he is and he knows where the grace of God is I looked at Peter's life and I'm ashamed to say I recognize my life in Peter's life I recognize myself coming to the message I Was So Unworthy even to hear these things I felt so grateful I felt like I felt like I was absolutely nothing but God rescued me I was so grateful I was I was so I was just like Peter but then I don't know where it came from I don't know how it happened but you become proud that you know what other people don't know proud that you're the bride proud that you're the elect proud that you're chosen and I hope I'm not the only one but God has a way of taking his needle and popping our bubble he lets us make some mistakes he doesn't say things wrong he makes us have to come back and correct things and clear things up we make fools of ourselves sometimes how many of you look back over yourself in your early days in the message and you shudder thinking of the pride and the way you've spoken to things you said and you just pray that everybody forgot I just pray they forgot what I said I said things so bold like I knew what I was talking about and I realized I had no clue what I was talking about going around correcting everybody and I hope everybody forgot that and if you remember please don't tell me you remember it I can't hardly stand the thought of it myself but then God allows us to fall on our face Satan desires assistance like wheat and God doesn't stop him they just prays that our faith will hold until I pray that we finally get to the place where we can say without him I'm nothing I am worthless I am in my flesh I am absolutely nothing without god without if it wasn't for a sieging of God an attribute of God I I would be who knows where I'd be doing who knows what I would be doing if it wasn't for God bringing the message my way amen and sparking that seed to life where would I be and what would I be doing and now amen I took this glorious message and I used it to bring pride and arrogancy and attention to myself I used it to elevate myself over over other people and that's never what the message was for it was only to bring a true revelation of who I really am and that true revelation of who I really am ought to put me in humility because if I am like him he can humble himself if I am like him he's not proud he's not arrogant he's not boastful so if I really come from him amen and that Holy Ghost is drawing that life out of that seed then then then I don't need to lean to the side of arrogancy That's My Flesh I need to move to humility and still remember I'm nothing I I look at the life of Peter and maybe it's not just me but maybe it matches many of our lives maybe it matches us as a whole as the bride over the last so many years but I say oh God I want to I want to come to the place where it's all you and I never lose my gratitude and and in that I don't I also I don't feel like I have to get to the place where I say uh you know I'm a worthless nobody no good nothing a piece of dirt no he redeemed me that makes me valuable of myself I'm a disaster but he came down amen and he redeemed me and he cleansed me and he filled me I can no longer speak trash about myself because he redeemed me but I have to understand what's flesh and what's gone and if without God where would I be in the flesh so we don't have to take this false sense of humility and keep talking on no I I am saved by the grace of God he's called me before the foundation of the world I'm one of God's children and I believe that with all my heart and I'm not ashamed to say that but if that be true then I have to quit acting like a child of the devil and start acting like a child of God taking his characteristics and taking his nature amen and humbling myself to bring Redemption to everyone that's around me praise God God is good in First Corinthians 1 25 says because the foolishness of God is wiser than men and the weakness of God is stronger than men for you see your calling brother and how that not many wise men after the flesh not many mighty not many noble are called but God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise and God has chosen the weak things of the world to confuse confound the things which are mighty and base things of the world and things which are despised hath God chosen yea and things which are not to bring the knot things that are that no flesh should glory in his presence but of him are you in Christ Jesus of whom God has made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and Redemption that according as it is written he that glorieth let him glory in the Lord if God has chosen the foolish things if he's chosen the weak things he's chosen the things that are not if he's chosen the base things and the things that are despised why do I want to be anything other than that if that's what he's going to use to defeat the Devil and declare himself then that's all that I want to be I don't we want to be strong we want to be honored we want to be respected we want to be all of these things but God is not using that God is using the weak things and the base things and the things that are despised so praise God and in reality we're all nothing I mean really when you think about and the grants keeping things you look at the billions of people who are on the earth amen sometimes sometimes even in church we start to look at each other and exalt one above the other when that one's got a good Ministry in between the churches that's a good church but if you back away from even believing the message and fellowship and you go to the world Amen we're nothing our churches are nothing our ministers are nothing they're they're just regular people that people walk by and Overlook all the time we esteem one over another but really that's just because in our Circle we see it that way amen but you back out and get a world perspective these people are just as common as common can be nothing special whatsoever and those are the ones he wants those are the ones he wants to choose those are the ones he wants to show Redemption through so that's that's what I want to be amen God has always used the humble God has always done it this way if you think about Noah God took Noah who was a farmer and told him to build a giant ship but he was a farmer he could plant potatoes but he had to build a ship God it always he takes the most unlikely amen that's not the guy I would pick he has no engineering school no training I mean they could ask Noah you ever built a ship before no have you ever built one of those little ones kids build and Float across the pond no have you ever been on a boat no do you have any friends who have been on boats no that's the way God wanted it he didn't want no one to have understanding he didn't want Noah to have ability he didn't want nowhere to have strength he wanted to take something that was nothing and make something with somebody that was nothing that way that God gets all the credit for it Moses when he went to destroy Egypt he was an old man with a stick remember I said white beard hanging down his face didn't use it didn't use him earlier used him when he was weak or used him when he was unable used him when he had no association use him when he was all by himself back in the desert amen and then God took Moses and what was he doing brother brother always dramatizes these things and they're so important amen he's walking down with a stick in his head his wife and his baby on a donkey behind him and he's coming down and say what are you doing Moses where are you going he's I'm going to Egypt what for to take over it looks foolish it looks ridiculous but that's the way God wanted it he took a group of slaves that had been in bondage they had been out of their land they've been separated for over 400 years they had been bondage in many of those years and in hard bondage for the last portion of that amen they had no military training they had no government structure they had nothing and God was going to take them to conquer and displace a land and a people and establish a nation beautiful he was going to take David a little boy to destroy a giant not Saul whose head and shoulders above no he's going to take a Shepherd boy to destroy a giant he was going to use Peter an illiterate fisherman who couldn't sign his name he was going to give him the keys to the kingdom the Way Up Is Down amen and he was going to take brother Branham a man with a seventh grade education to dip into the mysterious back part of God's mind and reveal what wasn't written under the seven Thunders a man who was rejected and despised all of his childhood come through poverty had limited education had no support from the systems and had no formal training it was so uh uh uh he was his education was so poor in such a way he had trouble sounding Out names and sounding Out words out of the King James Bible and to her when he first was in his ministry he'd have his girlfriend at the time his fiancee read his opening scripture for him she'd stand and read it and then he'd preach because he didn't have confidence to do it when he got down to Shreveport Louisiana there at the end of his ministry he asked Jack Moore to stand to read because the section he was going to read had a lot of names in it and he couldn't read those names what was he to do he was to bring the perfect revelation of the entire word with Divine vindication and he couldn't sound the words out that he was supposed to interpret what does God want this is what God wants he wants to take the nobodies to bring Redemption I don't want to all of a sudden try to become a somebody when God was going to bring the righteous line of Jesus Christ he had a tendency to use women who were Barren and couldn't conceive isn't that amazing he didn't bring the fruitful the wind had no problem but all the way through this lineage of Christ you kept finding women kept popping up who weren't able to have children they didn't have the ability they weren't strong that way in fertility but God chose them it's amazing to me the whole Bible is structured this way he took Sarah couldn't have a baby amen then took Rebecca to have Jacob and Rebecca also was Barren then had Rachel to have Joseph and Rachel was also barren why because they couldn't do anything on their own they were depending on God Amen and when God gave them conception they knew that it came from God and God got the credit when God was going to bring John the Baptist he used an old couple that was Pastor Prime Zechariah and Elizabeth who had never been able to conceive what was she was also barren what was he going to bring out of that he was going to bring the manifestation of his promised word out of a Barren womb this is the way God does it hey if we want to get anywhere the path Up Is Down when God was going to bring I think it's the great grandfather of Jesse we bring David he chose Rahab the Harlan and Rahab the Harlot and her husband founded Bethlehem where Jesus would be born what was the foundation Rahab the Harlot and her husband you know what Lucifer cannot work this way he cannot lower himself he cannot be humble he cannot look bad he cannot be abased when he chose to bring Christ he chose Mary of Nazareth of Nazareth nobody from nowhere is who he chose and what was she she was the Fulfillment of Isaiah chapter 7. the prophecy of Virgin shall conceive amen through her was going to come the prophecy from Genesis 3. amen what was she she was the word nobody knew who she was she was nobody she was a spouse to a man amen and she she had nothing to offer in herself she was a virgin amen she was predestinated to this position and the angel comes to her amen and and we know that Nazareth is a undesirable place why would God choose her from there he loves to do it that way when Jesus they called Jesus of Nazareth we know he was born in Bethlehem and the prophecy showed he had to come out of Bethlehem yet he resided most of his life in Nazareth and he was called Jesus of Nazareth why did God do it that way because can anything good come from Nazareth God was masking it and giving people an excuse to disbelieve they said that no Prophet comes from Nazareth well you know what he was born in Bethlehem according to the word he's exactly according to the word but God would have him live in Nazareth so he could get the name that dirty name that bad Association so that he can mask the truth amen so they can come through humility not through Pride why is it sometimes when God can make you look good he allows you to look bad maybe it's better for us if we look bad amen God is good when Jesus was on Calvary he was at the weakest amen when Satan was at his proudest moment when he was taking the life of this prophet he had turned all the tables seemingly he had routed the ministry he had changed the opinions of people he had got the governments amen together and now this great prophet that was doing damage to his kingdom is now amen hanging on a cross and now at this what appears to be Jesus's weakness weakest most humble humiliated State amen Lucifer is at his proudest moment and he's a b buzzing around the calvary with the Stinger of death amen and Jesus is laying there in absolute misery humiliation disrespect uh rejection as low as you could possibly go he's laying there that low what's he laying there for he's waiting for the pride of Lucifer to bring that Stinger of death and as soon as he stings that Stinger of death in and Jesus grabs a hold of him and says Ah I got you now what do you do he laid a trap through humility he laid a trap through Brokenness and he trapped the devil because the devil doesn't understand humility he only stands pride and arrogance it looked like it was the worst moment and it was the best moment it looked like it was defeat but it was victory when Samson loses everything loses his eyes has his hair chopped off loses his strength now he's grinding at the Mill he's absolutely defeated but when the enemy comes to his greatest moment of pride he's going to show off the great victory of the Gods of Dagon and the gods of the Philistines they bring Samson up out of the dungeon and lead him by a little child here he is blind here he's a Broken Man been grinding at the Mill in the dungeon amen and at his weakest moment when the when the enemy is mocking and all the thousands of the Lords and Ladies of the Philistines are gathered together amen all it is is a trap for the devil and he's gloating and he's proud and they're showing off they're making sport of Samson they're actually making fun of him and mocking him and not just him they're mocking the god of Israel and they're showing that our God our gods were more powerful than your God and overcame Samson so what does Samson do he asked the little boy to put his hands on the pillar and he lowers himself and humility and he repents he repents an absolute repentance and Brokenness he also surrenders his life and he said let me die with the Philistines now what's he going to do he's going to go as low as he possibly can go he can repent repent to God and say God just once more and he can bow down with all his might and push out those pillars and it became the house collapsed and killed them all and it became the greatest victory of Samson's life when did he win the greatest Victory when he got to the lowest that he could possibly go even giving up his own life that was the greatest victory and the Philistines were defeated their nation was just destroyed immediately the Way Up Is Down amen we're nothing praise God where does average people with average jobs some of us make average income some of us make below average income we drive average cars we live in average houses is that right we have no political connections we have no strength in ourselves we we can't make things happen we can't get things done I'm talking about the flesh side is that true but there's a secret power and that's Christ there's a secret that lies in the humility there's a secret behind the flesh and that's God and With God all things are possible I want to look for just a minute as we wind down and close I'm going to look at Mary Mary was just going one day to do what she did every day brother Ben said she was going to fetch water and she meets the angel Gabriel who begins to tell her her purpose in life and that she's highly favored and all of those things and naturally she has human questions how will this be knowing I know not a man and and I'm reading the story out of Luke chapter one but then she asked a question and the and the angel gives an answer and she says this in verse 38 and Mary said behold the handmaid of the Lord be it unto me according to Thy Word and the angel departed from her I think what's amazing is when she surrendered she actually surrendered a lot because when Mary Mary was a virgin a spouse to a man she had thoughts of her upcoming marriage she was going to be joined to Joseph and she had a future plan a future life she had lived in Nazareth she had kept her reputation suit she was a virgin the Bible says she was a virgin and and and and no man had known her she had a reputation but the minute that she yields to this conception her reputation's on the line the moment she says be it unto me according to your word now all of a sudden amen it's going to set up a sequence of events a scenario that is going to paint her in a bad light because now she's going to show up pregnant before she was married to Joseph amen and she's not going to be able to hide it for very long she's not going to be able to mask it amen and as she comes forth and she she shows up amen six months pregnant because for six months she went off with Elizabeth her cousin you talk about something looking fishy this looks really fishy this young girl who's a spouse to be married to this man who's a virgin she disappears from the from the city of Nazareth for six months and when she comes back she's six months pregnant and showing and what does everybody say oh Mary are you the Virgin from Isaiah 7 no they start the rumor mill she went off and she did this and then it was rumored amen that Jesus was the product of her and a Roman soldier is that right and now she has to bear the consequences of this surrender she has to walk humiliated rejected who knows what her family said to her whether they accepted or didn't accept Joseph didn't believe her he was they were engaged to be married and Joseph didn't believe her until an angel met him and told him who this child was and then he stayed with her but he was going to put her away privately because he didn't believe her story if he didn't believe it who else didn't believe it and we only know of an Angel visiting one and that was Joseph so everybody else was left to their own imagination you know what there was nothing Mary could do to save her reputation she had no evidence she had no proof she was alone when the angel spoke to her she she she was gone from town for six months she comes back six months pregnant she there's no point in defending it when somebody says you've been a bad girl haven't you what's she gonna say uh who's going to believe her who's going to believe that she's still a virgin being six months pregnant there's not even any point in her defending herself there's no point in saying anything she knows what happened she knows who's whose Child is This she know what baby this is you know I was thinking and meditating on this and thinking even the birth of Jesus doesn't clear her name even Jesus being born doesn't vindicate that Mary was honorable and godly and virtuous her virtue has challenged her reputation is smeared her character is defamed amen and there's nothing that she can do to save it amen she just has to hold in her heart that she knows whose baby this is and Jesus is born and just because Jesus was now born and now she has a baby that doesn't clear up the rumors and the bad reputation and all of that she takes him to the temple when he's eight days old to be circumcised and to offer and pay the vow and when she takes him Amen brother Branham says all the women were pointing and whispering right pointing and whispering and saying and brother Adam dramatizes dramatizes all of this he says what they were saying I heard it was a Roman soldier and I heard this and they're all whispering and here Mary has to Stand Here amen poor with nothing standing in line knowing they're talking about here hearing the whisper seeing the points and knowing that they get silent every time she walks by knowing what's going on and there's nothing she can do but stand in line and wait to pay her vow oh praise God she can't defend herself she can't do any talking's not going to do any good we're going to believe anyways but oh God who's rich in Mercy when she finally gets up there in that line here comes Simeon Here Comes Simeon and he says oh I've seen in a I've been told by the Holy Ghost here he is and he lifts him up and I've seen the Lord's Christ and now I can die here comes Anna and Anna comes along and she begins to confirm the same thing and tell everybody else so that stopped all the rumors right no my friends they kept going because they picked those rumors up and they perpetuate him and they accused Jesus of being born a fornication later the Pharisees did those rumors kept going amen what God did through Simeon and Anna amen that was a blessing to Mary amen but it didn't change the opinions of the people it might have caused some to question or wonder but it didn't change she couldn't do anything to change the opinion even after Jesus started working miracles amen they just claimed that he did it because of the power of Beelzebub so even the Miracles even the sign of the Messiah it wasn't a Vindication of Mary and all of a sudden I began to realize Mary had to bear this reproach Amen to do what to be part of the word to manifest the word to have the word born from her she had to Bear a reproach and she couldn't do anything to take the reproach away nobody would believe her because it's an unbelievable story and we as the brine we have to bear the reproach amen all kinds of evil things are being said being spoken about the message we believe about the doctrines that we hold true about the messenger that God sent to our age amen there's there's all kinds of things circling the internet but there's nothing we can do about it there's no reason the first thing we do is make ourselves of no reputation if you're coming to Christ the first thing you can do is make yourself of no reputation and that way when they defame your reputation you don't have one anyways when they say you're ignorant you say you've got that right you only know the half of it buddy like they told Brother bam you don't even know your Bible he says he said that's true I can't pronounce pulpit that's true but I know the author really well you see there's no point we have to bear a reproach and that reproach may get worse there's nothing you can say I mean how many times have you tried to convince somebody that you haven't followed a false prophet did they believe you I had so many discussions with my family I mean so many discussions it didn't change anything we have to make ourselves of no reputation and then take on the form of a servant what did Mary do the first thing she did was give up her reputation as a clean living virgin said be it unto me according to your word she gave up a reputation and she said behold the hand man of the Lord she was now the Lord's servant oh I thank God if we're going to Walk This Way the first thing we need to do is make ourselves of no reputation if they call you whatever they call you amen they're going to call it nothing you can say in rebuttal is going to change anybody's mind so there's no point in speaking you know I I was amazed when I began to hear uh some brothers I know in Africa they sent me a a message from a brother who had preached the message I don't remember how long decades like 40 years he left the message and now he's coming against it and he's claiming he's going to get the government involved on for religious matters and any any starts claiming terrible things about brother Brenham he's a liar he he did all of these things wrong and he's got all this sin in his life and he covered this up and he hid this and all this other stuff and I started thinking huh isn't that interesting isn't that amazing that the first thing you do when you leave the message is you have to defame the character of brother Branham and you have to make him evil you have to make him Wicked you have to make him a liar and you have to make him a Deceiver and I started wondering why why because we some of these men were the same men who were propping up brother Brandon calling him wonderful calling him God's messenger is that right he was a wonderful messenger he was the man of the eighth he was the seventh angel and they were the ones spreading the message they were the ones convincing other people is true they were the ones baptizing in Jesus name they were the ones preaching the message they were the ones spreading it to the people they spread it to brother Branham never spread it they did they are the ones who convinced the people they're the ones who preached the message they're the ones who baptized the people they not brother Brenham they and they never come out and say I did wrong I I baptized you wrong no no what are they doing I realized they never became of no reputation now what's happening when people start finding evidence and it looks like this and brother bam did this and did that and all of a sudden people start pretending this this evidence to these men these men start to distance himself from the message and Heap all of their own failure on brother Branham to what protect their own reputation they say it's not my fault he deceived me he's the liar he's the deceiver he's the charlatan it's his fault it's not my fault I said oh this is the devil this is exactly what he does because amen because when a man repents amen truly repents he says I did I did I did I did my fault I taught I convinced I'm sorry yes yeah but the devil says he did he did he did why to protect a reputation I said God let me have no reputation let me have nothing to protect and nobody that I have to point to when I fail I fail amen and if there's any success in my life God did it if there's any failure in my life I did it amen help us to lose our reputation and take on the form of a servant and not have to defend ourselves and not have to prove anything amen and be able just to March forward and say listen I didn't I didn't come up with the message I didn't invent it it's not my invention it's God's I didn't write the Bible the way it's written God did I didn't say amen I didn't say that in the days of the voice of the seventh angel the mystery of God will be finished God said that I didn't say it God said it I don't have to defend it because it's not my word it's not my reputation on the line I have no reputation amen I'm not the one who Vindicated the prophet God did I'm not the one who turned my back to the crowd God God did amen I don't I don't have to protect myself I didn't invent this God did I just believe it I believe it and I'm not ashamed of it and I'm ashamed to stay with it by the grace of God I'm not ashamed I'm proud I'm thankful to be associated with the message right I I don't want to have to defend my reputation you know people start up websites and you know this happened in this wrong and this and listen don't waste one second typing out a comment you just go oh that's wrong they got that wrong that didn't even happen tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick what do you think when you post that comment everybody's gonna be like oh I'm so sorry we had it wrong you were right we had just be of no reputation this is God's message this was God's Prophet this is God's word I believe it and I stand by it and I want to be part of it with everything that's in me but I don't have to defend it Mary didn't have to defend herself Mary didn't have to make herself pregnant Mary didn't have to do all she had to do was believe the word and surrender to it so I started thinking of what was Mary's vindication the birth wasn't the Vindication the Miracles went to vindication but for me this is just me I think the resurrection was her vindication if he would have stayed in the grave she would have been a liar but when he came out of that grave amen Mary was Vindicated whether anybody accepted it or believe it or not most of them didn't but it was still Mary's vindication and you know what we we believe this message We Believe It's The End Time message we believe that it's going to bring a rapture we believe that the sleeping Saints are going to come out of the ground amen but I have no way to vindicate myself and prove that any of that is right amen but you know what's going to be our Vindication the resurrection of the Dead is going to be our Vindication the change of the body is going to be our Vindication amen that's going to vindicate that this message is true and I can't control that I can't do anything but surrender surrender surrender and say beat unto me according to Thy word until that time I must be of no reputation and let God prove what's what's what amen you're just this and you're just that that's fine God will prove who's who God will prove who's who sometimes the people that were the strongest the boldest the firmest they've already walked away sometimes we try to prove with harsh speech and firm comments and that we're real believers the reality is time will tell the real truth of it is because the people walked away thought they were Believers at one point the truth is time will tell everything will be manifest in due season whether you're legit or not you're not going to prove it by your firm speech you're not going to prove it by how firmly you say and how many times you declare and we've heard all of that before all I can do is stay true and stay surrendered and stay submissive lose my reputation take on the form of a servant humble myself and obey and God will vindicate when it's time for him to vindicate I've got nothing to prove to nobody my reputation is in his hands I've placed all my reputation my honor amen people may believe that you've accepted doctrines of devils you you we believe we've taken the seed of Christ we believe we're impregnated by the word others believe we're impregnated by doctrines of devils what are you gonna what are you gonna do to prove it what are you going to do to prove it you don't do anything to prove it you stay true God will prove it God will back up his word God will vindicate it God there's nothing for us to do but stay true to him and let him stay true to his word if not we're going to get sucked into all kinds of nonsense that we don't need to be part of amen first I want to lose my reputation then I want to take on the form of a servant humble myself and obey God help me and may that in my life open doors and channels of redemption to everyone else around me amen you know Ruth she had to go lay herself at boaz's feet you know Naomi's the one who told her what to do because Naomi represents the old church or the Old Testament represents the word and Naomi gave her the instructions this is how you do here's the law of redemption this is how you go to him so she did in obedience she surrendered herself in obedience to Naomi and she went and she went at midnight when the man laid down by himself everything about this looks bad here you have a man all by himself in the Midnight Hour now you have a woman all by herself who slips in she uncovers his feet She lays at his feet and She lays down there waiting and somewhere Amen in the middle of the night he wakes up scared and he says who are you and she says I am Ruth thine handmade here she's already laying there as a servant and she says you're in near Kinsman cover me with your skirt what's she saying would you marry me she's saying would you marry me and right away Boaz recognizes the purity of her heart the intention of redemption the desire to see Redemption come back and he says you're you're more righteous you're better you're Kinder in the end than you were in the beginning because you didn't seek after young men whether rich or poor amen you're coming for Redemption you're not coming for lust you're coming Amen to for others you're not coming for yourself Jesus and when he recognized that amen he says amen lay here and in the morning he says now depart before anybody can know that a woman was in the threshing floor because why it would look terrible it would ruin her reputation amen it'd make her look like a harlot amen and he says the whole the whole village the whole town knows you're a virtuous woman she had a reputation she had a reputation everyone knew she was a virtuous woman but she was putting that reputation on the line when she slipped in there at night according to the word and laid herself down for Redemption purposes amen she put her entire reputation on the line because if a Boaz had misunderstood her intentions and he had sounded the alarm she would be labeled as a harlot the rest of her life and there would be nothing she could do to defend herself when when Ruth you know brother Brown's so good at dramatizing but if you allow me the allowance to dramatize us for a minute when Ruth had done all that the word had told her all that Naomi had told her to do the approach she knew the approach now to him she knew how Redemption Works she knew where she had to go and and and she comes at night and she's waiting at night I I just wonder what that waiting was like I wonder if she questions should I go through this should I do this what if he misunderstands what if he says this what if somebody else Finds Me I just wonder what her waiting was like as she stood there and then she sees him go and he lies himself down by the Heap of corn and it's amazing Amen in the evening time at the setting of The Sun where does she find Boaz she finds him where all the word is and the fullness of the word is where he's laying where do we find him in the evening time at the end of the Harvest we find him at the fullness of the word so we are Ruth and now she's she's standing here and maybe he's asleep now everybody else is asleep this is a good time when when she goes to step forward Ruth finally comes to a point Where It's All or Nothing she finally gets to the point where she could back out she could abort she could jump ship she could save her reputation she could save the risk of looking bad everybody knows she's a virtuous woman but but if this goes wrong it goes very wrong if this goes wrong she's labeled as a harlot if this goes wrong her reputation is ruined if this goes wrong nobody in the village will speak to her the same way again she's ruined amen so she's getting ready to take an action that's either going to bring her to Redemption to be married to the lord of the Harvest or bring her a reputation as a harlot and an outcast for the rest of her life this is where Ruth is at and she's standing here at this point and everyone's asleep and he's asleep and Now's the Time and she's got to make her choice and when she makes her choice there's a point that she crosses the point of no return when she makes up her mind she's got to go all the way amen because if she doesn't go all the way and she doesn't go to the right place and she doesn't ask for Redemption amen the whole thing should fall apart so in in my mind this is just the way I would do it this is the way I Envision it when she made up her mind amen all of a sudden she's got to move quickly now amen I've got to go now I can't back out I can't I can't and she moves quickly in uncovers and lays herself down now I don't know what the period of time was before she got there and Boaz woke up can you imagine what that was like but when he woke up he stirred and said who are you and she said and we know the dialogue this is the point she's either going to be accepted or rejected her life is either over or it's made she's either brought into redemption or she's an outcast of society and here she comes to the point and Boaz says I'll do all that you require and all of a sudden she was sealed now her reputation is in boaz's hands Boaz is holding her reputation Boaz is the only one that can declare her virtuous because he was alone with her on the threshing floor he is the one who redeems her and protects her integrity and defends her and he goes to pay the price of redemption and takes her to himself and raises up seed declaring that she is virtuous she is righteous it wasn't in her hands anymore she had given when she was living clean it was in her hands when she kept herself above reproach it was in her hands all of her virtue was in her hands as soon as she laid down at boaz's feet her virtue she handed right into Boaz and now Boaz was holding her virtue listen when we come to this message it's got to be all or nothing it's either all the way right or it's all the way wrong you're either brought into redemption or you're an outcast in religious Society that's just the way it is it's too different this isn't this isn't another Christian idea this is so far away from that friends this isn't another denomination we're coming in contact with the very Redeemer himself the lord of the Harvest the one who can bring Redemption and we're coming to a place the word is showing us the approach but when she laid down there at her feet she gave herself completely to Boaz now whatever Boaz does is what her life is if he cast her away she's a Castaway if she accepts her she's accepted but she's come to his feet and now every her whole life is in his hands that's how I want to come to this message that's how I've come to this message with my eyes wide open recognizing that if I step to that threshing floor and if I Lay My down and myself at that feet this is the point of no return I have nobody else to blame I have no one else to save my reputation I have no more reputation to save I've given myself to Christ I trust it's him I believe it's him he's revealed it to me and I've given myself holy to him now my reputation my virtue my everything is in his hands now it's up to him to vindicate all right and I believe you will what's going to be my Vindication I can make all kinds of claims I can say this I've got a revelation I see this the Bible I can claim all of that but one thing for sure is going to vindicate me is when these atoms change I am Vindicated when I'm moving a Rapture amen and move Beyond this Dimension into another dimension amen and go to the marriage supper I have been thoroughly Vindicated and he's held my reputation in honor proving by that that I was virtuous my virtues not in my hands my virtues in his hands for I've given myself to him and I trust that he will do all that he said he will do amen let's stand amen I encourage you this isn't a halfway deal this isn't something that we just try out this is Jesus Christ the lord of the Harvest this is the one who has Redemption and can redeem us and we're coming to him and laying ourselves at his feet listen when when our reputation starts to get on the line and we start to back up from the message to save our reputation that just shows we haven't died yet as it shows we we haven't fully surrendered because when you fully surrender now you come like Mary there's nothing I can say you believe in serpent seed yes you believe that you believe God sent a problem yes you believe that there's just the only the elect yes do you believe that yes I believe all of that and I can't defend myself I believe it it's the truth for me it's the absolute truth I know it's the truth and I can't do anything to defend myself and say well you know there's no well it's the truth and you believe you're one of them yes by God's grace I believe I'm one of them well I don't believe you are well I can't make you believe that I am it's by the grace of God I've already given my life away I have nothing more to prove it's up to my husband now to hold my virtue and honor it's up to him to prove I've given my life away how many want to have no reputation that's a hard request it's going to take the grace of God in our lives I want to have nothing to defend I want to have no argument I want to have no comeback I just want to believe the word and I want it to manifest in me I want to have no reputation and now I want to take on the form of a servant and humble myself that's Christ unlocked Redemption that's how Mary moved forward in Redemption that's how Ruth moved forward in Redemption that's how we can move forward in Redemption and let's bow our heads together dear Lord Jesus we thank you God for your word Lord I appreciate you so much Lord what you've showed us in this end time and God we've laid ourselves at your feet Lord those who of us who've received this message Lord we recognized it was you speaking you are the lord of the Harvest you've come at the end time to draw your bride to yourself We've Come To You Lord we're asking father for Redemption that you would take us Lord and that you would unite yourself with us and redeem us fill us with your spirit and live your life through US impregnate Us by your word and bring forth the Life of Christ for God we're giving ourselves to you into this word we're surrendering as Mary did we're surrendering as Ruth did Lord we want to surrender like Paul did and like Peter did I'm going to say God I have no reputation I want to be what you've called me to be in this age God take us now and use us For Your Glory help us Lord to walk in humility and help us to walk and surrender and may you finish the work of redemption through us for God it was Mary that you needed you needed her to bring forth that child thought it was Ruth that you needed you needed her to bring forth that child for Redemption and God you need a woman in this end time to bring forth a child of the word the Manifest Redemption and God we want to be that woman we want to be that vessel that you can use for Redemption God we're laying ourselves in your hands and trusting you to keep our honor to keep our virtue for we trust in you we ask your blessings in Jesus Christ's name amen teach me thy way oh Lord [Music] [Music] my heart to Fear Thy Name and teach me
