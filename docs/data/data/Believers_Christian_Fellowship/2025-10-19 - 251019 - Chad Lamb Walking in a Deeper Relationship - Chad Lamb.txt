Oh, welcome Holy Spirit [Music] for we are in your presence. [Music] Come fill us with your power. Go and live inside of me. [Music] Amen. God bless you. Let's bow our heads together this morning. Lord Jesus, we're so thankful, God, that you have cared for us, Lord, that you've provided for us, that you've watched over us, and you've brought us back together once again. And God, we know that we can do nothing in and of ourselves. But God, it's you working in us but to do the will of your good pleasure. And God, you've drawn us together again, Lord, into this meeting place and where we can gather with our brothers and sisters and worship your name. And we're grateful for that, Lord. And God, our desire is that you would find welcome in this place. For you've been invited, Lord. And Lord, may we welcome you with a kiss and anoint you, Lord, with our worship and prayers, weeping before your feet with joy and gratitude and repentance. God, may we be willing, Lord, to bear your reproach. God, we're here to hear from you, to sit at your feet and learn of you, Lord. We pray, God, you would, Lord, move amongst us as you break the bread of life and feed it to us by your own hand, instructing us as individuals, Lord, in the way of righteousness, what you have for us in our individual lives, Lord. May you speak it to us now through this vessel of clay. And may you get glory in it all and take preeminence among us all. May you have the first place. That is our desire. And we ask you would bless all that we say and do. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you this morning. We're going to let you have your seats for just a moment. Musicians, thank you. You can be dismissed. Just want to say I appreciated that special this morning. Sister Anne, thank you for sharing that with us. Amen. And also wanted to let you know that at the end of service, we have a baptism. Sister uh Amanda Balog has desired to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. So we're very happy for her and for God drawing her to himself. Amen. It's always exciting to see. Amen. I wanted to also share with you, many of you know, but um uh Brother Jordan, Sister Rebecca Simson's baby Judah passed away Friday evening. And I know the prayer request went out a couple times for the assembly to be praying and just wanted to take the time to thank you all for praying for them. And it's such a heart heartwrenching heartbreaking tragedy uh for them. Some of you don't know uh Jordan Rebecca. Rebecca was here in this assembly before she was married. She was attending here for many years. Uh those of us who've been for a while, we know her really well. She visits every year. She's got family in Indiana. She visit them. she comes over. So, we've seen her and their children. Um, they had four children before Judah was born. Amen. So, it's it's it's a heartbreaking heart-wrenching thing. And, uh, Rebecca had sent me some text along the way. We stayed in communication while they were while Judah was in the hospital. He had some sort of a virus and swelling of the brain. Uh, his brain was damaged and they they they considered him to be brain dead. They had him on life support and they had to remove the life support Friday evening. And so I I can't imagine the heartbreak that they're suffering from. And so I'd like for us to just pray together for that family and and for their not just their family, their assembly and their extended family and their friends. But I immediately as I was praying for them thought of a quote that uh brother Gabe had read last Sunday and I want to read it to you to remind you of it and you'll remember but there was a woman that was stationed in Germany with her husband and she was trying to get brother Bam to come pray for her baby and the baby was had died and was dying and and she kept calling sister Ma trying to get brother Bam to come was going to send a plane ticket and all of these other things and then brother Brandham he wakes up and and I want to read from this point here. This is out of the message the Messiah 1961 said, "One morning about daylight, I got up and the wife went out of the room and she went out of the room and I just wakened up and I lay there a little bit directly. I heard something coming into the room and I looked there was something moving in the room and I jumped up and I said, "Lord, what would you have your servant know?" It said, "Do not rebuke that. That's the hand of the Lord." See, so I got her on the phone. And I said, "No, God has called your baby." And so when she come over to see us, I left her at the house when I left yesterday. She said, "What was it, Brother Brandham? My weakness of faith." I said, "You have great faith. You prayed for your baby. You and your husband held on to it. God raised that baby." And he refused to do it because he knows what's best. And still you love him. That's real faith. Anybody when mountains are moving and things can have faith but let it go backwards one time and see how it works. That's when you prove whether you got faith or not. Every son that cometh to God must be chasened and tried of God. So remember our trials works patience and patience works hope and so forth. So we just hold on to God whether he blesses us or not. We are right there to believe him anyhow cuz he's promised it. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I can assure you that as I was receiving text from Sister Rebecca, she was believing. &gt;&gt; She was believing to the last moment, she was holding on to the promise of God. She was expecting that baby to raise up. She was even expecting though they removed the life support, the baby will raise up. She had tremendous faith. And even after God took Judah home, she sent me a text still declaring the goodness of God and her faith in him. So I say that Jordan and Rebecca Simonson have great faith. And so, you know, we we have so many testimonies and we have prayer requests here and testimonies all the time. We see God move all the time. And sometimes God moves in ways we don't expect. And sometimes he moves in ways our human mind cannot fathom. Amen. &gt;&gt; I cannot with human reasoning I cannot I cannot grasp a two to threemonth old baby leaving this world being born healthy being born strong and starting to interact with his parents and then God allowing something like this and taking the baby home. I I can't fathom that. &gt;&gt; My my human mind can't I can't reason that one out, friends. The emotional realm can't come to terms with it. But one thing's for sure, God remains good &gt;&gt; and he remains faithful and his word is true. &gt;&gt; Brother Benham had to deal with this with losing Sharon Rose and and he saw her in a dream as a beautiful young woman standing there 18, 19, 20 years old and she said, "Daddy, don't you recognize me in life? I was your little Sharon Rose." And Brother Random knew it was it was okay. Amen. when he saw Sharon Rose there as a as a woman and though Judah has been stripped away from mom and dad and they don't have the privilege now of seeing him grow they don't get to embrace him and kiss him and hug him and all the things that they desire to do. I believe by the grace of God somewhere yonder there's a fine handsome young man &gt;&gt; named Judah. Amen. And there's going to be a reunion someday with his earthly parents. And that's the consolation that we have. That's where our faith when our faith in in the the promise of God and our faith and the hopes of God and our hopes that we have for a certain outcome when they don't go that way. Amen. There's still an anchor of faith that can look beyond the natural and beyond into the supernatural and beyond time and say his word is still true and his promises are still true. So, if we could stand together, I'd like to have a special time of prayer for the Simonson family. Amen. Let's bow our heads and hearts together. Dear Lord Jesus, we love you, Lord. We're so thankful for the price of redemption that you paid to take away the sins of the world. And God, your prophet told us that that sin offering removed the sin even of babies. the sin that he was born with. He had not yet had his own sin. He was born in sin, but you removed that sin at Calvary. And your prophet said, "Babies go to heaven." God, we're so thankful for the price of redemption and the consolation that we have. God, we're so thankful that we live in the hour that you've allowed a prophet to step beyond the curtain of time and show us what's beyond this life. So in times of heartbreak, in times of sadness, we can lift our eyes above the carnal and to the supernatural and realize that all is well. And God, our hearts are broken uh for brother Jordan and Sister Rebecca. Lord, for the whole Simson family, for their brothers and sisters, and God, for their church, for brother Kelly, their pastor, who now has to do a funeral for this baby. God, I just pray that you'd send a special comfort to them all, especially to Jordan, Rebecca. May they feel a tangible presence among them, Lord, that you would take them by the hand and wrap your arms around them as it were, and walk with them through this trial, through this tragedy in their lives. And God, may they find you faithful even in death, faithful in heartbreak, faithful in sadness. May you be true to them, Lord, and true to your word. God, we ask that you would do these things. We bind our faith with theirs and our hearts with theirs. For you said, "When one rejoice, we all rejoice. And when one mourns, we all mourn." And we're in mourning now with our brother and sister. And God, we know that someday the mourning will be turned to rejoicing sometime beyond this life. But until then, we pray you give them a supernatural comfort by your grace. We ask it for the whole church there. God, be with us this morning as we look into your word. May we also, Lord, be able to look beyond this life and keep our eyes fixed on something that's greater. And may that joy that comes into our heart by that vision help us to walk through every tragedy, every valley, everything that we face in this life, the highs and the lows, may they all be leveled off by the revelation of what lays ahead. We love you, God, and we ask your blessing for this family in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Man, I appreciate if you just remember them in prayer for no doubt there some difficult days ahead with funeral planning and and all the things that go with that and then the time that comes to a family after a funeral and after a burial. So, just remember them in prayer, please. Amen. If you could turn with your Bibles with me this morning to the book of Jude. I'm going to read two places in the scripture while we're standing. and Jude. We'll start in Jude chapter 14. Jude chapter 14. I'm just going to read the first part of this verse. And Enoch also the seventh from Adam. If you turn with me to Genesis chapter 5, we'll go back there and read a bit about Enoch. Genesis chapter 5 verse 21. Genesis 5 and 21. And Enoch lived 60 and five years and begat Methuselah. And Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah 300 years and begat sons and daughters. And all the days of Enoch were 360 and5 years. And Enoch walked with God and he was not for God took him. Amen. God bless you as you have your seats. Amen. So now we know that Enoch was the seventh from Adam. And Enoch is a type of the seventh church age. He's a type. He's our type in the scriptures because we've come to the seventh church age. and the seventh from Adam. Amen. Typing the seventh church age shows that Enoch had a a translation. He had a rapture. Amen. He was translated out of this world into the next. Showing that that's that's the that's the type of us in this generation that we're going to take a translation. Amen. We're going to take a body change and step out of this world and we'll be not for God will take us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I want to look at this. I I ministered this last Sunday, this subject uh uh at brother Eugene Bronn's uh uh service there and I know several of you uh listened to that, went to the archives and listened to it. Maybe many of you have and so you're going to get a part two or you're going to get not part two, maybe repeat with overlap. I don't know. Amen. But I I was debating on whether to bring this or not and I had a couple thoughts and I kept bouncing back and forth and I finally settled on this and I just really wanted to share this again with the whole assembly. So if you've heard it already, you know the parts to amen, okay? So we're expecting you to stay with me. Amen. But it's always a little different. There's some new things that I would like to share that God's been dealing with me on. And so I would like to just work uh this subject together. But if we could bring up the PowerPoint uh this morning, I want to talk about walking in a deeper relationship. I want there's a little bit of a different uh direction I want to take than I did last Sunday. What amazed me is when I got home and I watched the archive uh of Brother Gab's service, he he quoted several of the same quotes that I quoted and several of the same thoughts along the way. It wasn't the same service, but there were some points that were the same. And that was encouraging to me to see that God was working in a continuity. And so I just want to stay in that theme where God's working, I want to stay there and keep working in that and see what God will do. So Enoch, he walked with God. And it's amazing before he came to a translation, he walked with God. &gt;&gt; And if we want to look at what would be a precursor to a translation, it would be walking with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. We we cannot force a translation. We cannot force a body change. Amen. We we cannot predict, amen, the day or hour, the moment of that body change. But we know that that it's going to come as we walk with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the thing that we cannot do is force a body change. But the thing we can do is walk with God. And as we walk with God, we'll be walking in that resurrection, walking in that rapture, and moving closer and closer to him. And as we walk with him, we walk closer to a translation and further from this world. &gt;&gt; And I think our goal should be to walk with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and when we walk with God, I I wanted to look at this subject of walking with God. Uh in Genesis chapter 3, it speaks uh here of the fall, but we're going to take a a little picture into Eden. It says, "And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also, and to her husband with her, and he did eat." And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked, and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons. And they heard the voice of the Lord, God, walking in the garden in the cool of the day. And Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden. And then brother Bam would dramatize this many times. We've talked about it where God would come down in the cool of the evening to fellowship with his children. But brother Benham tells us they never saw a physical form. They never saw a body. They never saw a man. He said sometimes he would materialize as a pillar of fire or or something like that. But here when he came down in the cool of the evening for fellowship, he found them fallen. But it says they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden. They didn't hear footsteps because there were not footsteps because there was not a human form. He wasn't coming in that way. Amen. But he was coming. And and and it says, "And they hid themselves from the presence of the Lord." How was the presence of the Lord recognized? How did they know he was there? Amen. It wasn't that he heard his footsteps. They didn't recognize him by footsteps. They recognized him by his voice. &gt;&gt; So his voice declared his presence and they were walking with the voice. &gt;&gt; And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden. Amen. So when when you hear his voice, the voice of God, Amen, is God coming to walk with us. Amen. Like he came to walk with his children in the cool of the evening. Amen. And they hid from his presence. Amen. because his presence was declared by his voice. &gt;&gt; This has everything to do with you and I. &gt;&gt; Brother Bham says Jesus said, "No man can come to me except my father has drawn him and all that my father hath given me they they will come. My sheep, my doves hear my voice. A stranger they will not follow." And what is the voice of God? Is the word of God. What's any man's voice but his word. It's the word of God. They'll they'll hear the word of God. So when we're hearing the word of God, we're hearing the voice of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we can walk with that voice. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. Brother B said, "The bride must be unified, unified together by the word. My sheep hear my voice, and this is his voice in printed form." Brother said, "This is his voice in printed form." So, it's not necessarily audible, but it's a voice because it speaks. What does it speak? It speaks him. His thoughts, his mind, his desires are spoken through his word. And it's his voice. And it's the voice that we can walk with. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says this. This is always God's way of making his voice known to his people. He sends his prophet and gives a sign and then takes his voice that's been spoken before on his word and vindicates it by this man. And they know that it's his voice because it's the promised word of the day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the promised word of the day is his voice &gt;&gt; which brings us denotes his presence. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we can walk with that voice in his presence. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I I I I like to ask questions and I asked this question. Brother Beam told us that when God came in Eden to walk with his children, he didn't come in a physical form of a body. They didn't hear footsteps. He didn't walk with him that way. But his presence would come, his voice would come. And even they would maybe see a pillar of fire, brother said, hanging in the bushes and they would hear his voice. Amen. And so they were walking with the voice of the Lord, not walking with a physical form. Amen. So to walk with God, you don't have to see anything. &gt;&gt; You can walk with God when you hear something. &gt;&gt; When you hear his voice, you can walk with his voice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the question is, how did Enoch walk with God? That's my question. &gt;&gt; Was he handinand with another physical being in human form? Amen. How was Enoch walking with God? that the the Bible doesn't tell us how he was walking with God. But from the things the prophet tells us and from everything we understand, Amen. I don't think that that God appeared him to him in a flesh body and they went strolling along together. Amen. In a flesh body. Amen. But he knew the presence of God. He knew the voice of God. He knew the word of God. And he was walking with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he may not have had another being beside him on the stroll. Amen. But he was still walking with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and we're going to uh look at that in the prophet's life here later. Now, look at what brother Bam says, taking from the scriptures. How can two walk together lest they be agreed? How can you walk with God unless you agree with his word? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How can you add creeds and so forth to it? Then you're ordained not to do it or commanded not to do it. You can't do it. There's no way of doing it, brother, sister. You can't mix that leaven with the unleaven. Oil and water will not mix. Darkness and light will not mix. So how how can two walk together? This is a fundamental principle. Amen. From the scripture is how can two walk together lest they be agreed? So how can I walk with God unless I agree with his word? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because his word is him &gt;&gt; revealed. It's him. It's his thought which is him. Amen. Come into word form. come into a manifestation, come in to a revelation and a manifestation. That's him. And how can I say I walk with God and deny his word and disobey his word and not give heed to his word? How can I say I walk with God when I'm not agreeing with God? &gt;&gt; And if I don't agree with his word and I don't agree with the word for the day and I don't agree with the prophet's message, then it's impossible for me to walk with God. Amen. Because God is his word. Amen. And he's manifest his word in this day. And to walk with God, I must walk with his voice, with his word. Amen. That's been spoken in our hour. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Brother Bam said, "What is sin?" &gt;&gt; Unbelief. Unbelief in what? The word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to try to move to the whiteboard here and see if I can use this. I I want to write this out because it becomes uh it becomes so real to me when we start to look at these things because the prophet teaches us so many fundamental lessons. And if we'll take the lesson the prophet gave us, it begins to give us some understanding and discernment. He says sin. He said it's not smoking, drinking, swearing, running around, committing adultery. That's not sin. He said those are the attributes of sin. That what comes that comes forth from sin. But he says sin is unbelief. &gt;&gt; But unbelief in what? &gt;&gt; Word. &gt;&gt; Unbelief in the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Here's my next question. What word? &gt;&gt; That's a good question. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; It's unbelief in the word for your day. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When Jesus came in flesh as the fulfillment of the prophet prophecy, he was the word for his day. M. He was the word made flesh. And they believed the Old Testament and they believed the mo ministry of Moses and they believed in the Exodus journey. And they believed in the parting of the Red Sea and they believed in the stopping of the waters in Jordan. And they believed that there was uh 12 tribes, sons of uh uh of Israel. They believed in all of the visit. They believed in in God visiting Jacob. They believed in God visiting Abraham. They believed in all of those things. But Jesus said, "Unless you believe that I am he, you will die in your sins." &gt;&gt; So they believed so much of the Bible and which would be the word. You say, "Do you believe that that there was a deliverance out of Egypt, amen, by the hand of God through Moses?" Yes. Do you believe in the 10 plagues? Yes. Absolutely. Would you stake your life on it? Absolutely. I'd stake my life on it. Amen. They believed so much of the Bible. But where were they failing to believe? They were failing to believe the word for their day. &gt;&gt; From the beginning of our Bibles to the end of our Bibles, salvation is always the same. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I've said before, I'll say it a thousand times. This is where denominations fail. Amen. This is where traditions of men fail. Amen. From the beginning of our Bible to the end, salvation has always been based on believing the word for your day. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because God would send a word of salvation in every age. Amen. And to heed that word would equal salvation in that day. &gt;&gt; Amen. So sin is unbelief. And so you can get somebody who says, "Well, I believe the Bible and I believe in Paul and I believe in Peter and I believe in Calvary." And nobody's contesting that. Amen. They believe in that. But but where was the sin in Jesus's day? It wasn't that they disbelieved the Torah. It wasn't that they disbelieved the prophets. It was that they disbelieved when all of that was brought into manifestation in front of them and the word made flesh in their day. They disbelieved the word that they were encountering in their day. And when they disbelieved that word, amen, Jesus said, "You'll die in your sins." &gt;&gt; They paid ti. They went to church. They gave tribute. They went to the feast. They did everything that the Bible was telling them to do. Amen. &gt;&gt; So to me this is a really really important understanding that brother Brandham gave us. Amen. And it shows what the fallacy with tradition what the fallacy with denominations. Amen. It's it's not just that they get some of the word wrong. Amen. It's that they get the whole fundamental principle of the word wrong. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God is alive. He is present tense. He is an I am God. &gt;&gt; And he wants us to receive him as I am. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so he he goes on to say, "How can two walk together unless they be agreed?" They can't. Jesus said they can't. And how can a church, the Methodist and Baptist, walk together? How can the church of Christ walk with the Presbyterians? How can the Catholic walk with the Protestant? How can the Protestant walk with Protestant? But the bride can walk with the word, which is Christ. It must be in agreement. Not the ecclesiastical system, but the word. You have to agree with the word to walk with the word. &gt;&gt; This is so amazing. So, brother said, "But the bride uh the bride can walk with the word." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Which is Christ. &gt;&gt; So to walk with the word is to walk with Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. And you have to agree with the word to walk with the word. So to be in disagreement with this message, Amen. means that you're not able to walk with the Lord because how can two walk together unless they be agreed. &gt;&gt; Amen. Again, he says, notice, you can't walk with the world and expect God to walk with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Angels won't visit you or nothing else but the world because you cannot mix God and the world together. I &gt;&gt; mean these are so basic principles but they're so important for us to understand. Now when we go back to Hebrews and Hebrews 11 we're going back to Enoch. It says by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death was not found because God had translated him. For before his translation, he had this testimony that he pleased God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I I love this. I just absolutely love this. &gt;&gt; I'm going to highlight this because it says, "Without faith, it's impossible to please him." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So before his translation, he had a testimony in his walk with God. He had this testimony that he pleased God. And the thing that I want to share, this is what I was sharing uh up in Edmonton last week, is he didn't please God because he was really good at doing good deeds and he always did the right thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'm not accusing Enoch of doing the wrong thing, but if he was a human being like everybody else that was in the Bible, he probably did some wrong things. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm just an assumption that I'm making, but that's not what pleased God. What pleased God is his faith because without faith, it's impossible to please God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It it you know, it wasn't all through the Bible. It's what's pleased God. God's been looking for somebody who will believe him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's always in the Bible in every age looking for those that will believe him. Amen. Uh and not doubt him and not doubt his words and not disbelieve. but somebody who could believe. And and when we believe in God, God has a vessel to work through. He can perform his word and he can bring it to pass. But God is looking for somebody that will believe him. So, how was it that Enoch pleased God? I'm sure he did some of the right things. I'm sure he he was obedient, but I'm also sure that he probably made mistakes along the way and did some wrong things if he's like all the other heroes of the faith in in Hebrews 11. But without faith, it is impossible to please him. So all the works that we can do if we don't have faith in the word for our day. Amen. We cannot please him by dressing right, acting right, doing right. A amen. All of those things. We cannot please the Lord by that absent of faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it doesn't mean that the Lord's not pleased with the right conduct. It doesn't mean that it doesn't bring him pleasure to see us in obedience in the word. Amen. But those things are an outcropping of our faith. Amen. They don't bring faith. Neither they do bring God's pleasure. &gt;&gt; What brings God's pleasure is faith. And faith brings works. &gt;&gt; Enoch couldn't please God by doing a hu and Noah Noah could not please God by undertaking a huge construction project. &gt;&gt; One day he just decided, you know what? I'm gonna build a gigantic boat to please God. &gt;&gt; It wasn't the building of the ark that pleased God. It was the fact that Noah believed the voice of God. &gt;&gt; And because Noah believed, he built an ark. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's go to Hebrews. Can you turn with me to Hebrews chapter 11? Sometimes we get the cart before the horse. You know, we misunderstand the things with God. And it wasn't that building the ark didn't please God, but what pleased God was his faith. And and and building the ark was the outflow of his faith. &gt;&gt; Why did he build an ark? He didn't build an ark to please God. &gt;&gt; He built an ark because he believed the message. And the message said, "There's coming a destruction, but I made a way of escape. If you'll build this ark, you and your family will be saved." He built the ark because he believed the message. &gt;&gt; He didn't build the ark to get merit points with God or to please God or to get salvation from God. God brought him his word. Amen. And his word with salvation and he built the ark because he believed the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He didn't do it to get something from God or to be pleasing to God. He did it because he believed God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Why did Abraham take his son, his only son, up to Mount Mariah to slay him? Why did he do that? He didn't do it to find pleasure with God. He had already found pleasure with God. He his faith had already pleased God. He already had an imputation of righteousness because he believed God. He wasn't going up there to get righteousness. He wasn't going to get something. He was taking him up there because he believed God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's in Hebrews 11. Let me find it here. Verse 7. Hebrews 11:7. By faith Noah being warned of God of things not seen as yet moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house, by which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith. &gt;&gt; So how did Noah save his family? He didn't save him with an ark. He saved him by faith. &gt;&gt; And faith moved him to build the ark. &gt;&gt; I hope we're getting this. &gt;&gt; We can't just go and decide to do something and I'm going to do this and save my family. I'm going to do this and save my faith. No. The only place of salvation is faith. You're saved by grace through faith and that not of yourselves. It is the gift of God. But the faith in the word of God will produce the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's the way it's been all down through time. Now in Hebrews 11:1, it says, "Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. For by it, it what's it? By it faith. By it the elders obtained a good report. It did not say by good deeds the elders obtained a good report. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Have you read the book of Hebrews? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; By faith Noah. By faith Abraham. By faith Sarah. By faith. By faith. By faith. What was pleasing God? What put them in Hebrews chapter 11? The the the the heroes of faith chapter. What put them there? faith &gt;&gt; and the promise word for their day. What Noah believed was different than what Moses believed was different. What Abraham believed, &gt;&gt; but it was all the same. Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. The word for their day. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So by it faith, the elders obtained a good report. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; By what? By faith, not by deeds. Amen. You say, "Well, they did good deeds." They did. But go back and read their lives and see, did they always do good deeds? &gt;&gt; Was everything they did right? Did they do good only? What about David? No. What about Solomon? No. What about Noah? No. What about Moses? No. Amen. You go through each one of their lives and you will not find that they pleased God because of their deeds. They pleased God because of faith. &gt;&gt; And they obtained a good report because of faith. &gt;&gt; Now we go to Hebrews 11:13. These all died in faith. &gt;&gt; I love this. &gt;&gt; You mean I can die in faith? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You means to die doesn't mean I lack faith. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They died still believing. &gt;&gt; These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them a far off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth. For they that say such thing declare plainly that they seek a country. And then Hebrews 11:39-4, these all having obtained a good report through faith. There it is again. Having attained a good report through faith, received not the promise, God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect. Amen. So each one of them obtained a good report through faith. And each one of them overcame by faith. Amen. &gt;&gt; They didn't overcome by sword. They didn't overcome by feet. They didn't overcome by deed. They overcame by faith. And faith produced the feet and the deed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope we're all on the same page. I hope we're all on the exact same spot. So, how do I get into the heroes of faith chapter? Do I build an ark? Do I slay a giant? Do I destroy enemies? No. The only thing I have to do to find myself in Hebrews 11 is believe the word when it's presented to me. And by it, faith in the present word, I will receive a good report. &gt;&gt; What good report? The same good report. Amen. That'll give me entrance into eternal life and entrance into all the promises of God. &gt;&gt; So they without us should not be made perfect. That means they're waiting on us. What are they waiting on us to do? probably the same thing they did, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Build an ark. Clay a giant. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Believe the word. &gt;&gt; Believe the word for our day. Walk with God and give God something to work with so that he can perform his word in our generation through somebody who will believe his word. They without us are not yet made perfect. They're waiting. Brother Brandham said they're waiting for this church to come to perfection. They're waiting on us to do what? to just believe God's promise for this hour to believe the word and walk with the word. And as we walk with the word, the word will produce itself in someone who believes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's what they're waiting for. So, we've got to do the same thing they did. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Brother said in the Easter Seal, "Let's take another man with this quickening power." There was a man way long ago by the name of Enoch. when a new thing come along, when something come along and said, "Well, now we have to go back to the old school or this that or the other." Enoch walked with God. Whatever God said do, Enoch never missed one word. He walked with God. What was he? He was a son of God. He was an eagle that had been called to that day. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Ram goes on and he says, "Salvation is an individual affair between not a church but between each individual and God walking with the word." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we seeing a pattern? &gt;&gt; Amen. Salvation's an individual affair between each individual with God walking with the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember I said from the beginning of our Bible to the end, salvation has always been the same in every generation. It's been receiving the word for your day. &gt;&gt; Walking with the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And only believe, brother says, wouldn't that be nice if we had a testimony like that, brethren? I do only that which pleases God. Wouldn't that be wonderful? Like Enoch walked with God 500 years and had a testimony that he pleased God. He didn't have to die. He just went up. So then a little afternoon stroll, he just started walking out and just thought, "Well, I've been on Earth long enough. I'll just walk on up." And just started by faith. He thought, "Well, I've been here long enough, so I'm kind of tired of being around here. I think I'll just stroll on up till I hit the Milky White Way and just walk on up and knock on the door." So that's what he did. See, by faith, he did it. The Bible said, "So, see, he just got tired staying here." He said, "Well, I'm just going to walk up home." God just went on up through the air walking. He did that by faith. Amen. I put this quote in here because I want to show when brother Brandham dramatizes the body change. Amen. Enoch walked with God and was not. For God took him. Amen. And and and he he by faith Enoch was translated. &gt;&gt; By faith. How was he translated? By faith. It wasn't an act of works. It wasn't his willpower. It wasn't It was by faith that Enoch was translated. Yeah. &gt;&gt; But the way brother Bam describes it is absolutely amazing to me. He says, "As Enoch walked with God," he just took a stroll one day. And as he's walking along, he says, "Well, you know what? I think you know what? I don't have to die. You know what? I think I've walked so long." And in other places, I'm I'm closer to here than I am there. Instead of going back on home, I think I'll just walk on and be with God. And so, he just strolled on up to God. And you look at this and you think, what in the world is Brother Benham saying? Because Enoch is a type of us, the seventh from Adam. Then we're the seventh from the last Adam. Amen. In the seventh age, there's going to be the same thing take place. There's going to be a translation. And how's it going to come? By faith. Amen. What faith? Faith in the promise of God for our hour as we're walking with God. Amen. We're going to please God because we're going to believe God's word. &gt;&gt; And something's going to happen. And the way brother Ben Brandham makes it sound as he dramatizes this in many places. He he says there was just a realization that came to Enoch. I don't have to die. I can go on home. And he just walked on home. Brother Brandon made it the easiest thing in the whole world. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I believe when the rapture time comes for the translation of the body, I don't believe it's going to be a strain and a push and a works program and we've got to this and I'm straining and I'm trying. I believe it's going to be the easiest thing that ever happened because by faith he was translating. &gt;&gt; And I'm not talking about what's going on all around. I don't know what will go on all around. Amen. In the proximity to to the bride to those who are translated. It might be difficult times, but there's going to be a people who are walking with God and a communion with God. And there's going to be a peace in their heart and a revelation. And they're going to be pleasing God because they've accepted his word, received his word, and are letting the word flow through them. And in that communion, there's going to come a time where there'll be a realization. You know what? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We don't have to die. &gt;&gt; We don't have to go by the way of the grave. We can just go on up and they're just going to walk on up. They're just going to change. The Adams are going to change. They're going to step from this dimension to another dimension. And it's not going to be strain and push and pull and strive. It's going to be by revelation. &gt;&gt; How? walking with God. &gt;&gt; Not the revelation that hits when you're in the world and not the revelation that hits, Amen. when we're off doing our own thing and have our own agenda. But this is going to be something that happened to Enoch as Enoch was walking with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And as Enoch was walking with God, Amen. All of the sudden, the further he walked with God, the more real this became to him until all of the sudden there come a day where he says, "I can go home." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, praise God. May that be our experience and that we start walking closer and closer with God. &gt;&gt; He said in this message, I started walking down the mountain and the snow all drying up. This is the Colorado experience he had when he spoke to the storm with the hot sun steam coming out of my shirt. Just a moment or two difference. And I started walking down the mountain. And when I did, it said, I heard a voice say, why don't you walk with me? I said, 'Lord, the greatest privilege I ever had. I turned and started back down through the big deer trails, down through the virgin forest. God came to him just like an Eden and he says, "Why don't you walk with me?" And brother said, "That's what I would love to do." And the question is, how did brother Brandham recognize his presence? &gt;&gt; What form did he come in? How did he walk with him? &gt;&gt; Did he hold another man's hand? Did he go arm in arm? How? They were walking together. Brother Bam said that virgin timber. They were he was walking with the Lord. How was the Lord walking with him? Brother Bam didn't see anything &gt;&gt; but he heard his voice &gt;&gt; and he was walking again with that voice. And he was walking in the fulfillment of the promise because the promise was if you believe and don't doubt your heart, if you say to this mountain, be plucked up and cast into sea. And he had just experience that word coming to pass. And God says, "Why don't you walk with me?" And he says, "Oh God, that's what I want to do." But what did he recognize? How did he recognize his presence? How did he know he was walking with him? Because of his voice. That's why I believe Enoch didn't see a physical form, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Because Brother Brandham didn't see a physical form. &gt;&gt; Amen. But he was walking with the voice. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham made this statement and I want to spend some time on this. He said, "You live in a three- room house." You know that that you say, "I beg your pardon. I got 10." No, you haven't. You only live in a three- room house. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may have three or four bedrooms and three or four pantries and things like that, but you actually live in a three- room house. That is the kitchen, the living room, and the bedroom. And brother Benham says he he goes and he talks about this quite a bit. And he says you live in a three- room house. And he says you may have four bedrooms, but you can only sleep in one at a time. You may have a living room and a family room or two living rooms or whatever you call them parlors or lounges or whatever, but really you have you have an eating place. Amen. you have a fellowship place and you have the bedroom, the place of rest. &gt;&gt; And he said, "You live in a three- room house." And I'd like to uh look at that for a little bit. &gt;&gt; Uh as we look on the whiteboard here for just a moment. And there's some things that became started to become reality to me as I began to look at this. He says, now he begins to talk about you live in this three- room house. And he starts to type it with our relationship with the Lord. And he says, you know, you've got the kitchen where you eat and there's a certain amount of fellowship. Then you go into the living room and you sit together and you have a more intimate fellowship and a time together of relaxing together. And then you go into the bedroom, which is the most intimate of the intimate of relationships. And he starts to type that with our relationship with the Lord. And and before I go into that, I just want to look at at this right here. If you look at the tabernacle tabernacle in the wilderness with me in the tabernacle in the wilderness, you've got three parts to this building, &gt;&gt; to this construction. You have outer court, you have inner court, sorry, and you have the holy of holies. &gt;&gt; And so in this three- room house, God has a three- room house. When he built a tabernacle to dwell in, he put it in three parts. And you come in through the eastern gate and you you move to the west to go through this house. You come in east and you moved in a direction of west. And this is a type, amen, of the of the movement of the sun from east to west. And the movement of the sun from east to west types start and finish. Amen. &gt;&gt; The day begins for everybody on the earth. No matter where you live on the earth, your day begins when the sun comes up in the east. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the start of your day. And it doesn't matter if it comes up for you a different time than it comes up for me. The beginning of your day is when the sun rises in the east. And the end of your day is when the sun sets in the west. So this is marking beginning to end, first and last, start to finish. And so there's a direction you move in the tabernacle and you move from east to west. Amen. When you come into the outer court, the outer court is crowded and there's many people in the outer court. And there's a lot of coming and going in the outer court. And the outer court is also exposed to the elements because there's no roof on it. There's just a barrier around the outside, a curtain that separates us from the world. Amen. And we begin to move in to this greater relationship with the Lord. But there's a lot of people involved in that relationship. But but as the priest would move from the outer court into the inner court, Amen. There's much fewer people. And now there's a shelter. There's a further degree of separation from the world. As you go into another shelter with the Lord and in there, you've got the light from the church ages. You got the showbread of fellowship. You got the altar of incense. Amen. Where you commune with the Lord. Amen. But but there was one priest once a year who could go beyond that next veil and go into the Holy of Holies. But he could only go there by himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Only go there by himself. And what was in the holy of holies? It was just the throne of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The ark of the covenant. And what would he find in there? He would find in there the presence of the Lord, the shikina glory of God. And I want you to note there's no door over here on the western side. There's only one door and there's only one direction of travel and that direction is traveling from the outer court to the inner court to the holy of holies. So when you look at the construction of this house, what was the destination of your travel through the house? What was the whole purpose? Where were you trying to get to and worship to God? Amen. Each stage had more worship. Coming through the altar of sacrifice, coming to the labor of baptism. Amen. Moving in to to the the light of the ages and to fellowship with God at the altar of incense. What is all of this bringing us to? It's bringing us into an individual relationship with God himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; God's three- room house was to bring us from the outer court to the inner court to the Holy of Holies. Amen. And when you get to the Holy of Holies, there's nobody else in the Holy of Holies, just you and God. &gt;&gt; And that's why there's not a back door. You can't continue your journey. Where do you go past this? How do you climb higher than being one with God? That's the connection he wanted. That's the relationship he wanted. That's what he's been trying to get us to, friends. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he showed it all in his three- room house. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. Does anybody know what this is? &gt;&gt; And don't say three circles. I don't need any smart. Brother Bam showed this was us. body, spirit, &gt;&gt; and soul. We live in a three- room house. &gt;&gt; This is us. When it comes to the physical, our body, our outside, our outer court, our outer man. We come in contact with so many people. And this is how we begin our journey with the Lord because you come in contact with somebody. in that contact with somebody will share something with us and it will hit our ears and we'll see something, read a book. We have a contact. Amen. And in that body realm, we come in contact with so many people just like the outer court of the temp temple. &gt;&gt; But then inside of that is a spirit man. Amen. And that spirit man is the more intimate side of us. Amen. And there's fewer people that get to connect with us on a spirit level. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We connect with so many people walking through the store. Amen. People see you. They're connected to you. You're driving around. and you're all over the place. There's a there's a broad connection. Amen. But when it comes to the spirit level, amen, it becomes much narrower of a connection. &gt;&gt; There's only a few people who are connected with us on that level. But when it comes to the soul, Amen. There's only one that can go in there, and that's God. &gt;&gt; When it comes to the soul, to the core of where we are, it's either faith or unbelief. &gt;&gt; So, it's either God or not God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And God is the one who has access to our souls cuz we live in a three- room house. And where does God want to get to? He wants to go past just your body. He wants to go past just your mind and your spirit realm and your emotions. He wants to get down to the core and essence of who you are where there's a part of him there and connect with that. He wants to come to the bedroom. He wants to come to the soul. He wants to come to the maximum level of intimacy for you and him. &gt;&gt; He wants to come into your three- room house. Now I want to look at marriage. Marriage is friendship, courtship and union. Three parts to the journey and marriage starts off as friendship. If you make an acquaintance and you talk to somebody and and as the friendship goes, it begins to develop and you're friends like everybody else's friends. You have the same access to this person everybody else has to this person and you talk to them like anybody else would talk to them. But along the way, amen, there becomes a different level of interest. And all of a sudden, I don't want to stay in the outer court anymore. &gt;&gt; I don't want just the access everybody else has. I want a different level of access. So, we move from friendship to courtship where we declare our intention and have that opportunity to move into a more intimate relationship where we can have private conversation where we can begin to get to know each other. We've moved from the kitchen to the living room. &gt;&gt; Amen. And now we're sitting on the couch together comparing notes, talking about their future and what we want and what we expect and what we love in life and our hopes and our dreams and our ambitions and all of that. Amen. And and you know what? We can go into the uh a friendship with many many people. You can even have courtship and have more people involved because parents are involved and maybe a chaperon's involved and maybe other people are involved. Amen. But when it comes to the third step in this union, nobody else is involved. It's just you and your spouse alone. &gt;&gt; Amen. And this is the journey that God wants us on. And he's typed it in everything around us. Typed it in his tabernacle. Amen. Typed it in us. Typed it in our marriages. And what does God want? God wants us to walk with him &gt;&gt; alone &gt;&gt; in the inner chamber. Us in his inner chamber behind the veil. In him in us in our inner chamber and the soul behind the veil. &gt;&gt; I in you and you in me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; At that day you'll know that I'm in the father and the father in me. I in you and you in me. Everybody say what day? That's this day. That's the seventh from Adam. That's the day that he wants us to walk with him and him alone. &gt;&gt; We need to move through the tabernacle, friends, &gt;&gt; from outer court. We can come into church and have fellowship and that's wonderful. And we can be in the outer court and our relationship with God here with everybody else. Amen. We may even be able to go a little deeper and and and share some of our h more intimate spiritual experiences with other people. Maybe a few people. Amen. But there's a place that we've got to go beyond that. There's a place that we've got to move into that third chamber, into that third phase in our relationship with God. And we've got to move into the marriage where nobody can go there with you, just you and God alone. &gt;&gt; This is an experience you can't share with your spouse. It's an experience you can't share with your children. It's an experience you can't share with your parents. Amen. You can't take anybody else into this walk. It's got to be just you and God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Bam says, &gt;&gt; he says, "Not say my church. My church has nothing to do with it." I'm sorry. You can't read what I'm reading, but I'm going to read it anyways. You'll catch up. Amen. Has nothing to do with it. It's an individual one person. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All hell is against this teaching. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All hell is against this truth, but it is the truth. Jesus never said, "Now Peter, you and John and all the rest of the people, you've got the revelation. Now the whole church is saved." No, it was to him personally. &gt;&gt; This wasn't about anybody else. That was him personally. Amen. And that revelation to you personally upon that rock I will build my church. What rock? The rock of an individual revelation from the father of who Jesus Christ is. And when you get that revelation from the father, you're on the rock. But you get there individually. He said, "I'll build my church." But he's not saying, "I'm going to plant the whole church." He's going to plant us individually on that rock of revelation. &gt;&gt; It's an individual, not a group. We can come into the group and that's how our journey begins. And that's absolutely wonderful that there's a group of people who love God. It was wonderful to come into the outer court with people who want to worship God. That was tremendous. That's exciting. That's wonderful. Amen. But there's a further step to go. Don't just come in and out of the outer court all the time saying we're worshiping God. You can go further with God than that. You don't have to stay there. Amen. You can come into the inner court. Amen. Where there's another degree of separation where you're not tossed about with the wind and the rain and the sun and the dark and everything that's going out now. There's a light that doesn't go out. It's a light of the word of God. Amen. There's a fellowship of the showbread that's renewed all the time. Amen. There's a prayer of incense where you're praying to God and he's receiving a sacrifice of praise. &gt;&gt; We can go deeper and in there there's fewer people that make that journey. Amen. From the outer court experience to the inner court experience. Amen. And we get into that place and the intimacy is greater. The things we talk about are more wonderful. Amen. We see the same things. We talk about the same things. We're talking about the light of the seven churches is shining in fullness. We're talking about the fellowship we have together and with God and the completion. We're talking about all the prayers and the answered prayers and the time with the Lord. That's wonderful. But don't stop there. There's another room beyond that room. There's a place we can go. And there's nothing wrong with these stages. There's nothing wrong with these rooms. Amen. But the real goal was not to stop from east to west, but it was to go all the way to the west. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The real goal is to go behind that last veil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when you go behind that lost veil, &gt;&gt; nobody's in there with you. &gt;&gt; Not your husband, not your wife, not your children, not your parents, not your best friend, not the person who witnessed the message to you. &gt;&gt; Not your pastor, not your favorite preacher, not &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Nobody can go in there. &gt;&gt; And it's wonderful to be in the outer court. I love it. It's exciting to be gathered, moving in. Amen. We're coming to worship God. We're recognizing our salvation. We're recognizing our baptism by the brazen altar and the brazen. It's so exciting. Amen. It's exciting to move into that next phase with fewer people and say, "Did you see that? Did you see that? Did you experience this?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. There's another step beyond that. And that's the step I want to take. And that's the place I want to remain. I want to go within the veil where Jesus has already entered &gt;&gt; waiting for us to come there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that we do alone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And once we've entered there, everything's different. Yes. &gt;&gt; Even when you enter there, the conversation is different than it was in the inner court. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because there's things that take place there you can't describe. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You can't explain. You can't make anybody else understand. &gt;&gt; Remember when brother Brenham had the tent vision, he was throwing the third pull, which is the third phase. &gt;&gt; Amen. which is the third step. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And in the third pool, he's caught up in a vision and he sees a little room and people are entering in and they're going in. There's a crowd of people. &gt;&gt; He said they're all in the tent and outside the tent. They've come into the outer corner. Now there's people lined up to go into the room. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But when they go in the room, they go one by one &gt;&gt; individually. And when they come out the other side, Amen. What was in the room? The only thing we know that was in there is we know that pillar of fire whirled down and went into the room and they come in contact with the shakina glory of God, the pillar of fire, Jesus Christ himself. Amen. When they come in contact with that, they came out the other side and the lady with the tablet who was writing down, they said, "What happened in there?" And they said, "I don't know. I can't explain it. &gt;&gt; This is the place that we have to go. We got to go to the place where you may try to explain it to somebody. You may try to explain your experience with the Lord and this is what happened. But every time you start to use words, it starts to fall flat and you start to try to explain it and you start to try to give them what's inside of you. Then all of a sudden you say, "Well, just never mind. You've got to go in yourself." &gt;&gt; And you might use different words to try to describe in a different way, but the reality is there's something that takes place there that I cannot explain to you. Yeah. &gt;&gt; It's like you have so many young people have come to me over the years and said, "Uh, Brother Chad, I don't understand this courtship thing and I don't understand. I've tried to do it and I've tried this and that and it's amazing. The guys don't get it. &gt;&gt; The girls get it instinctively. &gt;&gt; The guys don't get it &gt;&gt; because they're made different. &gt;&gt; A guy is made mechanical. He's a problem solver. He goes step by step. A woman is made more emotional. She's intuitive. She understands what falling in love is. A guy doesn't get it. He's never fallen in love. So when I say something like friendship, courtship, then marriage, he goes, "Okay, explain to me friendship. Okay, I'm in friendship now. All right, what are the parameters? Okay, when do I step to this step?" And no matter how many times I preach it, no matter how many times I discuss it, all a guy ever hears is step one, step two, step three, I'm married. That's all they ever hear. Step one, step two, step three. I got it. It doesn't work like that. It's a natural progression of a real relationship. &gt;&gt; It's not something you plan. It's not something you meter. It's not staged. It's not rules. There's not parameters. Not a rule book. Amen. You just find yourself in a friendship with somebody and all of a sudden you start liking it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It's not a formula, friends. It's just something that happens to you. &gt;&gt; Then you like it better and better and then you like it so much other people are starting to notice you're liking it and then it gets to the awkward place where you're like, "Well, I better say something to somebody because this is the only friend I want to have." &gt;&gt; So then I have to have a discussion with their dad or my parents or whatever cuz I'd like to have a deeper friendship. Amen. And I like to go into courtship because I want to know if this is God's plan for the rest of my life. I'm feeling something, sensing something, but I want to explore this option before I make a lifetime commitment. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And in there, that's not a stage, friends. That's not a step. That's not a phase. It's a natural progression of a natural relationship until the relationship grows so strong and the intimacy becomes so intimate till you say, "I cannot stay in this phase anymore. I've got to go to the next step." &gt;&gt; Amen. I got to have this one for life. &gt;&gt; And when somebody's never been to that spot, &gt;&gt; you can't explain it. &gt;&gt; You can't explain it. And when you try to explain it, it's so foolish. Can you imagine a young man going to He says, "I I have a desire to get married. How do I get married?" Every time he asks that question, he's asking for the formula. Yeah. &gt;&gt; He said, "Well, go talk to somebody and find out how they fell in love." So, you go talk to 10 different people and you get 10 different stories, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And you can't figure out the formula. &gt;&gt; They got this before that and this happened, that happened, and I don't understand it. You don't understand it because you've never been behind that last veil. &gt;&gt; You've never fallen in love for yourself. And as soon as you do, as soon as the sparks fly, as soon as your heart melts, as soon as something happens to you that you didn't make happen, just happened to you, all of a sudden you're like, I get it now. &gt;&gt; I understand. That's what it's like to go behind this last fail. &gt;&gt; What's it like to be born again? What's it like to have the baptism of the Holy Ghost? What should I expect? Brother Brandham said, expect a change in your life. Amen. &gt;&gt; But give me more details what will change and how much will change. Listen, just keep walking with God. &gt;&gt; Can't explain it to you. I can't give you the formula. I can't tell you, Amen, the steps and the stages and what you need to do to get to the next phase. All I can tell you is keep moving from east to west. Keep going towards that chamber. Keep moving towards the Lord. Keep moving in a deeper separation. getting you further away from the world, closer to him, more intimate with him all the time. And keep moving as he leads until you find yourself behind the last veil. And something happens inside of you that you can't explain to anybody else that you can't put words to, but you just know that you've met your savior and you're in love with him and he loves you. &gt;&gt; It's an individual in the third room of the house. We've gone behind his veil and he's gone behind our veil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's an individual one person. &gt;&gt; He says all hell is against this. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Why is all hell against this? Because you can't control individuals connected to God. &gt;&gt; You can control systems. You can control denominations. You can control churches. &gt;&gt; All you've got to do is control who's ever in charge at the top. You can control that. You can control the whole system. &gt;&gt; You can control governments. You can control denominations. You can control churches. You can control businesses. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wherever there's a structure, you can control the time. Then you can control everything. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But you get a bunch of people who is connected to God individually. Amen. Listen, you can't control that. You can't stop it. You can't manipulate it because each individual has their own walk with God, their own relationship, their own revelation. &gt;&gt; That's why if the church blows up and the leadership fails, they'll still walk with God because they're connected into something deeper than church, deeper than ministry, deeper than all of those things, it's got to be deeper. Or when the church fails, you fail. When your pastor fails, you fail. When your mom fails, you fail. Dad fails. If you fail when somebody else fails, it means you didn't go behind the veil. &gt;&gt; And if we blame our failure on somebody else's failure, it shows we haven't went behind the veil. &gt;&gt; Because it's an individual, one person, you and God. &gt;&gt; Amen. When Enoch was raptured, when Enoch was translated, who went with him? Have you ever thought about this? &gt;&gt; Enoch was married. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; The Bible said he had Methusela when he's 65 and had sons and daughters. &gt;&gt; Where were his sons and daughters? &gt;&gt; Where was his wife? Where were his brothers and sisters? &gt;&gt; Where were the rest of the people in his church fellowship? &gt;&gt; Where was his best buddy? &gt;&gt; Yeah. When Enoch was translated, he translated by himself. &gt;&gt; And friends, that's how you and I are going to translate. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Alone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope once we meet that translation, we meet again on the other side. But the pass through is going to be individual. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's going to be alone. Enoch walked with God and brother said he got so far down the road he just decided to go on. There was something about this relationship with God as he walked with God. It became more important than every other relationship. &gt;&gt; As he walked with God alone, it became more powerful than the power of any earthly connection. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. How can a man leave his wife and his children behind? &gt;&gt; How can a man walk with God and get so far down the road, as brother Benham dramatizes, so far down the road that he says, "You know what? I'm so far down the road. I think I'll just go on." And how did that love affair between him and God become so real and so strong? He didn't say, as he may have said in previous days, "No, I better go back. My family needs me. &gt;&gt; My wife wouldn't understand, I'm worried my kids won't make it without me." He got so into this walk with God and such in harmony and union began to think the way God thinks. When God gave him the tug to come home, he responded. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. That means this relationship he had with God was far superior to the relationship he had with his wife. &gt;&gt; And far superior to the relationship he had with his children. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's amazing. Friends, &gt;&gt; I've read about Enoch so many times, but when I really go to contemplate &gt;&gt; him walking away, &gt;&gt; I'm sure by this time he had grandchildren. &gt;&gt; And he could leave his grandchildren. &gt;&gt; You ask him how he had entered to a realm of love that was higher than filio love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He had entered to a place of perfection. Amen. That was so much higher. Amen. That he was moving and operating in a perfect love. And that perfect love had a totally different set of understanding than the earthly love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's nothing wrong with us feeling for our family and wanting for our family and helping our family. Amen. But there's got to come a relationship that becomes stronger than any filio love relationship. &gt;&gt; And and listen, the only way that we can help anybody in this world is to walk with God. &gt;&gt; That's right. I say before when the when the when the uh when the prodical son comes to his father and asks for his inheritance and he takes off with his inheritance, the father gives it to him and lets the son go. Amen. And the father doesn't go to the world following his son around because he's worried about his son and trying to redeem his son by leaving his position and becoming like his son. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The only hope he had for redeeming his son was to stay in righteousness and stay his position and give his son a place to come to. Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; We can't stop walking with God to save anybody. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because if we stop walking with God to save somebody, then we we will be lost ourselves. &gt;&gt; The only hope that the world has, the only hope we have for anybody else is to walk with God. The only hope that we have is to enter behind this veil. And you say, "But my wife's not ready." Listen, you can't stay out of the veil when God's calling you beyond the veil because your wife's not ready. You've got to walk behind the veil because there's nothing that you can do for her. This last step, she's got to make herself. He's got to make himself. You can't stay out of the veil. My son, my son's going wayward. I want to stay with my son and help my son cross the veil. You can't cross that veil arm in arm. You can only cross that veil alone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you staying out does nobody any good. Amen. &gt;&gt; It doesn't help a soul to say, "But I want to stay with my family. I want to stay with my son. My wife's not ready. My husband's not ready." Listen, &gt;&gt; is God calling? &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is God calling you beyond the veil? Do you hear Jesus who's entered in within the veil bidding you to come? Come unto me. Come unto me. Do you feel the pull? Do you hear him calling? Then you've got to move. Amen. from the inner court to the Holy of Holies. And you've got to make that move by yourself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Man, it's a shame so many times that carnal love we've put more value on than the love of God. &gt;&gt; And we've deemed this somehow heroic to stay behind and not keep walking with God so that we don't leave someone behind. That's not God's plan. Everybody has an individual walk &gt;&gt; and everybody has an individual time and everybody's got to go through this three- room house &gt;&gt; on their own time. &gt;&gt; And we can't speed it up for anybody else by stopping it for ourselves. We've got to walk with the Lord. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham was told this. said there he stood talking to me and he said but you walk with too many. He &gt;&gt; said to walk with me you walk alone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen there should be there should be a part of your spiritual life between you and God that your wife can't even enter into &gt;&gt; or your husband can't enter into. And it doesn't mean you don't want them to. And it doesn't mean there's separation. But there's something more that you can't explain in the natural. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. You want to serve the Lord arm in- arm. Absolutely. But a man and a woman have to have their individual connection to God. &gt;&gt; And that's what makes a family strong. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And there there there should be a part of your love relationship with the Lord that you can't even fully explain to your wife. And there should be a love relationship between her and the Lord she can't even fully explain to you. And we shouldn't be jealous of each other's walk with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we shouldn't be intimidated when we see our wives have a connection with God. &gt;&gt; And God reveals something to them and they pray and God answers their prayer. We shouldn't be intimidated by that, brothers. We should thank God for that. That's what makes a strong family. &gt;&gt; Now, what makes a family that's not going to get off the rails? That's going to make a family. Amen. where each one is led by the spirit of God. But sisters, you shouldn't get intimidated just because your husband has a relationship with the Lord that you can't enter into and he can't explain to you and you see the connection and you can't enter in with him. Don't get intimidated with that. Praise God. Because that's a relationship that you need. If he's going to be your headship, you need him to have a relationship that's greater than his relationship with you. &gt;&gt; So that your emotions doesn't change his headship. &gt;&gt; That's what we want. We shouldn't get intimidated when we see our brothers and sisters have their own walk with God &gt;&gt; and they can go beyond us spiritually. We should encourage that. Amen. We shouldn't try to put them under us and well, you just said that because and you're just always No, we should thank God that they have a walk with God. &gt;&gt; That they can go behind the veil and they've got a connection with God that maybe I can't even comprehend and they explain it. It sounds amen beyond my understanding. It may even sound stronger than my relationship with the Lord, but I can't help that. And I can't enter in there. I've got to enter in with him alone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And have my own unique relationship. &gt;&gt; Yes. The apostle Paul in Galatians, he says, "But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb and call me by his grace to reveal his son in me that I might preach him among the heathen, immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood, neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me. But I went into Arabia, and I returned again into Damascus." What did God do with Paul when Paul first was converted and met the pillar of fire? God immediately took him to the wilderness &gt;&gt; to be alone, &gt;&gt; to come in contact with Jesus Christ alone and to deal with him alone. And that became the foundation of his whole ministry. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I when when Paul was smitten down to the ground by a pillar of fire and a voice from heaven. Amen. There was other men with him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He wasn't alone. &gt;&gt; But I want to read two accounts out of the book of Acts of this. Acts nine says, "And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a voice, but seeing no man." Then in another place they said, "And they that were with me saw indeed the light and were afraid, but they heard not the voice of him that spoke to me." They heard something, but they didn't see a man. And another account, they saw a light, but they didn't hear the voice. Amen. &gt;&gt; That means they were there when Paul had his experience with Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But they could not understand what Paul understood and they didn't get out of it what Paul got out of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It was individual to Paul. Even though they were there when it happened and they were all struck to the ground, but there was only one who knew that that was Jesus Christ. And there was only one who heard what the voice says. They saw something. They saw a light. They heard something, but they didn't hear the voice of him. Amen. They had an experience when he had an experience, but his experience was special and unique to Paul alone. And he's the only one that saw Christ and heard Christ and understood the message. &gt;&gt; So it doesn't matter who's with you. Amen. You could sit in the same church service and everybody can hear things and see things and and experience things on a different level, but you can hear preaching and everybody can walk out and they can walk out and say, "Listen, I've had it happen in the forer, brother Chad. You don't know that was for me." &gt;&gt; There was a part there where everything you said was exactly what I was praying about. &gt;&gt; Same service, somebody else will say, "Brother Chad, that was for me. That's what me and my wife were talking about last night." Listen, you compare notes and you say, "This message was for me." You said, "No, it was for me." You say, "Well, this was the best part of the sermon." No, this was the best part of the sermon. They both heard and they saw. Amen. But there was something individual to you in every service, in every book, in every tape, every time you read your Bible, every time you pray, there's a relationship that's just for you. There's something that's just for you alone. And no matter how much you explain it, other people listen, you may have a prayer request. You may have a desire in your heart. You may have a question that you've been praying about and you've shared it with nobody. And all of a sudden, right over the pull pit comes, bang, bang, bang. That's exactly what I was praying about. And you can go out with enthusiasm and tell somebody else and they'll say, "Oh, that's so nice." &gt;&gt; But there's no way they can understand what's happening inside of you. God just spoke to you. God just answered your question. God just gave you exactly what you were looking for. And for you, it's the greatest thing that ever happened. for somebody else. That's exciting. &gt;&gt; I'm happy for you. &gt;&gt; That's wonderful. &gt;&gt; And after you've explained it two or three times, you said, "I'm not going to explain it to nobody else." &gt;&gt; They just don't get it. &gt;&gt; And the truth is, they can't get it. That was you behind the veil. That was God whispering in your ear because it's love secrets to you as an individual. He's whispering the answer back to you. Everybody else heard the same words. &gt;&gt; Amen. But to you, it was a personal meeting with you and God. &gt;&gt; Oh, I love it, friends. &gt;&gt; I love it so much. &gt;&gt; Then look at second Timothy 4 said, "In my first answer, no man stood with me, but all men forsook me." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Here comes Paul towards the end of his ministry. He started off alone with God. Guess where he's going to wind up at the end? &gt;&gt; Alone with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge. Notwithstanding, the Lord stood with me and strengthened me, that by me the preaching might be fully known, and that all the Gentiles might hear, and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion, and the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me into his heavenly kingdom, to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen. &gt;&gt; Who was Paul depending on? Yeah. &gt;&gt; The Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not any of his companions on earth. Not any of his fellow ministers, not anybody who walked with him and talked with him and helped him. Listen, they went through some stuff together. &gt;&gt; Those who traveled with Paul, they went through some things together and some hardships. But there come a time when Paul had to walk a part of his journey all by himself and all forsook me and no one stood with me, but the Lord stood with me. &gt;&gt; Listen, there's times, friends, you can be surrounded by people. You can go to a church with 200 other people and you feel absolutely isolated and all by yourself like nobody understands and nobody's standing with me and nobody can comfort me in my pain and nobody can take my pain away and nobody can understand what I'm going through. And that's absolutely the truth. And we wonder why do we get in those positions sometimes? It's because God wants to deal with you as an individual. He wants to come and be your deliverer. He wants to be your comforter. He wants to be your prince of peace. He wants to show that it's me and you together. If all forsake you, I will not forsake you. &gt;&gt; God's constantly bringing us into a relationship with himself. &gt;&gt; Luke 17:34, I tell you, in that night there shall be two men in one bed. One shall be taken and the other shall be left. Two women shall be grinding together. The one shall be taken and the other left. Two men shall be in the field. The one shall be taken and the other left. This is discussing the translation and the rapture. We know that this starts way back when we first hear the message because the beginning of the rapture is a shout to gather the elect together. &gt;&gt; And in that gathering, there's already been separation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There was two who heard, but one followed. &gt;&gt; Yeah. you and a friend or you and a family member or you and whatever. But there was one who came out from among her. &gt;&gt; But the separation continues because your translation is not dependent on my revelation. &gt;&gt; My revelation won't change your Adams. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; My revelation will change my Adams. &gt;&gt; Your revelation will change your Adams. Your revelation will not translate your children. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your revelation will not translate your spouse. &gt;&gt; It's got to be a personal individual revelation ourselves. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When we come to the translation of the body and the change of the atoms, it'll be one by one with nobody else. &gt;&gt; I'll take one and I'll leave one. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Rem says in Christ is the mystery. He said his presence in the individual with a personal vindication of himself expressing himself the living word that's promised for the day expressing itself through you. A vindication of the great revelation of God. Look only in an individual. Never in a group. An individual. Not in a group. His identification is with an individual. Not with the Methodists, not with the Baptist, not with the Presbyterian, not the Lutheran, not the Pentecostals, but as an individual. I'll take one and I'll leave one. I'll separate them. That's right. There'll be two in the field. I'll take one and leave one. There'll be two in the bed. I'll take one and leave one. It's not a group. It's a personal vindication of a pregnantated child of God filled with the Holy Ghost, so surrendered to God that he don't care about anything else. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can I highlight that? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So surrendered to God, he don't care about anything else. &gt;&gt; Enoch got to this place. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the Holy Spirit living its life pulsating through him, showing the personal vindication of the word itself, expressing itself to the people and to the world. Enoch come into a personal relationship with God himself. And that personal relationship wasn't group. It wasn't family. But I don't believe that that personal relationship made him a bad husband. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He didn't forsake his wife and say, "Listen, I'm I'm dealing with the Lord. You leave me alone." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; He didn't become so spiritual that he stopped being a daddy. &gt;&gt; He didn't become so high in his revelation that he stopped being a good friend &gt;&gt; or a good neighbor. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Or a good citizen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I think Enoch was the best daddy. &gt;&gt; But I think his fear of God and his relationship with God made him a better father, &gt;&gt; made him a better husband, made him a better neighbor. I don't think he became so spiritually minded that he was of no earthly good. &gt;&gt; I don't think this personal relationship we have with the Lord Jesus Christ will make us deficient as a husband. &gt;&gt; I don't think it'll make us absent and negligent. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I don't think it'll make us negligent as fathers and as friends and as coworker. I don't think I don't think it's that kind of relationship. I think it's a relationship nobody else can enter into. But that relationship brings me into the life of Jesus Christ. Amen. And he was a good friend and he was a good brother and he was a good neighbor. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But he was a good son. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And I believe that Enoch got so surrendered to to God that he didn't care about anything else. Everything else comes secondary. Not that he was a bad father, but that God became his all in all. Brother Bham says, "But all this mystery is revealed only as he promised to his bride. Hell is against this truth of the revelation of this mystery. But the bride is standing on it. That's her stand." &gt;&gt; Why do you hunger, church? Why do you thirst? It's the father trying to reveal this hidden secret to you. But you let so many things get it out of you. You let your job, you let your wife, you let your husband, you let your children, you let the cares of the world, you let some pastor, you let somebody else get that out of you. When when you know that way down in your heart, you're thirsting, hungry. It's God trying to reveal it to you. See the revelation, the last day is here. What is it? We're hungering for him and for this revelation with him to enter in behind the veil. Amen. that we can let so many other relationships take it out of us. &gt;&gt; But there's got to be one relationship that means more than anything else to us. And I think that's the relationship that will affect all other relationships. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Beam says, "In a shame, let me speak to you as dying mortal that someday you've got to come to the end of this life. And I may not be there and another preacher may not be there but there is only one who can meet you there and that's God. And you listen to it and not whether my wife is a good Christian or my husband is a good Christian but I am I right with God. Have I met God like that? Not because my pastor met God or because my deacon met God but have I met him not because I shouted, not because I spoke in tongues, but because I met him as a person. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then you'll never be ashamed of that. There is something that is so perfect and pure and true. &gt;&gt; We'll never be afraid to cross death's gate &gt;&gt; when we've met him personally. &gt;&gt; We'll never be afraid of the rapture &gt;&gt; when we've met him personally. &gt;&gt; Never be afraid of the journey and this life coming to an end and a transition to the next life because we met him personally. Because there's a transition if if if if we don't go in the translation of the body in the next so many years. Amen. There's many among us who's going to transition to the sixth dimension. &gt;&gt; And you transition alone &gt;&gt; by yourself &gt;&gt; without anybody else. And how are you going to make it? Because you've walked with him. He'll walk you across Jordan. &gt;&gt; He'll not leave you nor forsake you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Bram says, "He that loveth not knoweth not God, for God is love." &gt;&gt; I want to leave you with this thought. &gt;&gt; I believe what Enoch came to was the capstone of love. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Perfect love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Pure love. He was the seventh from uh Adam. He had come to a perfect realization as a son of God into a perfect relationship with God until he actually was a foreshadow of the rapture in our day. &gt;&gt; And he was translated by faith and showing what path we're going to walk. But we know and to get to this place, we've got to come to the stature of a perfect man. We got to climb from faith, amen, to temperance into all these things until we finally come to the capstone which is love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Which is God himself. We climb to this capping off of us in perfect love. And this perfect love is so different than filio love. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The reason I believe Enoch came to perfect love is because when he came to this kind of love, he could walk out of the earth and leave his wife and children behind. &gt;&gt; You say that doesn't sound like love. No friends, this is perfect love. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not human love, not emotional love, not filio love, but perfect love and love is God. He got to the place where he began to understand like God understands. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He began to love like God loves and see like God sees. To the place where he understood, I can go on because God's got a plan for everyone and everything's under his control and all things work together. I'm not leaving them. I'm going the way God's called me to go because God has a plan for them. Amen. &gt;&gt; Perfect love brings us to a place where there's no anxiety. There's no fear. There's no heartbreak. You've come into perfect love. Perfect love is perfect realization of God. And God does all things well. And if God was calling Enoch home, Enoch come to the place where he realized if he's calling me home, the best place for me to be his home. The best place for my wife is for me to be home. The best place for my children is for me to go home. &gt;&gt; Because God's will is perfect. God's word is perfect. And if he wants me to go, the best thing I can do for them is to go. &gt;&gt; Not to stay, &gt;&gt; this love is so different than human love. &gt;&gt; It's so it's it's magnitudes beyond human love. &gt;&gt; It's a perfect realization. Brother Brandham when he went beyond the curtain of time says and I heard a voice then that spoke to me that was in the room said this is what you preached was the Holy Ghost. This is perfect love and nothing can enter here without it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Nothing can enter into the sixth dimension without perfect love. &gt;&gt; I am more determined than ever in my life that it takes perfect love to enter there. There was no jealousy. There was no tiredness. There was no death. Sickness could never in never enter there. Mortality could never make you old. And they could not cry. It was just one joy. Oh my precious brother. Look at this experience. I'm going to read a couple more quotes in this experience brother Brandham had. But brother, when you pass between here and yonder, it ain't that way there. Oh my. It's it's impossible. It's all love. Everything is real brother and everything's real sister. There's no death, no sorrow, no jealousy, no nothing. Nothing can enter there. It's just perfection. That's what I'm striving for. That's what I'm placing for I'm placing for. I said, Lord, that's what I'm here at the church for, trying to set the church in order. Telling you, brother and sister, there's only one thing that can enter there. That's perfect love. Not because you're loyal to the Brandham Tabernacle or the Methodist Church or the Baptist Church. Them's all right. You should be. But oh friends, not because you spoke with tongues, danced in the spirit, because you cast out devils or moved mountains with faith, that's all right for that's all right. But still, unless that real perfect love is in there, that was where perfect love was. And that's the only thing that'll let you in there. That's the only thing that can stay there. It's the only thing there was there. Oh my, it's an adoption. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When we come to adoption, we've got to come to the capstone. perfect love. &gt;&gt; That's why brother Bham said in the sixth dimension when you enter into perfect love, you've come into an adoption because you've come to the capping. You've come to God himself. &gt;&gt; And when brother Brandham entered into that realm, he says, I thought, now this is strange. I turned back around and I looked and there laid right there and there was my wife laying there on the bed and said, now you know what? I died. I said, that's what's happened. I've died. And he wasn't upset. &gt;&gt; He looked back and he says, "I wasn't 20t from where I was laying. He was looking at his body. And next to him in the bed was his wife, who he loved dearly. Probably loved more than he loved anything else on this earth. &gt;&gt; And he said, "hm, I died." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He didn't say, "Oh, my poor wife. Oh, God, let me go back. Oh, she can't handle this. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; He had entered into perfect love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And in perfect love, he knew everything is okay. &gt;&gt; Everything is fine. Listen, we can't understand that in the form we're in right now. We can't comprehend that. If you take me and separate me from my wife and see her laying there and say, "Now you're dead. You got to separate." I said, "No, no, let let me go back. If I go with the mind I have now and the feelings I have now, let me go take care of her. She's going to be heartbroken. I don't want to see her cry. I don't want her to suffer." But when you enter into that realm, it's totally different. In perfect love, you say, "God does everything perfect and everything well and everything's okay." And hey, I died and there's my wife. &gt;&gt; I don't mean to make a joke out of, but listen, folks. Look at his tone of voice. It He wasn't mourning. He wasn't sad. He wasn't afraid. Amen. There was no fear. There was no anxiety. There was no heartbreak. He said, "You couldn't cry. There was nothing but joy." He knew he'd enter into a realm of perfect love. And in perfect love, her suffering was going to be okay. It wasn't breaking his heart because he had enter into where God was. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh God, help us get to this place. Help us get to this place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Benham goes to the bedside of his wife, his first wife, who's dying. She's dying alone in a makeshift hospital, laying on a cot because of flooding that took place all over the Ohio Valley, separated from her husband, separated from her babies. And she dies all alone. Amen. And he finally finds her after she passed away. And he ran to her c. And he began to pray, "Oh God, oh God." And he starts calling for her to come back. And he says, this is in his life story. He says, "God, I know I've been wrong, but if you'll just let her speak to me one more time, will you, Lord, please let her speak?" Listen, I want you to look at the different perspective from him that's on earth and her that's entered into perfect love. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He said, "Please let her talk to me one more time. Please don't let her go. Please, Lord." &gt;&gt; And while I was praying, I looked. If I live to be a hundred years old, I'll never forget that. Those big dark eyes opened up and she looked at me. She motioned for me to get down. I looked at her. I said, "Sweetheart, you're all right, aren't you?" She said, "Why did you call me, Bill?" &gt;&gt; Not, "Thank you for bringing me back. I'm so lonely without you. I want to stay with you in my B." No. Why did you call me back, Bill? This is what walking with God will produce. This is the destination, friends, where everything's okay. Where everything's perfect, where God does all things well. She entered in there. Why did you call me, Bill? Why did you call me? I said, what do you mean? &gt;&gt; Look at these two different perspectives. I say, oh God, I want to walk with you till I enter into that perspective in life. &gt;&gt; What do you mean? She said, "Oh, I was so easy." She'd been suffering so hard. I said, "What do you mean easy, honey?" She said, "Well," she said, "Bill, you know I'm going, don't you?" I said, 'N no. She said, 'I am.' And she said, 'Bill, I don't mind it. &gt;&gt; He was minding it. &gt;&gt; He was scared. &gt;&gt; He was heartbroken. She'd entered to a place where there was no more heartbreak, no more fear, no more anxiety. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Friends, I want you to see this is the destination. &gt;&gt; This is where we're coming to. And I believe our walk with the Lord is going to bring us there. And even if we don't fully realize it till we translate, we're going to get closer and closer and closer and closer &gt;&gt; as we move with the Lord. Why? Because we've got to come to a stature of a perfect man. And we've got to move in the capstone of this kind of love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then she says further down she said another thing I want you to promise me. I said what's that? She said that you won't live single. I said, 'Oh, Hope, don't please, please don't ask me, honey. She said, 'Look, Bill, said, 'I'm in heaven. There'll be no marriage or given in marriage.' She said, and I got two little babies here I'm leaving you with. She said, I don't mind going, but I hate to leave you. Said, I hate to leave Billy and Paul and Sharon. She said, "But Billy, if they're raised up and you in the ministry and they be pulled about from pillar to post," she said, "find some good girl, some good girl that's got the Holy Ghost, and let her be in my place as a mother." I cannot imagine a woman saying that. She's in her 20s, only been married a couple years, looking at her young husband and saying, "Bill, get married. Promise me that you won't stay single, that you'll marry. Promise me there's two babies there in you. And I hate leaving you like that, but I'm happy to go. But promise me that you'll take some other woman and she can replace me as a mother. This is a different kind of love. &gt;&gt; This is a different kind of love. This is the kind of love I want to walk into. &gt;&gt; No jealousy, no anxiety, no fear, &gt;&gt; no pride, just perfect love. say, "God, help me." Brother Ram goes on to say in the fifth seal, "So then, but however, there was Fritz standing there licking me on the hand." Y'all know who Fritz is? His dog, his coonhound. Fritz standing there licking me on the hand. I couldn't cry. Nobody could cry. It was all joy. You couldn't be sad because it was all happiness. You couldn't die because it was all life. You couldn't get old because it was all youth. See, it was just perfect. I thought, "Oh, isn't this wonderful?" And millions, oh my, I was right at home. See, and just then I heard a voice and it cried out and said, "All that you've ever loved, reward for my service. I don't need no reward." He said, "All that you ever loved and all that ever loved you, God has given to you." I said, "Praise the Lord." I felt funny. I thought, "What's the matter?" I felt funny. I turned around and looked and on the bed, my body was moving. I said, "I don't have to go back. Surely, don't let me go." But the gospel had to be preached. In just a second, I was on the bed again. See, like that. Here's a man looking back and seeing his wife on the bed next to him, and he thinks, "Oh, I've died." He's looking around and there's you can't he said you can't be sad. You can't be &gt;&gt; it's impossible. It's not this is not a self-help like don't be sad. You couldn't be sad. &gt;&gt; You couldn't fear. You couldn't have any anxiety. You couldn't be nervous. &gt;&gt; You couldn't be upset. and he looks back and he sees his wife and he feels something funny and he sees his body moving in bed and he and he says, "I don't have to go back. &gt;&gt; His wife's laying there. &gt;&gt; She's getting ready to wake up and realize he's dead. She's going to probably cry, scream, call for the paramedics. Then his children will be &gt;&gt; But he'd enter into a realm that was so much higher." &gt;&gt; He said, "I don't don't let me go." He doesn't want to go back. He wasn't begging to go back. He didn't want to go. &gt;&gt; Hope wasn't begging to go back. &gt;&gt; She wanted to pass on. &gt;&gt; I don't want to go backwards in my walk with God. I want to keep moving till I strike this. &gt;&gt; I want to move higher in my revelation closer to him more into perfect love until I get to the place where if I have to walk alone, I can't save anybody by bailing out on God and going, I got to walk with God and everything's going to work out right. &gt;&gt; Amen. And what did brother Benham realize in that moment? Listen, when when Fritz come up and licked his hand and Prince come over his shoulder and knickered his saddle horse and his dog. Remember when Fritz died? &gt;&gt; Remember when the sheriff fed him a dog button, poisoned him and killed him? And Brother Man was so heartbroken and so upset and so distraught as a boy, he promised Fritz over his grave that he was going to kill him. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He said, "If I'll catch him out somewhere and shoot him. If not, I'll run him over with my car. He promised he took his gun and was going out the door and his dad rrestled him down and took the gun out of his hand cuz he was going to go kill him. He was so heartbroken, so dro so destroyed as a boy. But when he moved into the sixth dimension where there was perfect love, &gt;&gt; Fritz came up and licked his fingers. &gt;&gt; I think brother Benham realized everything's going to be okay. What have you suffered? Loss and heartbreak and disaster in your life. Listen, when you get to that side, you realize everything is okay. &gt;&gt; Everything God has atoned for, everything God has provided for, God has writed every wrong. When brother Brandham got to that place, God had writed every wrong. &gt;&gt; Everything was perfect and perfect love. Oh, please God, bring me into this realm of love to where if somebody does me wrong, it's okay because God will make it right. &gt;&gt; If I have a terrible loss in my life, it's going to be okay because it's going to come out right because God does everything well. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Bram says in first John or brother Bram 1 John 4:18 says there is no fear in love but perfect love cast out fear because fearth torment he that fearth is not made perfect in love. So many of my reactions to situations to disasters and heartbreaks and hardships is fear. But God let me walk with you into this realm of love where there's no more fear. where I'm not motivated by human emotions and fear and the lower form of love, but where I move into the higher form of love and I realize if I lose it here, I'll have it there. &gt;&gt; If it's stripped from me in a horrible way here, I will be given back to me because all that I ever loved and all that I ever loved me, God is going to write it all for all of his children. &gt;&gt; I don't know what that'll equate to for you or what that'll equate to for me, but I believe it. Amen. I believe the experience brother Benham had and I believe no matter what's been wrong here, God's going to make it all right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I just need to walk with him. &gt;&gt; In perfect faith, he said, "That's the way it is to all believers. They're a mystic. They're people that don't understand because they live in a world to themselves." Jesus lived in a world that nobody else could touch. The disciples couldn't understand them. When he spoke to them, they say this and then they said, "Why are you talking riddles? Why? We don't understand this. How can this be? See, they wasn't in the world that he lived in. They couldn't understand him. Nobody could understand him. And so, when a man lives by faith and walks by faith, I mean substance faith. He is isolated from the entire world and becomes a new creature in Christ there. Now, you're getting into bride material. That wasn't just for Jesus Christ. That's for you and I. &gt;&gt; You're getting into rapturing condition. Now that means for each one of us, not just the pastor, deacons, trustes. That means for the ley, every individual walks in a world with God alone. You're baptized into this kingdom and there's nobody in there but you and God. &gt;&gt; And in there, everything's okay. Amen. &gt;&gt; When you've gone beyond the outer court and you've gone beyond the walled curtains, you take another step into the inner curtain and there's another curtain that falls behind you. And then you go to that third phase where it's just you and God and there's yet another veil that falls behind you. In there, everything's okay. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In there is perfect love. In there is unity. in there is a trust and a faith in God that everything that's going on outside is okay. &gt;&gt; And listen friends, when things happen to us in life and tragedy strikes and heartbreak and hardship and things that we never thought we would deal with come our way, amen, the solution is not to fight back or scream or yell, but the solution is slip back into that inner veil and let that curtain fall behind you till everything is again okay. Your outer man can be shaken. Your heart could be broken. You could be shedding bitter tears. But in your soul, if you can commune with God and he can be in behind your inner veil and you can be behind in his inner veil, you can say be it unto me according to the Lord &gt;&gt; according to your word. Then that's the place where you can say the Lord giveth, the Lord taketh away. Blessed be the name of the Lord. That's where brother Brandham was when he stood by the bedside of his baby Sharon Rose suffering and twitching. Her eyes crossed. He was chewing away the flies. She was suffering so bad. And he prayed to God as any man would pray to God. God, don't take my baby. Don't let her die. What did he want? He wanted to take her home. He had just lost his wife. He was absolutely distraught. His nerves were on edge. And all he wanted was to hold that baby and care for her and let it live. maybe even as a reminder of his wife &gt;&gt; and a black sheet fell down and God wouldn't answer his prayer and the devil come in and started speaking to him and say he he's done so much but he doesn't care for you and you've done all this for him and said I was just about to agree with him and all of a sudden something changed something from within and he said the Lord giveth the Lord taketh away blessed Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Listen, that's something beyond human love, friends. That's beyond human. That's somebody who's been in behind the veil. That's somebody who's been in a love relationship with God Almighty that knows, "No, though he slay me, yet will I serve him because he is perfect &gt;&gt; in every way." Abraham said, "Many times and every time that a man ever done anything that's worth anything, he walked alone with God." But we think we have to have some great something around us to secure us. We This is what we're looking for. We're always looking for security. We're We're like sheep. We find security in numbers. &gt;&gt; The more people, the safer we feel. the more people that agree with us and the more people that gather around, we're we're looking for security in the wrong place. &gt;&gt; But to walk with God, we walk alone with God. &gt;&gt; When Paul went to prison, he went by himself. When he first stood, nobody stood with him. He stood alone. But God stood with him. &gt;&gt; What was his security? His security wasn't his friends. They weren't there. his security. Listen, when brother Benham come to the bedside of his baby, his security wasn't his buddies. They weren't there. His security wasn't his wife. She was gone. &gt;&gt; His security had to be the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what secures us as our relationship with God. 1 John 4, he says, "And we we have known and believe the love that God hath to us. God is love. And he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God and God in him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I in you, you in me. &gt;&gt; And that day you'll know that I am in the Father, the Father, me, I in you, and you in me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Me behind his veil, in him behind my veil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he that that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God. Amen. &gt;&gt; And God in him. Amen. &gt;&gt; What is this innervail relationship? It's bringing me to the capstone. &gt;&gt; It's bringing me to perfect love. It's bringing me to the place where though he slay me, yet will I serve him. &gt;&gt; It's bringing me to the realization, the Lord giveth, the Lord taketh away. Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's bringing us to a place where we can walk alone with God. And when it's time to leave this world, we're not asking the question, where's my wife? Where's my son? Where's my daughter? Where's my baby? Where's my this? But when we get to that place, like brother Brandon was in beyond the curtain of time, like like hope was in beyond the curtain of time. When we get to that place, all we're going to say is yes, Father, I'm coming. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because that perfect love makes everything perfect. &gt;&gt; And all is well. &gt;&gt; I want to finish with this. And you're here to fulfill it, too. Just walk unconscious of fear. Walk unconscious of criticism. Walk unconscious of this world. Walk as you walk in Christ. Walk with him. Not paying any attention to the right or the left hand. Just keep moving on. If something comes up in the church, walk with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If sickness strikes you, walk with God. &gt;&gt; If the neighbor don't like you, walk with God. Just keep on walking with God. Enoch one day walked like that. You know what he done? He walked all the way home with God. got so far up the road he didn't want to come back home anymore. Walk with God. Doctor says you're going to die. Walk with God. Doctor says you can't. Well, walk with God. Just walk with God. That's all. For God has promised you, I'll never leave you or forsake you. I'll be with you to the end of the world. And he took an oath by that covenant that he give you that he'd confirm it. Just walk with God then. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You'll have your ups and downs. Don't worry. You've got to go through brier patches, over sharp rocks, over bluffs, down on the hillside, up through the mountains, over waters, but walk with God. &gt;&gt; What is the solution to every problem? &gt;&gt; Get in behind the veil. &gt;&gt; Walk with God &gt;&gt; and with him alone. &gt;&gt; Where is he leading me? To perfect love. &gt;&gt; The perfect realization of perfect love to perfection. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when we get to that place, we won't be scared. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We won't be afraid. We won't worry. We won't have anxiety. &gt;&gt; We'll get to a place where it's just all joy. &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about in this natural life, this natural man, he's always going to be a certain way. That's why it's going to change. Amen. &gt;&gt; But inside on the inner veil, I want to get to this joy, this faith, this place of perfect love and perfect trust where I know no matter what's going on all around, I may have to quiet my flesh down and say, "Be quiet." But inside, I want to know all is well. &gt;&gt; If somebody poisons my dog, I want to say it's okay. God will write every wrong. Amen. &gt;&gt; If somebody does me wrong and does somebody does me evil, my neighbor don't like me or somebody takes my job or somebody lies about me on the job site for a promotion. Listen, I got to get to the place where I've walked with him so much I know he'll write every wrong and he'll take care of everything. And what does it matter to me anyways? If he wanted me to have it, I'd get it. If he doesn't want me to have it, I don't want it. I've got to walk with God. My place is in the inner chamber, not out here in the outer court where it rains and sun and wind and happy and sad. That's not where I belong. I belong in the inner chamber. I belong in the bedroom. I belong in the third phase of this relationship. &gt;&gt; And in there, everything's okay. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Let's stand together. Musicians, if you'll come and brother John, please. Amen. Sister Amanda, if you and your folks want to make your way around back for the baptism, I just want the rest of us to bow our heads and pray for just a moment. Dear heavenly father, I'm so thankful, God, for the word that you have given us. And God, I'm the first to say, Lord, I'm sorry. I'm sorry for being distracted. I'm sorry, Lord, for meandering in my walk. But oh God, I realize more than anything, I want to go beyond that last veil. And I want to remain there with you, Lord. I want to take that journey as far as I can take it right into your very presence. And there I want to remain walking with you. God, I I ask that you would just come and dwell in the innermost part of my life. That you would come behind my veil and my soul. that you would there would take your abode and may you draw me in behind your veil into the innerv. And God, may I there with you commune until everything in the world fades away. Until everything, Lord, becomes secondary to this love affair. God, may I come into the relationship that I can only have with you and can share with no one else. And may that relationship bring me to a greater love and a greater understanding and a greater realization of reality. Lord, if there's anybody here, Lord, who's never went beyond the outer court, may they hear your voice drawing them in further. God, if they've come into the inner court and they've discussed the wonderful things that are there, the light from the ages, the the showbread of fellowship, the altar of incense, and they're rejoicing in it. But Lord, may they realize that there's another veil. There's a deeper relationship. There's another place that they can go. And may they not be afraid to go alone. God, I pray as your voice is drawing us, may we come. As you're bidding us to come, may we lay down whatever's hindering us. If it's a relationship, may we lay it down, Lord. If it's if it's some ambition, may we lay it down. May we lay down anything that's hindering us. And may we move beyond that last veil and come into the Holy of Holies, into the place of your shikina glory, where we meet you in a way we've never met you before. Where we become one with you, Lord, and where we're changed, forever changed. And God, where you bring us into that atmosphere of love where everything, Lord, is going to be all right. where our faith just soarses because we know you're perfect and you do all things well and you cannot fail and our life is in your hands. God, bring us into that place. Let us abide in that place as Enoch walked with you before his translation. May we walk with you now in the last days before this final translation. And may we have faith to believe you, Lord, to take you at your word, to stand upon it and just hold on to it and believe it with all of our hearts. And may that word become our life. Bless your people, bless your children, guide us as we move from here. And may we never stop walking with you. We love you, Father, for your word. And may it become more and more of a reality to our hearts. We ask it in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. Just want to say Enoch raptured by himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I think it's time for us to get comfortable in our individual walk with the Lord. &gt;&gt; I think it's time for us to to find that our happiest place &gt;&gt; is alone with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where we have the most comfort is not in the group, but where we have the most comfort is alone. &gt;&gt; Amen. with God. That's right. &gt;&gt; In our times of meditation and devotion and prayer, I I I believe it's time that that is the last phase of our journey where we just walk with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. He was a foreshadow of us. So I know that if it happened to him, it'll happen to me. &gt;&gt; And may I walk with him. &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother John. Just beyond the veil. I long to see your face. Just to see your beauty there. Just beyond the veil. [Music] Beautiful. You are beautiful. You are beautiful. You are. You are. Beautiful. You are. And you're the prince of peace. peace. You're the prince of peace. You're the prince of peace. You are. You're the prince of peace. And marvelous you are. Marvelous you are. Marvelous you are. You are marvelous you are. Oh just beyond the veil. I long to see your face. Just to see your beauty there. Oh, just beyond the veil. And you're the prince of peace. You're the prince of peace. You're the prince of peace. You are. For you're the prince of peace. It's just beyond the veil. Just to see your face, just to see your beauty there, just beyond the way. &gt;&gt; What a wonderful day to see God still drawing his children and drawing Sister Amanda. And God has been drawing her for quite a while and she's responding to that call. Amen. And she wants to be identified with the Lord Jesus Christ by taking his name in water baptism. So, we're so happy for you, Amanda. So happy that the Lord has drawn you and that you want to make a public declaration of what God has done in your heart. And you want the world to know that you're identified with Jesus Christ in his death, burial, and resurrection, and that you intend to live for him. So because of your confession of what the Lord has done in your heart and your desire to be baptized in his name, it's with great pleasure that I now baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Dear heavenly father, I lay hands on my sister, Lord, and so appreciative, Lord, that you know how to draw, that you're a great shepherd that can lead a sheep back home. And God, as she has fulfilled your word, she's been obedient to what you've called her to. Lord, I pray God, you confirm the promise that you've made to her, upon her, that she will receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost. May you walk in her every day of her life. May you shield her from the fiery darts of the enemy. May she become a light in this world and a testimony of your saving grace. And may you use her, Lord, as you intended to from before the foundation of the world as part of your kingdom. And may she do the work that you've left for her to do. Bless her in all of this. We pray in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. God bless you, sister Amanda. God bless you all. Thank you, brother John. &gt;&gt; I have a maker. He formed my heart. And before even time began, my life is in his hands. And he knows my name. And he knows my every thought. And he sees each tear that falls. And he hears me when I call. All. Oh, I have a father. He calls me his own. And he'll never leave me. Oh, no matter where I go. Oh, he knows my name. He knows my every thought. He sees each tear that falls. And he hears me when I call. [Music] Oh, he knows my name. [Music] He knows my every thought. And he sees each tear that falls. and he hears me when I call. How deep the Father's love for us. How fast that beyond all measure that he would give his only son to make a wretch of treasure. How great the pain of searing loss. The father turns his face away [Music] as wounds which are the chosen one. Bring many sons to gloryy. Behold the man upon a cross. My guilt upon his shoulders. ashamed. I hear my mocking voice call out among us scers. [Music] It was my heat that held him there [Music] until it was accomplished. [Music] His dying breath has brought me life. I know that it is finished. How great the golf that God did spend to come where I lay helpless. Through tears I see his outstretched arms as he declares me guiltless. How great his love that sought me out. How infinite his mercy. His blood has cleansed my every part and placed me as his purchase. I will not boast in anything. No gift, no power, no wisdom. [Applause] [Music] But I will boast in Jesus Christ his death and resurrection. Why should I gain from his reward forth? I cannot give an answer, but this I know with all my heart. His fruits have paid my ransom. [Music] Why should I gain from his reward? I cannot give an answer, [Music] but this I know with all my heart. His words have paid my ransom. [Music] Here is here is love. Here is love vast as the ocean. Loving kindness as the flood. When the prince of life, our ransom shed for us, his preious blood. Oh, his love will not remember. Look who can cease to sing his praise. He will never be forgotten. throughout his eternal days. On the mount of crucifixction, fountains open and deep and wide. Through the floodgates of God's mercy, oh flow of glass and a gracious time, grace and love like mighty rivers poured incessant [Applause] from above. Heaven's peace and perfect justice. Kiss the guilty world in love. Let me all thy love except thee. Love thee ever all my days. Let me see thy kingom only. and my life be to thy praise. Thou alone will be my glory. Nothing in the world I see. Thou has cleansed and sanctified me. Thou thyself has set me free. and in thy truth thou dost direct me. By thy spirit through thy word and thy grace my need is meeting as I trust in thee my Lord. Oh, of your fullness thou art pouring. Thy great love and power on me without meful and boundless. Drawing out my heart to thee. For in thy truth thou dost direct me by thy spirit through thy word and thy grace my need is meeting as I trust in thee my Lord of your fullness thou art pouring me. Thy great love and power on me, oh without measure full and boundless, drawing out my heart to thee. [Applause] [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Oh, [Music] heat. [Music] dark. [Music] Oo. Oh.
