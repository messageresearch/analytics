========================================

in sincerity with a sincere heart wanting to actually do something for God but not doing it according to the word. &gt;&gt; That's the greatest temptation you and I are going to face. &gt;&gt; What's the solution to the temptation? Paul told us, I die daily. &gt;&gt; I die to my wants. I die to my dreams. I died to my ambitions. I died to my pride. I die to all of that and surrender to his word. Amen. &gt;&gt; And secondly, I want to walk in a relationship with him to where he can correct me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To where he can come like he did to David and said, "David, you got the right idea in bringing the ark back. You got the right motive, but you're doing it wrong." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; And David would say, "Oh, God." He doesn't go back to everybody and says, "You know, I think um uh I had another idea." trying to keep his pride and trying to look good. No, I believe David went back and says, "Guys, I got it all wrong. This is where we failed. &gt;&gt; We didn't keep the word." Amen. We had the right desire. We had sincerity. We We wanted to worship God. We wanted his presence among us, but we we failed to keep the word. OH, LET'S COME BACK TO the word. And when they come back to the word, look at the revival. Look at the jubilee. Look at the dancing. Look at the sing. LOOK AT THE SHOUTING. AS THE ARK CAME, THE WORD CAME ON THE SHOULDERS OF THE LEVITES, MARCHING BACK INTO JERUSALEM, BRINGING THE WORD AND THE PRESENCE OF GOD BACK INTO THEIR MIDST. AND DAVID DANCED BEFORE THE LORD UNTIL HIS WIFE CALLED HIM A FOOL. &gt;&gt; HE WAS SO EXCITED. WHAT WAS EXCITING DAVID? DAVID WAS SO THRILLED. AMEN. BECAUSE GOD HAD CORRECTED HIM AND GOD HAD TOLD HIM, "WHAT YOU DESIRE IS RIGHT, BUT YOU GOT TO DO IT THE RIGHT WAY." AND NOW DAVID KNEW THE RIGHT WAY. AND DAVID COULD HARDLY CONTAIN HIS JOY BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO WORK THIS TIME. IT'S GOING TO WORK THIS TIME. THE PRESENCE OF GOD IS COMING BACK AMONG US BECAUSE WE'RE DOING IT ACCORDING TO THE WORD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; EVERY FEW STEPS SLAY OXEN. EVERY FEW STEPS SLAY. WHAT ARE THEY DOING? REJOICING. REJOICING. REJOICING BECAUSE THE word's coming back. &gt;&gt; TILL HE DANCED BEFORE THE LORD WITH ALL HIS MIGHT AND DISROED HIS OUTER GARMENTS. TILL HIS WIFE BEGAN TO MOCK HIM, WHICH WAS SAUL'S DAUGHTER. &gt;&gt; HAD THE SAME PROBLEM HER DAD DID, PRIDE. &gt;&gt; And she said, "IF YOU DIDN'T LIKE THAT, COME WATCH ME TOMORROW." &gt;&gt; LIKE, THAT'S NOT PRIDE, FRIENDS. THAT'S NOT ARROGANCE. THAT'S A MAN WHO KNOWS THAT WORD IS GOING TO COME BACK BECAUSE GOD GAVE ME THE WORD AND THAT WORD CAN'T FAIL. AND I KNOW EXACTLY NOW HOW TO ACCOMPLISH WHAT'S IN MY HEART. &gt;&gt; I KNOW HOW TO WORSHIP HIM. I KNOW WHAT HE WANTS. AMEN. CAN YOU IMAGINE ABEL WAITING TO WORSHIP GOD? AMEN. AT THE GATE OF OF EDEN, NOT KNOWING WHAT GOD WANTS AND HOW TO WORSHIP HIM AND HOW TO PLEASE HIM. CAN YOU IMAGINE HIS JOY WHEN HE GOT THE REVELATION? GOD WANTS BLOOD. ALL OF A SUDDEN, IT DAWNED ON HIM. WHAT DID HE DO WHEN MY PARENTS FELL? WHAT WAS GOING ON THERE? WHY AM I IN this condition? WHY ARE WE OUTSIDE OF THE GARDEN? ALL OF A SUDDEN, HE REALIZED HE WANTS BLOOD. &gt;&gt; CAN YOU IMAGINE HIS REJOICING AS HE WENT SKIPPING AND JUMPING AND RUNNING TO GO FIND A LAMB? BECAUSE NOW I KNOW WHAT WILL WORK. I KNOW WHAT GOD WANTS. I KNOW HOW TO PLEASE THE LORD. IT WILL WORK &gt;&gt; because it's according to the word. &gt;&gt; WE TRY TO SAVE PEOPLE. WE TRY TO DO GREAT WORKS FOR GOD. WE TRY CAMPAIGNS. WE TRY ALL OF THIS AND IT WON'T WORK IF IT'S NOT DONE ACCORDING TO THE WORD. &gt;&gt; The word IS THE WAY. IT'S BEEN THE WAY FROM THE BEGINNING. WE'VE GOT TO COME BACK TO THE WORD. AND PRAISE GOD, GOD HAS SENT BACK HIS WORD IN THIS DAY BY A VINDICATED PROPHET TO BRING US THE FULL TEACHING OF THE FATHERS OF FAITH.
