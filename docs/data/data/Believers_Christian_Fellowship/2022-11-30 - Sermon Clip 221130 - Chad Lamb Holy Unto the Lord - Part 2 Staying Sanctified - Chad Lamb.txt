========================================

he has Sanctified Us by his Spirit he has filled us he's burnt out the worldly Nature by the Holy Ghost he's come to take residence in US amen so that we will stay consecrated to him amen not because we have to but because we want to I I grew up and oh I grew up in all kinds of preaching friends and youth meetings and all kinds of gatherings I hit the altar every time the events have started naming bad things in your life because it was there what other choice did I have but it was this Revelation that was contained in the seals that that unsealed who I am there was the Revelation under the seals that unsealed who I am I knew God was holy but I didn't realize that I was supposed to be holy I I knew he was holy but I didn't realize he he because he wanted to be he wanted me to be the Tabernacle that was going to be Tabernacle deity in this day and when I come to realize what God wanted to do in this generation that he wanted the deity to be tabernacled and flashed and that he wanted my flesh to be part of that Tabernacle all of a sudden everything in my life changed it wasn't anymore I have to be a good boy to make it to Heaven I realize I've already made it I made it before the foundation of the world when he placed my name on The Book of Life amen before it was there I was in his thoughts I was always with God and always a part of God I'm not in jeopardy of being lost I'm not conducting myself in a way to be saved I recognize I'm saved I'm conducting myself in a way to keep myself in his purpose [Music] because I recognize his purpose in my life I won't join in in the things of the world not because I'm going to be punished not because lightning bolts are going to hit me or because the rest of the church will reject me I I know what he wants me to do and now that's what I'm consecrating myself for I know who I am I know my purpose in life I know the light that's supposed to shine from this vessel now I sanctify myself for their sakes amen because they're not going to find him in a system they're not going to find him in Hollywood they're not going to find him in pleasures of the world where will they find him he'll find him in the word that's coming forth from his bride she's the final voice and the final age how can I now live an unconsecrated life where somebody won't hear the voice of God you understand going behind the veil changes everything entering the little room amen having him unveil himself to you it changes everything
