and as a Christian you have to keep life inside of you and I was thinking about this because this sister tells us she was from Siberia and it gets really cold up there Moldova in there and they'd gone to Russia I think she was born there sister Kia she was telling me the story one day she was coming home from school and she got really tired and it's so cold up there we were up there in Saskatchewan it was minus 36 degrees I don't know how people do it I tell I told him I said you know the first thing I'm going to tell Eve when I see Eve I say Eve whatever they tell you do it you don't know what 30 negative 36 degrees is you broke the rules now it's the curse it's just so it was so cold and so now this Kia she's talking about living in in Siberia and it was so cold and she she one day she she was coming home from school and she just sat down by the road and she got tired she sat down and just rested and she was just resting she got home she told her mom said Mom I was so tired and so cold coming I just sat down by the side and her mother looked at her said don't you ever don't you ever sit down by the side of the road in that cold weather because that's the first sign of freezing to death and dying and I'm here to tell you we live in a generation where it's becoming cold amen and we see the Revival and it's getting cold don't ever ever sit down along the road somewhere and say I'm just going to rest right here because it's death it's the signs of death you keep going to church you keep lifting up your hands amen and Mary when you when you get cold really say you start rubbing your hand I mean you create your own heat amen you start rubbing and I might have to clap my hands I might have I might even have to shout a little bit what are you doing I'm keeping life in me I refuse to get cold and Lady you'll see a hot or cold amen hot or cold say Lord I want to be hot for you I don't care what people think I don't care if they think I'm a fanatic I'm alive I'm alive I don't know they feel like well I don't know I'm alive being my birthday I'll be 55 years now I'm alive I've been married 35 years you know ups and down like I'm married still have a desire to go to God I made some mistakes along the way but this message works and it's the Gospel of Jesus Christ and I'm not ashamed of the Gospel it works hey man I'm gonna keep going on I'm going to keep pressing on maybe there's somebody streaming here this morning amen and you'd like to hear that keep pressing on don't get cold along the way somewhere pick up your Bible get down on your knees sick God help me God strengthened me Lord I want to renew myself this morning things that are to be things that are to be
