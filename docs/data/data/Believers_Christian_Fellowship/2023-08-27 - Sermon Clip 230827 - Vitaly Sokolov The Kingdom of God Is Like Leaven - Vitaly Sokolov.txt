========================================

the meal is actually made of grain but the the parable doesn't say she had to mix the leaven with the grain right so the grain the wheat had to undergo a certain process before 11 was actually added right and and the process is not nice because before that you would have different sizes of the grains right oh you have a lot of stuff here to use as as visual aids you know so so so you would have a grain this size and then you would have a grain this size and it would have a grain this size and we have a tall grain like this you know and before before they go into the process of grinding they're all different sizes right sorry this may be for the kids you know you never know so it depends on what the audience is pulling you know so but but I mean just different we we come up you know as as bright material as bright raw material we come in different sizes right we come come in you know and and you know sometimes uh you know these guys are kind of the same but when this guy shows up it's like oh I'm a real grain you know oh so so they're all you know coming into the grinding machine but but they they're talking in between themselves and they're saying you know you know this this guy says you know I'm kind of one of the tallest and biggest and decisions of this one that says and I've always lived a clean life you know you know and this and this and this guy says well I'm kind of the the highest and the tallest here and I'm kind of you know really stylish and nice here but how about this guy and this guy doesn't even open his mouth you know he's like is is looking up to all of them is like am I will I ever make it but this guy here you know he lifts his voice and he says you all guys you don't know what you're talking about you know because you know I'm so big and tall nobody can beat me well nobody except the grinding machine oh my goodness so then then the Lord takes all of them Embraces because he actually loves all of them so he loves all of them and he's like oh you you look nice now but after you come out from there you look even nicer so so he opens up you know the the machine oh you got the machine here right yeah so he opens you know the the uh the the grinding machine and he throws all of this into here and there's a lot of work there's a lot of Trials you know brother Brown says but today I know it was all working for my good I know the life had to be ground Twisted squeezed and to get what it was out there was too much Brenham in there had to be squeezed out before God could take himself known so that means before you receive a revelation before crisis is ready to to be added as leaven you should be meal by then you should be grounded by then oh because without humility you you're not receiving revelation Hallelujah so all of these guys go into the grinding machine and when they get out there's no big ones there's no tall ones there's no transparent ones there's no small ones they are all the same size and by then they are already mixed together laughs so when there's all the same size and it's almost like you know did you did you also have to go through that oh yeah did your kids do that oh yeah did you pray for so many nights and days oh yeah do they have a problem with your job oh yeah do they have a health issue oh yeah all of these we all have to go through that
