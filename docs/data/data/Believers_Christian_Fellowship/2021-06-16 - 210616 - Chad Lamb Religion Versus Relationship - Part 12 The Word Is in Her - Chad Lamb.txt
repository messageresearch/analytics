wonderful to be together again and thank god for the atmosphere amen hebrews chapter 11 we're going to continue on this would be part 12 of religion versus relationship and i there was some thoughts i touched on at the end of sunday but i didn't really have a time or opportunity to go into it so i just felt today just the inspiration to back up and grab that and just expound on it a little bit and so i'd like to subtitle this the word is in her the word is in her and i would like to begin in hebrews 11 and reading verse 11 again hebrews 11 11. through faith also sarah herself received strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised therefore sprang there even of one and him as good as dead so many as the stars of the sky and the multitude and is the sand which is by the seashore innumerable you can see here that the fulfillment of the prophecy that was given to abraham god had promised abraham that he would have seed he promised him he told him to come out and look up in the heavens and count the stars if you can and and he told him so shall thy seed be so there was a prophecy there that was given to abraham and god was going to perform this prophecy amen but we found now that the prophecy was contingent upon a woman and now that's why here in in hebrews it says by faith abraham he he left you know when he was called he left and went into a strange land he did that by faith but when it come time to perform the fulfill the promise of seed coming forth to fulfill that promise god was going to have to through faith he's going to make a way through faith that sarah herself receives strength to conceive seed because when god made the promise to abraham it included sarah praise god let's bow our heads and ask the lord's blessing over the word this evening lord jesus we thank you for the privilege of gathering once again and lord may we never take these opportunities lightly god help us to fight the tendency to make it a tradition or just another wednesday night or just another service a routine of life an obligation on the calendar something we do as a family lord may we fight all of that may we come to you fresh right now saying lord we want to hear from you we come here to worship you we come here to receive from you that way we have need of lord it's not a routine it's not another service lord this is the time this is the moment you've called us you've drawn us this is our life this is where time and eternity meet is in the now and god we're asking that you would come and break the bread of life for us that the eternal things would become the reality for us and all the carnal things would begin to fade away god i pray that you set our affections on things on high and lord that you would lift us lord out of the natural and into the supernatural by your word we ask that you would take control of this vessel lord and speak your word in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can be seated so you can see although the promise in the word was to abraham because sarah was a part of abraham she was also included in that promise because adam was given a bride to reproduce himself that's what the bride was given for christ was given a bride amen to do the same thing and so now we know abraham has a has a bride he has sarah he has a wife but when god made the promise to abraham it included sarah so sarah was going to have to receive faith amen and through faith sarah received strength to conceive seed so god couldn't leave sarah out of this promise she was part of it in fact she was contingent upon the whole fulfillment of the prophecy was dependent upon sarah amen so god was going to have to do something for sarah sarah was going to have to get into the right condition so god by his grace and his mercy and this for ordained plan was going to get her into the right condition let's go back to genesis 21. we went all through this on sunday but we just want to touch this as we take this subject we we now find out that in that in chapter 18 18 1 we know that the lord appeared unto him in the plains of memory and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the dead as he sat in the tender the heat of the day and he lifted up his eyes and he looked and three men so this we know is when the lord comes to abraham and and we he sees three forms but he says lord because he recognizes the lord and now that was a visitation to abraham and in that visitation it was elohim in flesh and that elohim and flesh was discerning the thoughts and intents of the heart the thoughts of the heart and sarah and the tent behind him and so now the now the discernment was being performed upon sarah and he says why did sarah laugh and sarah said i didn't laugh and he said you did and so now there was this whole episode in genesis 18 now this visitation of elohim and flesh and the and the sign of the messiah the discernment amen it gave them faith and by faith they were turned back young again and then we know now in verse 20 they go down into gerar and go and in gerar now abimelech the king wants sarah for his own amen and she's been turned back young again but though she's been turned back young again she even made the statement she said shall i being old have pleasure with my lord him also being old amen so now she was brother graham said they were past the time amen of family relations but that was going to be restored that was going to be restored under this sign of the messiah they were going to be turned back young again and they could go back to what they were when they were first married but yet there still was not a conception so now we come to chapter 21. and in chapter 21 it said in the lord visited sarah the lord visited sarah he had come to abraham in a dream he had come to abraham in a vision he had come to abraham in flesh but now the lord in order to bring this promise amen all to pass amen god was going to give sarah faith to conceive and god god visited sarah as he had said and the lord did unto sarah he had spoken for sarah conceived and bear abraham a son in his old age at the set time of which god had spoken to him this in verse 21 gives us no other details there's no there's no signs there's no manifestations there's no great meetings there's just a private visitation of the lord and in the private visitation of the lord amen he confirms the promise and now the promise is going to be a conception and that conception is going to be inside of sarah and now in sarah is going to be the promised word amen that word is going to begin to manifest and as it begins to manifest it's going to take a private visitation the lord is going to visit sarah and when he visits sarah now there's going to be a conception and that conception is going to be the fulfillment of the promise and the fulfillment of the promise is coming into her and now she is carrying the very fulfillment of the promise and nobody saw anything there was no public show there was no great meeting there was no great there was no great powerful demonstration for the eye to see but the powerful demonstration was something that was coming inside of sarah and it was the confirmation of the promise that god had made now was coming alive inside of sarah for by faith through faith she was given strength to conceive and the lord visited sarah and she conceived and now as she's walking around nobody can tell that something has changed not every nobody around her can tell but she knows herself because she received the visitation now she knows it's changed and then it begins to manifest her whole being begins to change everything around her becomes becomes subject to the life that's on the inside and then we know sarah brings forth and and brings forth the promised son we go on let's continue reading down through here verse 3 and abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him whom sarah bear to him isaac and abraham circumcised his son isaac being eight days old as god had commanded him and abraham was a hundred years old when his son isaac was born unto him and sarah said god hath made me to laugh so that all that hear me will laugh with me and she said who would have said unto abraham that sarah should give him children should give children suck for i have borne him a son in his old age and the child grew and was weaned and abraham made a great feast the same day that isaac was weaned and sarah saw the son of hagar the egyptian which she had borne unto abraham mocking wherefore she said unto abraham cast out this bondwoman cast out this bondwoman and her son for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son even with isaac and the thing was very grievous in abraham's sight because of his son and god said unto abraham let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad and because of the bondwoman in all that sarah has said oh praise god and all that sarah sarah was the one who talked to abraham the first time and told him this is how we're going to bring about the word god has he's shut me off from bearing children it's not possible for me and now we're going to take my handmaid and you go into my handmaid and she'll raise up seed for us it was sarah's idea it was sarah's thought it was sarah's way of intellectually bringing the word to pass and it brought corruption amen it brought a hybrid product it brought a corrupt product amen and so she spoke in which she spoke according to her own wisdom according to her own understanding according to what her eyes could see and what she could understand it brought forth an ishmael but now something has changed and sarah sarah has now come in contact with god the lord has visited her amen the mystery has been revealed to her and now she has conceived the word and her whole understanding has changed amen everything that she thought was logical and reasonable and made sense before now she saw the failure of it all because she had come and the lord had visited her and she conceived on the word and now she's brought forth the word now her eyes are open her understanding has changed everything about her is different now and now she knows that these two can't dwell together anymore and that's where god is bringing his bride to amen that she's got a visitation from the lord amen son the word has been quickened inside of this bride and now she knows that what we used to think was okay what we used to the way we used to try to serve god the way we used to try to fulfill his word the way we used to think was right amen it's not right and it won't work and now cast out this bondwoman and when you come in contact with the lord when you come in contact with the seventh seal and the seventh seal mystery is unlocked in your life and you conceive on the word and the word comes into you everything in your understanding changes amen now you realize why it was a failure why it wouldn't work why denominations will never fulfill the word of god why human reasoning and wisdom and intellect will never be god's way now all of a sudden you understand why and you say cast it out lord cast out the bondwoman verse 12 again and god said unto abraham let it not be grievous in thy sight because the lad and because of thy bond woman and all that sarah hath said unto thee hearken under her voice so now sarah has a voice and the voice of sarah is the word of god and god is backing it up and saying that it's right and that sarah has said unto thee hearken unto her voice for an isaac shall thy seed be called let's turn to galatians chapter four i said we've we went through this we touched on this sunday but i want to take a little more time galatians chapter 4 verse 30. the apostle paul is speaking now and he says nevertheless what saith the scripture cast out the bondwoman and her son for the son of the bondwoman should not be heir with the son of the free woman the apostle paul is now quoting sarah sarah is the one in the scripture who says this sarah the sarah said this to abraham abraham was troubled but the lord came to abraham and said listen hearken to all that sarah said hearken to her voice and now the apostle paul picks this up and says nevertheless what saith the scriptures after she had as she had a visitation from the lord and she had brought forth the word she conceived on the word and brought forth the word now amen she had become one with the plan of god she had come to a different level of understanding now she knew the promise she knew the word she knew it intimately she had carried it she become one with it she brought it forth and now when she spoke amen the lord told abraham you listen to her and the apostle paul picks it up and says this is scripture does not scripture say now let's turn over to ii timothy 2 timothy chapter 3 this is also the apostle paul ii timothy chapter 3 verse 16 all scripture is given by inspiration of god what did paul say that sarah said he said what sarah said with scripture now he's telling you all scripture is given by inspiration of god where did sarah get this it was by inspiration of god and god backed it up amen and all scripture is given by inspiration of god and is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction and righteousness brother ben says in the laodicean church age out of the church age book he says well let me find the right spot here he says he quotes revelation 10 7 in the days of the voice of the seventh messenger when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he has declared to his servants to prophets there it is he is sending a vindicated prophet he is sending a prophet after almost two thousand years he is sending someone who is so far from organization education in the world of religion that as john the baptist and elijah of old he will hear only from god and he will have thus saith the lord and speak for god he will be god's mouthpiece and he as it is declared in malachi 4 6 will turn sorry he will turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers he will bring back the elect of the last day and they will hear a vindicated prophet give the exact truth as it was with paul he will restore the truth as they had it and those elect with him in that day will be the ones who truly manifest the lord and be his body and be his voice and perform his works hallelujah do you see it a momentary consideration of church history will prove how accurate this thought is in the dark ages the word was almost entirely lost to the people but god sent luther with the word the lutheran spoke for god at that time but they organized and again the pure word was lost for organization tends towards dogma and creeds and not simple word they could no longer speak for god then god sent wesley and he was the voice with the word in his day the people who took his revelation from god became the living epistles read and known of all men for their generation when the methodist failed god raised up others and so it has gone on through the years until in the last day there's there is again another people in the land who under their messenger will be the final voice to the final age man sarah had a voice amen and god said it was right paul said it was scripture amen it was laying down an example because god is now speaking he's still speaking he come and spoke to the prophet the word was given to the bride and now god has a mouthpiece god has a voice and that's his living epistles that's his living word that's his living bride her very life is speaking the word her actions coming subject to the word and obedience to the word is is declaring speaking living this word he said yes sir the church is no longer the mouthpiece of god it is its own mouthpiece so god is turning on her he will confound her through the prophet and the bride for the voice of god will be in her yes it is for it says in the last chapter revelation verse 17 the spirit and the bride say come once more the world will hear direct from god is at pentecost but of course that word bride will be repudiated as in the first age now he has cried out to this last age you have the word you have more bibles than ever but you are not doing anything about the word except dividing and hacking it into pieces taking what you want and leaving out what you don't want you are not interested in living it but debating it so what is god interested in the debate or the life he's interested in living this word this is a living word i would sooner you record her hot if you were cold and rejected i could stand that if you could get white hot to know its truth and live it i would praise you for that but when you simply take my word and don't honor it i in return must refuse to honor you i will spew you out for you nauseate me further down in the same court he says oh god still has a voice for the people of the world even as he has given a voice to the bride that voice is in the bride as we have said and we will talk more about that later we will get to that later part so god still has a voice for the people of the world in that voice in god he has given a voice to the bride the voice is in the bride let's turn to revelations chapter 10. these are things that we have been through before they are not new things but i want to bring them in and go over them again at this time in revelations 10 verse 7 it says but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets and the voice which i heard from heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth and i went into the angel and said unto him give me the little book now this is john but john is the type of the bride and now john is told to go and say to the angel amen give me the book and so he says he said it to the angel give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and i took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as i had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings so now we know that after the manifestation of revelations 10 7 the mystery of god is finished that that now john typing the bride has to take the little book and get it from the angel amen from the angel who opened the book and had the open book in his hand he goes to the angel says give me the book and he says take it take the book and eat it up amen so the bride has got to take this open book and she has got to feed on it and eat it up eat it up means eat all of it and when she eats all of it it'll be in her mouth sweet as honey but in her belly it's bitter because when she's taking it in she's enjoying it but when she has to when she has to digest it and become one with it and begin to live it now it makes her belly bitter because it's hard to live in a world that rejects the word but he says take it eat it it'll be sweet in thy mouth and bitter in the belly for thou must prophesy again amen so there has to come forth that she has to prophesy again there's a there's the continuation of the giving forth of the word but this word prophesy again it's not more prophecy because you can know you can't add to or take away the message has already been given through the prophet the bride is not here to find more amen to add to her to take away she's prophesying again what has already been spoken amen what has already been given she'll be saying what he says we'll get to that quote in a little bit amen but i'd like to just make a comment on saying what he says when you know when brother branham went beyond the curtain of time and went beyond the curtain of time he was asking could i see jesus and no he'll come to you and you'll be judged for what you preached and we'll be judged with you you remember this and brother man said well what about paul and his group he said he'll be judged with this he said well i preached what paul preached and everybody there said we're resting on that so brother branham preached what paul preached he said what paul said is that true but brother branham did not get into the pulpit every week and say i want to start in the book of romans romans chapter 1 and he read the first chapter of romans closed his book and left and said i'm only going to say what paul says then next sunday he comes back and he reads chapter 2 and he closes the book and leaves the next sunday he comes back and reads chapter three and all he does is stand in the pulpit and read exactly what paul said when he said what paul said he preached what paul preached he had the same truth amen and he could go back through the bible the old testament that paul went through and he could find examples he could find amen he could find that word laying all the way through there he could bring it out and preach it and he could even use scriptures paul didn't use so to say what paul says doesn't mean that he can only just repeat what paul wrote he's saying the same thing amen it's what paul had brought it's the truth that was revealed to him amen and brother branham picked it up and now he was carrying that same thing and he and he and he was finding it all through the scriptures so now when the bride says what the prophet says amen that's why we don't just get up and just start reading out of crisis the mystery of god revealed we'll read the first 10 pages today close it and the preacher leaves and we come back next sunday and we pick up the next 10 pages saying well you know we only say what he says no you say what he says amen but do you say what he says in the spirit of what he says you say the same thing he's saying but you can find it through the whole bible that's why brother branham said i'm just hitting the high places amen just enough so that you'll get it so you can go home and study it out so sometimes you get a wrong concept of what it means just to say what he says but you cannot add to or take away from the revelation that's been given to us the prophet brought it god brought it through the prophet we're not here to come up with our own message we've been given the message we must prophesy again amen that say what he said let's go to luke chapter 1. luke chapter 1 and verse 38. in luke chapter one mary is going to have a visitation from an angel now there was there was a prophecy given over adam and that was the multiply and replenish and he was given a wife so that he could reproduce himself he was given a bride but that wife she come to her own understanding and her own intellect and by her own human effort to bring forth the word she brought corruption abraham was given a prophecy and under that prophecy abraham had a wife amen and that wife amen through her own understanding and her own intellect and her own human effort tried to bring forth that prophecy and what did she bring corruption every time human beings tries to bring forth the word through human effort they bring corruption but now it's time for god to bring forth the promise of the of the the the seed of the woman and now he's got to come to mary there's nothing mary can do to produce this word there's nothing in her human effort there's nothing in her intellect there's nothing in her wisdom that she can do to make this prophecy laying in isaiah come to pass even though she's the chosen one she's the predestinated vessel she can't make it happen amen god's got a designated time and he's got a designated season and the visitation and the angel will come to her and say now's the season now's the time and in her understanding she doesn't even necessarily understand how that it's physically going to happen and she even questions that but when he gives her an answer it's going to be the holy ghost and she says be it unto me according to your word and now when god comes to confirm the promise now it's perfect now when a human being tries to bring the promise to pass it goes into corruption amen it brings a perversion it brings a corruption but when god does it himself amen it brings forth the word it brings restoration it brings life that's why human effort will never produce the word of god god will produce his own word he's looking for somebody just to surrender and in verse 38 says and mary said behold the handmaid of the lord be it unto me according to thy word and the angel departed from her and mary arose in those days and went into the hill country with haste into the city of judah and entered into the house of zacharias and saluted elizabeth and it came to pass that when elizabeth heard the salutation of mary the babe leapt in her womb what babe this is now john the baptist what is john the baptist john the baptist is the word and now the word is in elizabeth right the word of god the prophecy amen that was laying in the word of god now the word is in elizabeth elizabeth now is carrying the word her and the word are one unit together and when she hears the salutation of mary amen that word inside of her left and listen and and elizabeth was filled with the holy ghost and she spake out with a loud voice now elizabeth has a voice and said blessed art thou are among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb and when says this to me that the mother of my lord should come to me for lo as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in my ears the babe leapt in my womb for joy and blessed is she that believeth for there shall be this is prophecy friends blessed is she that believeth for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the lord now because now because elizabeth was carrying the word amen and the word was inside of her she had conceived amen and she was now carrying the prophecy the word when she come in contact with mary and mary gave her a salutation that babe left with joy she was filled with the holy ghost and now elizabeth began to speak with a loud voice and what elizabeth was speaking was speaking down blessings upon mary and now saying that what was promised shall be performed praise be to god why because the word was inside of her this is the start of the new testament and now these women are conceiving the promise and now they're speaking in verse 46 and mary said my soul doth magnify the lord and my spirit hath rejoiced in god my savior for he hath regarded the lowest state of his handmaiden for behold from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed for he that is mighty have done to me great things and holy is his name and his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to generation he has showed strength with his arm he has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts he has put down the mighty from their seats and exalted them of low degree he has filled the hungry with good things and the rich he has sent him the rich he has sent empty away he hath hope in his servant israel in remembrance of his mercy as he spake to our fathers to abraham and to his seed forever and now what is mary mary also has the word inside of her elizabeth has the word in her and mary has the word in her amen and now these two women are speaking and what they're speaking is magnifying and glorifying the word for their day they have caught the revelation of the word for their day and what are they speaking they are speaking the manifestation of the word for their day and these two women who have the word on them they know the day they know the hour they know the prophecy and they know what's going on and under the inspiration of the holy ghost they're declaring it now praise god amen there was there was priests and there was rabbis and there was all kinds of religious leaders and scribes all the way around but you've got two humble little women and these two women have the word inside of them and then when they come in contact with one another now they have a voice and what they're speaking is declaring the mystery that is being revealed what they're speaking is declaring what's hidden on the inside of them is the fulfillment of the word for this day and they begin to speak and elizabeth loud voice and mary begins to proclaim all that's taking place in that day praise be to god and this is the beginning of the new testament it's how it starts in the message the spoken word is the original seed so the angel showed abraham who he was that he was the word he said why did sarah laugh so he called her forth and she said i never he said but you did what the grace see right there god would have slew her right there but he couldn't see our stupidity he'd kill every one of us but he can't to kill sarah he had to take abraham because sarah was part of abraham they were one in union this is so important to understand because if the prophecy was for abraham it had to be for sarah too because they were one and to take the church and destroy it he can't do it because it's part of himself christ part of himself the word being made flesh amazing grace how sweet the sound couldn't do it you get it he couldn't kill her he couldn't take her life because she was part of abraham she was flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone in our mistakes don't say well i made a failure no that don't make abraham made failures too see but he couldn't take the church he can't kill the elect he can't take your life because you're part of himself you're the word the word is in you we know revelations 22 17 well i'll just quote him he said in the spirit and the bride say come all the way at the end of the revelation at the end of the bible the spirit and the bride so at the end of the end of the end the bride has a voice and the voice of the bride is speaking in conjunction with the spirit or the spirit through the bride is saying come the spirit and the bride say come what are they saying they're saying come come to what come to the fountain of life amen and what are they saying when you say come there's something you have to leave in order to come you've got to leave and they're crying come out from among them and be ye separate come so in the end time at the end of the revelation of jesus christ the bride has a voice and that voice is saying come come to the fountain of life back in the latest in church age from the church age book it says but thank god at this moment this age is not over he is yet crying and his cry is not only in the spiritual ears of men by his spirit but once again a prophet is in the land once more god will reveal the truth as he did to paul in the days of the seventh messenger in the days of the laodicean age its messenger will reveal the mysteries of god as revealed to paul he will speak out and those who receive the prophet in his own name will receive the beneficent beneficient effect of that prophet's ministry and they that hear him will be blessed and become part of that bride of the last day who are mentioned in revelation 22 17 the spirit and the bride say come the corner of wheat the bride wheat that fell into the ground at nicaea has come back to original word grain again praise god forever yes listen to the authenticated prophet of god who appears in this last age what he says from god the bride will say because she has to prophesy again prophesy again what are you going to prophesy what's already been prophesied what he says from god the bride will say the spirit and the prophet and the bride will be saying the same thing listen you can take quotes and you can stand before a group of people and just line the quotes up and just speak just quotes amen you can line it in a way that the people get the wrong understanding of what the prophet's saying and all you're doing is saying what he said but you're not saying what he said do you understand so to say what he said amen is to say what god was speaking in this age the revelation of this hour the full revelation of the word the spirit and the prophet and the bride will be saying the same thing and what they will say will have already been said in the word praise god they are saying it now come out from among her now and be separate the cry has gone out the cry is going out how long will the voice cry we do not know but one thing we do know it won't be long for this is the last age in the message the token he says it has to be because a woman and her husband become one they become one and so does the bride and christ become one the ministry of the bride and the ministry of christ is the same i'd like to say the ministry of abraham and the ministry of sarah was the same because the prophecy to abraham was he was going to bring forth from abraham a seed amen and he was going to have a seed and abraham that was a prophecy to abraham but sarah was included because sarah was his wife so sarah and abraham have the same ministry the problem arose when when when sarah tried to use her own intellect and her own understanding to fulfill the ministry it failed amen but if she would have just waited for god to confirm his word she was already included in it it was going to happen she just needed to wait and the ministry of the bride and the minister of christ is the same why are they the same because why is the ministry the same because they are the same they are the word amen he's the word she's the word she's come from the word she's being united back to the word amen there's a prophecy to be fulfilled but she's included she doesn't have to get nervous about that she's part of it in the pergameon church age the section we've read many times on pick up your pen and write when the angel told brother brandon to pick up his pen and write and he has it here italicized in the church age book i'm just going to read a small section it said notice the harmony of the father and the son jesus never did anything until it was first showed him by the father john 5 19. this harmony is now to exist between the groom and his bride he shows her his word of life how did he show her his word of life amen he sent a prophet and then he had to give her a revelation of what that prophet was speaking he shows her his word of life she receives it she never doubts it therefore nothing can harm her not even death for if the seed be planted the water will raise it up again here is the secret of this the word is in the bride there's the secret of it the word is in the bride as it was in mary the bride has the mind of christ for she knows what he wants done with the word she performs the commandment of the word in his name for she has thus saith the lord then the word is quickened by the spirit and it comes to pass like a seed that is planted and watered it comes to full harvest serving its purpose those in the bride do only his will no one can make them do otherwise they have thus saith the lord or they keep still they know that it has to be god in them doing the works fulfilling his own word he did not complete all his work while in his earthly ministry so now he works in and through the bride so as the ministry of christ and mr bride the same ministry absolutely it's christ's ministry through the bride now he works in and through the bride she knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must now do but he will now fulfill through the bride that work which he left for this specific time there was a specific time that god was going to bring forth the promised word to abraham and then that specific time he was going to come and he was going to renew them back to youth and he was going to give sarah a man strength to conceive seed to bring forth the promise and it was coming at a specific time and it was something he was going to come and do himself and so when he does it it's perfect and questions and answers on the seals there's a question question number 22 say would the bride of christ would the bride of christ have a ministry before the rapture here's brother branham's answer sure that's what's going on right now the bride of christ certainly it is the message of the hour so what's the ministry the message of the hour see the bride of christ sure she consists of apostles prophets teachers evangelists and pastors is that right that's the bride of christ sure she's got a ministry great ministry it's the ministry of the hour so what is the great ministry of the bride it's the message of the hour in birth pains i got several quotes i want to read so just hang with me and birth pangs brother bram said now the word must produce the bride so this is key if the word is in the bride and now there's a ministry in the bride that consists of apostles prophets teachers evangelists the fivefold ministry it's the message of the hour the word must produce the bride so that ministry in this hour must produce a bride the ministry in this hour is not to produce a church it's not to produce another group another movement another segment another section another sect another denomination another another form of thinking amen the word in this hour the ministry of the hour amen the ministry of christ and the ministry of the bride is the same and the ministry of this hour will bring the word will produce a bride and so if it's producing something other than a bride it's not the right ministry because the word must produce the bride that's all that we're after that's the whole point amen that's why we preach and why we have services and why we pass out books and why we do all that we do is because there's got to be a bride amen a bride in the end time and every elect seed has got to come into this bride and be manifest amen that's what we're here for not to build a church not to build a movement not to get a new not to get a new popularity club going in a new circle of whatever the word must produce a bride that's the ministry at the end time it's good that we stay focused on what we're here for if there's a voice at the end of the revelation of jesus christ that voice was saying come that voice wasn't starting a new church a new movement a new denomination new creeds that voice was calling to the elect come and the word must produce the bride and the rapture says she has to be molded and made into the image of christ and christ is the word that's the only thing see it's in there in the word there cannot be one thing added cannot be a woman with one hand like a man in the other hand like a paw like a dog it's got to be exactly the word of the lord like he is the word the bride is part of the bridegroom the woman is part of her husband because she's taken out of the husband eve was a part of adam from his side and so is the bride not taken from a denomination but taken from the bosom of the word of god for this day you catch that what is the bride taken from she's taken from the bosom of the word of god for this day she's taken from the word of god for this day not an old word not a stagnant word but the fresh revelation of the word and choosing of a bride he says and that is the mark of the beast when she forms that world council of churches and she'll give birth to her son the antichrist the other is pregnanted by the word of god and will bring forth the body the finished body of jesus christ which is the bride the body of christ isn't finished yet how many knows that a man and a woman is one and christ is one body the word the bride will have to be the rest of that body and the two together makes the one body again like adam was at the beginning man his wife are one now she the true bride so sold out to him that she uses no mind of her own his mind of course is his will and his will is his word so now she's been impregnated once pregnant is going to bring forth the antichrist but the other is impregnated by the word and will bring forth the body the finished body of jesus christ which is the bride because the ministry of the word in this day will produce a bride in the message the seed does not air with the shock he says cannot do it now it's seed time or bride time the shucks are dead the shucks are dried up the virgin word time not touched it's a virgin remember a virgin word time if you put it in the hands of a denomination it sure won't be virgin it'll be manhandled time you get it to it but god's church is not touched by the nomination hallelujah it's a virgin-born word of god made manifest jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah how wonderful i love it i believe it i know that it's the truth it'll not be touched there'll be no denominational man handling in the virgin birth of the bride that's why when this bride that's on earth today amen she's got a voice and that voice is saying come come out from among her come out and be separate come into the fountain of life that's flowing clean from the from the throne of god come and drink come and taste come be united with this word it's got to be pure word amen the brightest calling to a pure word a fountain amen a crystal clear water that's not polluted with man she can't mix her own ideas in it she can't add anything to it amen she can't take anything from it but she's here just to say what he said but he's got a voice in the earth and that voice is his bride and if she's preaching the word the word will produce the virgin-born bride no denomination no man handling in the virgin birth of the bride no sure she's commanded by god to come out of such that's why sarah after she went through all the experiences she went through she went through her denominational ideas she went through her own reasoning and intellect she went through trying by her own effort to produce the promise and then it failed and then then god come and he showed the sign of the messiah and she saw something real and the discernment was done to her and all of a sudden she was turned back to what she was when she was first married to abraham and then somewhere along the line amen the lord visited her and when he visited her she conceived on the promised word and now the word was in her and now she carried this word and she brought forth this word and as this word was coming into maturity she saw the very thing that was her reasoning her very mistake her very error was mocking this word and that's why she said cast out the bondwoman nothing's going to mix with this seed one time we thought it was a good idea it's not a good idea we may have carried a lot of denominational ideas into the message with us but i want to say right now cast out the bondwoman and her son for not be heir with this word we've been given a pure word to come from god and god has brought a visitation to the church that will bring a conception and bring forth the word amen and that word will bring a virgin birth to the bride of jesus christ but it can't be denominational manhandled we can't carry any more ideas everything got to be burnt brother branham was telling us that from one age to the next when the when the lamb was left over and the manna was left over and then they weren't to carry it they weren't to carry it from one age to the next whatever they couldn't eat then had to be burnt totally done away with and then when we when we come in from whatever understanding we had before and whatever idea we had before whatever was in our mind and whatever we thought was right and whatever we've been taught if it's contrary to the word it's got to be burnt it's got to be annihilated because this bride will not be manhandled by the nomination and trying to do god a service without being the will of god says and if the bride is to be the word then she's got to be of christ part of the bridegroom she's got to be the word the word not for his day the word for this day that he promised would be this day that he sent his word forth to mold his bride and make her hope you see it don't get some idea of your own and don't take somebody else's idea take the vindicated word here the bible and the identified masterpiece of god he says he is cutting you out now cutting you down to his word only cutting all the creeds and dogmas and everything away from you trying to get back to a bride for the sun another masterpiece part of the word the word what's god trying to do to us amen week after week as he opens the word he's trying to cut everything down to just the word to all that's left in our thinking and all that our desire there's nothing mixed in anymore he's trying to cut us down to just the word in the message christ is the mystery of god revealed he says how how did he what happened in the pre-figure now he opened adam's side and took part of his flesh which was adam to make eve the bride has to be the word for he is the word she cannot stand on creeds she cannot stand on denominationalism she cannot stand on good behavior she has to stand alone on the word because she is part of it she was taken from christ and the message that is the rising of the sun he says as he being the groom the bride has to come forth because it's part of him and it can only be the manifestation and the fulfilling of all the revelations any others has spoke of the bride it can only manifest if it does something different from the groom and isn't the bride because she is flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life power of his power she is him that's why there can't be anything else mixed in and the message the invisible union of the bride of christ says but to the elected god is calling to the elected they know it calling the virtuous bride the word the last day church the elected lady of our lord jesus christ jesus is the word how many believe that all right then the bride is always part of the bridegroom so the bride will not be a denomination it'll have to be the word manifested to be the bride of christ that means in order to attract the bride of christ or bring somebody to a birth there cannot be anything mixed into the word it's got to be the word amen because the word will bring forth the bride god he worked and he worked and he worked until he got sarah to the place where she now realized she now understood she now got it it now she understand why and when she understood why she can make that that decree that said cast out the bondwoman and i hope we've come to the place where we recognize why it won't work amen why nothing but this word will work none of my own ideas are manipulating or twisting it or making excuses for it nothing will work this word is the only thing that's going to work it's the only thing that'll bring life it's the only thing that's the pure water that's flowing down from the throne of god it's the only thing to call people to it's the only thing to separate from and to come to amen don't come from one dirty pool to another dirty pool don't try to attract the bride of christ amen from one dirty mud hole to another a mud hole that's a little bit cleaner than that mud hole and this one's just a little bit cleaner and this one's just a little bit cleaner but god has brought us a word amen he's brought us a pure word he's he's bypassed all the denominations he's come down with a prophet with a mighty sign to show us that there's a restoration of a pure clean word and the bride is going to stand on that word and that word alone and that's the only thing she's to propagate is that word she's not to propagate herself her church her ministry her people her ideas but just that word and if we can just speak that word and live that word and manifest that word the word will produce a bride that's what we're here for let's go to genesis chapter 3. genesis chapter 3 and verse 14 and the lord god said unto the serpent because thou has done this thou art cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the field upon thy belly shalt thou go and dust out to eat all the days of thy life and i will put enmity between thee and the woman in between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shall bruise his heel god had laid down a prophecy and in that prophecy there was going to come a seed from a woman the seed of the woman and that seed of the woman was going to bruise the serpent's head and no matter how many people wanted to produce that until it was god's time then nobody could produce that no matter how much they wanted the serpent's head to be bruised they couldn't produce it they couldn't manufacture it you can't you can't through intellect and reasoning and effort you can't you can't produce this promise but in due time god would send an angel to a little virgin by the name of mary and he would begin to tell mary now is the time now's the season you're the one and she would say be it unto me and when god did it it was perfect and it was in perfect time and all that he needed was somebody who would accept it the way he gave it and when she would accept it the way he gave it all of a sudden what she had faith to believe amen as elizabeth said blessed are you for it shall be performed in you because you believed and god raised up the seed from the woman and that seed from the woman bruised the serpent's head and that seed was christ let's go to romans 16. romans chapter 16 and verse 20. and the god of peace shall bruce satan under your feet shortly the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you amen now the god of peace shall brew satan under your feet shortly the devil's going to be bruised under feet and the apostle paul says it's going to be under your feet who's the apostle paul talking to he's talking to the church he's talking to the bride but who's going to do the bruising it's going to be god god's going to do the bruising and he's going to use your feet he's going to use the bride in this end time amen because in the beginning the devil he he took the bride that was given to the serpent or given to adam and the serpent through subduction amen perverted that tool that god was going to use and brought corruption and always down through time it's been that way but god is going to take the very same thing that the devil used for corruption and god is going to bring it right back and going to bruise him crush him destroy him by the very tool that he's tried to use to stop the word of god and god himself is going to do it amen it's not going to be you and i we don't have the power we don't have the strength all we've got is the yielding amen all we've got is the ability to say here i am be it unto me god i'm available but it's he god the god of peace shall brew satan under your feet shortly amen it's up to us to stick with the word to say what the word says and let god do what god's going to do because this is the age and this is the bride that he's going to use to do it he said in things that are to be now if we are those attributes of god we cannot live by creeds we cannot live by denominationalism we must live by the word because the bride is part of the bridegroom like any wife is part of her husband therefore we must be that word bride and what is the word bride the manifestation of this hour the bride not a creed or denomination but a living oracle of god a living attribute of god displaying to the world the attributes of god in the formation of the bride that's to be expressed in this hour that we're now living friends it is bride time what is the manifestation it's the manifestation of the virgin bride it's the manifestation of the word that's been restored back to bring a bride back to what she ought to have been in the beginning to unite with christ and now to bring forth the very life of the word it's bride time that's the manifestation for this hour he has called us amen he has sent a prophet messenger to us he sent the angel to us and called us he's not looking for your power he's not looking for your strength he's looking for you just to believe him and yield yourself to him and stay with this word and watch the word do all that it was intended to do and not fall back into the old trap of manipulating twisting figuring out or sorting it all out ourselves just believe it the way he gave it stand upon it and stay with this word amen and let god do what he's going to do there's no confusion about what time it is once mary received that visitation there was no confusion about what time it was in the message the easter seal he said his messianic anointed ones believe that what is the messiah what is the messiah messiah's anointed one and now if he was the messiah by being the anointed one for that day to fulfill the word of god to be the redeemer and the anointed one of god raised up that body his bride is the anointed one for this day his anointing his word in bride form the manifestation of this hour and i'd say god here i am here i am god i can't do it i can't make it happen but i believe your word i believe that you sent that prophet to me he was calling me and i believe this is the hour and this is the time and i believe that you will you will deal that final blow to satan and you will bruise him under the bride's feet in this day you're going to do it i can't do it but i can say be it unto me according to your word that i believe what that angel said i believe what he told me i believe amen that you gave me strength to conceive and now you're bringing forth your word from me help us to keep it pure brother branham said in revelation and the message revelation chapter 4 said all right here was voices oh how we need in jeffersonville thousands of lived voices the bride has a voice the bride has a ministry we've been through all of that but brother man i'm going to start talking about voices the thousands of lived voices the thunder of god thundering out in sweetness and holiness purity undefiled lies walking around catch this he's using such strong language thousands of lit voices the thunder of god thundering out in the sweetness and holiness purity undefiled lives walking around the earth today without a blemish yes sir real christians that's thunder against the enemy the devil don't care how loud you can holler the devil don't care how much you can jump or how much you can do this or shout but what hurts the devil is to see that sanctified holy life consecrated to god say anything to him call him anything just as sweet as it can be and move right on oh my that throws him away that's the thunder that shakes the devil we think that we're going to do such mighty things and and stomp on the devil's head and you're going to bruise him under your feet and when the bride she's gonna she's gonna do this and she's gonna stomp on his head and she's gonna defeat him how did he say that she was gonna defeat him by a sweet humble submissive pure life not yelling and screaming and acting bold and tough and like she can do this and she could mary couldn't do anything but yet he was going to use her to bring forth the seed that would bruise his head to fulfill the word that was going to bring a redemption that was going to absolutely take away all the power that he had and how he's going to do it through a simple sweet little humble virgin girl that could just take the angel at his word without even being able to fully comprehend the science behind it she was going to have something in her that could say that's the truth be it unto me and submit herself to the word and god was going to use this vessel to bring a destruction to the devil's kingdom she's gonna use sarah and her old age amen when her milk veins were dried out when it was in she was incapable and impossible for her to bring forth the promised word she was an absolute weakness amen she was beyond any time any possibility of ever producing the word amen but that's what he was going to use he was going to take a broken down vessel that was old and unable and he was going to come to her and he was going to visit her and he's going to visit her when he visits them through the sign of the messiah he's going to turn them back but then he's going to come to her privately and he's going to give her strength to conceive because she didn't have it in herself she wasn't capable in herself in all of her humanity and all of her efforts she was a failure but when god come on the scene he made her more than able what did he bring he brought the promised word and now it's time that god's going to take in his hand amen a woman that's going to fulfill the word amen that's going to be subject to the word and he's going to use this woman amen to drive a nail down a death blow to the devil himself but it's not going to be because she's able and she's mighty and sheik and this and i can talk the devils like they're garbage and i can speak to satan like he's a but how is he going to do it what's it going to look like what's going to be that thunder that shakes the devil and throws him off what's going to be that power that thunder that the devil fears what's it going to be somebody who can yell threats and verbal abuses towards the devil act like they're big and tough and can i can handle the devil he don't know who he's talking to do you understand what i'm saying that's not what god's looking for that's not what god wants he's not going to share his glory with any man he's not looking for a woman who's going to be like sarah says i got this figured out i know obviously god wants to do it this way but he's looking for somebody who already realizes i'm washed up and incapable and i made a mess out of everything he's looking for somebody who will come finally to us surrender to the word and quit manipulating quit playing with it quit figuring it out quit being smart quit being strong quit being able and then get to the place where you got no ability no capability there's no way for you to be this strong one there's no way for you to be this tool that he's going to use amen to bruise the devil's head because he wasn't going to let you do it anyways he was going to do it through you what's the devil what's the thunder that thunders against the devil what's the thunder that shakes the devil what is it that the devil fears sweetness and holiness purity undefiled lives walking around in the earth today without a blemish what's he afraid of he's afraid of the life of christ he's afraid amen of that word coming to life inside of you and changing all your wants and all your desires and bringing you in a total submission to the word until you and the word become the same thing and whatever he was he now is through you in obedience and in sweetness and in gentleness and in quietness amen in purity without a blemish how could you be without a blemish because you've been turned back virgin by a virgin word you've been washed with pure water amen that flows from the fountain of god and washed away all of the effects of the prostitutes washed away all the spots and brought you back to a virgin condition by a virgin word and those are the people that shake the devil it's not what we say and it's not how we act in our ourselves but it's that life that the word produces the word produces a bride and the bride is submissive to her headship which is her husband which is the revealed word of the hour and that simple submission to the word and humility and surrender to the word and allowing the word to come and take absolute authority in our lives and living through us is the very thing that the devil's afraid of and the very thing that will defeat the devil many times in our lives we want to fight the devil and defeat the devil and overcome the devil amen but the thing is we're still playing games with the word and the very thing that'll shake him off and the very thing that'll throw him away is our surrender to the word the life of christ god has brought us to the hour where we realized this bondwoman and her son can't stay i it cannot stay and one time i thought it was a good idea i know now it's not a good idea something has happened to me amen i've had a visitation of the lord i've i've conceived on the word and i realize now that this bond woman and her son it ain't going to work anymore it's got to go lord it's got to go i want just your word and your word alone i want to be able to be humble and submissive to your word i want to be reverent to your word i want i want to be a submissive to my headship which is the revealed word and i want to open myself and let that word have the victory through me this is the hour this is the time for the greatest victory and he's going to use a woman for it is that right but he's going to use a woman for it like he used mary and how powerful and bold and strong was mary her power was in her faith and her ability to yield i said god make us just like mary totally surrendered to you let's all stand if we want to see if we want to see the rest of the bride the word produces a bride if we want to have the great victory we want to see god win and the devil lose that it's going to take a full surrender and a submission to the word of god i thank god for the day that we live in i thank god that he's brought us a pure clean unadulterated word i said god let me stay true to that word help me god i surrender to you but help me god keep us clean keep us pure let's bow our heads dear lord jesus we thank you father for the privilege lord of standing here so many things have been spoken about this end time bribe you through your prophet as as you have revealed us you have showed us through the word what our position is you have opened up that word and you called us by name you've placed us as a bride you've told us what our position is and what you're going to do through this bride in the end time but god that's what you revealed to mary and mary had no ability to bring it to pass but she had something inside of her that could believe it she had a desire within her to yield and receive that word god you've placed the same thing inside of us no ability to perform it no ability to bring it to pass but yet we believe with all of our hearts that we are part of that bride that we are the ones that you're going to use to bring that final victory that's going to reverse the curse so reverse that our atoms will change i believe lord it's me i believe i'm the one but god i just want to yield in a greater way to the headship of the world i want to surrender everything to you lord that you might take this vessel and use it for your glory help me god never to become self-sufficient never to be wise in my own wisdom and my own thinking to to conjure up my own solution or come up with my own fulfillment of the word god i pray that you would keep us from that help us to believe what you've given to us to surrender to it lord to speak it to share it to live it lord through us i pray that you'd shake the devil that you would thunder out through our lives lord the thunder that shakes the devil for we want to yield to you we want to surrender to you we want you to have the victory god how we love you how we thank you lord and we want to surrender to you and ask that you would speak through our lips that you would live through us lord you'd walk in our flesh lord that these hands would be your hands these feet would be your feet this mouth would be your mouth and that you would use it for your glory and may you have the victory and may you get all the praise god how we love you and thank you in this hour i ask that you would use us lord for your glory in jesus christ's name we pray amen bless you brother [Music] let
