come to feed from your hand we're here at your table Lord as you've commanded us we've come in obedience now we expect Lord we we have expectation that you will feed us that portion for today we love you we pray you take preeminence among us and have your way speak your Eternal words to these lips of clay and may you have first place in our hearts and our lives and in this service today we love you and we thank you in Jesus Christ's name amen and God bless you while we're standing let's turn to Second Corinthians chapter 5 verse 17. second Corinthians chapter 5. and verse 17. all right I'll begin reading second Corinthians 5 and 17. therefore If any man be in Christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new man God bless you as you're seated and we want to thank God for his word as was mentioned earlier remember brother Manuel sister Mimi they're leaving this morning to head to Congo and so they'll be there 12 days also Brother Joseph Scott and I will be leaving this afternoon for India we fly out of Detroit this evening and we'll be gone for 12 days we'll be back on the 28th so we appreciate you praying for us I spoke with brother rashan brother Rashon sent me the Ministry schedule I was gone and I thought the brother loved me but after I saw how many servers he scheduled I I don't know anymore if he loves me or not but he scheduled eight services for us to preach while we're gone so I'll be in special prayer and especially for one of them he's having special meetings in his hometown um the Tuesday before I come home I don't remember the date not this Tuesday but next Tuesday and he's having two services and is down and he's invited everyone he's got posters all over he sent me pictures of posters all over the town and a big billboard announcing the meetings and they're inviting all the denominational Christians in the area and they want to have Outreach meetings so if you could be in particular prayer that God would just give me a special anointing and inspiration for that service that we can present the word and present light in a way that it'll catch the seed of God Amen so while I'm gone the Ministry schedule Brother Kyle Weichert will be taking this coming Wednesday the 19th brother Nathaniel science will be coming down and preaching for us on Sunday the 23rd and then I asked brother Noel Johnson if he would come up and preach for us on the 26th because brother Noel is so active in India I thought it'd be nice if he came here and ministered while I went to India it's like teamwork you know so and I asked brother no I said do you have any tips or any advice for me and he was sharing some things and he says you know you're going to Punjab it's a nice area it's the seat of the Sikh religion and most of the majority are Sikhs and he said they're very nice very friendly they'll treat you really good but if you speak against the religion you may not come home that is a good tip he said they they they protect the quality and religion they believe all Faith are valuable they're really nice friendly people but they're mandated to kill you if you speak against the religion and they and the The Devout seeks all carry a dagger with them to back up the I guess the threat I don't know so I'm going to start every sermon with I love Sikh people and and I love the seek religions and anything I say after this just referred to my opening statement so just pray for us that was a good tip from Brother Noel so we'll be we'll be cautious also I want to thank everybody who came out yesterday for the work day and for the trustee brothers who organized that they got a lot of work done in just half of a day so we appreciate all your brothers thankful for the trustees wives Who provided a lunch for everybody that was working and they got several things then they were able to line wash the brick and touch it up over here on the fellowship hall they fixed some parking lot lights they cut out and formed a new sidewalk to the Pavilion that is going to be very useful and very helpful they'll be pouring the concrete in that in a few weeks and they started this Nursery project to expand the nursing mother's Nursery into part of the library so they walled off part of the library because we have of we are blessed with babies and we need more space for the babies so they started that project that should be done in a couple weeks they had various other con projects like cleaning gutters picking up around power washing so they did a great job and I'm always amazed at how much skill and labor is within the assembly and and how much gets done in a short amount of time when everybody comes together so God bless you and thank you your labor was a blessing to us all amen well this morning I want to I want to look at this scripture and I want to take for a thought the continuation of the creation of God so for a title the continuation of the creation of God we just read in second Corinthians 5 17 that if any man be in Christ he is a new creature old things are passed away and and you may feel like in some ways you still deal with the old nature of some old Hamlet some old family trades but in the eyes of God you're a new creature and the old things have passed away and for God you've changed you've changed from the old into the new and you're literally a new creature a new creation old things are passed away and behold all things are become new brother Venom he says in the laodicean church age I've got several scriptures I want to go to so keep your Bibles handy and I got several quotes I want to read so stay with me we'll try to make it quick as possible but but there's so much that the prophet of God said on this subject to begin to stir my heart and out of the church age book he says this but now he is standing in the midst of the church as he stands there revealing who he is in the last age he calls himself the author of the creation of God the beginning of the creation of God he says there in Revelation chapter 3. and brother bam tells us that he's the author because God is the author of the creation and then he begins to speak about the church he says this is another creation this has to do with the church this is a special designation of himself he is the creator of that church the Heavenly bridegroom created his own Bride As the spirit of God he came down and created in the Virgin Mary the cells from which his body was born so we know that the creator of the Bride is not the bride but he created the Heavenly bridegroom has created his own bride amen and so he is the he is the author of the creation of God he's the beginning of the creation of God and he's the creator of the creation of God and that bride is his creation he goes on he says Mary was a human incubator and she carried that holy child and brought him to birth it was a God man he was the son of God he was of the new creation man and God met and joined he was the first of this new race he is the head of this new race so this new creation is not the old creation that had been perverted but this new creation which Jesus Christ becomes the first of he was born without human intervention so he was born free from the perversion of hybridization amen but but what made it the new creation was not that he just come forth virgin born but that God himself United with this creation making this his body his created body and this makes it a new race amen and he becomes the head of this new race really important to understand because he's the head of the new race that means there must be more of this new race and so the in order to be part of this new race you have to be able to escape Corruption of hybridization amen and you have to be a new creature so how do we become a new creation separated from the old where the old passes away we're part of the new and can become part of this new race our new creation it's done by the New Birth by being united with Jesus Christ amen in Colossians 1 18 He says and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence so there you can see that though man was of the old order or creation Now in Union with Christ he has become the new creation of God any any quotes Ephesians 4 24 here and that you may put on the new man which after God has created in righteousness and true Holiness let's turn to this together Ephesians 4. if you can turn with me Ephesians 4 and 24. let's start with verse 22. Ephesians 4 and 22 that you put off concerning the former conversation the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful lust and be renewed in the spirit of your mind and that ye put on the new man which after God is created in righteousness and true Holiness this new man is made after God It's Made In God's fashion It's Made In God's likeness amen which is created in righteousness and true Holiness so that's that's the goal he goes on back back in the church age quote he says this new creation is not the old creation made over or it would not be called a new creation this is exactly what it says it is New Creation it is another creation distinct from the old one no longer is he dealing by ways of the flesh that was how he dealt with Israel he chose Abraham and of Abraham's issue Through The Godly Isaac line but now out of every Kindred tribe and Nation he has purposed a new creation he is the first of that creation he was God created in the form of man now by his Spirit he is creating many sons unto himself he was the head of the race now he's creating the rest of the race by uniting with Man by uniting with man through the new birth amen he says Now by his Spirit he's creating many sons unto himself God the Creator creating himself a part of his creation this is the true revelation of God this was his purpose this purpose took form through election what an outstanding quote he says he tells us that he was God created in the form of man that's what he did with Jesus Christ when he United with Jesus Christ he made his own body to dwell and then he came and he dwelled that body and United with him making him the head of the new creation and God he was God created in the form of man now by his Spirit he created many sons unto himself through the new birth through Union with Christ God the Creator creating himself a part of his creation amen now we've got to get Beyond just us and just what we are this is something that God is doing God is creating himself part of his creation this is the true revelation of God this was his purpose let's turn to First Timothy 3 16. this statement will develop as we go and it'll become clearer and clearer as we move on in first Timothy 3 16 it says and without controversy great is the mystery of God in this God was manifest In the Flesh justifying the spirit scene of angels preached unto the Gentiles believed on in the world received up into Glory now initially when we read this we think all of this was accomplished in Jesus Christ amen in his coming here 2 000 years ago but you see it says he was God was God was manifest In the Flesh this is all about God God was manifesting the flesh scene of angels preached unto the Gentiles when God was here in the flesh of Jesus Christ he wasn't preached unto the Gentiles he told his disciples don't go into the Gentiles but only go into the lost sheep of Israel amen and then after his resurrection he told his disciples that I will be with you always even to the end of the world and he was telling them that I was in the comforter I will come unto you I will Unite with you and be in you and then he tells them go into all nations and preach the gospel to All Peoples amen so this mystery of God this when God was manifesting the flesh justified in the spirit seeing of angels preached unto the Gentiles that preaching was through his bride believed on in the world that's continuing on and received up into the glory this is the mystery of godliness this is the work of God and God is continually unfolding himself through his new creation he's continually working Amen in this scripture encompasses amen him coming in flesh and Jesus Christ but it also encompasses him uniting with you and I as the new creation Amen in continuing the work amen and the restoration of the Bride tree says otherwise you're going to form what's known to me as a bride I'll go with you and you will be part of me you'll be my bride my life will be in your body just like a husband and wife is one person you and I are going to be one at that day you'll know that I am in the Father the father and me I in you and you and me oh I just love that Satan just gets so angry at that see the Oneness of God all that God was he poured into Christ all that Christ was he's poured into the church there you are makes them all one so we realized the true revelation of God Amen and encompasses all the attributes of God it encompasses the entire family of God so the true revelation of God must Encompass if you and I are expressed attributes of God Amen if we are parts of him sieging of him that has become to be expressed in this day then the true revelation of God must contain the attributes of God which must contain you and I so here we are as part of the unfolding of God of the mystery of God and part of the true revelation of God if we've been made a new creature in Christ Jesus and the message proving his word oh no I'm sorry I want to read Ephesians 1 first before we go to that quote Ephesians 1 and 22. Ephesians 1 and 22 and hath put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church which is his body what is his body the church he's the head the church is his body he made all things it made to be head over all things to the church which is his body the fullness of him that filleth all in all so what has the body become in this day the body amen has become the fullness of him that filleth all and all amen who is that this is the mystery of godliness it is going on now there is a revelation of God there is a revelation of the godhead amen there is a mystery that's still unfolding because Christ is now the head of the new race his body is that new race the head is united with the body now he's poured everything into the body the body has become the fullness of him that filleth all in all the body is to be the expression of Jesus Christ on Earth amen it's amazing that God created his own body and he created his own body in in Christ Jesus and he dwelt in that body amen and that was the beginning of the creation of God and when God was dwelling in that body he was manifesting the sun was manifesting or declaring the father to everyone it was he says he says it's not me that does the works it's the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works he was he was declaring amen the father and all that God was he poured into Christ but all that was Christ was he poured into the church because Christ is God's body amen but the church is Christ's body so the the God the Father poured unto Christ everything he was he poured into Christ that's his body but Christ just like Adam had to have a further expression of his body because male and female made up Adam and Adam was expressed in a male body and a female body and he created the male and female and called their name Adam they were the body of Adam amen because it was Adam's spirit that was broken split and portion of that was put in female so that was the body that contained Adam the male was the body that contained Adam it was all one time in a singular vessel of flesh called Adam amen but within Adam was male and female and God was going to give a further expression of his great desire and he was going to take from Adam the elements to create another vessel and in that other vessel he would take part of Adam's spirit and put in that other vessel so that other vessel would also be the body of Adam and that's the same thing he's done with the bride in this day amen all of it was in the last Adam amen but he took out of him the elements to create his body his bride and she's now a tabernacle of the spirit that was in Christ making it the body of Christ and all that God was he poured into Christ and all that Christ is he's poured into his body the church the bride so that she might be the fullness of him that filleth all in awe praise be to God now we realize when we begin to speak like this the whole point of remember reminding ourselves of these truths the things that the prophet God the whole point of coming continually to be reminded of this is so that we won't go back to old dead things that we won't return back to Old life that we won't allow the old Cardinal nature that's still hanging around to drag us back amen because we know that there's a much higher calling for our existence than to live the old life or to live the American dream or to live the life of everybody around us lives but we have been called to a new purpose a new race a new creation amen and we are here to declare Christ we are here to manifest God and we have to constantly be reminded of that because we're still Amen in this old Fallen state with a sticky cucumber nature amen and it wants to pick up on these old things and we got to constantly come to with within earshot of one another and remind one another provoking one another to love and good works and say don't pick up those dead things that'll burn there's a different purpose for our life we've been called for a different reason we're manifesting something other than the American dream we're manifesting something other than our own pride and arrogant Ambitions amen we need to lose ambition and be ambitious about the word we need to lose self-desire more and more and ambition and a desire to be somebody and Achieve something those things need to fall to the Wayside because the greatest achievement that will ever have is when we surrender and allow the spirit of God to take absolute dominion and control in us and to manifest Christ in the flesh of his body the bride and it'll happen through normal life it'll happen through work and through family and through working and cleaning your yard and all the trivial things of life will still be a manifestation of Christ if we let the spirit of God dwell within us without inhibition and we have to constantly be reminded of these things we get so bogged down with life and the purpose is not to get bogged down with life and to get absorbed with life and then try to achieve something in this life the whole point of living this life is to manifest and declare him and we'll declare it through trials and we'll declare it through families we'll declare it through situations amen we'll live amen we're still to engage in the world and live in this world Amen we're still to be part amen of what's going on here because this is where he wants his life on display so the job we don't all become monks so that we can serve the purpose of God we don't I mean we're not going to go into communal living so we could serve the purpose of God we are serving the purpose of God when we work our jobs and raise our families and take care of the things that he's given us responsibility over amen but we have to remember these things aren't my life he's my life and it takes a constant dialing back into the word and being sensitive to the spirit in proving his word the prophet says now we find that God come into this little cell see and he began to develop cells Drew from his mother's vitamins and things as she then when he become old enough to eat himself he began to eat and what what is that it's the dust of the Earth would you come up and plant life and animal life and so forth and as you begin to eat the fish and the bread and so forth it began to develop selves I love the way he talks about Jesus Christ and his body amen his body was formed like your body is formed from the material out of the Earth he ate like you eat and his body was formed praise God and then when it's fully matured at 30 years old he was baptized in obedience to John or to God in the water and went out and what happened the dove which was gone descending from heaven with a voice saying this is my beloved Son in whom I am pleased to dwell what did he come to do to redeem that part of the earth he was the beginning of the creation of God because God is not a creation only in Christ he is a creation because God is eternal and the spirit and the spirit is not created he was the beginning of the creation of God and God redeemed that body see when he come down this is my beloved Son I'm well pleased in him he came down and he claimed that part of the earth he said this is mine this is who I am this is the part that I've created for myself to be my expression and flesh to be me in flesh and he claimed this part and through this part of the earth he was going to redeem the rest of the Earth all the other parts that are his that includes you and I so he God came down after going through this and now every son that you eat and born of a natural sex birth the way you come then when it comes to a place to where you go through water baptism then Holy Ghost baptism then the Holy Ghost comes down at the fire baptism and claims this creation the same as it did him the Holy Ghost and God is the same Spirit see it comes down and claims this body for the resurrection and he was raised for our justification all the father has given me will come not one will be lost I'll raise it up in the last day not one hair of your head will ever even perish that is the beginning of the creation of God this is the continuation of the creation of God what's the continuation when Christ is formed in you when when God Amen when the spirit of God which he says the spirit of God is God when the spirit of God which is the Holy Ghost which is the holy spirit which is the spirit of Christ when it unites with you amen you become a new creature a new creation in Christ Jesus old things have passed away amen everything else all things have become new you have become part of that race that he's the head of and he has come to you to birth you and a new birth separated from your original old birth your natural birth now there's a spiritual birth and you're part of this new race and you're a new creature in Christ Jesus and this is the continuation of the creation of God and the message who do you say this is but they think it's the most wonderful thing in the world that all of us can join hands and be one he's speaking of The ecumenical move Jesus prayed that we might be one that is true but not that kind of one he said be one as I am the father are one yea be that kind of one then how will that be the word in us would be the anointed word that is the Oneness of God the Oneness of God is the word anointed in you and then you become a son a messiah of the age if you have a predestinated see Gene of God Amen you've gone if you're a thought expressed you've got a portion of that thought in you a portion of that word amen and when when that Holy Ghost anoints you in the New Birth you become part of the anointed word amen and and the Oneness of God the word in us would be the anointed word that is Oneness of God the Oneness of God is the word anointed in you praise be to God we know Colossians 1 really well I'm just going to uh recite it here for you Colossians 1 26 even the mystery which has been hit from ages and from Generations but now has made manifest to his Saints to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory this is the great mystery among the Gentiles that will be Christ in you Christ the anointed word in you and we know brother Branham read this quote or read this scripture at the opening of Christ is the mystery of God revealed Christ is the mystery of God revealed so the revealing of the mystery of God is found in Christ and Christ is expressed in his body which is female which is bride amen so the mystery of God is continuing to be expressed through Christ and Christ is the head United to the body the marriage has come there's a union and they too are one and he is now expressing his life through as many membered bride and it's a continuation of the revelation of God in the message Christ is the mystery God revealed he says this is God's great mystery of Love expressed that God and man became one the whole thing is God in man one God and man was one there and God and man is one here what is it being filled with his Spirit him having the preeminances that was God's achievement that's God's purpose to do that that he might be in Christ and Christ in us and all of us together one this is God's achievement this is God's purpose and now we we have to continually like I said make God's purpose our purpose because God's purpose is the correct purpose if you want to know what your purpose is in this life this is your purpose amen that that Christ would live in you that Christ would Express through you that Christ would manifest through you that by the new birth you'd be part of that new creation that new race amen a super race a super church not where you have something to do but where he has something to do in you amen his life in you your life gone surrendered laid down and now his life taking preeminence and taking control that's God's achievement that's God's Great purpose amen that's the continuation of the creation of God that should be our main purpose not religious rhetoric not a pep rally not words that make people feel good I can stand up here and start screaming about your Egos and and this and that and get everybody so excited but if you're excited about being an eagle and excited about being a bride but you go out Monday and live the old life the old nature there's no there's no new race amen there's no new creation amen what was the purpose of the pep rally the purpose of coming to church is not just to get excited and feel good and go home having got a dose of medication it'll make you feel good for another few days but the purpose brother bear says we come here to see our bad parts we come here to see where we need to grow where we need to change we come here so that we can realign with the purpose of God and stop getting distracted by other things so that Monday morning we wake up and we know when your feet hit the floor what am I alive for what am I here for why am I in this time why has this word been revealed to me what am I doing on this Earth and what is God's Great purpose amen we can have a good time but I don't want a good time with no fruit I want fruit in my life I want this to be a living reality I want it to be genuinely amen the continuation of the creation of God in first John 4 17 he says herein is our love made perfect first John 4 17 here and as our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world because as he is so are we this is what gives us great boldness in the day of judgment because as he is whatever he is so are we in this world in few in the future home he says see you were made for an eternal purpose because you was the manifestation of an attribute that was in God that thought of you and expressed you and he made an earth to take you out of and to make you a human being and sin come along and perverted his way you come anyhow you know the the the fall and the Garden of Eden never changed God's plan you came anyway he always determined for you to come in flesh he made an earth to take you out of Amen that attribute was a part of himself was to be expressed in flesh made out of this Earth Amen in the fall corrupted the flesh but it didn't stop God's plan you came anyhow right you come anyhow but you was lost with the world so he came and redeemed you the expressed attribute and also redeems this Earth by the same way then his purpose rolls on what is the point of redemption why did he come down to redeem the Earth and to redeem his that were in the earth why did he come down to shed righteous blood to pay the price of atonement to pray the price of redemption to redeem back all that was lost so that his purpose can roll on because his purpose hasn't changed his purpose was to have his attributes which is a portion of himself expressed in flesh your flesh in the Samaritan Church age from the church age book The Prophet says in very plain language the true bride of Christ was in the mind of God eternally though not expressed until each came forth and into designated decreed season as each member came forth it became expressed and took its place in the body thus the bride is the literal spoken word c brine and though she is feminine in designation she is also called the body of Christ it is very apparent that she ought to be called that for she was predestinated in him came from the same Source was eternal with him and is now manifesting God in a many-membered body whereas once God was manifest in one member even our Lord Jesus Christ so in in the Lord Jesus Christ God was manifest in one body now God is being manifest in a many-membered body now then here we are coming to a conclusion as the Eternal logos God was manifest in the son and in Jesus dwelled all the fullness of the God had bodily and that Eternal one was the father manifest in flesh and thereby gained the title of son even so we Eternal in his thoughts and our turn became the many member spoken word seed manifest in flesh I just want to draw your attention to something he said the Eternal logos God was manifest in the Sun and then Jesus throughout the fullness of the godhead bodily and that Eternal one was the father manifest In the Flesh and thereby gained the title of son he was still God but he was operating in the title of son then he came as the comforter he came as the holy spirit amen it was still God but with the title Holy Spirit amen he gave his word and his word is God with the title of word we understand these are the manifestations or the expressions or the Declarations of all that God had in his mind how God wanted to express himself Through Time amen and he expressed himself as the Holy Spirit it was God with the title Holy Spirit it was word and man that was God with the title of word amen he gained the title of son it was God Amen manifest in the form of a son and he had the title of son and what will it be when he manifest In You and I amen so thereby gaining the title son even so we Eternal in his thoughts in our turn became the many membered spoken word seed manifest in the flesh and those Eternal thoughts now manifest in flesh are the sons of God even as we are so called we did not become seed by the rebirth praise be to God almighty we did not become seed by rebirth we were seed when we were thoughts in his mind we were part of him we could never be separated from him what he is his thoughts are amen his attributes are actually parts of himself amen and we did not become seed by the rebirth we were seed and therefore were reborn for only the elect can be reborn because we were seed is the reason we could be quick and and non-seed there is nothing to Quicken and listen we're going to get down to the reality of this we did nothing we've done nothing we had nothing to do with any of this this was decreed and determined in himself before the foundation of the world he is living out his own drama for his own purpose to declare himself in the best way he saw fit and he he he has decided to portion himself out over time amen and to express himself out through the generations and You by the grace of God happen to be part of that expression amen of no merit of your own of no design of your own it was all in him amazing [Music] in non-seed there's nothing to Quicken hold this carefully in mind now take the next step redeem means to buy back it restores to the original owner God by his death the shed Blood Bought back his own he bought back the spoken word seed bride my sheep hear my voice word and they follow me you always worship you never were a pig or a dog turned into a sheep that is impossible for every kind of Life produces the same kind and there is no change in species as we were in the thoughts of God and then expressed in flesh there had to come a day when we could hear his voice the word and hearing that voice became aware of our father calling us and recognize that we are the sons of God we heard his voice and we cried out as did The Prodigal Son Save Me O my father I am returning to thee a Son of God can go a long time before he recognizes that he's a son but it doesn't mean he wasn't a son a sheep can think he's a pig he can think he's a goat he can think he's this for a long time an eagle can think he's a chicken for a long time amen but eventually he'll hear something that represents his true nature the reality of who he is and it'll call him out of confusion out of Amnesia out of the misunderstanding and bring them to the correct understanding praise be to God I was I was in the sanctuary last night praying and and I I tend to do this on Saturday nights I pray at the altar for a while and I walk the aisles and I pray and and I was in the back here praying and I said God we have tried so much to draw people we've tried through uh uh uh excitement we've tried through enthusiasm we've tried through debate we tried to intellectualism we've we've tried uh coercion and force and I'm talking not just I see I'm just talking about Christianity for the last 2000 years tried through persuasive altar calls and threats and and you know you could die tonight if you don't come down here and give your heart to the Lord and all of those things and I'm sure God used them all at different times for different ways to catch his children so I'm not condemning any of it I'm just saying God I was praying by they're gone I don't want to use Force I don't want to use a good reasoning I don't want to draw I'm not trying to attract people amen by my entertainment by an enthusiasm by an excitement and by by an exciting sermon or exciting music I don't want to attract people even by friendship and camaraderie God I want your word to be the attraction amen I want the reality of the truth of this day to attract the Sheep amen whether it's said quiet or said loud amen without Fanfare without Showmanship with without a bunch of program but just the word alone pulling God's elect back to where they came from the the pull of the reality of the word should be the greatest pull to a seed of God amen sometimes we get the idea that if we just befriend somebody and befriending them amen and they stay in the atmosphere long enough amen and they like all the people that they'll can get converted they might just come along and be a friend and never be converted and we should befriend everybody it's not about being nicer we should be nice and treat everybody hospitable but Hospitality won't bring a conversion all right uh uh enthusiasm won't bring a conversion excitement program a camaraderie amen entertainment none of that will bring a a change none of that will bring a new birth none of that will uh what will be the eagle scream that connects amen a predestinated seat of God back to a living God to Quicken that seed to life what is it going to take it's going to take the reality of the word that's been unveiled in this day and and and I just committed myself again said gone help me Amen to use no other tactic but the word pure unadulterated word the way it was delivered unto us amen if we could just give that out it'll draw the seed of God to itself that's what the word was sent for me so all kinds of efforts have gone into all kinds of things but it's just a lot of effort in the wrong direction but our effort should be not just to preach this word but to live it to preach it yes and to preach it true to share it to speak it to testify of it but that but what comes out of our mouth and what has lived out of our Lives needs to be a match it needs to be the Life of Christ it needs to be the new creation on display amen that gives validity to the words that are spoken because we're not just speaking words but we're demonstrating it with the power of God to change the life and line it to the word I said God let the reality let there come an Awakening to every seed when they hear that you were never a chicken you were never a dog you were never a goat but you were in the mind of God from before the foundation of the world I don't need to intellectualize that if there's a sieging of God laying there something in them is going to start stirring when they start to hear those words because it's a truth amen and the one who is truth is the one who put that seed down on the inside of them and that seed will respond to the truth praise God let's go to John 15. John 15 and 16. he says ye have not chosen me but I have chosen you you have not chosen me but I've chosen you and ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain that whatsoever ye shall ask of the father in my name he may give it you Jesus is done his disciples you haven't chosen me but I've chosen you what a tremendous revelation because I didn't choose myself in the beginning I can't untruse myself right I I didn't I'm not the one who made the choice I'm not the one who determined the election amen God is the one who determined that so I cannot undetermine my election by another Choice amen the choice is already set it was his choice it was determined before the foundation of the world my name was put in the Lamb's Book of Life and with indelible ink never to be removed my name was there when the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world I cannot be lost amen God has already made his choice it's not determined upon my choice amen my choice amen is not what God was dependent on it was his choice that he was dependent of my the grace of God the sovereignty of God it is an overwhelming reality God says to Jeremiah the prophet he tells him in Jeremiah 1 4 then the word of the Lord came unto me saying before I form thee in the belly I knew thee and before thou camest forth out of the womb I Sanctified thee and are ordained thee a prophet unto the Nations well what is Jeremiah going to do about that Jeremiah going to say uh well I I don't think so because you know I'm not as smart as I should be and I don't have as much education as I should have I don't know how much how old Jeremiah was but he was an adult at this time that the word of the Lord comes to him and God discloses this bit of information to him as an adult and he may have felt inferior he may have felt inadequate he may have felt that he made too many mistakes in the past he may have felt that he come from the wrong family I don't know what he felt as a man but it didn't matter what he felt as a man and to this point it didn't matter what he had done as a man God said before I formed thee in the belly amen God had a plan for Jeremiah before Jeremiah's life was even conceived before I form thee in the belly I knew thee and I tell you what else is amazing is God said I formed you in the belly so that willful act of mother and father of their own self-will was God and the same thing for you if you're a child of God God knew when you would come forth he looked after your lineage to get a certain temperament a certain way amen about you so that he could use you for his purpose and he watched after you generationally and he knew when you would come forth in what form you would come forth with with what characteristics you would come forth before I form thee in the belly I knew thee that listen he didn't say I knew of Thee I knew about thee he said I knew thee there was a fellowship somewhere somehow before the foundation before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee and before thou countest forth out of the womb I Sanctified thee and I ordained thee a prophet unto the Nations you know what Jeremiah didn't have to try to be a prophet he was a prophet he didn't have to wonder he didn't have to try you know a counting school that didn't work you know uh Seminary that didn't work Jeremiah I don't know what he did before but you know everybody's trying to find themselves we don't need to find ourselves we need to find Christ and whatever he's ordained us to be is what we will be amen Jeremiah was going to be nothing other than a prophet David was going to be nothing other than a king is that right because that's what God had predetermined that he was going to be and we spend so much time trying to self-determine and self-analyze and or or not even this I want to be and I want to be and I want to be it matters not what you want to be what matters is what God wants you to be and what God wants you to be is what you will be and the sooner you get with that program the easier life is going to be even brother Graham said God is going to even be expressed in your in your natural aptitude in your work and the things that you do and God knew and so there's no you know I sometimes high school kids when we had guidance counselors and they used to tell us you know you got to go to college and you got to do all this and then they would give you little charts and you would have all these potential jobs and the job market how many uh uh what kind of deficit there are and how many jobs the the this you know computer science or engineering they need this many roles so hey that'd be good they'll hire and then then they have a list of what they're likely to make make this and you make that you make this it comes down to it for a child of God it doesn't matter the chart throw it away because God's already determined what you're going to do God knows what you will be he knows how he will use you he knows what you're born for just yield to him walk with him put your hand in his and walk he knows where he's leading you look at John chapter 4. I'm sorry John chapter six not four John chapter 6. verse 44. no man can come to me except the Father which has sent me draw him and I will raise him up at the last days go to 65. chapter 6 verse 65. and he said therefore said I unto you that no man can come unto me except that we're given unto him of my father ma'am says in the message why are we not a denomination he says how are you going to if he made me what I am without having any choice at all I never went back there and saying now Charlie Charlie Branham you marry Ella Harvey and bring forth me out of the earth no sir I never had no choice of that God did that that listen to what he's saying that was not a random choice of two people and those two people were not serving God but God knew his Prophet was coming forth and he knew what union it would take and God watched over it God did that and if he made me what I am without a choice how much more when the Holy Ghost goes to brooding over me and I say yea Lord You're My Creator and I love you and accept you as my savior how are you going to hold me in the dust if God could bring brother Branham Out of the Dust out of the earth without his choice by bringing his mother and father together having a conception the food his mother eating and the food if God could bring him out of the Dust without his choice now that he's surrendered to the choice of God how will you ever hold his body in the dust God can do that and and God knew amen when he was going to come forth he knew where he was going to come forth he knew what temperament he would have he knew his father and mother was going to be God had already determined it he watched over he made it happen and that without the prophet's Choice God did that amen without him choosing that and now when he has Joyce his choice is to surrender to the Holy Ghost how much more will the program of God work if we're surrendered to his spirit he was working his program before you were surrendered to his spirit praise God let's go to Ephesians chapter one Ephesians chapter 1. and I'm going to begin reading at verse 3. Ephesians 1 and 3. blessed be the father the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us into the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will whose choice was it whose will was it whose pleasure was it for six to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and Prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him and whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will he decided basically what he's saying is he decided he decided before he knew what he's going to do and he did it for his pleasure and he did it according to his own will and that's why you're here and that's why you believe verse 12 that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ and whom also in in whom he also trusted after that you heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation in whom also after that you believed you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise God knew exactly what he was doing when you came forth God knew where his attributes where he knew where seed was he didn't lose any he didn't have to go and try to find them again and he didn't he you know he didn't uh guess when they would come forth he knew exactly when they were going to come forth and you are fashioned a certain way with certain characteristics you've come forth through certain parentage in a certain location being a certain race male or female certain gender all by his good pleasure by the pleasure of his will or by the Council of his own will and and that's why why can the Potter why can the clay say to the Potter why have you made me thus he can fashion whatever he wants any way he wants it's not for us to question why did you do this as if he made a mistake but to just recognize that what he does is good and it's for a purpose amen so God he knows exactly what he's doing with us and and it's no mystery for him but it's been most of our lives a mystery for us amen but the word of God is here to unravel the mystery so that we know who we are and the message Israel in the church he says now I want you to notice that is the beginning of Christianity of the church and I want you to notice it wasn't because Abraham was a good man it was because God elected and chose Abraham it wasn't Abraham choosing God it was God choosing Abraham can you see it and now watch now as it was then so is it today it isn't you choosing God it's God choosing you Abraham's the father of the faith but what did Abraham do to choose himself God came to him amen when when he was an ER of the chaldees and spoke to him and separated him out and let him out and showed up to him Abraham could never go find God's Dwelling Place God had to come to Abraham so it was God's choice God's will God's purpose all along let's look at Galatians chapter one Galatians 1 and 13. the Apostle Paul speaking for you have heard of my Converse conversation and time past in the Jews religion how that beyond measure I persecuted the Church of God and wasted it and profited in the Jew's religion above many mine equals in my own Nation but more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers but when it pleased God who separated me from my mother's womb and called me by his grace who separated who when it pleased God who separated me from my mother's womb and called me by his grace to reveal his son to me in me what what was Paul called for so that their son would be revealed in him but when it pleased God who separated me from my mother's womb and called me by his grace to reveal his son and me that I might preach him among the Heathen immediately I confer not with flesh and blood the Apostle Paul was chosen he didn't choose he was chosen he was fashioned for a purpose and if you look in Acts 9 he speaks about this Acts chapter 9. verse 15. in Acts 9 and 15 it says God is speaking now to ananias ananias is afraid to to go to Paul to go to Saul as God had commissioned him and so he tells the Lord this and the Lord responds but the Lord said unto him go thy way for he is a chosen vessel unto me to Bear my name before the Gentiles and the Kings and the children of Israel for I will show him how great things he must suffer from my name's sake God had chose Paul before Paul knew anything about it in fact it was God who separated Paul from his mother's womb and watched over him because God had a plan for him and when it was time to reveal his son in Paul he called to Paul and separated Paul out and Paul went into the Wilderness to learn of Christ himself amen and God says he's a chosen vessel unto me to Bear my name before Gentiles and kings and you think about the prophet of God in our day God had chosen Mount and selected him he was born A peculiar birth the the pillar of fire like a dove showed up and a light showed up when he was born who orchestrated that that was God who determined that it was gone amen he could hear voices as the voice of the Lord as a boy he could see Visions he didn't do anything to make himself that he was that he didn't do anything to bring it on why can a three-year-old boy do to bring on a vision did he pray enough did he fast enough did he spend enough time except no he was he was a prophet of God God called him and separated him from his mother's womb God watched over him and he had a vision when he was two or three years old of men falling off of a bridge and it wasn't when he was fasting and praying and separating himself out it just happened because that's what he is right and then God when he finally calls him and calls him to the field and he tells him that you have a gift of healing that you'll take to the peoples of the world Amen and you'll pray for kings and potentates and all these other things and here is a man with a seventh grade education moved from Kentucky to Southern Indiana as a boy I was only really known in this local community amen wasn't formally trained didn't have any formal backing how in the world was this man gonna pray for Kings amen but it wasn't up to him to worry about how he was going to pray for Kings God had already determined he was going to pray for kings and guess what he prayed for Kings multiple Kings in his lifetime an impossibility for that man to go to that place and pray for that person but God before determined that that was the way it's going to be so that was the way it was going to be amen it wasn't his effort that made him pray for a king amen God had already told him before he put forth any effort before he made a surrender Amen to go to the field I mean God had already said you're going to pray for Kings he said you're going to take a gift of healing to the peoples of the world and he told him that amen before that gift was really manifesting amen so what did Brother Branham have to do to manifest a gift in his life all he had to do was step out and be what God called him to be and it worked amen because of who he was [Music] not because of what he did but because of who he was and God you know God has determined something for each one of us and we are who we are amen you know there's there are some people in our midst who have extreme compassion and are always thinking of others and always remember somebody's birthday always remember your anniversary always send a card and they always ask you when you've been sick that's right there's others Among Us who could never remember your birthday and I forgot that you had a surgery I'm sorry but I love you is that true there are some who love Hospitality who love having people over and love putting together there are some who are more of a loner nature and love amen the either one-on-one conversations or time alone with God which one's right and which one's wrong there are some who can sing and some who can't sing and I'll name no names but what are you going to do to change that what are you going to do to change what God Made You some are a finger some are a toe some are an eyebrows some are what ever part of the body God already determined it's not for us to worry about what we're going to be our plan for a position or strive for a position or or hope or try or set ourselves up the only thing for us to do is just live because it's already in you to be it's already ordained for you to be whatever he's going to call you to be amen and you may feel a strong pull one way and that may be actually your gift but it's going to be God's timing when he puts it into place there's nothing you have to do about it just rest and let God bring it forth right we don't have to make ourselves anything he has already made us what we need to do is yield and just do what comes natural to do and you won't you won't even know it but you'll be serving the body and not even realizing that you're serving the body because it just comes natural God knew what Paul was going to be God ordained him and told him he'd pray for Kings God knew brother Branham was going to be and he knew in order to pull off an extraordinary worldwide Ministry he needed to be deficient of Education and Theological training in church backing the opposite of what everybody else carnally we think God knew he knew that he needed the prophet who was not confident in his education so that his confidence would be in Revelation he needed a prophet who wasn't schooled and wasn't educated in the Finer Things he needed him to be dependent on himself so that's the life that God gave you the life that God gave each one of us was so that God can draw out of us the attributes he wants and keep us from things that we don't need nothing bad has happened to us you say brother Chad I'm telling you nothing bad in the great economy of God has ever happened to us we think things were bad and negative and horrible brother man I'm growing up in poverty being made fun of those were bad things but it shaped him I read here I think a week ago the quote where mother banham was saying he says why when I was a young minister to God take my jerk my wife right out from under me why did he take my baby right out from under my heart he said I didn't understand he goes I didn't know then but I know now God was shaping him molding him when he stood at the bedside of his little baby suffering so much an eight-month-old baby suffering to her eyes crossed and he was shooting the flies out of her eyes and he prayed and like a black sheep come down and God wouldn't answer his prayer and he knew she was going to die and he had he had he had to watch her die and bury her and all the agony that he went through and it was real Agony friends when he tried to commit suicide he really wanted to commit suicide but God stopped him from committing suicide he wanted to shoot those boys who beat him up but God would not allow the gun to fire he wanted to shoot himself with his revolver but he just pull as hard as he might amen the hammer would never come down amen but he would throw it on his bed and it would shoot a shoot a hole in the wall his Agony was real his heartache is real his rage was real his sorrow and his depression was all real but through it all God was molding and shaping the character of a prophet so that he could use him for the purpose that he had in his life amen and brother Branham never looked back on those things with bitterness he never looked back with regret he never felt like he had missed out or lost or all of these things amen when he got to the end of life he knew it was all God training him shaping him and molding him because God needed him a certain way amen God knows God knows and it's his love that has brought all this to pass and you say why because you're serving him today because you love him with all your heart because you you want to give your life to him what made it that way I don't know all these circumstances work together to make our life what they are how it works only he knows but we don't have to make ourselves I I have so often seen somebody that I just genuinely admire I I admire it used to be I admired people who kept their mouth shut so much you would see a brother or a sister they were quiet and they would only speak when they needed to and what they said carried with wisdom and it was an answer to the question and I was blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah then I even wrote note cards down and I kept him in my service truck where I worked and one of the cards that I kept on my visor so I could see it every time I got in my truck was the scripture that says even a fool when he holdeth his peace is counted wise and I tried so hard to change myself but God had a plan for my life not everything was right and some things needed to be brought in balance but God had a plan for my life God knew what he needed and he knew he needed the vessel a certain way to accomplish a certain purpose and when I was fighting hard to stop needed to be curbed but it was something that God was going to use it's still true even a fool when he keepeth his peace has counted as wise you know brother Brown says not all are prophets not all our Apostles not all of this or that but it is given those things are born in Us by election gifts and callings are without repentance how many scripture readers know that let's see gifts and callings not what you want to be it's what God makes you see you are because God has chosen you to be not because you chose to be God chose you and if you're trying to make yourself something that God hasn't chose you to do you're only a mimic and it'll never be a success you've got to be what God chose you to be Paul we're still on Paul the Apostle in First Corinthians 15 8 he says and last of all he was seen of me also as one born out of due time for I am the least of the Apostles that I am not Meek to be called an apostle because I persecuted the Church of God but by the grace of God I am what I am he didn't even consider himself worthy to be called an apostle but it was the grace of God that made him what he was and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain but I labored more abundantly than they all yet not I but the grace of God which was with me he says that even that Grace was not wasted on me because more than all of them I labored more abundantly than he checks himself and says not I but the grace that they said not I but the grace of God which was with me it was an even Paul's Zeal it wasn't even Paul's ambition or burden that pushed him to go on the missionary Journeys to go from City to City when he got stoned and rejected and one to pick up and go to the next one that wasn't even his own Zeal that was the grace of God that was in him that was manifesting out Samson was called before he was born he was called To Be A deliverer he was a deliverer he was born to be a deliverer through all the mistakes of his life through the through the trappings of his own personality it never changed God's call in his life he was told he was told that the angel told his mother amen what he was that he was to be a Nazarite from the wound and that he was going to begin to deliver his people from the Philistines amen and God had already determined what Samson was going to be he wasn't waiting for Samson to get a little bit older and say yeah there's some pretty good muscle on that boy I think I I think I could use it he seems to have a strong some grit and a strong character he wasn't waiting to see what Samson was he knew what he was going to make Samson amen and he didn't need somebody with grit and he didn't meet somebody with muscles he needed a little old shrimpy mama's boy praise God and he determined what he was going to do and he did it and it was such a mystery to the Philistines they could not determine where he gets his strength because it wasn't what he had in the natural that made him strong it's what God had made him and determined him to be and so many times you know you you and I we all have different gifts and different things about us and others can't understand how is it they can always do this and how can they always pull that off and how come they can just I mean how is it that you can just sit down and all of a sudden a song comes and all you do is write it out to me that's the most foreign concept on the planet I tried to write poetry in high school as a required class and it was absolutely ridiculous it was just like whatever words I could put together to get the rhyme at the end and I didn't care what it said drive at the end we're done we wrote a poem hat cat satin whatever in between we got a poem but somebody who can sit and under the inspiration instantly it drop and write out a song and it's beautiful somebody even go from instrument and instrument and play them and in a few minutes they're playing another instrument and you ask them say how long have you been playing that oh this is the first time I've tried it some poor kid has been taking violin for five years and you say hey can I see your violin and you're over there you know 15 minutes later you're playing something that poor kid's like give me back my violin I don't like you anymore but God determined that God put that in us and that's for a reason we don't ever want to try to be something we're not and don't ever fret about what you are just be what you are and serve God put your hand in his trust your your life into his and let him live his life through you and just be what he's called you to be amen Samson he had problems Samson had a problem with women Samson had a I would say a lack of character a lack of morality but he still was God's chosen vessel and brother Bram said in the message just once one more time lord said as his fibers begin to tighten and he's leaning into those columns as his fibers begin to tighten he said let me die with them I was born to destroy them let me die with them and his fibers his muscles tighten up his great huge muscles receive strength the Holy Spirit began to move upon him and he twisted That Rock with his mighty power and down she went all we need is sincere prayer once more Lord there was one thing that that that Samson could determine after being in slavery after grinding in the mill his eyes being plucked out and being in bondage to his enemy there was one thing he could come back to at the end of it all I was born to destroy them this is what I am here for I have failed I have failed miserably but he was willing to repent and he was willing to give all of himself now for his Commission he was finally after failure upon failure upon failure after making a mockery out of the things of God Amen after being taken captive and after giving in to a woman and being seduced by a woman and falling prey to a woman be having his head shaved his eyes poked out and putting bondage in the enemy's Camp the very ones that he was supposed to destroy are the ones that now he is a slave to what a shame what a mockery but it didn't change who Samson was and it didn't change God's Eternal purpose for Samson and when he came back to what his purpose was in Repentance and humility now as his muscles began to tighten against the pillars he says I was born to destroy them God once more God one more time let me die with the Philistines I say when we can surrender to the purpose that God has in us and if you don't know what is my purpose whatever you're doing is your purpose keep doing it when God wants to change it he'll bring a change don't look and seek for something just live all that you can do all that you can live of your life all that you can surrender surrender to him manifest the word give your life to him and let him live through you and die out to that purpose I'm not here for luxury I'm not here for reward I'm not here for accolades I'm not here for promotions I'm not here to be somebody to be recognized I am here to serve God's Eternal purpose that's in my life that's the only thing I want and everything else God gives to me or takes away from me I'm fine with because it's his purpose we fret so much about how to gain one more step and we cry so hard about the one we lost is that true we we we strain and frighten how to get this next step or how to accomplish this next goal and then when it bypasses us and somebody else got the promotion or something else happened and you lost out on the deal and then how did that happen I missed all of that and and all this all this wasted energy instead of just saying God if you want me to have it I'll have it if you don't I don't I'm trusting in you because I'm not living this life for me I'm living this life for you I am here to manifest to demonstrate to live the life of Jesus Christ through every circumstance success or failure Victory or defeat blessing or or hurt I'm here to express him Ephesians 2 and 8. I'll just read it's very familiar scripture to us Ephesians 2 and 8 for by grace are you saved through faith and not not of yourselves it is the gift of God not of Works lest any man should boast for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them um am I missing something are we supposed to pick our own works no we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them God knows what he wants you to do he knows what he wants me to do and the message things that are to be says now the only way that you can be a son or daughter of God is because you have to have eternal life and there's only one form of eternal life and that's God's life only one form of eternal life that was God there to be a Son of God you had to be in him always the gene of your life spiritual life tonight was in God the Father before there was even a molecule and you are nothing but the manifestation of the gene of life that was in God as a son of God now you're expressed after his word has come in you to light up this age you are expressing God's life in you because you are a son or a daughter of God therefore you get what I mean so you are you are now made you're sitting in this church tonight because your duty is to express God to this nation this people and this neighborhood where you associate wherever you are God knew that you would be there because you have to be one of his genes or his attributes you had to be if you ever if you've got eternal life then it always was eternal life and God before there was a foundation of the world knew that you would be here and when the word or the water of the washing of the water of the word fell upon you it expressed in a being now you have fellowship with your father God just as you have with your Earthly father God knew that you would be here and our duty is to express God to this nation this people this neighborhood where we associate what's your duty that's our duty how will we do it he's already determined whether you'll pray for Kings or not you know Isaiah had a prophecy that a virgin shall conceive before he spoke the prophecy God knew the virgin what could she do to earn that title what could she do that to say oh I hope he'll let me be that virgin that Isaiah spoke about I I just want to be the Virgin that no God already knew who she would be and when the time was appointed she didn't have to go anywhere seek anything do anything the angel came to her and said hell thou highly favored of the Lord where the Lord is with thee and she she is just as shocked as anybody else that she is going to be the the virgin that's the Fulfillment of Isaiah 7 but God knew beforehand and God knew where she was what city she dwelled in what time she was coming to the well and he could send Gabriel at exactly the right time he knew the time the season he knew who she was where she was where she was born where she lived what did she have to do nothing but surrender to what she heard Zechariah and Elizabeth had lived all their life Barren had no children it was a hardship it was it was not an easy situation it was a reproach amen for a woman in that day amen but God had already determined he had a special thing for them to do she was Barren Zacharias and Elizabeth could have no child they were getting older in age he was serving in the temple how many times did he pray did they pray for a baby ask yourself it was you how many times would you pray how many times would you ask God why why couldn't I just have a baby why why why amen we could pray so many times we could ask so many times but God knew that they were going to bring forth John the Baptist and he knew when they were going to bring him forward then they knew how he was going to bring him forth and he was holding back preserving them for that special work [Music] disappointment I'm sure they had it misunderstanding they probably didn't understand the plan of God but God understood his plan and he knew who they were and where they were and in the right season he knew how to get the word to them all right God knows where you're at he knows what you're doing he knows what his plans are for you don't stress don't fret Just Surrender to him don't be ambitious one thing that we could lose in life we could lose a whole lot of ambition let's not be ambitious I only want what he wants me to have Abraham was rich but not because of ambition Abraham was rich because God made him rich I don't want to be ambitious I just want to be what God wants me to be I want to be free to be whatever he desires for me to be and I want to be I want to keep myself free from the world so that he can send me anywhere and do anything he wants with me so it'll be him and not me and then whatever happens amen there's no way that I can get the credit for it because I had no ambition it was him not me let me think brother Branham could get credit for going and praying for King George how did he make it happen God made it happen God gets the credit for that in the laodicean church age from the church age book Prophet says herein is now set forth the love of God he desired in love a family of his own if you're part of that family you're an expression of the love of God hearing is now set forth the love of God he desired in love a family of his own a family of Sons Sons like himself there before him lies all mankind as one lump of clay out of that same lump he will now make vessels into honor and unto dishonor the choosing will be his own Jews in then those chosen ones born of his spirit will be trained to conform to His Image in their walk he proves with he reproves with all long-suffering and gentleness and mercy he chastens with nail scarred hands sometimes this Potter must take the vessel he is working on and thoroughly break it down in order that he may rebuild it exactly as he desires it but it is love that is his love another way of his love there is not there cannot be his love the love of God was in love to have a family of his own to have sons like himself and in his love he will bring forth those sons in their decreed season and he will manifest in them what he has already determined to manifest of his attributes and in doing so he will train those he said then those chosen ones born of a spirit will be trained to conform to his image with their walk what's happening in our walk we're being trained what are we being trained for for his eternal purpose we're being trained through the things that we experience in life and through the corrections and through the blessings we're being trained to to walk in his very image to express his very life to fulfill his very purpose in our lives our life is a constant training and shaping and molding and moving and bringing us into the purpose for our lives it's his love it is the expression of his love it is the desire of his heart it is a family in love that is expressing his love and his desire and it's his love that will reprove and Chase and not because he punishes him because he doesn't lie because he has the picture set in love and he's bringing everything according to his picture of love and when we catch the same image the same thing the same vision there's nothing else we want is there anything else you want than the walking is purpose is there anything else you want them to be pleasing to him is there anything else you want than the walk and the Eternal purpose that he had before the foundation of the world to walk step and step with that purpose that he designed in great love amen there's nothing else we want we want that too it's his love and our love working together to bring us into conformity into his image of his word let's look at Romans chapter 8 together Romans chapter 8. in verse 29. for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called whom he called then he also Justified and whom he justified then he also glorified we have been predestinated to be conformed to the image of a son we have been predestinated to be conformed to display the very life and nature of Jesus Christ everything we experience in the message keeps going deeper just for me so much deeper it's not not just the fact that God sent a prophet but now it's deeper because God sent a prophet to me so on the surface God sent a prophet to restore the Jews praise God but the scripture says behold I send you a prophet so now it's deeper now God Did It For Me and and then you know God uh broke the the bonds of denominationalism to free his people to be all he called him to be amen and so now we've been freed from denominationalism from ideas of man and that's great but it goes deeper than that because now I need to be freed from the very core of denominationalism and that's man's thinking and now that's in me so now I need the word to break my thinking and so it just keeps this message just keeps going deeper and deeper and now you know first you start to learn about God Amen and you start to to see a man who experienced God and you learn about God and how God deals with the son but then all of a sudden you step into the picture and you become you become the son that he's dealing with and you start to experience God dealing with you not just watching it in the life of the Prophet but now it's happening in our lives now God is dealing with us as Sons and it goes deeper and deeper and now it's not that I just want to to live right amen I want to think right I want to be right that it's not that I just want to conform on the outside to a to a standard that I know is pleasing to God but I want in in the depth of my soul for the life the essence of who I am to be in the very image of God to be a place that God is dwelling on this Earth in me I I don't just want to know about him I want to know him I don't want I don't I don't want to just learn facts I want to know the reality I want to experience the relationship I want to think like he thinks and I want it to translate into walking like he walks and talking like he talks I just don't want to see what he's done I want it to be what he's doing but I want him to do it in me and I want to be changed thoroughly completely I want to be that new creature in that new race living a new creature kind of life it's got to go deeper it's got to go to the core it's got to root out all of self and it's got to leave only room for him to manifest himself what he's determined that's what I want him to have what he's withheld I don't want it's got to be his eternal purpose and our love for him and his love for us and this great love love relationship creating love slaves to Christ Jesus but we have been predestinated to be conformed into his image brother man said born Christians grow into the stature of Christ as they live Paul the Apostle says in Galatians 4 19 my little children of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you he was laboring to bring forth Christ in them and now this message is here to bring forth Christ in a mini-membered body to bring forth Christ in you the message goes deeper than than you know bride and we have a a mini-membered body but now it comes down to I am a member of that body it's me in Christ it's Christ in me it brings a personal responsibility it brings a private life I think that's what this word in this day was meant to do not to bring another religion another form another ritual but it was come to unite Sons and Daughters of God with the head with Christ Jesus so that there is a personal intimate individual relationship between us and our maker so that we cry out to him and he hears us and we commune back and forth with him in his love plan it's got to go deeper because this is the continuation of the creation of God not a form of religion a living reality not a gathering place for people who share the same or similar Doctrine but an individual totally sold out to God who's now expressing the very Life of Christ in their flesh that's what this message came to do and the unveiling of God he says and it shall come to pass in the last days saith God here we are see here we are the light over the world as the light of the sun changes the seed from glory to glory we also become more like him as we live in his presence like him being conformed to his blessed image as we walk with him why is it we keep reading the message why is it we keep listening why is it we keep coming to service for this scripture right here for this quote because we become more like him as we live in his presence as the sun changes the seed from glory to glory and the presence of the Sun the the seed is constantly unfolding the nature that's in itself and the presence of that Sun as it draws the seed out of the ground it comes forth as a little blade and it comes forth as a stalk and then a tosso and a shock and and then finally it comes back to the very life that was in it from the beginning then it's in the presence of the sun day by day that it draws more life and more life and more life and more life until finally it returns to what it was always meant to be to the very purpose of its planting in the beginning and that is a Christian's life we are here to lay in the presence of the sun we are here to stay under this word and let this word draw more life out of the predestinated seed that's already in us the very attributed and part of God that he's placed within the children of God the word that we're laying under day by day and hearing amen May the light get brighter and brighter as it draws more life more of the original life out of us and it becomes more evident in our lives in the Rapture message he says the shock is pulled away and the wheat must lay in the presence of the sun to be ripened that's what this message is supposed to be doing to us we shouldn't be going backwards in maturity we shouldn't be going backwards in our walk we shouldn't we shouldn't be turning from Back to the weak and beggarly elements of the earth we shouldn't be getting caught up again and the things of the world we're a new creature everything else is dead to us amen but we should be growing and christ-like character we should be coming more like him all the time this message amen has the power amen it is the light that will bring the transforming power out of the sea he says in Christ is the mystery of God revealed he said that is his purpose that's why he died that's the second fold of his threefold manifestation first to express himself in Christ then Express his self through the church and the same thing Christ was the word in the church becomes the word when it lets the word go through them Ephesians 5 25 says husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that you might that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of Water by the word that he might present to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but it should be holy and without blemish what is the word doing it's making us perfect spotless the word is washing I say this way the word is washing away everything that's not compatible with the word everything that's dirty everything that's not clean everything that's not pure is being washed away by the washing of the water of the word and we must constantly stay under the flow where the water of the word is washing over us and washing out impurities and moving away everything that's not pure that's not word so that the washing of the water of the word will never remove the word it'll only remove non-word so what's not word in our lives let the word wash it away so that what his word will remain that's why we come to church Wednesday and Sunday not to hear how good we are but to see our bad parts to stay in the light for growth to be encouraged in our walk to provoke one another and to love and good works in The Invisible Union of the bride of Christ the prophet said the spirit the spiritual union of Christ in his church now when the flesh is becoming word and the word is becoming flesh manifested Vindicated what is the word doing it's becoming flesh where is the word which is God where is the word becoming flesh in our flesh the word is taking on flesh and the flesh is becoming the word to where the life that we live is supposed to be the life of the word let the washing of the water of the word wash away everything that's not God's purpose that's not God's plan that's not God's word and under this under this spout where the water is Flowing let it wash away every impurity every old nature every old desire every carnal thing of the word and so where our heart and affection is purified by the washing of the water of the word and we want what God wants in every situation of Our Lives that's the way we've lived for years but it's it's taken the washing of the water of the word to bring a further realization that this has to go and this has to go and this has to go and that's not what he wants from me it's the washing of the water the word continually a Christian grows in christ-like character as he walks in the presence of Christ let's keep walking in the presence of Christ and trusting that the son will do the work the washing of the water the word will do the work because this is the continuation of the creation of God it's got to be God on display the second fold of his threefold plan first to get preeminence in a man he did that in Christ Jesus second to get preeminence in a people he's doing that now in the body of Christ Jesus is he giving preeminence I say Lord have preeminence I want you to have preeminence and keep washing me I can't do it myself you and I can do no more to fulfill the purpose God has for us then brother Branham could to go pray for a king but God has predestinated us to be conformed to the image of his son it's a promise we just need to stay under the water we just need to stay in the light and this walk in this presence and he will accomplish everything he's promised to accomplish in our lives amen let's all Stand Together your life is not an accident if you're a child of God your life is not an accident you're not here by accident and if you're not here if you're not here by accident then you're not here without purpose the musicians want to make their way up don't let the devil tell you nothing's happening in your life something's happening you're not here without a purpose and you didn't come without a plan and God knew when you would arrive and where you would arrive and who your parents would be and he knew the struggles that would be in your life and he knew what you would have to overcome and he already made a provision for all of it now all we have to do is just trust that he knows what he's doing how could the prophet of God go stand night after night after night before thousands of people call a prayer line knowing that he can do nothing to discern he can do nothing to make a vision come he can do nothing to heal these people how could he do it because God told him that was his purpose how is it that we can walk in a world that's so filthy knowing that we won't be defiled not being afraid of falling away because we know his purpose for us is to bring us through his purpose to manifest himself that we're not going to fall away we're not going to be deceived we're not going to be trained right but God has a purpose in our life and he's called us for a purpose and we're not afraid to go out and live that purpose because God is backing it up God is good friends his plan is good and he's given us everything we need to continue to reveal God to this world let's bow our heads and pray Lord Jesus we thank you father I'm so grateful Lord for your word for the Revelation Lord that brings us back to origin back Beyond a mother and a father back Beyond grandparents or ancestry Lord that you've brought us back into your very mind and showed us that we were there and there you had a plan and that plan was perfect and God we rejoiced in that plan one day when the sons of God shouted for joy God now you're working that plan in our lives help us to surrender Lord help us to catch Lord the vision of what you're doing in our lives help us Lord not to resist but to yield help us to surrender Lord to the things that you're working out of us and that you're working in US God let us go where you lead us and do what you call us to do let's do it without fear Lord we we want to be what you call us to be in this life vessels Lord that you shall use as your new creation display yourself in each one of us Lord wash us with the water of your word cleanse us grow us Lord in your presence and make us more like you we love you Lord we thank you God bring realization to every one of your seeds of who they really are bring a reality to each one Lord that the lies of the devil would fade away Lord that the lust for the world would would fall short of this great reality of who we really are we love you we give you our lives we surrender to you afresh we want to give you first place and preeminence in all things we want to have the right vision of what our purpose is in this life help us God to turn away from carnal things help us to lay down ambitious things and just take your word above everything else and follow after you God it'll all work out just right for you've already determined it so we love you God I pray that you would bless brother Emmanuel and sister Mimi in their travels God I pray you would guide myself and brother Joe as we go to India we're going trusting in your purpose and in your plan relying completely upon you Lord we pray that you would do what Only You Can Do Lord you would accomplish your purpose and your will as we surrender to your hand bless the Brethren that will stay here bless the ministers that will Minister the word pray you watch over this Fellowship Lord while we're gone we trust you for your plan is perfect and your ways are perfect and you already know what it is that you'll do we want to say we love you Lord we thank you God in Jesus Christ's name we pray Amen Brother John only to be what he wants me to be every moment of it heal there it completely to Jesus alone every step of this oh just to be played Potter's head bread to do what his were
