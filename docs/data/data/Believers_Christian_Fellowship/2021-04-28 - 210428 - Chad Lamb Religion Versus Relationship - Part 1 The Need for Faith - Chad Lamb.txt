founded his likeness to hear [Applause] [Music] god bless you this evening it's good to be here together amen how many just want to please the lord praise god i thank god that he's given us a word and a revelation on that word so that we know how to please him we don't have to come up with our own way or make up our own idea but he has told us the revelation of the word how to please him and how is it we please him by believing his word amen by believing whom he sent let's turn to the book of hebrews chapter 11 when we're standing and read this portion of scripture together i just want to give you an update on brother manuel i was able to text with him just a little bit before service and he said he's still improving and still recovering and he wanted me to give you greetings from him so god bless him as he recovers and makes a full recovery and let's look at hebrews chapter 11 and i'm going to begin reading in verse 1. now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god so that the things which are seen were not made of things which do appear by faith abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous god testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh by faith enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because god had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased god but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him let's bow our heads lord jesus we thank you for the privilege lord of coming here lord the privilege of being able to raise our hands and raise our voices to sing your praises i'm glad to hear your word as it's been revealed in this last days god it's a privilege lord many prophets and many godly men have have desired to see this day but lord you've chosen us to be here let it not pass by us lord let it not move over us and let us catch it lord let it not slip through our fingers but may we beware totally aware of what's going on in this day give us a fresh revelation lord i pray that you speak your word through these lips of clay and may you speak the eternal word lord that would forever bring changes to us to lift us higher and higher in the revelation of yourself god we pray you would have preeminence lord among us and that you would speak and that no one else would speak we ask your blessings in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can have your seats i mean i i'd like to take for a subject uh a topic that i i believe i'm going to spend some time on because it's hit me with great impact here recently and that's the subject religion versus relationship so i'm gonna i believe i'm going to be preaching on this maybe for several services i'll be preaching religion versus relationship and and as a subtitle for today i want to talk about the need for faith the need for faith so religion versus relationship the need for faith and i'd like to start off with a disclaimer at the very beginning of this and say when i'm when i use the term religion i know that there's a true religion but i'm referring to man-made religion i'm referring to a religious order in the same way brother branham does many times so so don't be bothered in your mind whenever i use the term religion i'm always i'm i'm through this series i'm looking at the man-made religion man's own religion and his own religious order and his own religious ideas amen so when we look at hebrews chapter 11 here it tells us that by faith abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than cain and we know that brother branham told us faith is a revelation so abel had a revelation so that by faith he offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous so now because he had a revelation from god amen in that revelation was his faith in order to act upon the revelation and bring the right sacrifice when he did that it obtained witness that he was righteous amen he did not become righteous he was righteous and because he was righteous he had the capacity to get a revelation from god which was his faith and when he offered the right offering amen it witnessed to him that he was righteous amen praise god so this is really important amen so then we go on down to enoch is it by faith enoch was translated that he should not see death it was not found because god had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased god amen how could enoch please god without a revelation i want to ask you how is it how could we please god without a revelation i mean what work before the revelation of the hour came to us what did we do that was pleasing to god amen some of us were in different churches and various forms of belief amen and we we were we were doing whatever we felt like god wanted we chose uh uh we chose the mode of worship they meant according to what we thought was pleasing to god whether we were pentecostal or a catholic or baptist amen some of us were that because we were raised that way and we assumed it was correct and we maintained that some of us had even switched from one to the other amen trying to find the one that would be most pleasing to god but there was no way we could please god until we had a revelation and when we got the revelation we realized that our life was not pleasing to god no matter how religious we were we were not pleasing to god because in our religion we were rejecting his word amen we were taking false titles and baptized and we were we were we were cutting god into three pieces and amen and we were dressing him morally and living immorally amen so there's no way without revelation that we were actually pleasing to god so in order for enoch to have a testimony that he pleased god he had to have a revelation of that word for his day what god was looking for in that day and when he had that revelation and was able because of that faith produced in him in action amen he had a testimony that he pleased god remember this is this is hebrews 11 it's all about faith so the testimony did he please god so you see enoch could have never done enough good works to please god there was other people in that day doing works enoch wasn't the only one trying to serve god through works cain's line was also very religious cain went out from the presence of god but brother bram said he never stopped being religious and cain's children were religious they didn't stop the religious practices just because they went out from the presence of god they maintained the religious practices and they were doing works amen but but enoch was not able to please god by matching them work for work amen he was only able to please god when he caught a revelation of what god was doing in that hour and when he gave himself over to that revelation amen then he could please god but then verse 6 but without faith it is impossible to please him no matter how much effort we put into it without faith which is a revelation without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him that phrase we're going to come back to those who diligently seek him let's turn if you would with me to genesis chapter 3 i found that as i was looking at this subject it really just exploded for me and i was just seeking where to start because i've got so much more on my heart to say than i can possibly say in one service maybe possibly say in three or four services i don't know just as the lord leads but i thought where do we start and the only place to start is genesis amen you might as well go all the way back to the beginning because brother venom told us everything started in genesis and you know i was discussing with the brother the other day or to even today as everything started in genesis and we've said amen to that for years i believe it brother branham said it i believe everything started in genesis but more and more as he lifts us in revelation i i'm not only agreeing with the prophet said i am seeing with my own very eyes that have been opened by revelation that everything started in genesis everything that we're dealing with today the battle that we're in now amen we can trace it back to genesis so genesis chapter 3 we're going to look at verse 6. and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also into her husband with her and he did eat and the eyes of them both were open and they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons and they heard the voice of the lord god walking in the garden in the cool of the day and adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the lord god amongst the trees of the garden and the lord god called unto adam and said unto him where art thou and he said i heard thy voice in the garden and i was afraid because i was naked and i hid myself and he said who told thee that thou was naked hast thou eaten of the tree where have i commanded thee that thou should not eat. so we know this we know the story really well but i want to begin here and i want to lay a foundation amen that we pray that the lord will build on in the message conference from 1963 he says oh the hour the tremendous time that we're living when men is told of their error instead of trying to come back and say father i'm wrong forgive me they still hide behind fig leaves fig leaves is what they sowed together themselves and they tried the word religion means a covering so i want you to get a hold of that and this is the this is the the this is the reference that i'm using when i discuss religion when i talk about religion versus relationship amen the word religion means a covering and they tried to make themselves a handmade covering and man hasn't changed yet today amen so you don't walk around anywhere and see people amen trying to uh uh make an atonement for themselves by sowing fig leaves together but what they've done is made a man-made religion and in their man-made religion they made their own covering amen and the covering was to cover their sin so when adam and eve fell in the garden of eden they made themselves aprons and aprons was a covering for their sin because the apron was covering the affected area of the sin all right and so this was this was why brother said religion is a covering in the fig leaves was what they made themselves it was a self-made amen covering and the word covering is the same word as the word atonement the word atonement means a covering god made an atonement to cover their sins but adam amen we did not have an atonement he had a religion without an atonement and he made for himself a covering amen but the covering did not possess an atonement it was his covering not god's covering so the word religion means a covering let's look at chapter 3 verse 21 unto adam also and to his wife did the lord god make coats of skins and clothed them so this is the first instance we have of of of killing in the bible when god now would kill an animal and we know it's a lamb the prophet told us it's a lamb it's typed all the way through the bible as a lamb but god now would come and he would take an innocent lamb and by the shedding of blood he wouldn't make an atonement or a covering for his children that would fallen and and he would take the skins of that animal whose blood was shed as a substitute for them and now he would cover them so god made a covering god made an atonement and the covering spoke of the atonement so the covering that they were in testified amen that when i'm covered with the life amen of my covering was shed the blood was shed as a substitute offering because now i've polluted blood and i should die i mean but there's a substitute that shed its blood in my place and now the very covering that i'm wearing is testifying of the atonement that god made that is why the bride has to be clothed in the word amen that is why the prophet has to take the clothing of the word amen has to clothe the bride in the word amen because that is that is the word and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and now the bride is clothed in the word and what if she is clothed then amen is is depicting the blood that was shed the life of the word went out for her as a substitute for her atonement and now the fact that she is clothed in that word is testifying that there was the right atonement that there was shedding of blood amen that's why she must live in the word she must be in christ she must portray the word she must live the life of the word it must be the word upon her amen the word reflected off of her and amen that's her covering now amen it's it's the word amen in the life of the word the word was made flesh amen and the word bled for us the word died for us and that blood amen was the was the price of our atonement and now we're clothed in the word so god was typing it all the way back here and in the message fellowship from 1960 brother said then god made a remedy for that in closing i might say this in the garden of eden when god saw that his children had sinned and had gone from him god himself who is the supreme judge made a reconciliation so he could restore that fellowship to his creatures by the shed blood of an animal and that shed blood lasted for many years speaking of the coming of christ so now what the brother brain was telling us he said god himself who is the supreme judge made a reconciliation so that he could restore that fellowship to his creature by the shedding of blood so when god came he found he found his son and his son's wife he found them fallen now and they had made their own covering tried to cover their sins their own way and by their own religion and god was going to come down and he was going to place judgment upon them now i want you to catch this because there's a lot of things i want to say and i don't know how to say it but just stay tuned in and pull because it's going to take god amen to bring it out because man he was making a covering and what he was trying to do is he was trying to cover his sin and he was trying and cut and covering us and i want you to think of religion religion in our day and covering his sin he was trying to prevent judgment if you just catch this and just stick with me he was trying to cover his nakedness or cover his sin because he wanted to prevent judgment amen but the covering then if there was no judgment then there would be no shedding of blood if there was no shedding of blood there was no proper covering without shedding of blood there was no restoration of fellowship so man in his own covering amen with his own religion now i'm going to say something that's a contrast to what the world believes but it's absolutely the truth and we can see it here in genesis that man's covering was not to bring him into restored fellowship with god but man's covering was to keep him separated from god because man was trying to prevent judgment from taking place but judgment was the very thing that would restore fellowship because god came down as the supreme judge but the supreme judge was a father amen and what the father wanted to do was to judge the sin of his children and in judging the sin of his children he would provide an atonement because he's not just judged he's father also amen if we have a god who's not a father amen then we just have a judge and we want to have a religion to prevent us from coming in contact with that judge because we fear judge unless your judge is also your father and then you're not afraid to come into judgment because it's the father's responsibility after judgment to restore fellowship so the purpose of judgment was restored fellowship amen and the same thing happens with a father today who's raising a little toddler when that toddler begins to become become rebellious and and starts to throw a temper tantrum and they start to fight against mom and dad and they don't want to put their clothes and don't want to eat their food and then they and their actions are breaking fellowship so dad will become the judge and dad will execute the chastisement amen but the chastisement is not just judgment it's judgment with a goal for reconciliation because he's not just a judge he's a father amen so he will judge the error and he will bring the correction amen so that so that he will be able to restore the fellowship so god in the garden of eden amen he would now come down and he would begin to to to know that his children were fallen and as children had made their own covering but when they heard the voice of god walking in the garden in the cool the evening they hid from god because your religion now see their religion or their covering was fig leaves what they had made their religion was it was possible that their religion would satisfy the ideas of one another because they knew where the sin was and they knew what had went wrong adam and eve so they could make for themselves fig leaves a covering and adam could look at his wife and he could say how do i look and she goes i don't see any sin you're covered you understand and eve could say how do i look and he says you're covered i don't see any sin because the physical area that committed the the sin was covered amen so in the eyes of one another intellectually speaking with carnality they could fool one another into believing that their sin was covered but when they heard the voice of god amen and the voice of god amen denotes the presence of god because it says in the scripture that they hid themselves from the presence of god let's read that let's read that chapter 3. let's go back verse 7 and the eyes of them both were open and they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons and they heard the voice of the lord god walking in the garden in the cool of the day and adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the lord amen the voice and then be spoken of his bespoke of his presence amen and they hid from his presence because under the voice of god when the presence of god comes now there's a realization that although you're covered you're naked [Music] they were hiding from god and they said and they hid themselves from the presence of god amongst the trees of the garden and the lord god called unto adam and said unto him where art thou and he said i heard thy voice in the garden and i was afraid because i was naked and i hid myself amen technically he was not naked technically he had an apron of fig leaves but but his religion crumbled to pieces amen he was still covered in his own religion but when he heard the voice of god walking in the garden in the cool of the evening amen there was the presence of god that had come into the garden and he hid from the presence of god because he knew that he was naked his religion would not allow him to enter into the presence of god so religion listen friends this kind of religion religion has never been intended to bring somebody closer to god religion is actually a barrier to prevent reconciliation and restored fellowship with god now i made my disclaimer you know what i'm talking about there's a true religion but i'm talking about this kind of religion religion is not intended to bring somebody closer to god that is not satan's purpose in religion it is intended to make somebody feel covered and in their covering they're trying to prevent judgment and in the attempt to prevent judgment they have they have separated themselves from reconciliation because reconciliation can only come through judgment praise god that's why when jesus was hanging on the cross that was the judgment of the father that was the judgment of the supreme judge but the judgment of the supreme judge had an intent to reconciliation to restore fellowship with his lost children but they didn't want to come to judgment they wanted to cover their sin but this is the very reason that the jews tried to kill jesus when he came because when jesus came he was the voice of god walking in the garden in the cool of the evening it was the presence of god unrecognized and in their presence they were naked in in that voice in the presence of that voice because he was speaking on behalf of god and reflecting the very life of god and when jesus was speaking what jesus was doing was making them naked because jesus said if i had not come and done the works that no other man did you you would have a covering for your sin but now you have no cloak because now the presence of god had come and declared that the presence of god was here the voice of god was again on earth amen and what did they do they tried to stop the voice because the voice amen was cutting through the fig leaves and they were feeling naked and instead of coming to judgment they stopped the voice so that they could stay covered and stay separated from god so religion is intended to keep man separated from god religion is not to bring man into the presence of god praise god in the message the super sign he says adam he tried to make a super religion without an atonement they're still trying to do it a super religion make a religion so he could live any way he wanted to without an atonement and still have a covering he tried to do it in the beginning and he is still trying to do it but god's provided way was an atonement and it will never work no other way it has to come back to an atonement praise god and god hiding himself in simplicity he says in the beginning when man sinned it showed the nature of man he always trying to hide from god and make himself a way that he can feel justified a religion i understand what we're saying now man's religion is a way for him to hide from the judgment of god and hide himself from the presence of god so that he can feel justified because i went to church and i paid my tithe and and i took the sacraments and and i and i sang the songs and i did everything that i was supposed to do in religion now i feel covered because man is born with a guilty conscience he knows he's wrong and he knows there's a god no matter what he says he knows he's wrong and he knows there's a god that's why religion is so prevalent amen no matter how advanced science get religion remains prevalent no matter how how they they try to disprove god and how they try to prove it's a myth and say but religion remains prevalent because god that man knows that he's guilty and he knows that there's a god and so they make a covering he's always trying to hide from god and make himself a way that he can feel justified a religion so he's trying to cover for his own guilt and trying to cover for his own guilt amen and it's amazing that this religion can become so complicated because man will do anything to stay out of the presence of god he'll take any religious form in any religious order to stay out of the presence of god when god brought his children as a nation his chosen nation elect nation out of egypt and brought him to sinai he wanted to unite with them in marriage and he wanted them to come into his presence but when he came down in thunder and lightning and fire upon the mountain when he spoke they were supposed to come into the mountain but when he spoke they ran away because man amen is afraid to come into the presence of god because when he comes into the presence of god he's laid bare he's naked there's no hiding and he must come to some form of judgment so they could not bear the commandment to come up unto him so they ran away and they told moses you go up and you get all the commandments and all the orders and whatever he says to do will do because they would rather keep an order than have a relationship with that god of fire and lightning and thunder and judgment and the same thing is true today friends they would rather have a religious order no matter how complex it is no matter how many beads you do and how much you kneel how many times you have to follow this order in that order it doesn't matter how complicated you got it man is trying to avoid coming into the presence of that judge because they don't know that that judge is their father he's just the judge and so man will keep creating his religion and evolving his religion making his religion more complex or or more frivolous however he wants to make his religion and what he's trying to do is man is trying to hide from god but find a way that he can feel justified to cover his guilty conscience so he'll come up with all kinds of rituals and acts and services and things that he must do and church attendance and tithe paying and and taking sacraments and taking orders and praying to gods and bring the statues and saints and doing beads and blah blah blah blah blah because he's trying to find a way to feel justified a religion that's been a religion means a covering so he tried to make his own religion we're still in god hiding himself in simplicity but god made his decision on how that he would meet man that was upon the shed blood and that's the only way no matter how much we try any other way that's the only place that god will meet man for fellowship is under the shed blood that's important the only place he'll meet for fellowship is under the atonement let's look at genesis chapter 4. i'm going to look at verse 3. and in process of time it came to pass that cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the lord and abel he also brought of the first things of his flock of the fat thereof and the lord had respect unto abel into his offering but in decaying and to his offering he had not respect and cain was very roth and his countenance fell i just i can't hardly believe what i'm reading cain brought his offering of the fruit of the ground and offering to the lord and abel also brought the first things of his flock and of the fat thereof and the lord had respect unto abe and his offering but in decaying into his offering he had not respect and cain was very roth he was very frustrated and very angry who was he angry at he was angry at god why because god didn't accept his idea of worship and his countenance fell brother bam says in the message the odd boy said a human has to worship you have to worship something it's just in you to worship so a human has to worship something so we have to understand that this is in humanity amen even the atheist will worship science or or some something but a human has to worship something and in the message spiritual amnesia he says did you know cain offered as good as cain offered as a good sacrifice to he was sincere build an altar knelt down in worship and offered a sacrifice and prayed to god and if god that's all god requires for you to belong to a church and have an altar and pay your tithe and go to church and to live a good life if that's all he requires he was unjust to condemn cain because he did the same thing yes sir that's exactly but religion means a covering and you can't be covered by your own good works there's only one thing that god will accept and that's the blood of jesus christ praise god let's go back here to genesis chapter 4 and pick it up in verse 6 and the lord said unto cain why art thou wroth why are you so angry and why is thy countenance fallen if thou doest well shalt thou not be accepted and if thou doest not well send life at the door and unto thee shall be his desire and thou shalt rule over him see he came to cain and he accepted one form of worship and he rejected another and cain became angry and so these little these scriptures though they're not they're not many words they're deep rich in meaning why was cain angry amen if he came to god and god with his father amen and he if he had a desire to please god why would he not become curious instead of angry like if his only motivation was to please god with his sacrifice then when god was not pleased with his sacrifice why did he become angry why was he full of wrath amen why was he angry towards god when god didn't accept his sacrifice if he wanted to please god amen and then now god in his mercy he comes to cain and say cain why are you roth and why has that countenance fallen if thou do good amen and brother branham explains this to us he says he tells him if you'll just do like your brother abel and his mercy now now look at the picture cain and abel they both had a desire to worship amen they both wanted to offer worship because it's in man to worship so cain he works out the best form of worship that he can think of because it was not offered by faith it was offered by wisdom by intellectualism so he gave the very best that he had he put his work and he put his effort into it and he worshipped god according to the best of his understanding and the best of his thinking but abel abel did not offer according to his own thinking because abel offered by faith a more excellent sacrifice that means by revelation so abel never offered of his own thinking he offered by a revelation that god gave him of what would be pleasing to the lord and he brought a sacrifice no matter how simple or how ugly or how bloody he brought a sacrifice that was pleasing to the lord not one that was pleasing to himself but cain brought an offering that satisfied his desire and satisfied his understanding abel brought one that he may not have even understood until the revelation clicked amen and then he understood why and he brought it and he pleased god because without faith it is impossible to please god so abel pleased god and god accepted his sacrifice cain pleased himself and god did not accept the sacrifice and then cain became angry and i think if all i wanted to do was please my father and he was pleased with this and not with that why wouldn't you just replicate the same action if the only thing you're interested in doing is pleasing god even when god comes along and gives you the opportunity and says if you'll do good will you not be accepted if you just repeat just watch and repeat amen won't you be accepted but he was so angry amen he would not it didn't it didn't stop his wrath he was still angry because god wouldn't accept it his way and he wanted to worship god his way because he was not interested in pleasing god he was interested in satisfying his own desire to worship we just peeled the mask off all religion in the world amen cain he came god came to him what mercy god came to him and asked him why he's the wrath if you'll do good just just do what able does it'll be fine with you just do it want mercy amen and it just goes to show that cain did not want to please god cain had no faith so he had no capacity to please god but neither did cain have a desire to please god because god made it so simple all you have to do is repeat what you saw and he wouldn't even do it the reason he wouldn't do it is because cain would not come to judgment abel was willing to come to judgment and by faith abel realized i was born wrong i am wrong in abel's revelation brought him to judgment to where now abel needed god and he needed god to accept his sacrifice so that he could have atonement so that he could be brought back into relationship with god abe cain was not interested in having a relationship with god so he was trying to avoid the judgment because he didn't need the atonement because he did not want the relationship but you and i we don't want religion amen we don't want just our own covering we want a relationship with our father and because we want a relationship with our father when the voice of god makes us naked we don't hide we run naked and open amen and say god help me i need you you've got to save me amen you've got to wash me with your blood you've got to cleanse me because i'm wrong by revelation i'm wrong i was born wrong i'll always be wrong unless you judge me unless you come as a father amen and you accept my worship you accept my sacrifice and atone for me through the blood of jesus christ i will forever be lost there's nothing i can do to fix this problem there's nothing i can do to make this right i have to have a blood atonement amen and i have to have a sacrifice that's accepted by you and this is the only one oh god save me first corinthians 11 we read this at communion amen but it says for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged now i want to look at judgment a judgment coming from a father now if we would judge ourselves we wouldn't mean to be judged that goes the same thing for our children if our children would just judge their own actions there's no reason for dad to be judged if they would just say you know what that's not mine i shouldn't take it i shouldn't take it from my brother that would be wrong for me to do that then no need for dad to judge if they would say you know really it's not right for me to punch my brother or sister but when they fail to judge themselves then there has to be a judge that will bring them back into fellowship and the scripture says but when we are judged we are chastened of the lord that we should not be condemned with the world amen that's a father amen that's when we fail to judge ourselves he will judge us amen to so he we won't be lost with the world he wants us to be his and with him and in fellowship with him so judgment serves a totally different purpose for the children of god in the message three kinds of believers the prophet said just like eve was she was very religious of course but she did not believe the true word and she had to make herself a religion so she made some fig leaves see but it wouldn't work religion means a covering cain did the same thing cain couldn't believe that that was right he said god is holy god is pure god is beautiful so i will get me some flowers and i'll make the flowers and i'll make a fine great altar and i'll show my reverence to him i'll get up before it and i'll bow down before him and worship that god and i'll put flowers on the altar because you know my father and mother eat some apples some fruit in the garden of eden and that's the thing that brought me out and so that's i will go back because i'll make it beautiful god just can't turn my big cathedral down why it'll be too big of a cathedral i'll make it so pretty till it'll track god's attention satan is the one that dwells in beauty that's exactly what the scripture says notice satan dwells in beauty what did he try to do in the beginning make a more beautiful kingdom than michael's was moved over in the north took two-thirds of the angels with him whose son that was then had that nature in him satan's son it was now he built the altar and he knelt down and he worshipped he went through everything that abel did but abel knew that it was blood that took him out he knew that was it it was sex blood so he took a little animal and offered it upon a rock and chopped its neck notice cain god told him said why don't you worship like your brother and you'll do all right you'll do well if you do that but no he know too much about it see he rejected the original a vindicated word if that ain't his children today now look god had testified the bible said the hebrews to chapter 4 chapter 11 11 chapter god testifying of his gift that he was righteous god vindicating his offering god made proof that that was what what he accepted that was his word his plan so when when abel had caught the revelation he had caught the mind of god he had caught the word of god he had caught the plan of god and now abel was working according to the plan of god god's plan of redemption and that was the word for his day that god made proof that that what he accepted that was his word his plan and told cain do the same thing and live but do you think he would he would forfeit his idea no sir let's look at genesis chapter four verse eight and cain talked with abel his brother and they came to pass when they were in the field that cain rose up against abel his brother and slew him now hold your finger right here and go with me to first john chapter 3. first john chapter 3. and pick up one other scripture here first john chapter 3 and verse 11. for this is the message that you heard from the beginning that we should love one another not as cain who was of that wicked one and slew his brother and wherefore slew he him because his own works were evil and his brother's righteous marvel not my brethren if the world hates you so cain talked with abram his brother and it came to pass when they were in the field that cain rose up against abel's brother and slew him so it makes you wonder what they talked about because the question was proper worship and abel had a revelation of what the proper worship was and abel's revelation uncovered the fall and the need for an atonement for the shed blood of an innocent one and abel's revelation required a judgment cain did not like what he heard i don't know exactly what was said the bible doesn't tell us you can only imagine whatever the discussion was it made cain desired to kill abel and why did he why did he slay his brother why slew him because his works were evil and his brothers were good we're righteous and so you have to ask yourself what were his evil works was it drinking was it smoking was it womanizing what was cain doing that was so evil amen cain's evil works was trying to make his own atonement avoiding judgment and creating his own religion so that he could justify himself this is why he was so angry when god would not accept his sacrifice because cain felt justified in his sacrifice because when he was wrath he was angry why do you get angry you only get angry when you feel like you've been unfairly treated so cain amen he was self-righteous and he felt like he he had achieved it was good enough amen and god said it's not good amen and then he became angry because he had his own form of righteousness but abel just waited on the lord and found out what god wanted and when he caught the revelation for his day he acted upon that revelation and god testified that is that he was righteous testifying by his works that he was righteous amen he was righteous because he was able to receive the revelation for the word of that day and he could believe it and he could act upon him but cain's works were evil in his evil works amen it says why slew he his brother because his works were evil so it wasn't the slaying of his brother that was his evil works he had evil works before he slew his brother and what did cain do that was so evil i mean he worked really hard to give a sacrifice to god he planted he tilled he weeded he protected he built an altar he brought flowers he brought fruits he gave a beautiful offering his works his works if you put the works the labor the effort of cain against the labor and effort of abel cain's works far outweighed the works of abel his effort and the beauty and all that he put into his sacrifice far outweighed that of abel but in god's scale when he saw faith amen when he saw faith in the word for the hour god saw it this way amen and cain felt justified in his own actions and when god would not accept it instead of humbling himself and being judged he became angry with god and when god told him just to do like abel does he goes and he has a conversation with abel and after he has that conversation with abel he decided to kill abel and why did he kill abel because when there was a voice of god cable abel had the revelation he had the word he had the path back to god amen he knew what the atonement was he knew what needed to be judged he knew how to come to the judgment and when he had the revelation he was the voice of god to cain amen and cain could not endure that voice amen and he wanted to hide from the voice and the only way to hide from the voice was to stop the voice amen and to kill his brother because his own works were evil and that's why john says marvel not when the world hates you amen because you're testifying amen there's a path back to god and all these other paths are wrong amen they're a man's own doing man's own achievement man's own covering he is there's no atonement in it amen there's no covering but you have to come to the judgment to recognize what went wrong in the garden what's wrong with religion what was wrong with the church ages why we need a judgment today when you begin to become that voice of revelation amen now the voice is in you amen the voice of god is in the bride and it's the voice of god walking in the garden of his bride in the cool of the evening amen and it's testify your very life amen your very confession what by revelation you understand is testifying that the works of religion are evil what's evil feeding the poor feeding the poor is not evil going to church amen giving tithe supporting missionaries printing bibles it means what's evil is rejecting the judgment and the true atonement amen and not coming through the judgment in this hour to have your father make an atonement for you then feeling self-justified by your own works and your own covering those works are evil because those works do not bring you into the presence of god but that religious order keeps you from the presence of god because the presence of god would expose the religious order as false and so there's no denomination no religion that is out there bringing people to god they it's all inspired by cain who's of the wicked one and it is all in an effort to keep people from the presence of god you may think what i'm saying is extreme but it's the truth it is the truth because if it was bringing them to the presence of god it would destroy the very system that's supposed to be bringing them to the presence of god and no man is not going to allow his system to be destroyed so he'll protect his system and protecting his system he'll kill the voice when jesus came in jerusalem they were in the system they were part of the system they were entrenched in the system and in order to protect the system which gave them a false covering they would not come to a true atonement for their day they had a false covering amen but jesus was there he was the voice of god walking in the in the garden in the cool of the evening and he was there amen to bring them the voice of god and instead of running to god their religion had them running away from god and hiding from the presence of god until they could not resist that voice and they could not hide and when they heard that voice and they knew the presence of the lord was there they realized they were naked and instead of repentance they desired murder and when cain realized he was naked he desired murder over repentance praise god and the message now actually i want to i want to read another passage of scripture let's go back to genesis chapter 4. pick it up at verse 9. oh praise god the seals have been open the cover has been taken off this bride is not going to fall into the same trap [Music] because the seals have been open these things have been exposed chapter 4 verse 9 and the lord said unto cain where is abel thy brother and he said i know not am i my brother's keeper look at the rebellion in the face of god there is zero repentance zero remorse and the lord said unto cain where's the able thy brother and he said i i know not am i my brother's keeper and he said what hast thou done the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground and now art thou cursed from the earth which has opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand when thou tilted the ground and shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength a fugitive and a vagabond shall thou be in the earth and cain said unto the lord my punishment is greater than i can bear and now god finally comes with the judgment he refused god's judgment he refused god's way he even refused god's voice in the living vessel in that day and so now there's no recompense but god to bring judgment and god's judgment is righteous and cain is still disputing with god that god is not fair my my my look at the pride and arrogancy of cain with cain's worship and his religion he could in in cain's religious desire in cain's worship no matter how beautiful and religious and pious it was that that spirit within him that would make him worship in such a beautiful pious sacrificial way is the same spirit that will reject the word of god and call what is good evil and say it's not right and it's not fair like somebody in the denomination it's not fair that god has an elect who are you telling that it's not fair are you telling god it's not fair that he made a choice and that he chose it he made his election before the foundation of the world what do you mean the same spirit lives today amen when they come into the face of judgment amen and god begins to break down the word and say god has an elect in this day and he come for his elect he say that's not fair it's not fair that god would choose some come it's the same spirit that lives today it's a religious spirit he says now cain said unto the lord verse 13 my punishment is greater than i can bear behold thou has driven me out this day from the face of the earth and from thy face shall i be hid and i shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth and it shall come to pass that everyone that findeth me shall slay me now listen i just want to stop here for a second he is being sent out from the face of the earth in the face of god and he is not remorseful that he is going to be out of the presence of god from the face of god he is sad that somebody's going to kill him i tell you if i had to live without the presence of god i'd rather somebody kill me he was going to move into hell because there's no god in hell hell is uh opposite devoid of the face of god of the presence of god and he was going to move into his hell amen and he wanted to live there he wanted to preserve his life separate from the presence of god cain was not interested in pleasing god one drop amen he was not interested in a relationship with god all cain wanted to do was play please himself promote himself preserve himself and now he's sad because somebody's going to kill him everyone that finds me shall slay me and the lord said unto him therefore whosoever slayeth cain vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold and the lord set a mark upon cain lest any find him should kill him this is the first mark of the beast and cain went out from the presence of the lord and dwelt in the land of nod on the east of eden and came to his wife and she conceived and bear enoch and he builded a city and called the name of the city after the name of his son enoch oh there's so much there but we're gonna get into that later but he goes out and his whole desire was to preserve himself to promote himself so he goes out from the presence of the lord and he's fearful that somebody will slay him because he wants to perpetuate his life devoid of god and god puts a mark on him that nobody should kill him and he goes out and he takes a wife and he goes out and he has a son and he builds a city because cain is satisfied with a life outside the presence of god oh praise god brother said in the message take on the whole arm of god he said but hurry up these intellectual giants are too much for god's humble people god's people has always been uneducated and humble just tell me one time it was any other way watch the two sons watch cain and cess children abel was killed which was a type of death burial resurrection of christ seth took his place now cain's children become intellectual religious because their father was intellectual cain religious and cain built an altar able built an altar so you see now i want you to catch they they have gone out from the presence of god they are separate from the presence of god separated from the face of god which brings us presence but they are still just as religious the form of worship didn't change the bringing of a sacrifice the making of an altar the bringing of first fruits to you realize it didn't change they continued to be religious and they continued to worship because in the original cain desired to worship and he wanted to worship but i want to ask you a question was cain worshipping god or was cain worshipping himself who was cain pleasing with his worship they go out and they continue to worship just as like before they were intellectual they were religious is what he said he said it came build an altar abel built an altar cain made an offering abel made an offering cain worshipped abel worshipped and if god only respects a church its order its worship its offerings and so forth if that's all god respects he was unjust for condemning cain because he was just as religious as abel was but he didn't come the right way how about moab there was israel there was moab who worshiped the same god we do what was it it was lot's daughter's child and there they was they went out and brought bishop balaam in and he made seven altars just like they was down in israel now israel was an undenominational had no nation to go to but it was going to one amen here we have no continuing a city but we're seeking one to come watch balaam offered seven clean sacrifices bulldogs just like they had down in israel and balaam offered seven rams speaking of the coming of christ so did israel now there's a mirror image of worship taking place in moab under a prophet balaam and in israel under a prophet moses there's a mere reflection of worship in the sacrifices of seven rams but one is right and one is wrong praise god then if fundamentalism is all that god requires both places was justified but what was it what was it that balaam failed to see he failed to see that pillar of fire he failed to see the smitten rock that brass servant going before israel for an atonement israel had an atonement with their worship he failed to hear the shout out of the camp the king among them he judged him by their works god don't judge no one by their works judge you he judge you by your faith notice i want to clear that up about the little woman last night too it wasn't her works of washing his feet he justified her then before simon by saying what she had done he justified her by her works what she was doing but when he justified her in her own side he said thy faith have saved thee because no man is justified by works by her faith in him being the son of god not what she was doing but her faith in him and your faith always tells your works that's right i want to go back to genesis chapter 4. let's go all the way down to verse 25. and adam knew his wife again and she bear a son and called his name seth for god said she hath appointed me another seed instead of abel whom cain slew and to seth to him also was born a son and he called his name enos then began men to call upon the name of the lord i want to contrast this with cain when cain went out of the presence of the lord he took a wife he had a son he named his son enoch and then he built a city and he named the city after her son enoch seth goes out and takes a wife and has a son and a son named enos and after he has a son then began men to call upon the name of the lord so you have two lines here you have a the false vine and you have the righteous vine and these two vines begin all the way back here and genesis both of them worship both of them sacrifice both of them build altars both of them have religious ceremonies do you understand what i'm saying but cain amen was was perpetuating his own life in his own desire because he no longer was in the presence of god he was separated from the presence of god but he was satisfied to continue worship without the presence of god but seth now wasn't going to build a city he wasn't interested in self-preservation he wasn't interested in making a name for himself he wasn't interested in establishing himself because seth had one interest amen when his son was born this line had one interest and that interest was to call upon the name of the lord they wanted a relationship with god amen cain did not want a relationship with god cain wanted to perpetuate his own life and make his own name and establish himself as a mighty man upon the earth but seth in his lineage were calling what were they calling upon the name of the lord they were seeking his face they were looking for his presence they were trying to get back into fellowship with god amen they wanted to be in fellowship with god cain could care less if he was in fellowship with god because in order for him to come to fellowship with god he would have to get rid of all his own ideas and be judged so then began men to call upon the name of the lord proverbs 18 10 says the name of the lord is a strong tower the righteous runs into it and is safe and god's only provided places of worship he says and the name is in the word because he is the word i want to ask is there a righteous line here that's not interested in their own form of worship or they're perpetuating their own life upon the earth is there a line here that's not satisfied living a life void and separated from the presence of god but is there a line a righteous line a vine that's still on the earth today that's looking amen seeking after the name of the lord well he said his name is in the word because he is the word what is he then the word interpreted is the manifestation of the name of god if there's a line here amen that is calling on the name of the lord then they have to come to the word interpreted because the word interpreted in this day is the manifestation of that name that you're looking for because that name speaks of his presence it speaks of a person with a presence and that personal presence can come it's seeking restored fellowship it's seeking not just the name so that i can say the name jesus christ billions can say the name jesus christ but i'm looking for the person of that name i'm looking for the presence of that person here and where will i find that name that name is in the word and the word interpreted is a manifestation of that name and if i'm calling on the name of the lord i better find where the word is interpreted no wonder flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my father which is in heaven has revealed this to you who i am and upon this rock i'll build my place of worship and the gates of hell can't shake it down amen a living church of god standing firm and firm foundation on jesus christ alone you can sing the song but if you're not on christ the word you're on teetering faltering sand but upon this rock christ my word and the message the conflict between god and satan to satan had has his system of work again to get people to misbelieve the word of god satan's wrong way of worship like cain and like balaam they're very religious cain was religious he brought an altar made an altar frankly cain was more religious than abel that should make you feel good because you'll never out do a real sincere catholic in one of these third world countries who really do it all right cain was more religious than abel sure was he done more for the lord than abel did but abel came in the way of the word that's all he done more he built a great denomination he built a great thing a great christian heritage but you see he come in the wrong way it wasn't received now wrong for it was contrary to the word balaam was just as religious as moses he came with the same sacrifice the same lambs the same clean animals everything and prayed to the same god and offered sacrifice to the same god that moses did though he came in the wrong way see it was contrary to the word like it was in eden then when we get to the message the indictment he says that's the only place he meets with man today is under the shed blood of the sacrifice i don't care if you're methodist baptist presbyterian if you can forget your differences roman catholic whatever you might be and will come under the shed blood god will meet with both of us there that's where we can all meet and fellowship on the same grounds but otherwise he will not meet just because you're a methodist he will not meet just because you're a pentecostal he will meet with you under one condition that's under the shed blood when your sins has been confessed and expelled in his presence then by the blood and the blood is always before him and therefore he only can see you through that shed blood and your white as snow see when you confess your sins otherwise you're not there you cannot fellowship that's the reason that you don't see things happening in the churches they confess that they believe the blood they reject the very plan to get to the blood the word think about this brother i'm saying you have to come whether your method is catholic presbyterian pentecost it doesn't matter you've got to come under the shed blood of the lamb the shed blood of the sacrifice to have fellowship again amen but he says they confess that they believe the blood but they reject the very plan to get to the blood which is the word so how do you get to the blood through the word and the word is his name amen is the manifest the word interpreted is the manifestation of his name let's go to revelation 19. i want to read one more scripture revelation 19 and 11 revelation 19 11 and i saw heaven opened and behold a white horse and he that sat upon him was called faithful and true and in righteousness he does judge and make war his eyes was a flame of fire and on his head were many crowns and he had a name written that no man knew but he himself and he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood and his name is called the word of god if you're seeking his name his name is in his word because when the word came when the word was restored our bridegroom came the revealed word his presence is here his name is here in the revealed word and under that revealed word is also the atonement the shed blood in the message the invisible union of the bride of christ he says what is sin sin is unbelief unbelief in what the word unbelief in god which is the word pure unadulterated oh hallelujah leaving soon for the skies amen standing ready think your garments washed by the water of the bleeding word we've come to the atonement how have we come to the atonement because we waited for revelation of who he is in this hour by the revelation of god we see him as he is in this day and he is the word that has been restored and that word has come and judged every other system false and when the when the word came the life was here amen the blood life was here the life that was in the blood and now we're washed listen friends we're washed there's an atonement being made when we come in the right form of worship when we come by revelation amen to be judged so that we can be restored in fellowship with god when we only desire to please him we come by the word and then when we desire to be restored in fellowship we come by the word when we desire to seek his name we come by the word when we seek his face we come by the word because he is the word it was the word that was made flesh it was the word that bled it was the word that died amen and now we're washed in the bleeding word washed by the water of the bleeding word the word became blood the word bled for you and you are washed in bleeding word the word bleeding the life of god in the word and the word was bled for you that you might be washed from the filth of these prostitutes and be cleansed and sanctified by the washing of water of the word and makes your mind and heart stayed on god and on his word and he anoint the ones at the end time he says where the carcass is the eagles will gather eagles the fresh kill of the word the word that's raised up in fat and been made manifest and give out to the food for the children i want to end with this quote brahm said in the message the god of this evil age said notice what he will do his thoughts he thought god dwelled in worldly beauty he did that in heaven sin never began in the garden of eden it began in heaven when lucifer the son of the morning exalted himself in beauty and wanted a more beautiful kingdom than that of michael and he thought that god dwelt in beauty and noticed cain he he didn't want no blood sacrifice he come down and offered the fruit or the fields of beauty upon his altar very religious done everything just exactly like abel done offered a sacrifice fell down before god in worship obedient in every way but without the revelation of the word and the word was from the beginning god's plan god's plan of what god's plan of redemption god's plan to restore fellowship the word was god's plan from the beginning and today god's plan is his word and the way to seek his name the way to find him is in the word amen and the way to be atoned for is to come by the way of the revealed word and be washed in the bleeding word the fresh kill today the fountain that is flowing today the atonement that is today amen friends everybody's thinking they're getting people to the blood but they've rejected the path to the blood and they rejected the word how are they getting people to the fresh kill today how are they getting them to the bleeding word the fountain that's open and bleeding today when you very reject the word and by religion move people away in fear from the word the religious order of the day in religion the spirit of religion is to keep man from god and to keep from restoring the relationship but god sent a prophet in this day amen to judge the entire system to judge the religious order the judge what came from cain has been perpetuated through the whole earth and now has taken over the whole earth god came to judge that by opening his word by opening the seals and revealed the whole thing and what did they do when they heard the voice say man did they run to it and fall in repentance and find a fresh atonement for this day no they shut the doors to it they pushed it out they rejected it amen they killed the voice by killing the influence of the messenger so that they could have their religion and the religion would keep them from coming to god's judgment and if they don't come to god's judgment they don't come to restore fellowship so the religion was there to prevent fellowship with god telling people this is the way to god but there's a voice in his bride today that's saying there's a fresh atonement there's a bleeding word there's a place to come and worship that has an atonement not dead forms of religion not old orders pointing back to another day but there's a path to get to the blood today and the path to the blood today is the revealed word of the hour every other way has shut their doors to him but there is a way and that way is through the word the word was from the beginning god's plan but god revealed by revelation the very thing that he vindicated and punctuated that was right not religion not an altar not belonging to church not making a sacrifice not being sincere but by the revelation of the word of god abel by faith revelation offered a more excellent sacrifice and by it he was declared righteous not a religion not an altar not belonging to church not making a sacrifice not being sincere but by the revelation of the word of god brings you into god's plan and in god's plan there is a sacrifice there is an atonement there is a restoration of fellowship with the father the question is is seth's line here is the vine that come from seth is it here those that are calling on the name of the lord not a religion not a sacrifice not even a sincerity but by revelation of the word of god there's a way back there's a restoration through the blood there's an atonement that'll bring us back into fellowship with god because the whole purpose was to bring us back in fellowship with god what the devil has been fighting from cain's time all the way down through he's been fighting a restoration back to fellowship with god and how does he fight the restoration of fellowship back to god he fights it with religion he doesn't fight it with the bar and the prostitute he fights the restoration of the children of god the attributes of god back to restoration with their father he fights it with religion it's time to shake off the religion and come back to the relationship and let's all stand musicians if you could come listen without faith it's impossible to please god faith and want faith in something that was done ages and ages and ages ago are faith in the god who's present today i say it's faith in the god who's present today and the word that's revealed today without that revelation it's impossible to please god all of our works and all of our efforts will not please him he can only be pleased when by faith we come to him praise god i tell you friends the voice of god today does the same thing it's always done it makes you naked if you're stuck in religion you could be stuck in religion in this church don't put it don't put it off on a pentecostal you could be stuck in a religious order by dressing right and believing god sent a prophet you could be in religion right here tonight but you know what the voice of god does it makes your religion nakedness and when our religion becomes nakedness amen that's a good thing not a bad things friends and don't don't look at that as a bad thing but when there's a minister at the pulpit that will start to strip away amen feeling safe because i grew up in the message feeling safe because i believe god sent a prophet i'm only safe when i've come through the revealed word and i've come to the fresh blood the bleeding word and i can only come by revelation in this hour and when i've been united back to god that's my only place of security it's not in coming to the right church sitting under the right ministry paying tithes keeping the orders not cutting hair wearing dresses you can do all of that you can sit in this pew every day of your life and be lost as lost can be but there's only one path back and that's by revelation of the word now revelation of the word will bring us amen into that bleeding bloody word amen the fresh blood for today that'll wash away our sins everything else will fail all the efforts will fail and all the making it to church every time the doors are open and always paying my tithe and confessing that god sent a prophet without the revelation of the word that restores you into fellowship through judgment you're lost there's no there's no grandchildren our great-grandchildren there's only children who just want to get back in fellowship with god there's just there's no more orders and there's no more religion and there's no more correct churches and correct this and there's only one thing there's got to be a people on the earth that are calling on the name of the lord there's got to be a people that are seeking if it strips me naked if it takes my fig leaves and punches holes through them and i have to stand naked in the presence of god amen he's got a clothing that he can clothe me with amen there is a covering for my sin there is a blood that will wash me white as snow and there's a wedding garment of the word that he can place upon me to cover my shame but i've got to come god's provided way and that's by personal individual revelation of who jesus christ is and he is the word and he is the word made manifest today it's the only place of security friends religion is here to prevent you from getting close to god but god's voice is bidding you come forget your fig leaf forget your church orders forget you're always doing it right and just come to the voice and let the voice cleanse you and let the revelation wash you white as snow let the word purify you and then let the word clothe you and then let the word present you to your mate and then be united to him forevermore that is salvation today [Music] amen let's just pray lord jesus we thank you father for your word god it means more to us than our lives god if we had to go without your presence we wouldn't want to live if we had to go and build great cities and live great lives but had to walk away from your presence we would rather die but god what we want is to call upon your name god forgive us for our religious notions forgive us for our fig leaves our own coverings let us by faith walk closer to you lord god you have made a way you have opened the door in this day your calling lord your voice is still calling i pray god that we could run to you and fall at your feet and ask all that you would wash us and cleanse us clothe us lord clothe us in that word and present us to yourself and unite with us lord that's our only desire let every other thing fade away let there be nothing between you and us lord let there be no religious ideas of our own no notions of our own none of our own thinking lord just pierce it lord with your word shred it lord let us be bare before you no more ideas no more self-righteousness through works just shred it now lord and give us a fresh revelation of who you are in this hour give us eye salve to see lord that we might come into your presence that we might be united with you or we might be cleansed by your blood have your way with us lord wash us cleanse us then use us lord for your glory we humbly come to you lord and thank you for what you've done in this hour we thank you for exposing the whole plan giving us this word lord by revelation that we could see the devil's tactics and not get caught in them lord lord open our eyes to see that we wouldn't fall into the same traps of our forefathers but may we walk lord true to you in every way we ask you bless us as we go from here watch over us keep us in your word lord keep us washed by the water of your word in jesus christ's name we pray amen god bless you i just ask that you pray for me there's much much much
