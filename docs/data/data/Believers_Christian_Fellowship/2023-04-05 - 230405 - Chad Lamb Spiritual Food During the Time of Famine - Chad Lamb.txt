the renewing of our minds well we love you we ask that you would take your place Among Us at the head of the table Lord and may you feed your sheep now we love you we ask these things in Jesus Christ's name amen God bless you we're going to have you have your seats for just a moment thank you musicians I want to just share with you a quick testimony first I want to say brother Samuel if I walk left this Tuesday and he left with his back in his hand amen but his back didn't show up until two o'clock in the morning yesterday so it barely made it in time and it was quite an ordeal he had quite a time getting here but I thoroughly enjoyed the service on Sunday I was really blessed our brother really suffered Amen to bring that to us but the Lord was gracious and good and he fed us and so about two o'clock in the morning he got his luggage and he flew out in the middle of the day and he arrived safely in Phoenix he's going to be preaching tonight in Phoenix and then he's going up to flying into Seattle he's going to be preaching for brother um brother John there so for the Easter meetings so keep him in prayer until he gets back home I also want to share with you a testimony from yesterday I got a call Sunday evening from Levi Yoder and Levi told me that asked if we would if I'd be interested in going with him down to the group in Junction City we've mentioned this group before the the there are ex-amish group that have left the Amish Church they've been gathering together for a little while and I asked Levi more details on the group and he told me that the man who's leading the group right now he showed up in brother Levi's driveway one day and he would been up in the Holmes County area visiting family and they had told him about an ex-amished man who had this this doctrine of this teaching about William Branham and and that he's a spiritual brother and all of that so he wanted to come over and and talk to Levi so he showed up in Levi's driveway and Levi walked up to the man and gave him a hug and they started talking and from that point on leave I started visiting them started sharing the message with them and that's only been about six months ago amen and so they they've got quite a uh a story they got in contact well with Levi Levi's been sharing uh taking people to visit them for just a little bit and they got in contact with Jesse Smith from Akron the pastor in Akron uh just about four weeks ago and brother Jesse went and preached to them about water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and they really enjoyed that and then the week after I believe it was brother Burley was in town if you remember that and he was preaching for a group of Believers down in Columbus and a group of them came over to the meeting and thoroughly enjoyed the service and brother Burley told me he said brother Chad that group is hungry for the word and so then uh brother Jesse Smith went back this past Sunday and he preached to them again and afterwards they opened the floor for questions and answers about baptism and at the end of that they decided they all wanted to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and set it up for last night for Tuesday evening so they had no baptismal tank they had nothing so Levi has the horse trough that he was baptized in and that we baptized hardly in a little more than a week ago so he asked if we would come so I asked Brother Kyle to go with me so we went over to Levi's house two hours and 20 30 minutes picked up Levi and his family and the horse trough baptismal tank and drove two hours south to Junction City and then brother Jesse Smith came over and conducted the baptism and by the grace of God we witnessed the baptism of 17 Souls amen so it was it was amazing to see it was really quite a blessing we'd gotten there early and we were visiting with several of the folks there and Levi had got a call the day before I believe yeah on Monday he got a call Monday one of the sisters in this group she had a brother her flesh brother lived in Tennessee and she started testifying to him about water baptism he wanted to know more she gave him Levi's number Levi talked with him for quite a while on Monday and at the end of that conversation that man decided he was going to get baptized and on Tuesday he drove nine hours from Tennessee to come and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so we got to meet him his name is brother Samuel we got to meet him and talk with him for a while amen and and then afterwards we had quite a lengthy fellowship and it was amazing because me and Kyle were split up we were on opposite ends of the yard outside and Levi was somewhere else and they were so hungry everywhere you looked there was groups of these new Believers pulling all that they could out of us amen and I had the best time I enjoyed it so much and I just pray you keep praying for them amen they they they're just beginning but I was speaking to the man who's head of the group and we were sitting there fellowshipping and we were talking he asked me my testimony and I shared with him briefly the testimony and we were talking about the church ages book and and he testified that that was his favorite book amen and he's reading that book and and later he told me he goes I don't know how anybody can argue with anything in that book it's all the word and it's all true and after I heard that I thought he's fine I mean this brother's going to be fine there's no problem here so it was really really exciting and we were able to carry down some more books and and material for them and I just want to let you know that we've we've been able to put in the hands of brother Levi who's in turn put in the hands of many many different people Church age books seven sealed book The volume one of the Supernatural series the life story brother Branham resume of the Aegis track our books uh baptismal tracks and some tablets the tablets that have all the message on it and everything on it and all the material that brother Franco could find in German because many of them are German speaking also a German Bible and German messages and we've been able to hand out a lot of those tablets as well and all of that comes from the general fund from the contributions of the Saints here so I'm going to say God bless you and thank you it was exciting to see them taking Church age books and seal books and baptismal tracks and and that take home we met we met one man from Minnesota from northern Minnesota he was just there visiting some Believers some Believers in Indiana who had come over to witness the baptism and he took a tablet he took at least one Church ages book a seals book and something else and he was going to take it all back home and share it with his whole family he was so excited about what he heard I say praise God Amen God's doing something and I'm just excited to see what God is doing amen so keep them in prayer they've asked if both Kyle or I at different times would be willing to go down and Minister for them and we both agreed we would love to go help them in any way we could so just keep them in your prayers and just pray that God will continue to move them down the path amen they've got an excellent start amen and we thank God for that so amen let's just go ahead and stand and we're going to turn to the scripture and turn to the word we want to say God bless you brother Paul and sister Nora Jean it's good to have you here all the way from New Brunswick so I hear you're going to get to visit with us for several weeks so praise God that's good also brother Aaron Lau has his brother and sister-in-law here God bless you they're visiting from Arizona and so we look forward to shaking your hand and seeing you as well amen let's turn to the Book of Amos and we'll begin in Amos chapter 8. God bless you brother Emmanuel it's good to have you back I forgot to let the church know my brother Emmanuel was gone this past Sunday preaching for brother Nathaniel syoss up there and so God bless you it's good to have you back in the service brother amen Amos chapter 8 verse 11. Amos 8 11. behold the days come saith the Lord God that I will send a famine in the land not a famine of bread nor a thirst for water but of hearing the words of the Lord amen God bless us as we look into his word you can have your seeds amen I would like to take just for a subject tonight spiritual food during during the time of famine spiritual food during the time of famine in Amos here he's promised a famine but not a famine a food or drink but a famine of hearing the word of God and I would say the world is in this famine this is the condition that the world is in this is the condition laodicea is in it's in darkness amen it's in famine it's in a desert place but praise God there is spiritual food during the time of famine you just have to know where to find it amen let's turn to Mark chapter 6. we want to look at several scriptures here as we move into this subject Mark chapter 6. and we don't intend to preach anything new or anything we haven't heard before but to remind us of the things that are so dear to us amen because we need to be constantly reminded in the world that we live in because the world is trying to suck our time and attention and we have to remember we have to constantly be reminded of what the Wiles of the devil are and and what we've been given and what will help us to overcome this world Amen and so let's look at Mark chapter 6 verse 34. and Jesus when he came out saw much people and was moved with compassion toward them because they were a sheep not having a shepherd and he began to teach them many things and when the day was now far spent his disciples came unto him and said this is a desert place so they're now in a desert place this is a place of of no food no physical food this is a desert place and now the time has far past send them away that they may go into the country round about and into the villages and buy themselves bread for they have nothing to eat and he answered and said unto them give ye them to eat now now they're looking at the situation we're in a desert place there's no physical food here and and they say the time is far spent send them away let them go fend for themselves and go find whatever they can find to eat and Jesus says don't do that you feed them amen you give them to eat and let's pick this up read this again in verse 37 and the answer is said unto them give you them to eat and they said unto them shall we go and buy 200 penny worth of bread and give them to eat and he says unto them how many loaves have you go and see and when they knew they saved five and two fishes and he commanded them to sit he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the Green Grass and they sat down in ranks by hundreds and by 50s and when he had taken the Five Loaves and the two fishes he looked up to heaven and blessed and break the Loaves and gave them to his disciples to set before them and the two fishes divided he among them all and they did all eat and were filled and they took up 12 baskets full of the fragments and of the fishes and they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men so here we see a situation where there's no there's no food Amen in the disciples solution is send them out to go find whatever they can but Jesus had compassion on them and he said no you feed them and how are we going to do this where will we buy shall we get a hundred penny worth which still would not have been sufficient and Jesus says what do you have amen quit looking all around quit scattering whatever you have is sufficient amen whatever you have amen Jesus knew that whatever they had he could multiply they found the the insufficiency of Five Loaves and two fishes brother remember says it was a lad was carrying it it was a little boy's lunch it was insufficient for 5 000 men besides women and children amen but Jesus wasn't looking at the insufficiency amen he was looking at the possibility so now they brought to him the Five Loaves and two fishes and he began to break amen and break and break and he took what little they had and in the hands of Jesus he multiplied it amen but what's amazing to me is when Jesus broke the bread and multiplied the bread amen he didn't give it to the people but he gave it to the disciples to give to the people and here he's setting his order amen Jesus is already setting his order that he's breaking the bread and the fishes and he's giving it to the disciples and the disciples are giving it out to the people amen and if when that when everybody came in order he said set them down by 50s and by hundreds and they sat down by 50s and by hundreds and he broke and gave to the disciples and disciples carried to the people and when everybody came into order they all ate till they were full and there was more than enough so we went from not enough to more than enough amen because Jesus orchestrated the order and all they had to do was do what he said amen and stay where he told them to stay and received the way he told him to receive and there was more than enough so the desert Place had plenty of food amen we're in a desert place when we talk about the condition of the world we talk about the laodicean condition and the condition of the religions of the world Amen it's a desert Place amen but when we come according to what God has taught us and we come in obedient to what God has taught us and we subject ourselves to God's order amen there's more than enough amen he can take what little bit we think we have and he can always multiply it to meet the need more abundantly not just enough but more than enough amen I mean if we want we can to believe in a god who's just enough amen but I believe in a god who's more than enough more than enough when we look at Matthew chapter 4 if we can turn over there to Matthew chapter 4. Matthew chapter 4 verse 4. Jesus says but he answered and said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God so now we find in this time of spiritual famine it's not a piece of bread we're looking for but it's the word amen that's what we live by every word that proceedeth out on the mouth of God what is this Famine of it's a famine of hearing the word of God what do we live by amen every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God what must we be feeding on the word of God amen let's turn with us turn with me to First Kings we're going to go to just a couple quick places in the life of Elijah First Kings 17. and 1. First Kings 17 and 1. and Elijah the tisspite who was of the inhabitants of Gilead sent unto Ahab as the Lord God of Israel liveth before whom I stand there shall not be do nor Reign these years but according to my word and the word of the Lord came unto him saying get thee hints and turn Eastward and hide thyself book by the Brook cherith that is before Jordan and it shall be that thou shalt drink of the Brook and I have commanded the Ravens to feed thee there so he went and did according according to the word of the Lord for he went and dwelt by the Brook cherith and that is before Jordan and the Ravens brought him bread and fish in the morning and bread and fish in the evening and he drank of the brook it man it's amazing that Elijah begins to speak a curse upon the Earth and when he speaks the curse the curse is going to be a drought that would bring famine but Elijah himself by the very word he gives is going to subject himself to the curse amen and he'll speak the word of God and take his stand and bring a judgment not yet knowing how he's going to save himself amen you've got such confidence in God he can come inspired and anointed by the spirit of God Amen and he can speak the word of God and bring the Judgment down and the Judgment was going to cut off the resources the natural resources no rain amen which will bring a famine but he himself now has no food amen but God's going to take care of his servants amen I think it's amazing that a lion didn't seek the provision before he spoke the word he spoke the word and trusted God for the provision he didn't know how he would eat for three and a half years he didn't have a stockpile of food somewhere we can tell by the scriptures he didn't make any preparation amen he just must speak the word and trust God that God has a plan amen and God hadn't yet revealed the plan to him he just went as far as he could and had to wait for God to reveal the rest praise God you know we try so hard to solve the equation before we enter in amen we try so hard to know the answer before we get started what will happen if I do this what will happen if I make this decision what will happen amen and all of a sudden we realize that we're being led intellectually and not spiritually into the things of God sometimes God will lead you to the first step and you have no idea where you're going to wind up but you know this is God leading me here and if God leads you here then he'll provide the provision that you need I mean think about Elijah calling for no rain for three and a half years and he didn't even have enough foresight to lay up three and a half years worth of food he just went by inspiration and God took care of the rest praise God I think sometimes we're we're too intellectual so God help me not to try to have everything spelled out when I know to do something God give me the faith just to move forward trusting you to work it all out so now he says in the in the scripture God comes to Elijah and says go hide thee Myself by the Brook cherith that is before Jordan and that shall be that thou shall drink of the Brook and I have commanded the Ravens to feed thee there there God didn't tell the Ravens to follow him all over wherever he felt like going he told him I have commanded the Ravens to feed you there the Ravens will find you there the Ravens will feed you there but you've got to be there I've made a provision for you but until you get there you don't get anything to eat I've got I've got I've got Birds amen that I have commissioned to feed you but I've commissioned them to feed you there not everywhere amen I tell you remember when brother Abraham Myra he preached the message on this and he talked to he typed the Ravens with the fightful ministry you remember that in the faithful Ministry amen we're our commissioned to bring the food just like the disciples amen were commissioned to take the broken bread and distribute it among those that were sitting there in groups of 50 and groups of a hundred amen if you wanted the food you had to get it from the disciples who got it from Christ and now if Elijah wanted the food he had to go to the appointed place that God told him and wait there for God's provided way and God's provided way was the Ravens amen amen wait what was I thought was so amusing is when brother Abraham preached as he typed him the faithful mystery of the Ravens and he talked about how God could use such a bird to do such a work because a raven amen a raven in the Bible is always a got a bad connotation with it amen it was the Raven who could feed on the dead of caring and the floods of Noah and not return but the dove couldn't do that amen amen but the Raven the raven could feed on the wheat and the raven could feed on the dead carcasses remember brother I'm talking about this why would God use such a bird it wasn't for Elijah to question God but to receive what God had provided and when you look at oh my goodness when you look at the foolishness of preaching that's what the scripture is called the foolishness of preaching that God would use somebody born sin born in flesh capable mistakes and making them all the time you know God doesn't use somebody who already came to Perfection to preach the gospel God uses a human being exactly like the human being sitting in the sea one identical to that is the one standing behind the pool but there's no difference whatsoever no difference in the mistakes no difference in the wrong thinking no difference and there's no there's no difference whatsoever amen between the one standing here and the one sitting there there's no difference the only difference is a calling of God and a positional placement by God himself so so you know so many people they just want everything pure and everything clean and no possibility to mistake I won't eat unless a dove brings it can you imagine Elijah when the Raven shows up and it's a it's a raven God couldn't you why not a dove even a turtle dove or a pigeon it doesn't even have to be a snow white though just why not a dove God says I commanded the Ravens to feed you there you know there's so so many things that sound good intellectually like I I don't want to listen to preachers because preachers get it wrong I want to go I want the Holy Ghost just to tell me I only want the dove I don't want any Raven to give me any food I only want the dove I only want the best I don't want anything listen what did God tell us in this day amen he told us he told us in his word and he told us and confirmed it through the prophet that God wants to feed his children amen he wants to feed you there where you're sitting now he wants to feed you there coming into the house of the God and the fellowship it's a place that God's called us to be and God may use an ugly bird and God may use something that's not perfect and something that maybe you know we're all sin born we're all in hybrid flesh we all have a sticky cockle burn nature that's going to trip us up we're all in the same boat amen you know none of us are perfect but I we can't help it this is what God Said too we can't change God's word this is what God Said I will commanded that that that ugly that that Fallen that that that that one with the ability to fall with just as much mistakes and complexes as you've had I'm calling him to give you that food you either take it or you don't and you can starve to death waiting on a dove or will come God's appointed way and the received from God remember brother Benham said he was taking Sam they were taking sandwiches off the king's table there was nothing wrong with the food it was the bird that wasn't so great but the food was good so you don't have to love the bird right you don't have to think the bird's perfect you don't have to think the bird is is excellent in every way the issue is where did they get the sandwich amen where did it come from if it came from the king's table I want to eat it amen I want to receive it means the quality of the food that he received not the quality of the carrier praise God so I will feed you there so in a time of famine God had an appointed place and an appointed way and in this time of Phantom and God has an appointed place and God has an appointed way and the message spiritual food and due season the prophet said Elijah had a secret place provided by God himself now the church never provided it for him the king never provided it for him he didn't provide himself but God provided a secret place for Elijah to be fed all the time during the drought where his food was provided day by day he didn't need to wonder what's going to happen tomorrow or wonder if the supply run out God said I have commanded the Ravens and they'll feed you what a wonderful thing a type of our secret place in Christ God's provided a secret place in this day in him amen and he's constantly feeding us but we don't have to worry about whether he'll feed us tomorrow or if the Ravens will show back up because God commanded the Ravens to feed you there as long as you're there God will feed you there as long as we come in obedience to what God Said the word says forsake not the sibling together of yourselves even the more so as you see the evil day approaching amen and God told us that the fivefold ministry are here to bring the body into Perfection amen amen they may not be the best looking birds amen they may not be the most desirable amen but they are God's provided way amen and so God if we'll stay in his position God will be faithful to feed us we don't have to worry about what will happen next and what will happen will they will the Raven show up amen today and you know I don't believe that Elijah amen was was saving half of his sandwich in a little crack in a rock somewhere in case the Raven didn't come back in the evening because God said I will send them in the morning and I will send them again in the evening time amen and and every day morning and evening they Faithfully came according to the word of God Amen he didn't have any other provision and no way to provide for himself he was trusting God to keep his word I believe we can trust God to keep his word Amen brother Benham said the hardest thing that God has ever got to do or had to do was to get one mortal to believe another you believe anything almost but one person believing another that's a hard thing we'll believe in all kinds of conspiracy theories and wild ideas but just to believe that God's using that man and that's God's provided away that's pretty tough sometimes amen so the prophet said that's the hardest thing God has ever got to do but God chose to use man so we have to come cause provided way brother man he tells us in taking sides with Jesus in 1962 says now you remember what that dream that I got the interpretation was go back and store up the food mother Brenham had a dream and and in the dream he was going to go overseas he was going to take a boat and there was two boatmen in the boat and there was a little white canoe he could take and it was fast and he can but but he he in the dream he was realizing amen that he had meetings over across the ocean and that little boat wouldn't make it it's good for going up and down the coast if he does a local meeting that's good but not for going clear across the ocean and he says go like them to two boatmen they were just two friends and they were packed in camping gear like they were going on a trip and he was invited to go to Switzerland as a tourist and take one meeting that's what the little boat represented and God told him not to do it but stay and store up the food amen store up the food so brother Branham was not to go overseas at that time there in 1962 but he was going to stay amen and brother Brahm said we made a whole bunch of tapes Amen on all kinds of teaching so this is the dream that he's referring to go back and store with the food where was The Storehouse this Tabernacle where is there anything like it in the country around here anywhere that will compare with the message that we have where would you go to find it shows it's show its comparison anywhere you go right out in denominational Creeds you'll go right away from the name of the Lord Jesus you'll go right out away from these other things and here is where the food has been stored up well one message that I preached here to you all look I've preached from one to six hours to you on a message well if I had to use one of those messages it would take a week to take it just a little bit here and a little bit there see because it's been stored up here he's saying if he preached if he preached a six-hour message which was spoken word as the Original Seed out in the meetings at 45 minutes before he would have a prayer line he goes I'd preach a little bit here a little bit there but he came home and he preached in the full length it's on tapes it'll go worldwide on those tapes where the people in their houses them tapes will fall right into the hands of the predestinated of God he can direct the word he'll direct everything just exactly to its course that's the reason he sent me back to do this store up the food here he forbid me to go overseas so brother Venom was saying we've stored up the food amen and I want to pay attention to this because the food was stored up because it would be needed later this is really important to catch there's a reason it was stored up in John 6 35 Jesus says I am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never thirst so this bread that we have need of is Jesus Christ amen and man shall not live by bread alone but every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God and Jesus Christ is the word amen so we know what this word what was brother Benham storing up he wasn't storing up tapes he was storing up the revelation of Jesus Christ the word for this hour he comes to the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed and this message he says and once just a while ago when you showed the vision the little Tabernacle here are about to store up the food that there would come a time when this would all be needed store up the food because there will come a time when all of this will be needed when we seen brother softman and brother Woods ready to cross over into the country but you said store up this food here for the time lord reverently I've tried to do that then that was paragraph five he drops down the paragraph 90 in the same message help this morning Lord as we read the word May the Holy Spirit reveal it to us that the church might be fully established in the faith that was once delivered to the Saints to hold them and may as you've gave the vision some two years ago to store up the food fine healthy looking vegetables that I saw in the vision being stored here in the Tabernacle may we today receive a whole barrel full of that amen Granite Lord or a tape load so A Bear full is a tape load a tape load is a barrel full may we may we today receive a whole barrel full what's he preaching Christ is the mystery of God revealed what's he doing he's still storing up food he said for the there would come a time when this would be needed I believe we're in the time so may we receive a whole Bear full of it Granite Lord or a tape load that it might reveal Jesus Christ to us in the hour that we live to give a sustaining strength the spiritual strength for the task that lays ahead granted father praise God so Christ is the mystery of God revealed it was a barrel full of stored up food let's look here again at First Kings 17. let's look at chapter 17 verse 8. I'm sorry I want to begin at verse 7. and it came to pass after a while that the brook dried up because there had been no rain in the land so God had told Elijah you go to this Brook and you stay there and I will feed you there and God was faithful but all of a sudden the brook dried up and you say is God unfaithful to his word no God is faithful as ever before but God has a widow woman who needs something amen so now he's going to bring Elijah in contact with this woman so that she can have her provision so God is just moving God is just moving Elijah amen and there's something else I want to see in this so many times we hit obstacles in our life and when we hit those obstacles we begin to doubt who we are and what God told us and God's provision and all of a sudden we may hit a financial obstacle or work-related obstacle a health obstacle a family or whatever we hit some obstacle in life and immediately we start to question everything am I a Son of God where have I failed what's wrong with my life did I miss the mark somewhere and we start this whole list of questions and the funny thing is we do it every single time all right and there's nothing wrong with reflecting on our lives we should do that but we begin to down and you know what when the provisions were all coming in we didn't doubt our sonship we didn't doubt God's provision we didn't doubt all of a sudden something changes nothing changed with God's attitude towards Elijah Elijah had done nothing wrong what it was was God was repositioning Elijah for another work amen and sometimes things happen in our lives all it is is God repositioning us let him reposition us amen let him prove himself Mighty on our behalf sometimes God wants us to make a change make a move make a decision you know allow things to happen so that we quit sitting I mean comfortably moving doing nothing he brings something in our lives to reposition us don't be afraid of the repositioning it doesn't mean God changed his mind about us praise God is good so now the brook dried up not because God was no longer faithful to his word but because God was very faithful to all of his people verse 8 and the word of the Lord came unto them saying arise get thee desireaphath which belong with design and dwell there behold I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee he's going into Gentile territory now so he arose and went to Zarephath and when he came to the gate of the city behold the widow woman was there Gathering of sticks and he called to her and said fetch me I pray thee a little water and a vessel that I may drink and as she was going to fetch it he called to her and said bring me I pray the immortal of bread in thy hand and she said as the Lord thy God liveth I have not a cake but a handful of meal in a barrel and a little oil in a cruise and behold I am Gathering two sticks that I may go in and dress it for me and my son that we may eat it and die look at that wording she didn't say that we'll eat it and live she had run out of Christ she had run out of the word the denominational system has run out of Christ they have run out of the word there is no more word to sustain amen them and and she's going to make a cake she has just a little bit left Amen to go and make a cake and die not to make a cake and live she has come in this time of famine she has come to the end of everything but that's when she's introduced to the Elijah Ministry praise God [Music] so she says now that we may eat it and die verse 13 and Elijah said unto her fear not go and do as thou has said but make me thereof a little cake first and bring it unto me and after make for thee and for thy son for thus saith the Lord God of Israel the barrel of meal shall not waste neither shall the crews of oil fail until the day that the Lord sendeth rain upon the Earth and she went and did according to the saying of Elijah and she and he in her house did eat many days and the barrel of meal wasted not neither did the crews of oil fail according to the word of the Lord which he spake by Elijah praise God brother bam says in the message be certain of God he says see he had to catch her attention he said would you fetch me a little water and she said I will and as she turned and started he said and just bring me a little morsel of bread in your hand Elijah's seeing that Vision already know what the condition was and she said as the Lord liveth Elijah knew she was a Christian then a Believer as the Lord liveth I've only got just a handful of me on a spoonful of oil that I've already prepared I've dressed it got it ready and I'm taking those two sticks to make a little cake for my son and I and we are going to eat it and die see now here comes a great lesson but Elijah said bake me one first oh what is that there what lesson do we learn seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness bake me one first and she looked she said I wonder who that is there's something about the man that seems to be different and he said make me one first and bring it and she started in to do what he said then she heard that comforting word that always Comforts for thus saith the Lord the bearer will not be empty nor the crews run dry until the day that God sends rain on the Earth amen here she is she's got just enough meal Christ and just enough oil Spirit to bake a cake to die but when she comes in contact with the Elijah Ministry amen he says bake me one first and if you put the kingdom of God first amen sometimes so many people are afraid Amen to take God's provided way because they're afraid of what they'll lose this woman had nothing to lose and I'm telling you if you're in a denominational system you've got nothing to lose because you have nothing you're starving to death you have no you have no food for overcoming you have no power to resist the Wiles of the devil you have not enough Spirit to overcome the world and to live a holy Christian Life you've got nothing to lose in listening to the voice of Elijah but everything to gain amen instead of eating one more bite to die amen why not giving up the last little bit of what you think you have amen what you have spiritually what you have in faith amen and give it over to the Elijah Ministry so that in doing so amen that Ministry by a prophecy can provide unto you enough to sustain all the way through the rest of this drought and bring you all the way into the rain falls in the millennial reign of Christ and bring you into a Bountiful Harvest and until that time amen there's a promise if we will give what little bit we have amen what faith we have in Christ what little bit of the word we know and give it over to the Elijah Ministry amen we will have food that will sustain us all the way through to the catching away of the Bride amen what did she lose she was going to eat and die she was in the process of spiritual death and all she could do is eat what little bit she had to die not eat to live now she could exchange that little bit that'll sustain her for further death and now give that little bit over to the way of God and have enough to give her spiritual life all the way through the family what an exchange can you imagine she wretched down in that Barrel tilted it on the side smacked it on the side to get all the dust down to just enough to make a cake and she scooped that Barrel clean amen she had nothing left to give but everything she have she gave that's the way to serve God it may seem like she was losing a lot she was losing nothing when we came to Christ when we came to this living Jesus Christ manifest in the end time we thought we were giving him all but our all was really we didn't have anything friends we were in desert condition we were in famine condition we were emaciated amen and had nothing but crumbs but we felt like we were giving over everything we were giving the last bit of nothing in order to get everything so this woman now she gives and she has a promise and now now when she goes back the next meal and she dips in there's meal in the barrel there's meal in the barrel she had scraped it out but now there's meal in the barrel and and I don't know how much meal was in the barrel but I just knowing the way God works I don't think that now she walked in the house and had 15 barrels of meal and enough barrels that she can count them and say praise God this will last through the three and a half years of the prophecy no I think she just had some meal in the barrel it may have been half full three quarters full quarter full I don't know how full it was but but the promise that she had was the barrel won't go empty she didn't walk into a storehouse full of barrels that she couldn't weigh okay if we each have a cake in the morning we each have a cake in the evening and it's about this many ounces and this many barrels oh that should go three and a half that might go three years and seven months she she couldn't have that kind of rest God never gives us that kind of carnal rest intellectual arrest but he requires that we keep operating by faith every day so that when she would scoop out the meal to make for herself to make for Elijah to make for her boy she had to trust that God would replenish what she scooped out according to the word that she he promised her she had to stand upon the promise of God not upon what her eyes would tell her amen because she could look in that barrel and no maybe that's enough for a day maybe that's enough for two days I don't know how much was in there but it wasn't enough for three and a half years but she would scoop out and make the cakes the next meal she would scoop out and make the case she would pour the cruise and oil kept coming out she didn't walk in and have cruises of oil lining the walls he said the barrel whatever runs right and the cruiser born so she kept dipping the same cruise and then kept oil coming out that's why we don't need a new message we don't need another messenger we don't need somebody else all we need is to keep going back to the same Barrel amen because it was stored up long ago for a day in the future that we would need it and we're in that day and it's already there friends he's promised it to be there you say well brother Chad I've already read that book go and read it again you'll find more meal amen I've been through that 10 times go through it 10 more times because every time you'll find a little more meal to get you through to the next one there's always more of Christ in this message more of Christ being unfolded and listen can you imagine the the the this little woman who knows what kind of condition she was in as she was trying to ration what little bit she had coming down to the inevitable day of her death and her son's death she was probably weak amen like all the other people were weak maybe beginning to show signs of starvation maybe a hollow cheeks maybe her little arms were thin and maybe the little child was losing weight and who knows what kind of condition they were in but as the famine wore on everybody around them became more emaciated weaker showing more signs of starvation and maybe there was even Death Around but This Woman's cheeks were full amen her little boy was growing he was getting taller all the time she could put him his back against the door and Mark his growth why because she gave everything to Christ and Christ was giving her a portion in the time of famine that was causing health and vitality and growth and brother Branham said she became a witness a witness amen that in the time of famine you can grow in the time of famine you can be spiritually healthy in the time of famine you can have fat rosy cheeks your children can grow and prosper and come into the full statue of Christ because there's food I can also imagine her going back to the barrel scooping out and making the cakes and sitting down I can imagine that little boy going Mom this is so good you know how it is when you're sitting there feasting and saying oh it's so good this is so good this is better than yesterday what did you do different amen just better than it used to be what did you change I didn't change anything it's the same Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever you're feeding on the same word amen but as you grow every time she dipped out of the bucket remember God was sustaining that barrel with a meal every time she dipped out of the barrel that was food for that day that was Christ for that day amen that wasn't yesterday's Christ that wasn't tomorrow's Christ that was today's Christ and today's Christ is always the tastiest you've ever had that's why I I don't know about you but this Christ is to me it seems like it's so much better than it was five years ago it's so much tastier so much more satisfying full of flavor you you come to the service and feed on the word and it's like this is amazing this is unbelievable amen but that's what you said four years ago that's why you said six years ago that this is the best how can it get any better it's the same Jesus Christ yesterday today and forever but the portion for your day is the tastiest you can ever eat today you can't stomach tomorrow's yet you got to grow up for that yesterday's you've already grown past but today's portion is the portion that tastes the best and I trust if time continues and we're here 10 years from now we'll be saying my goodness I can't believe this is the best message I've ever heard I can't believe where is that man getting this stuff amen where is he getting it out of the barrel that was stored up in the 1960s amen because it was put away for a future need and and I believe there was enough stored up to carry us all the way through and every time we go to the storehouse and crack open another mason jar somehow the longer it sits undiscovered the better it takes amen the wine gets better with age and this this little woman and a boy he was growing noticeably he was growing and the meal that she was eating listen she was going to the same barrel and pulling out the same scoop and using the same oil and it was the right food for the pastor for the woman and for the boy she didn't fix a separate meal for the leader of the church had to eat a special diet and the woman in the house the widow woman or the little boy they didn't need special food they all ate the same Christ for their day amen the teenagers don't need a different watered-down message they need the same message that feeds Mom and Dad the same one that feeds the pastor feeds the mother in The Home feeds the father in The Home feeds the teenage boy it's the same Christ for our day that every one of us need [Music] we don't need a program we don't need to water it down we don't need to change it we just need to preach it in the fullness of its power if you've got a child you may not fix them as big a cake but they're going to eat the same food amen praise be to God amen this is what God's been given us to overcome by this is what God's been given us Amen to rise above amen the false doctrines of this world Amen we don't need to change and we don't need to alter it we don't need to keep it from the kids we need to feed them the same thing we're eating amen brother bam said in spiritual food in due season you say you say why is it that the message don't go out in these great big places these big Crusades like amongst the denominations it's not their food it's not the church so-called food it's bride food it's spiritual food in season it would make them sick at their stomach it's too rich for them you can't do it but for the children it's bread it's life it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen why no matter how much we want to distribute the food everywhere amen it's not everyone's food amen I was so amazed when uh brother Samuel was here on Sunday and he started talking about the restaurant the special food and the Seven Courts because God had already laid this message on my heart to preach I already knew I was going to preach this message and actually I was sitting in my seat going well I'm going to have to get a new message for Wednesday but then he stopped and turned and I said Thank You Lord because it's always food and due season amen and and now the food we would distribute it we wouldn't hold it from anybody we would give it to everybody we want everybody to eat it but realizing this isn't food for everybody it makes some sick have you ever given it to a message to somebody and saw it make them sick they get sick they get repulsed they get angry they get scared they get upset amen it's not their food that's okay amen it's not everybody's food that's why we don't force feed anybody because it'll make them sick they can't digest it it's not for them we're not here to cram this down anybody's throat we make it available for whosoever will come let him come and eat but there's only one kind of person on the earth that's predestinated to eat this food because it's fried food amen amen when we when we went over to uh Junction City yesterday I I pulled dropped my tailgate and I had two bags of dog food laying there that I forgot to unload I said oh dear we gotta load this so we moved it out of the way and then we had books I had boxes of books that we're going to give out Church age books and seals books so I put them back there I was driving down the road and I told Brother Kyle I said well we got dog food and Eagle food in the back we'll see what they want to eat foreign it's bride food Theory it gives us strength it gives us Health it helps us grow it's designed for us and it's designed for this day amen I tell you there's so many times that I'll preach on Sunday and go home and lay down and wake up Monday morning and the first thought that I have in my mind is what in the world am I going to preach Wednesday I have no idea I poured my heart out I preached everything I was inspired to preach I've got not one thought left in my mind and not a single thing I can sit there and think to preach nothing but praise God by the time Wednesday I took another dip out of the barrel and there's some more meal amen it's not that we can look and say there's barrels and barrels and barrels and barrels we've got the message the message amen is full the message we can see will sustain us all the way through but I don't know where I'm going to get tomorrow's portion that comes by God's grace because he knows just which dip out of the barrel we need we are so dependent on his leadership amen we don't have Series in our minds we don't have five messages planned out we are going day by day and that's how Elijah was fed day by day amen that's how the woman went back to the barrel day by day and all of us are fed by the Holy Ghost day by day I I wish it was easier for me I'd love to know my next five sermons and then I could wake up Monday morning with no problem but that's not the way it works I've had agonizing days trying to find the inspiration of the Lord I've had Saturdays where I've cried throughout the day saying God you have to feed your sheep I got not one thing I have a little code word for my wife when she knows I'm struggling I say the sales up but there's no wind that means I've got the ship ready we've battened down the hatches I've raised the sail I'm standing at the helm but if there's no wind the ship ain't going anywhere we read we pray we read the message we we do everything we know how to do but if God doesn't send the wind of inspiration there's nothing this ship doesn't go anywhere so when she hears me say sails up no wind she knows I'm in trouble you can take the Helm of that ship and you can keep turning it back and forth you can tighten the sail a little tight there's no wind you're not going anywhere because God knows just which portion of the barrel he needs to feed for today I wish we could change that I don't wish but my Human Side would be much more comfortable if we could change that I mean I mean these some preachers have it so easy it shows up in the mail there's a date you preach this subject on that day I mean no wonder they they're part of golf leagues but when we want the food in due season we've got to be willing to take it God's provided way and God's provided way isn't always easy on the flesh that's why we all have to labor together we all have to pray we have to I have to stay consecrated you have to stay consecrated we have to pray for one another this is not coming and sitting comfortably in a comfortable seat to hear what God has put on this man's heart no it's I have to do my part and pull my part through that gift because we got to hear from God for today so we're all in this thing together amen amen remember remember when Elijah was in the school of the prophets and there was a prophet that had gathered wild gourds he took the wild gourds and he threw it in a pot they were going to all have a meal together and they began to dip out of the pot and they say no there's death in the pot and Elijah said this is in Second Kings Four Elisha I mean second Kings 4 and this is verse 41 but he said then bring meal meal is always a type of Christ bring meal and he cast it into the pot and he said pour out for the people and they may eat and there was no harm in the pot what did he do he put Christ he injected Christ into the ponds so this is what brother Branham says in God's chosen place of worship from 1965 he's referring to that same scripture said Elijah said bring me a handful of meal and he took the meal and threw it in the pot and said eat the pot is healed and the meal offering was Christ every Burr had to be set the same in every little piece of meal had to be ground the same for the meal offering showing that he is the Healer he substitutes and takes away death and puts Life by those two laws Hallelujah where death is one place when Christ comes in life comes in he's the same yesterday today and forever and where there was death there became life because that Christ was brought in the meal offering listen that that man the school of the prophets is the school of the preachers and that man was doing the best he could is that right he was out gathered he wasn't trying to poison the people but according to the best of his understanding he was gathering what he thought would be good for the people listen I feel sorry I I feel sorry for pastors who don't have the message we were on vacation one time and we started attending a Baptist Church and I went there every time the doors were open that week we were on vacation and the reason is I went to that first service just because I wanted our family to be in church and I thought it'd be a good experience for the family but I became so burdened for The Man Behind the pulpit because I could see he was sincere and he was honest hearted and he had nothing to feed his sheep and there was not a critical bone in my body but my heart was broke for him I grieved and I went there every service and later I wrote him a letter tell him I appreciated having a place to go on vacation and I appreciated all that he did and I sent him a seven Church ages book I never heard back I don't know what happened from that but but I realized he wanted he didn't want to poison his people he didn't want to feed boys and girls he he was gathering the best that he knew how intellectually he was using the best mind he had like this man from the school of prophets but behold when it was all cooked together there was death in the pod but oh in the Elijah ministry under Elisha now when he said bring me meal let's just put Christ into this and when you put Christ into this it'll heal the pots amen that's why we want the word the word the word we want the revelation of the word for this hour that is Christ amen that's what brother Brown says in three kinds of Believers says he that receiveth my words and believeth on him that sent me has already passed from Death To Life but can you receive the word first can you receive the word all of the word all of Christ Christ is the anointed word he is the word anointed Christ means the anointed one the anointed word for that day amen that's why it can't be left over Christ there has to be fresh Christ fresh word amen brother Ben he gets to questions and answers on the seals this is preaching Sunday morning now remember he was told to store up the food they told us a crisis the mystery of God revealed it's stored up for it will be needed later then he comes here to questions and answers on the seals and he says and then also know that right among you things are happening I know that you don't see it I'm just positive that you don't see it you say brother bear that's a hard thing for you to say I know it is but look let me just say this now I suppose this is just tapes for ourselves and so forth but let me say this that you don't you don't get it and you're not supposed to get it in other words I'm storing this on tape it'll be needed later so don't try to interpret anything see don't try to put your interpretation to it you only get further away now he gives them some instructions he's telling them don't try to figure it out it's not for you to figure out now amen but there's this Revelation is going to continually open amen the food's going to come out of the storehouse it's not for you now but I gotta put it on tape he said just take my advice if you believe me now if God has given me favor in your sight and you know that them Revelations and things I've been here with you a long time and it's always been right and now to double prove it it hooks right in with the word see so you know it's thus saith the Lord that's exactly it's proven to you now take my advice as your brother don't put your own interpretation to anything you just go and live a good Christian life because you'll only wind yourself away from the real thing when you do it you only wind your way away again away from that thing and all of you are conscious and know that there's something mysterious happening and it's happening and I know what it is brother Madam was looking at it he knew what was unfolding he knew what was transpiring in his day but then all through the seals brother but I'm saying I hope you're getting it I hope you're seeing what's happening it's all around you he's saying this to through the seals he's saying I hope I don't have to just take it out in my hand and show it to you then he comes to Sunday the last days preaching the seals and here he is Sunday morning with questions and answers and he says now I know you're not getting it you don't see it and even before when he was telling people to turn their questions in he goes I'm just waiting for a certain question I'm waiting to see if people are catching it or not but then when he comes to questions and answers he says I know you're not getting it you're not supposed to get it so you all here in this day you just live a simple Christian humble life don't add no interpretation you'll go further away there's no way for you to get it at all but that doesn't still apply today friends to you and I amen that food was stored up for a future day what future day one day I mean is there still coming today there's more in there to come out I'm sure of that amen there'll be more coming out all the way to the change of our bodies but I don't believe this is the day when we say I have no idea what the seals are about I have no idea what brother Ben was talking about all I want to do is live a simple Christian humble life no he's been pouring out meal for 60 years day by day amen he's been unfolding the mystery bit by bit and it's been delicious and tasty and giving us strength and we've been maturing now we're what would have made them sick 60 years ago amen there's a maturity there should be a maturity coming to the bride that can stomach the things that he was looking at that can stomach what he stored up on tape amen because it was it was enough Revelation to choke even a Son of God in that day amen but there's been a maturing process those things shouldn't choke us anymore statements like it's Christ coming in flesh My Flesh your flesh praise be to God everybody stored it up for a future day amen I don't want I don't want to keep the cap on what he's opened amen I don't want to be afraid to eat the portion of Christ for my day that's the part that's here to give me strength let's go to Colossians chapter one Colossians chapter 1. verse 9. for this cause we also since the day that we heard it do not cease to pray for you and to desire that you might be filled with the knowledge of his will and all wisdom and spiritual understanding I think this is so important for us to realize that Paul never said it doesn't matter you don't need to understand Paul wanted them to grow first they had to believe then they had to grow he said with let me let me read this again and to desire that you might be filled with the knowledge of his will and all wisdom and spiritual understanding that you might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing being fruitful in every good work and increase and increase in the knowledge of God he wanted them to grow in their understanding and he wanted to increase in their knowledge of God I think that still applies today that's why we keep reading the same Bible over and over and over and over again not so that I don't get anything out of it so that I increase in the knowledge of God so that as God unfolds bit by bit to me every new peace is bringing me into a clearer understanding of God this is what Paul wanted if we go to Peter let's go to First Peter chapter 3. First Peter chapter 3 verse 18. I have the wrong scripture reference well I'll read what I have but I don't know where to find it in my Bible but he says but grow in Grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ to him be glory both now and forever so Peter is telling them to grow in Grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we're supposed to grow in these things how do you grow unless you feed amen how are you going to feed unless God is constantly opening in a more portion more portions of himself brother Branham says in questions and answers from 1964 he said First Corinthians 13 says this when that which is perfect has come then that which is in part shall be done away with so all these little things of jumping up and down like a kid and trying to talk in tongues and all these other things when that which is perfect and we do have today by God's help the perfect interpretation of the word with Divine vindication then that which is in part is done away when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things brother Brandon was clear he says what we do have today by God's grace is the perfect interpretation of the word with Divine Vindication but I'll tell you what we didn't have in that day was perfect understanding of the perfect word is that fair to say that's why we grow in Grace in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ that's why we keep feeding on the message that's why we keep feeding in the Bible that's why we keep coming back and feeding amen and going over some of the same subjects some of the same teaching some of the same things because we have to grow because it's getting it's food for our day it gets stronger and stronger and stronger to bring us into greater maturity let's go to first Thessalonians chapter 3. and hopefully I wrote down the right reference we'll see first Thessalonians chapter 3. verse 9. for what things can we render to God again for you for all the joy we're with we joy for your sakes before our God night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith the Apostle Paul wanted to come and visit them so that he could perfect what was lacking in their faith is it when they saw Paul that they would have perfect faith what was Paul wanting to do when he saw their faith he was wanting to teach them more word and more word would bring more perfect faith because Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word so Paul is saying you're not fine where you are amen you're good but I want to come that I might perfect what's lacking in your faith praise God so what do we need friends we need more word amen we need more of the spiritual food that has been saved for this season where do I find it it's in the message how do I get it amen stay in the channel that God gave you feed on the message listen to the voice of the Prophet read the book stay in your Bible and come to church under the preaching of the fivefold ministry stay in your place because he said I will feed you there and receive God's way what's he doing he's he's opening up more of the stored food and more of the stored food and that's why it's so good because it's food and due season amen in the first seal brother Graham says but think now he wrote this but when he started to write these other seven Thunders he said don't write it he'd been commissioned he's talking about John to write everything he'd seen But when these seven Thunders over in Revelation 10 uttered he said don't write them at all they're mysterious we don't know what they are yet but in my opinion they'll be revealed right away and when it do it'll give faith for that Rapture and Grace for the church to move out what will the seven Thunders do it'll help perfect what's lacking in our faith that's what Paul wanted to give to the Thessalonians he wanted to come and teach them more to perfect what was lacking in their faith oh if I need more faith what do I need I need more word amen I need more of Christ where am I going to get it don't run all over the place stay in the message stay in the channel I will feed you there if you know your place you know the church you belong to you know the minister you said under you know the message of the hour you feed on the tapes you know your Bible I will feed you there you're not going to miss a thing if you stay in God's appointed place he'll keep feeding every day I'll bring more don't have to worry about it running out don't have to worry about starving to death in God's place what if God wants me to move he'll let the brook dry out something he'll do something to reposition you but until he does stay where he placed you have faith in God this message amen this message is Christ same yesterday today and forever it is the spiritual food in due season in the message the rising of the sun he says we shall rise in him we become part of him the Easter the revealed Secret Of God like it was then of life after death we are now alive we who are Once Dead in sins and trespasses he's talking about your Easter talk about your Resurrection coming out of dead denominationalism dead things of the world and coming into life in Christ Jesus you who were once dead in sin and trespasses the true Easter seal has broke death from around me and I'm alive the Easter seal at the beginning broke the Seal of the Roman seal the Easter seal that was see that he was sealed up and man when they died was gone but he broke the seal and revealed the secret and now God by his holy spirit has broke the seal from around our lives this is what he says next do you believe the seal has been broke from around your life by the word he has broke the seal from around our lives and Christ is revealed as he lives in US what happened when the seal was broke around your life Christ was revealed where was Christ revealed as he lives in US the revealing of you was the revealing of Christ working in you that was a mouthful a long time ago but that's food and due season today amen I want to read this last statement this last quote from the anointed ones at the end time he says the son of man is Christ he is the one that you're feeding on you're not feeding on a man a man his words will fail but you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man unfailing it's not going to run out before you're changing the body the unfailing body word of the son of man if you haven't fed fully on every word to give yourself strength to Fly Above All these denominations and things of the world will you at this time do it while we pray if you haven't taken your meal and turned it over to Elijah would you do so now yes we have it just forsaken all of our ideas and recognize our ideas is death in the pot our best effort is death in the pot but the only thing that will cure the death and the pot of our thinking is the mind of Christ coming in the meal has to come in and heal the pot where do I find it it's the message of the hour it's the word that has been given to us it's Christ in due season I say thank God for his word let's all stand musicians if you please come you know there's there's many things in this world that will feed our spirit but there's only one thing that will feed our soul and that's the bread of life that's Christ the bread of life that's every word that cometh out of the mouth of God is what we're feeding on and we need to be careful that we don't feed the spirit that's the carnal man there's every kind of entertainment distraction news feed there's there's everything around us wants to feed our spirit but remember you have a carnal Spirit of the world that's the black dog starve that thing starve that thing where's the white dog that's my soul what do I what do I feed it it will only feed on the word of God so if I want to overcome this day I have to stop spending so much time feeding the spirit and I need to feed my soul and praise God God has given us a storehouse full of food to feed the soul it's not like we have to look far amen we carry it around in our pockets it's it's everywhere we drive it's available all the time we can be feeding our soul all the time and if we want to have victory in this day when it's so easy to feed the spirit I say we need to be diligent to feed the soul so that we can overcome and Fly Above these denominations and all these things of the world how am I going to do it when I get strong by the word amen let's bow our heads and pray dear Lord Jesus we thank you we thank you Father that you've provided food in due season God in the time of famine you have not left your children without but oh God you're only asking us to obey your voice to show that we trust you to show that we believe you God I want to gladly Exchange my little portion my little meal I want to give it away to you so that I can have your portion the sustaining unfailing body word of the son of man God I pray that you would taken throw your meal into our pots and heal it Lord we all have our own ideas we all have our own feeling about things but God that's just death in the pot help us to surrender our thoughts our ideas our own gatherings help us Lord to surrender that now and allow you to put meal in the pot poem through the Elijah Ministry of this day would you add meal to the pot and heal all of our wrong understanding all of our our misguided efforts would you please Lord come and heal it God would you give us the strength that we need to Fly Above these denominations and things of the world we're so grateful Lord we have a source we have a fountain that will never run dry we have a storehouse that will not go empty Lord you have provided in this day everything we have

come help us God to have the same faith that the widow woman had when she'd go back to the barrel every day she expected meal to be there help us to have that kind of Faith to trust in you not because
