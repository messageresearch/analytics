Lord and [Laughter] cry amen [Music] amen it's um certainly uh my theme song of life um and we can just get quiet in the hustle and bustle lady oia and so many voices and uh so many voices you can listen to and but there's only one true [Music] voice and uh we have to get quiet and get still if we really want to hear that voice and um I I I trust uh that we'll hear that voice this morning we don't we don't want to be uh 3 338 or 339 or 438 or 439 but but we want to be 4:40 that that's what we're all striving for I I don't know about you but after brother Chad preached that I I didn't want to preach no more I said oh my it must be about 2:30 240 or something so um God's good I um just want to um say um this morning we appreciate the Lord and uh this may be just a few announcements before we we get started um we want to uh remember uh brother Emanuel uh Soldier for the Lord and uh we want to remember him as he travels be heading out uh what day this week brother Tuesday Tuesday that's what I thought Tuesday and then brother brother burley going with him so uh just pray that God would direct his footsteps and we' hold him up in prayer and then um also uh I want to remember these two fellas uh so so Brother Kyle he'll be uh ministering for us this Wednesday and so uh we want to be in prayer for him that uh the Lord would use him also for the youth meeting this uh this evening um we don't want to forget about those as well you know I I yeah you know Brother Kyle he he he's 10 foot tall and bulletproof in my eyes a uh you know uh um I don't know if you if you really maybe if you ain't a minister you don't realize it but you know that man he he preaches to our young people twice a month and I don't know if you unless you ever get behind the pull pit you don't really realize what it takes to minister but then also to channel your thoughts to young people twice a month and and you know um there's no archives you know there's no glory in that if if you understand what I'm saying uh it it it has to be pure burden on that man for him to to labor you have no idea what it takes uh to prepare two Services a month and channel it that way and so but I happen to have walked in his shoes a couple times and so uh to me yeah bulletproof in my eyes and so I appreciate Brother Kyle and the burden that he possesses for our young people and then uh brother Ben looking forward to Sunday trust that God will pour out his blessings upon him and uh and then our pastor uh you know um you know another thing remember when he preached that sympatic resonance you know Bing you know you know you think about this and something else about Ministry that you you may not realize when when he preached that I was in all the whole service and I had to be honest afterwards what I told him I told I was envious that God gave it to him and not to me confession good for the soul I was just hoping that the Lord would anoint me and I could call Brother Chad and say brother Chad let me you ain't using them anymore cuz here's the thing some something else you may not realize is Ministry uh brother Chad I mean he has just been preaching I'm in awe and uh and I don't say that uh you know for your sake or for the camera's sake and you know but I'm just saying it for my heart's sake what it's done for me that he's been able to yield in such a way that the God could use him in such a powerful way but here's something that maybe don't realize after he preached that sympatic resonance Bing and it went into the archives that was over and and and that man like a like an evangelist an evangelist will get one of those minist one of those messages well he can preach it all all across the country you know you understand what I'm saying but a pastor he preaches it it's one and done you and then it's like no matter how much how powerful it was well well now there's another service to come and and now that one's gone that's in the archives that's in the books and now it's like Lord what's next right and so uh for that man to be able to get away uh we just don't want no bears to get a hold of you right I'm G to pray them bears away I'm glad brother Elmer went with him you know but Elmer just flexed you know on time the bear be that brother he big as a bear yeah keep him on my good side yeah but uh but but really what what we want to do is is uh is we want to hold his hands up you you want to know what your ministry is well what can I do for the lord well you may not be Aaron you you may not be a Aaron but just be a her cuz that's who the other one was that was holding up his hands and it wasn't just Aaron you know uh uh uh but it was her also that had to be there holding his hands up and so that's what we can do we can hold him up in prayer not just just while he's on vacation but but every day uh to realize the burden that he has and so I just I I love and appreciate him and not only that but but even family right yeah he uh um so don't forget sister Angie right you know the the the the the Ministries the wives they usually take the backseat neat and you know I remember one time uh brother called my wife uh sister Gabe right you know cuz the preacher but then the the sister they always but you know there's a scripture I believe in Psalms that says that she that carried at home divided the spoils so she got half regardless right the so praise the Lord for that um so we just I I trust we we we'll have a little something uh that that'll be a blessing to you I I want to start off in Revelation chapter 19 and uh just trust that the Lord will have his way this morning uh Revelation chapter 19 and verse 4 and the four and 20 elders and the four beasts fell down and worshiped God that sat on the throne saying amen Allelujah and a voice came out of the throne saying praise our God all ye his servants and ye that fear Him both small and great and I heard as it were a voice of a great multitude and as the voice of many Waters and as the voice of Mighty thundering saying Al ujah for the Lord God omnipotent reth let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife hath made herself ready and to her was was get granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints and he saith unto me write blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb and he he said unto me these are the true sayings of God and then I'd like to turn to Genesis chapter 3 uh verse 8 Genesis 3:8 and they heard the voice of the Lord God Walking In The Garden in the cool of the day and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the Trees of the garden and the Lord God called unto Adam and said unto him where art thou and he said I heard thy voice in the garden and I was afraid because I was naked and I hid myself and this morning I I'd like to speak to you um by the help of the Lord on an invincible army with individual losses as bhe heads precious Lord truly as we bow before you this morning Lord as the song has been sung quiet me Lord you know what that does to me how I long to get quiet before you and Lord we're just asking that that still Small Voice would be able to walk the aisles this morning Lord that you would Minister Lord through your word this morning you know the needs lord of the people here this morning and I don't but Lord I I surrender to you I yield myself as all I know how and I I truly want you to be magnified and glorified Lord I I want to take last place when it comes to you I want you to have preeminence Lord and so I pray that your forgiveness would be Upon Our Lives that you would direct us lead us guide guide us bless your children this morning and we'll be careful to give you all praise glory and honor and we ask these thingss to be so in the name that's above every name our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen God bless you be seated if you like an invincible army with individual losses and and brother brandham tells us he says every believer in here is a Christian tonight because not that you're good but because God was good to call you you couldn't come yourself our our Natures are against us and um you know we we think so much and talk so much of being the bride and the Invincible Army predestinated elected saved before the foundation of the world and and those things are all yay and amen but no matter how uh thin you slice it there's always two sides to everything can we say Amen today and is is predestinated and as elected as we was there's still um a Time time in our lives that we had to experience uh one of those lost sheep of Israel um teach it brother yes thank you yes that's exactly right and I I I will say this that if um if you're if you are uh here this morning um remember it before you can be found you must first realize that you're lost I I don't know about you but I wasn't born found I I didn't come to this world uh knowing exactly who I was and and who God called me to be I I came to this world with amnesia and it took me decades to shake that Amnesia off now I don't know about you we we all come to this world different ways and and uh different uh Avenues of life as uh uh uh talking to uh brother uh Ben through text the other day he he he was texting brother Chad you know B got a group text and he said something about uh brother Ben said I hope you get the worst case of of Base thumb uh that you ever had and I thought base thumb I'm thinking wonder the world what's Bas th and I just talking to brother Ben I said I said brother I said I got to ask you what what's what's base them but but then he sent me a picture and he said brother it's it's not ba it's bass thumb see you know I come from the other side of the tracks you know I don't know about no no no bass I know about the Bas you know helping me Lord I but but but but but we all come through this thing called life in different ways and so you may have one to one way to pronounce b SS and I got another way but but you can't help maybe so much the path that was laid out before you uh and some of the roads that we chose uh because uh there there's sometimes there's a lot of forks in the road of thing called life and but but I don't know but I know one thing for certain that there was a point in my life where I was as lost as lost as could be and and and I was groping in darkness but but one day a a Merciful Savior came by my way and and in his infinite grace and mercy he he picked me up and he turned me around and and and he he put something on the inside out of me that I couldn't put myself and and he changed me and he transformed me and he made me a new creature in Christ Jesus and for that I am internally grateful because it was not one thing that I done it was his goodness that called me and changed me it wasn't that I was good but he was good to call me and and I think it's something that we as as as uh God's electing this day we got to realize and I hope you know that that we can we can see ourselves as the Invincible Army and that is true but but don't don't get yourself so elected that you're no earthly good right that there has to be a balance in it because you know we we we came lost and we get saved but then we we have to once we get saved then we got to lose ourselves again and that's the battle that we all go through because if you love your life you're going to lose it is that right as brother Emanuel preached uh uh uh so beautifully Wednesday but but Jesus tells us and and that Rich Young Ruler is an example that that he said that look here I was an invincible Army from my youth right he he kept it all he he knew all the quotes he he knew all the scriptures he he knew what Moses said and Abraham and but yet there was still that one little thing Laing in him and we all have to be honest with ourselves and make sure that we ain't just 99% good right that we ain't just 439 but we got to be 440 amen and so it takes us searching out ourselves and trying uh uh to be honest with ourselves because we live in a world as the Bible tells us that iniquity shall abound and the love of many would wax cold but there would take a people that would have to have an endurance to make it to the end there's many that start off strong that thought they were saved that thought they they were the elect of God but they didn't make it to the end of the road maybe they thought they was found the whole time but really in reality they was lost the whole time and I I don't know about you but that makes me tremble to my core yes yes and that makes me search out my own salvation with fear and trembling that that I I I want I want to look in the mirror of God's word and make sure that I line up because brother brandham says that that he he gives us a warning concerning the last days and he takes that scripture that we just read he says because of abounding iniquity the love of many would wax cold uh and it would be in this last age self love right this is the the age of selfies let me ask you why in the world would you care to share what you have for breakfast do you realize how vain that is absolutely do you think I care if you had a egg McMuffin or not I mean really you understand what I'm saying but that's the hour that we live where people are so consumed that they want their life to be on display where where look we don't even have to be trapped by the trappings of Hollywood we can become a star in our own eyes and all you need is a hand handful of followers right and and and we live in an hour where where so much is thrown at us we we live in an hour where there's so much where it's how hard is it for us to pray uh give us this day our daily bread if if I if we would take account at how many has actually prayed that in sincerity I would Dar say that there would be none because we live in the Land of Plenty I'm talk I'm not talking about saying it I'm talking about praying it because we live in so much we live where everything in life is one click away that that if if you can think it you can have it and if Amazon doesn't have it well I got a printer that can make it do you understand that's that's the hour that we live in where where where whatever your desire is you can attain to and and you know we we we couldn't have we couldn't have I don't believe that the Lord could have come in the 19 and80s because everything wasn't one click away but but all we had was a JC Penny catalog sir remember that we couldn't wait till that thing came along right and then we looked at that thing all year long I thought I thought the I thought the 70s they dressed bad till I saw that picture man look hey she look like she getting ready uh try out for the for the Browns sister what's wrong with them shoulder pads I know y'all have some shoulder pads like that man she like but that's where we live where we have everything and and we're so busy getting and getting that how often do we lose we live in a time where where we will absolutely spend thousands to keep because we don't want to lose and we'll spend thousands of our livelihood to make sure everything is safe and sound and I'm not preaching against those things cuz my insurance man is on the second [Applause] row and I don't want to get a bill next year and go I'm [Laughter] sorry but but we live in a time where it's it where we're trying to protect everything that we got so we don't lose it but really is that how we're supposed to be because Jesus said if you if you lose then you're going to gain there's so much I I I wonder I wonder in this in this pie of insurance where does Blessed Assurance fit in you understand what I'm saying we we live we live we live in an hour where it's it's we put our money in in a bank for safety really we we we have we have every week we put money in a stock market that's going to collapse in hopes that one day we'll have enough we we put so much in in getting and maintaining and keeping because we don't want to lose anything but as we by God's grace look through the scriptures losing is a part of life amen and and we have to we have to oh man we have to be I don't even we say balanced but then I go back to what brother Chad said we where is balance right is is it is it your Vantage Point of balance or my vantage point of balance because where are we at in in in this in this grand scheme of life because we're all striving to live a balanced life but that Razor's Edge is going to take only the elect of God will be able to do that right and that's what I want to be that's what I'm striving to be but only thing I can do is look at my life and say God is my life reflecting the elect of God I is my everyday life not not pull pit Preacher Man but but I'm talking about in my private life is that reflecting elect of God be because we we can we can buy a gift we've seen many mighty man that that can preach it like no other but then at some point in time they fade away so so the Bible tells us that we ought not to think of more ourselves more highly than we ought to because what we think uh we have it can be gone in an instant you we we live our whole lives to to have a home and to and to and to you know uh have a college fund for the children and and a piggy bank and retirement and all those things and and we can we can have you know the dream I don't know about you is to have you know all everything paid for but even that if you you have the title deed in the safe at home do you really own [Music] it you may say yeah brother Gabe I Own It Free and Clear I'm debt free but I ask you a question don't pay your taxes this year and then let me ask you a year from now do you own that home and your head's going to fall down low and and those Barn Door shoulders that you had will become deflated amen and you'll realize you don't own nothing that's the world in which we live and we can get so caught up in this thing called life that we lose sight of losing in order to gain and and I am for all those things uh uh we have to do those but but the whole point is is what is our Focus that's right where where are we going in this thing called life because we can look all of us we we we can live in such a life where where where we're not trapped by the things of the world the you know the the the addictions of this world do not have hold on us and that's great but that's not eternal life amen what is eternal life amen you tell me what it is and I'll tell you what the prophet said that's right eternal life is living for others but we live in a selfish World absolutely where it's all about me and we lose sight of others you know we get so caught up in the rat race of life that we lose our joy for the Salvation that's right that we have amen sister you can get so caught up in giving out to the family that you give so much that your joy becomes empty but we have to be mindful say Lord look do y'all remember the first time y'all got saved remember look you know and it don't have to be you know I was on a bar stool and I'm not talking about that that's that's that's not that's not my look cuz I I I'll say this you you young ones can go well brother Gabe you know uh I don't have a testimony I I didn't come from you know drugs and Al listen that's not a testimony look I I have to say this just because I got cleaned up don't mean I got salvation that's right just because my pants ain't sagging and I and I and I and I and I ain't you know uh a living that life does not mean I'm Eternal a suit and tie does not make you Eternal only he makes you Eternal and so don't discredit what God has you in your path called life that's right you have to look at your own self and and you have to be mindful of what God has done for you as an individual Hallelujah and when we see that and we realize what God has done that you are serving not out of Duty that's it that's right not because of what Mom and Dad does Mom and Dad has nothing to do with it the family church has nothing to do with it right how he was raised has nothing to do with it our friends and Associates has nothing to do with it yes sir it's something deeper than that but even when we come to that spot there's times in life where we can we can lose our joy of that moment are y'all with me do do I have to break out the amen sign again I will prompt you if I have to I thank you don't make brother Emanuel work hey y'all going to make me run down to the fifth row go amen we look even even even we can lose our savior that's right and and brother brandham tells us that actually means the power of contact we can get so bottled up in our own world that we fail to reach out and contact one another you know we can get so caught up in our life and our struggles and maybe you know all of our losses become greater than our gains amen amen amen we we look at we look at our missteps in lives and all the things that we lost in life look you know sometimes we lose things in life and we never even got to experience and we look across the aisle and I one of my one of my one of the things that I I love about these young people is to look on them and see innocence right I I look at I look at these you know remember that one uh remember that one sister she was you know she's out on the Dance Floor remember brother B cast that devil out of her and you know one another time brother B talking about and he goes uh she she was talking brother BR she said Oh Brother bam she said I just got such a hard look on my face and she she was looking at uh I remember if it's media open she said she got such a sweet look on her you know and there's something about look when when you youngsters don't get caught up in the world there's a softness that remains but but don't ever um lose sight of the value in which that is because uh there's others that's been on the other side of the tracks and they look at I look like when I look at you and I think oh man Lord don't ever let them lose it because there's such a beauty in which that is because it it it's it it's something that that's to be cherished for for a sister to be able to blush right amen amen right and and so so don't let the world somehow especially you boys you know you want to be tough you want to be uh right you don't be no right you're like brother Gabe I ain't going to put no skinny pants on right right you you want the you want the camouflage and right man I don't know y'all got some can y'all stand up and make sure I got no skinny jeans out there right but but you Brothers you you want to be a man right and and but but that doesn't mean that you can't be tender on the inside too in this thing called life there's there's pitfalls that happens and sometimes we lose things near and dear to us but I but I I want to say this brother or sister look may maybe maybe there's a prodal son that you're waiting on Amen but listen we all know one have been one amen or we're waiting on one amen right but but we have to hold the faith and and and listen may maybe sometimes we look in life and we think well brother Gabe I ain't did nothing for the Lord and and we when we think our life is insignificant and and we're trying but but you know it's it's not about how big we can be it it may be a you know it may be a testimony that we have that that we won't even recognize till we get to the other side at at the impact that our life had that you wasn't even mindful of amen amen you know you know you think about this when when brother Brandon went beyond the curent of time and he saw those Millions now let's really think about this there was millions of his converts but out of those Millions there was only one that was ordained to come out of the congregation and speak to that Prophet yes and and the voice says do didn't you don't you recognize her and this is the amazing thing brother brandham didn't even recognize who she was and though that Prophet didn't recognize her God [Applause] did and and the thing we ought not to take this lightly the voice says she was past 90 when you L her to Christ so out of the millions of Mighty Gentile Warriors out of all the preachers praise God that had handled it that had sent thousands of souls to the kingdom under that Ministry out of the millions God will would have one Grandma amen amen amen one grandma that had lived her whole life unconverted that had spent her life who knows how I look remember brother Bram says uh uh uh we get to the other side I'll spend 10,000 years of peace with you you remember that yeah remember I'm going to be standing in this sister's line too cuz I want to know I want to hear her life story because God you want to talk about unmar Grace hallah that when she was 90 years old let me ask you what Earthly value did she possess what Ministry was she going to do her Ministry was when she was on the other side think of the millions that she is encouraged by this story that was told amen am praise God this sister 90 s I ought I should hear a few more Amen brother gab come [Laughter] on it it was it was some mighty preacher there that cleared the aisles you know but it was a grandma that was past 90 when she heard the voice she was lost but then she was found she was blind but then she seen see because remember when the Capstone come down it come down with sh sh shoutings of of right Grace thank you double portion right that's what this message is this message is a double portion of Grace right yes so so when when she's there she was past 90 and though she may have not had any Earthly value yes you understand what I'm saying that that even though and and the amazing thing is that God allowed her to go 90 years he could have saved her at any point in time of that span but God allowed it to be when her life was over right not not three scoring 10 70 and but 90 then God would would reveal himself to her with Malachi 4 and she would catch it yes sir brother Bram said 90% of conversions happened before the age of 21 98% so after she had done lived her life hardened you know how grandma is setting the W yeah grandma said they no right come on sisters come on brother some of the brother you get a little am man side don't let her see it but when she's past 90 and set in her ways yet she could hear the voice and it made a certain sound amen and that hardened heart that was set in her ways would begin to crumble amen amen and that heart of Flesh would begin to be pliable some of us need our joy restored amen because of this rat race called life we live in a time of loss and gain gain and loss we live in an hour where it's not baby blue skies and white puffy clouds all the time it's not sunshines and rainbows right I don't y'all got sunshines and rainbows all the time no but but there's there's but but I I was talking to brother brother Josiah months and months ago and he and he told me something he said he said the other day he said he was on his way to work and it was storming out and uh and he said he said he said you know he said he said when you when it's baby blue skies and white puffy clouds you're just driving Lord prepare right but let let let those let those darts Skies uh uh appear out of nowhere and you see the rain come in and it gets real dark and black and the and the lightning flashes and The Thunder Rolls and it gets real dark it ain't Lord prepare me anymore but it's 10 and two and when it starts coming down like sheep of rain and it's wave after wave you ain't Lord prep me but you're what your LA are focused and you're watching that yellow line and really that's when we're in the test that's right that's when you turn off the Lord prep cuz you want to focus and brother Josiah said something he says teachers don't say much during the test and when he said that I thought oh that's so good and I saw I saw a PowerPoint slide in the making I should have gave him credit at the bottom of that right but listen sometimes everything falls apart cuz God trying to get you to focus that's right amen that's right you know I I I I was thinking about brother Tim losing him and I I I had I had this thought before then but it just uh brother brother brother Tony was was preaching on you know there's a time to lose and a time to gain and a time to get and a time of refrain from getting and then and then brother brother Emanuel preached Wednesday and he was use that same scripture about he that keeps his life but if you lose your life and I just and and and and to me it just seems like there's this cuz we're all going through a loss of some kind amen right but but we have have to be mindful in those losses that it's not to hurt us it's really for our good but we can't have a lady oia mentality that's why we have to break out of this lady oia mentality and you know brother brandham tells us this he says when the hand clapping over when it's speaking when tongues are over and the healing service is over when the Music Stops if that deep settled peace them doors of faith face standing there wide open to let him the Lord be Lord over the situation it doesn't do any good to play music or clap hands or speak in tongues or have a healing servant that's right we we led him so far but now Lord you stay back there you might have done that to to he says he says brother so and say sister so and so to that child but my case is diff oh amen no no brother Manuel you don't understand my case is different I brother John I know it worked for you but my case brother Mike God treats me different God favors you he that's brother Chad he's a preach praise God Amen no no no no no your case isn't different am it isn't different you you're the one that's making the difference by keeping him out of your door Faith you are the one brother Gabe is the one we all have to be mindful our case is not different God does not treat us differently look I I I came from a a broken home I I I came I came from a home where you know I was I was thinking about it yesterday you know my mama's uh not really a serving the lord my dad was a was came to the message I was about 56 years old he's a Marine right Totaline and uh he it it's it's Dad way the highway right and uh very uh I love it he's he's my hero so I ain't saying this you know against him I'm just saying it's just the way he is it's that old school way right dad's dad and but but you know that only works for so long when you're little but if if you're built that way Dad you at some point in your life you got to transform as that child gets older because you will push that child away if you keep that attitude it it only works for so long when when they're little you can do that you can Strongarm them you can muscle them but but once that world starts flashing if you Strongarm them when they when the light when the world opens up and they start seeing it they will look my dad was like I worshiped that man so I know what I'm talking about and I don't mean that in a bad way but it was like Larry Joe Smith and then God right just I don't mean that sacrilegiously I'm just saying he was my everything cuz when I my mama you know she was working and we wasn't that close when I was little but my dad I mean we we would sleep back to back uh he put me to bed and we sleep back to back I mean I mean I couldn't wait for him to get off work I mean he was my world but even though he was that because he was so strong armed and so heavy-handed once the World opened up that strong arinis didn't play with me and you have to realize the same too as a parent you you can't use Strongarm and fear tactics because what happens is then it be then it becomes the parents against the children and and then and then what you do is you open up and you start building Walls by doing that because then that child is seeing how much they can get away with because Dad is so heavy-handed and my dad he he I'm not talking about him beating me I I think I only got like one one or two spanking in my life he just had to look at me I mean he's like 58 150 right but he'd look at me and he was he was like 11 foot tall and nuclear proof brother brother Kyle but but but my my point is is is is is when when when we when we when we when we have that type of a home we we we lose the opportunities of actually winning them over our children do not come to this world born again no matter how much they've been under this message how many youth meetings how many children's church how many how many special meetings look they are still struggling trying to understand life and if Mom and Dad are way up here and they are way down here then there is no way for them to attain to the level that you're at you have to come down to their level and speak on their terms amen because if not it just it builds walls you have to be mindful that they are not converted and you have to hold them to that accountability I'm not talking about living free rain understand what I'm saying but my point is is is you have to understand that they don't have the overcoming power that you have amen unless your case is different but you know God has a way in which he deals with us because what when I was in the home like you know um I got treated differently and so and so you know my sisters would get one thing but then I would get another and so when you grow up with that it it it it begins to isol ol at you because you get to get you don't get to treat get treated fairly and you know children children have awesome discernment you may think you're fooling them you ain't children see it they see when you're naughty and they see when you're nice they may not have the courage to tell you they see see it they they see when Mom and Dad play church and when they don't that's right that's why you got to repent and say look I can't tell you how many times I set them all three girls down wifey too and like hey that messed up I shouldn't be doing this I'm sorry cuz Hey ain't going to be no Preacher Man here Preacher Man can't be over there no sir not me cuz honestly I'll be honest with you uh I want to make heaven and I don't care what it cost me that's right Ministry family livelihood I don't it don't it don't matter it don't matter cuz I want to make Heaven Lord that's all that matters to me right but but you know uh I I I found found out that that when when we live in life and we get treated those way sometimes you can take the way that you was treated as a child and then you can you can you can reflect that upon God and then you can take your hurts as a childhood because you was scarred as a little boy or a little girl and then you can make God the same way and think well the Lord treats me different and then you can say well my situation is different brother Emmanuel no no no no look the the problem is brother Gabe is not using the filter of God's word brother Gabe would be using the filter of his complex to approach God's word and and and and brother bham says this brother bham says I find that people so struggle seem see seems like I meet people and they say it's just such a struggle have you seen people that way and probably there's many sitting right before me now that has ups and downs ins and outs this day they're all right you meet them and they love the Lord today and tomorrow they're having struggled to hang on the devil is so tempting them and they're having such ups and downs didn't you meet somebody that's on the hilltop all the time brother there's nothing bothers them at all now there's bound to be something like back in somewhere wow God's no respector a person or God doesn't respect person he wants all his children to have the same amen woo Hallelujah a righteous father wouldn't give one a dish of ice cream without giving them all ice cream God I hope this little quote just crumbled all of your theology of why your Christian experience is different than brother so and so or sister so and so and you know what it was crumbled by an ice cream that's how good our savior is am that that you know he he he he he'll he'll have that Prophet anointed to say something so rough and he'll do it with an ice cream so you can't be mad at it so so when we when we think God is somehow treating us different no how many believes we have we serve a righteous father amen yes so so if he's going to give Brother Kyle ice cream then that means he's going to give you ice cream too amen that means you ain't got to be empty-handed where you say but brother I'm not talking about your previous childhood that's where you have to go back back into your childhood you say brother Gabe I don't want to go back but you have to sometimes in life you have to go back to the hardest places that are going to go back to because it's those places in life where you lost so much all those losses are keeping you from gains now and if you ain't careful all those losses will turn into losses for your children they'll turn into losses in your marriage they'll turn into losses in your family life your marriage life and your church life yes because you won't be the sister that we need you say oh no no brother gab no no no you're here and we need you amen amen yes that's right come on brother right do we not are we not a body and we need each other right but we have to realize that every lick of our father fire of our father you need not a not a bass Thum you need a base Thumb in the congregation because brother Gabe balances out brother Ben right and and and and and so we have to realize that God is here to hand out a dish of ice cream to every one of us so if you leave here not getting a dish of ice cream it wasn't the heavenly father that passed you by it was you making yourself your situation different when it does not be need to be that way God is God is just as much willing to give you those baby blue skies and white there's going to be seasons of rain that is true but listen it's up to you to make the choice look brother bam tells us this he says you've got to have faith he says but you've got to know how to use that Faith to make yourself well to get happiness out of life you know sister Wendy Chan G gave s Susan and I a little plaque years ago and and and I we keep it on our Manel and it says happiness is a choice amen and it is so true cuz if you want to sit in the service sour that's your choice if you want to sit in the service and go no brother Gabe my situation is different then brother so and so is going to have to preach another service like this in another way that isn't like brother gab's way that's in a different way because God is going to get you to understand that you're making your situation different cuz that's how he is because you're one of his and he's yours and you got to see it and so he's longsuffering not willing that anybody would stay in that situation and so he's got TR to get you to that place where you're going to realize I am not going to use my past to make my choices I'm going to have faith in God's word because you have to you have to call those things that are not as though they are how do you do that it's by God's word that's why it's so important to understand to read and to believe God's word because God is obligated only to his word amen look he's not obligated to your complex he's not obligated to your situation he's not obligated to your fears and failures and your losses what he is obligated to is his eternal word and you have to go to the word and find out where you fit in the word if you are suffering loss there's multitudes of characters for you to pull from to find strength right that's the way he designed it that's the way he built it the prophet of God W was built in such a way that that he could suffer loss upon loss upon loss but it was molding him in such a way where he could say I love you dear Jesus you've broken my heart over and over but I love you for it how in the world is that even fathomable I know how it's fathomable because I've said the same thing thank you Lord thank you Jesus amen there's the only this is this this this gospel is the only thing that is life and life more abundantly and I'm finding out in life the more that I lose the more that I gain the more that I can sacrifice the greater he becomes in my life amen you look at that Prophet you look at what that Prophet went through we think we think wow look you know you know we we look at anything how he look a crossey child could stand on a platform all he'd have to do is look at him he didn't have to offer a word of prayer and those eyes that were crossed would come straight amen and and the congregation no doubt would look at and be in awe but what they failed to see is what it cost that man to have that ability yes right right yes amen what he had to lose in order to have the ability to enter into the sufferings of that child praise God Amen but sometimes we look and we go well it didn't happen like I thought brother Gabe I prayed for something and it didn't happen or I wanted this to happen and it didn't happen well remember the stash Cliff baby brother brandom there was a a sister and and a and a and a brother over in Germany he worked for the military and uh uh the baby passed away and they heard about brother brandom and uh prayed for a baby came back to life and so they sent to brother brand brother Bram you come to we'll fly you to Germany and fly you to pray and fly to pray he said let me go pray and so brother brandom he goes and he prays I don't know it's 4 the night he was out in the woods I believe it was a certain amount of time he comes back and and God said no don't you do it and brother bam had to call that sister back and go sister it's the hand of the Lord God knows better amen praise God and she says this she said what was it brother brandom my weakness of faith I said you have great faith you prayed for your baby and your husband held on to it you and your husband God raised that baby and he refused to do it because he knows what's best and you didn't go off and pout that's right he says and still you love him that's real Faith hallelujah amen anybody when mountains are moving and things can have faith but let it go backwards one time and see how it works then you then that's when you prove whether you got faith hallelujah or not it's when you when you're wanting something and you lose it and you're left standing going you've met all the requirements you've checked all the boxes and God still says no but as Christians we rest in his nose yeah that's right just as much as is yeses and that's a hard thing to do in lady OA because when we want it we get it right yeah and if and if and if we want it if we want it fast we just got to pay more money and it's overnighted right we live in the world where we where there isn't really any needs it's all just want we we live in abundance right for the most part what right but but but contentment is priceless you know God is God is is you know we we we talk about Revival right we talk about the bride's Revival um 125 oh so we we talk about Revival and and we talk so much about the brides re Revival right yes we talk about the great outpouring of God and Supernatural and days of ananas and Safara right and and and we're longing for that but but you know I I think in the midst of all of that amen praise God in in the midst of all those great outpourings of God what was the prophet's definition of a Revival and and so if unless you think there's going to be two different like do you think your Revival is going to be different than so if we're wanting those manifestations what ought we to be doing amen I think we need to be losing amen amen some of the trash that's in our lives cuz cuz if we would be honest with ourselves we all got it yes it yes amen that's right but but sometimes if we're trying to get somewhere look hey we we may be like Paul look Paul had a commission to go before Caesar but he had to lose the ship in order to get there praise God Amen right yes so so maybe we need to lose the ship maybe we need to move lose what we think we're going to get somewhere maybe we got to lose that in order to get there that's right because we can have preconceived ideas 1 + 1 equals 2 and then this and then this and and you're wrong wrong wrong and you got to lose the ship in order to get there that's how God works we got to look we we we got to be like Paul we're going to go through these real fast Paul said I have suffered the loss of all things you think about this the first church messenger the lion the lion and he's got one quot but he had to lose all things and he count him but D that he might win Christ Moses Moses was a mighty man of God but he had to lose the throne and then after that he had to go on the backside of the desert and lose everything that he thought he gained in his wisdom and understanding and when we became so broken and lost amen amen that he would say to God who am I that I should go under pharaoh and that should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt and when he said that God said you're ready hallelujah hallelujah that's what I wanted to hear Lord who are we Who Am I who are we really you who you say you say I'm am Brad are we how do we know ask all the the the the the the the ones that fell away that's rubbish sheeps on the side of the the highway way of God ask them if they thought look at their archives and find out how many times they pumped their chest and said they were bride when when you look at brother bram's life look at his life when that man that man that man held the sword amen amen that was pulled out on Joshua yeah amen amen unless you believe there's two swords but I got a quote says God has one sword that's his word so that same sword that was poured out on Joshua the captain of the Lord's host are you for us or against us that same sword struck that prophet's hand that that Prophet that had those Seven Seals revealed to him loosed that got caught up in the cloud yes that same Prophet that had a mountain range that's right with his life written across it right what but at the end of his life you know what he'd say he said says if you call me a prophet I want you to hear this is in 1964 after the sword in the hand after the after after the mountain range after him putting the hand on the back of that shirt and his hand fitting the angel of the Lord perfectly after all of the mighty things that happened to him he would say this and if you call me a prophet I don't say I am but if you call me that remember I'm saying to you in the name of a prophet see in the name of a prophet of Resurrection Rapture will be a general all over the entire world no matter where you're at when that hour comes you'll be called up to meet him there's nothing going to stop you no matter where you are I only hope that I'm there what he's went beyond the curtain of time they they lifted him up you think that's artificial humility in 64 he's saying you think he's being humble and proud of it he says and I only hope that I'm there one of them I just only trust and Hope God that I'll be one of them and each one of you will be in the same I I I got I got I got seven of these here I could read to you from 64 on uh brother brandom says he he says if I don't stay with that message I'd be a traitor to God and a hypocrite to you 60 I I I I mean it what my my whole point is what amazes me is brother brandom after all of those great manifestations he would still say I'm a sinner saved by grace he would still say I hope that I'm here I'm there that day and and and I I I've I've I it just struck me a couple weeks ago and I've got seven quotes so far that I've been I'm sure there's countless more but my whole point of it is is that man never did exalt himself right but he stayed Little he stayed Little and and and and if and if we as the people of God ought not we to do the same amen ought not we to do the same brother Brenham says he said he says it isn't just the way that people get today let God just bless a fellow and put a little confidence in him and he gets all to be a know-it-all he gets to be he's got to start an organization he's got to do something that's different oh you know different Revelation different Doctrine you know but he says how art thou fallen from Heaven oh Lucifer he said God has a hard time to get some drop body that he can deal with that'll stay humble and me can stay in the place until God calls him to do something you believe that see a man that God can bless and he'll still keep himself a man amen not be an angel or a right God as soon as man gets blessed and has a little something given to him he wants to become oh my well well wait a minute brother Gabe I thought we were praise God Amen remember brother B brother B are are are you are you Christ well in one way in one way you'd make me Antichrist but in another way he wants to become a god well in one way you'd be Antichrist in another way amen amen he wants to become an angel he wants to become some great person what I do he says me and me and mine and all that that's wrong he said attitude God's hunting that for somebody who could bless he could bless and pour out the blessings and more he blessed the litterer that's good the man will become and you'll never get more of God until you become nothing you've got to belittle yourself he that will exalt himself God will bring a base he that will humble himself God will exalt you've got to get little before you can get big and you'll never be big in your own self I love this you'll only be as big as God will be big in youo preach brother Brandon you'll only be as big as God will be big in you so where does our strength come from that's it where where does our power come from you know where it come from Qui [Music] me the Bible says in returning in rest shall you be saved in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength see it it it's not about how loud we can be I you don't have to prove to your bride to nobody that's right right matter of fact if you're trying to tell me your bride I'm going question whether you are or not cuz you're trying to convince me you know you know I grew up on The Other Side Tracks right so so ah this is so crude see when I when I was in on sister Karen the Lord's nudging me so so when I was in the streets right you know it was all about being a tough guy right and and it and and one thing I found in in uh when when you was you know it wasn't so much the one that was popping off yapping you don't really have to pay too much attention to him you know it's like like when I got I got arrested right and I got locked up so I went to I had to go to the jail housee right went to the block so you walk into the block you all in the orange you know got the jumpsuit on and uh and I remember I was down uh in uh uh a bigger a bigger County Jail uh down by Indianapolis and it was you know the big boys right so so I walk in the block and and uh there's this one guy and he's yapping and he yapped the whole time I was there I was a short timer so I wasn't going to Yap back but but all the yapping he was doing I wasn't worried about him there a bit cuz he was trying to prove to everybody that he was the tough guy of the block but I wasn't worried about him cuz I saw through him that he was just trying he was trying to put people on Front Street you see understand what I'm saying you know who I was watching for I was watching for that quiet one right I they called him the old head I was I was looking for the old head because that's the one you know don't play cuz he knows who he is and if you try to test him on who he is he's going to prove to you who he is right and and in this thing called life friends when you see people trying to look you have to have that's that's my I know that's so crude but but but when you have that quiet confidence you know who you are and it don't matter what anybody not that you I I care what you think about me but it's a balance but I don't let how you think about me control me that's right you understand what I'm saying if I did I would be trying to talk like brother Emanuel I would be trying to preach like brother Chad right but but I'm not brother Emmanuel and I'm not brother Chad right and and so the thing of it is because we are not trying to conform the image we're trying to conform is to the image of Jesus Christ that's who we're trying to be like that's the image that matters and and and and when we come to that spot it gives us it that's where you find your strength that's right because God Made You To Be You amen you are part of that bouquet bride but you have to have confidence in the in the part of that bouquet that you are and it takes a molding and it takes a loss of ourself yes sir right and I know I'm going long but but but listen you know when when when Jo when look when Joseph was in that pit right do you think if if Pharaoh would have picked him up the next day he would have had the grace in his heart that he would be able to say when he was on uh when he was right there in the palace he' be able to say now therefore be not grieve nor angry with yourselves that you sold me hither for God did send me before you to preserve life all of those losses in his life were transformed into gains and if he didn't have all of those losses in life he would never have the character to be able to say those words he would never have the understanding to be able to say what he said and do what he did to preserve the nation of Israel and the same thing holds true for us the losses that we have in life are really for our gain they're really for our good do you think David look at David when he lost everything that man had to fight after he was anointed not with a vial manmade not Anointed with a horn of oil God made right when he was anointed he he was ran down like a dog but once he come to the throne he had the own his own kingdom ripped from him by his own blood and when he lost everything and and that and that one his Thro spitting on him and and one of his rightand man would pull out the sword I'll take his head off David said let him alone let him curse for the Lord hath bidden him see it was the losses that he had gave him the ability to say what he said that's right and if we want to say the right thing we have to see the losses in our life and see that our losses have purpose and meaning because the only way we really grow is through loss it's when we lose is really when we gain it's when God it's those are teachable moments in our life look you little ones think about this when non was a leper think about that little Maid nonon was a captain of the host of the king of Syria and the syrians had gone out by companies and brought away captives out of the land of Israel that little itty bitty girl she lost everything the innocence of a childhood the love of Mom and Daddy and protection and now she's carried away a captive but you know what her loss was really a gain to be a missionary amen amen praise God because that little missionary Spirit came to life in the middle of her loss Hallelujah and when she could have been bitter about everything that was taken away from her she chose life and the persons that had captivated her she witnessed to yes and say there's a man that can set you free brother that it's just it's it's just all throughout the scriptures as as you look you look at look look at look at Samson when Samson lost everything he lost his Prestige of being the great anointed even though he's little bitty shrimp the great anointed man lost his Seven Locks lost his eyes and he's grinding on the meal there's several quotes where brother BR said those Seven Locks growed out how long did it take how many revolutions did he make grinding thinking about that lustful devil that took everything away from him how many countless nights everything gone but he said just once more Lord amen just once more amen and the Bible says let me die with the Philistines and he bowed himself with all of his might and the fell and the house fell upon the Lords and upon all the people that were therein so the dead which he slew at his death were more than they which he slew in his life what did Samson have to do he had to lose his life in order to keep it I don't want to just have some victories I want to live a Victorious life amen as the musicians would come but in order for us to live a Victorious Life we first have to realize am I in the fight or not I I don't know about you I don't I don't want to be just glad that I'm no longer in that lifestyle that I'm no longer in the orange jumpsuit that I no longer have to worry about when the red and blue lights get behind me what I got in the car I I I'm thankful for those things but that's still not it you can be cleaned up and still full of devils you can have a Ministry and still be full of devils gifts gifts that gifts and callings is without repentance that's right but we have to come to the realization Lord am I really found that's right that's exactly and listen young ones little ones look you ain't got to go out into the world maybe just play something quiet just something sister maybe that quiet me look all of us you young Brothers you young sisters you you got to come to the spot where you come to a messy birth you don't have to wait till you're 16 and that cell phone got a hold of you and you on things that you shouldn't be that's not it you ain't got to be tantalized with the world and tempted but look at an early age you can surrender your life right look I'll be honest with you when when I hear our pastor preach some of the messages that's being said in the ministry and I look at the altar and I think why ain't it full why are we all where we're supposed to be every one of us young and old is there no need for us to pour out it do we have every piece of trash out of our Lives now you say Brother G I I know you don't have to go to an altar but what I'm saying is why isn't the altar is where you die yes come on friends look this this right here we ain't playing church this is this is between life and death and we don't want to just have a good comfortable life I don't I don't want to just have a all the bills paid and live within our means have a nice budget and nice vehicle and you know sit over there mainly and have have a wonderful Pastor preach to me and I get up there every once in a while share a few things and I get that no and I hope you ain't the same well we just come in we hug a few necks and then and then we go back and we go back into our little life no is that what really Christianity is no the Bible says set a mark upon those that sigh and cry for the Abominations that's done in the city and if I would ask you how many has done that this week how many when when when has there been a puddle left at this altar of sighing and crying for the Abominations that's been done in Lia where are we at friends self love the love of material things we're more worried about our Amazon list than our prayer list amen we're so caught up in life and we got all the Creature Comforts but where is our burden for our lost family where is our burden for the Lost Lo ones in our assembly that you can look and see the coldness that's crept in where is it that a preacher can preach and n a deer be watered why is it that that Brothers we don't pull out the hanky that's it and wipe an eye that's it say oh god brother we're so comfortable when when when have we prayed Lord give us this day our daily bread you know why cuz the bank account's [Music] full if we want something we ain't got to pray and ask God we go to Jeff Bezos and he sends it to [Music] us come on Friends [Music] Satan L us as sleep with giving us everything everything and then we spend our whole life trying to keep it trying to keep it and we make sure we're faithful we got a budget cuz we got to pay for this insurance and brother BR said you could be Insurance poor and we're so captivated with keeping everything all I'm saying is check your motive and objective it and maybe you need to lose a few things you wonder why you're in the position you're in it's because God's trying to wake you up that's right you say why am I losing in this part of my life why am I losing in that part it's not that God's trying to keep ice cream from you he's trying to wake you up trying to make me up make me realize what is what are you doing where are you at where is our burden for our children where is our burden for the assembly where is our burden for our widows where is our burden for our broken [Music] families you tell me we are an invincible [Music] Army but that's not [Music] singular we're not an army of one that's the problem is we got we're too much us me my [Music] mine but an army is this an army is all of us everyone not just brother Chad brother Chad ain't got to crawl his way to Minnesota wherever he's at and oh Lord get away try to get filled up we ought to be praying in blessings upon him that he can go out into the wild is already being filled [Music] up don't let him do it himself don't let the deacons do it to themselves why don't you pray over that [Music] situation why don't you get a burden for one that's get a burden if you don't have a burden pray and say God wait a minute you saved me 20 30 years ago but Lord I ain't sighed and cried in Abominations for nothing in years then listen old Soldier something's wrong you got comfortable you got comfortable and we get our lives and we got everything cut out and we live everything within we got a nice little tidy box like brother Tony preached and we're in a nice little T box of time and we fail to see that eternity we're so caught up in the [Music] Box called [Music] life we're so caught up in the Invincible Army predestinated for the foundation of the world when was you saved I was was saved before the foundation of the world that's exactly right you was but I want to see it right now what what good does it do being saved before the foundation of the world when the world's here right now let me see it in your life what look let me ask you this if you was to get arrested for being a Christian would there be enough evidence to convict [Music] you if you was to get [Music] arrested and they start laying out the charges what evidence would be against you what evidence would be held against you in a court of law please don't show me the length of your skirt please don't s me your suit please don't open up your claws and say no skinny jeans here brother Gabe but if you was to get arrested what evidence you young ones I I didn't talk about I don't do this I don't do that I've kept these from my youth up that's not the evidence we're talking about that's just being a good [Music] boy but the evidence is when them co-workers start telling JY jokes they come up to you like you know better they go yeah you're right the evidence is whenever they're popping off and they they they they say they say C they say oh oh so I'm sorry see there didn't see you there sorry about that the evidence is whenever they talking and they they got a they they may give you a hard time but whenever they whenever you're all alone with with them they they'll talk to you real gentle and sweet and you'll see that that coworker is just trying to keep a front up for everybody else but they know they see when your children's all broken they'll come to [Music] you it's when when these young ones is in the house of God and you know they're going through something and they come talk to [Music] you it's when you can come to a spot and you go this right here that's my spot this is my ti post right [Music] there that TI post was anry 20 years years ago but I still go back there every now and then my spot's right there that's [Music] me you little ones look don't don't go through life just being a good boy being a good girl that's good good but get a hold of Christ find out what brother brandom's talking about look you got to get on the back side of the desert you say brother gab what does that mean that means you got to get alone and you got to pray in a room without your phone right beside you that's getting in the desert [Music] that's taking off your Apple watch that's looking on your busy calendar and go wait a [Music] minute do you have a little slot there that's a certain color that says prayer time that's unplugging from Facebook that's some pluging from Instagram and all these other things that's getting along with God and saying Lord [Music] I that's being honest with yourself and taking inventory of your life you know if anybody ever take inventory in your job I remember being at the working at at the Applebees and I know I'm keeping you Al but is this okay there may be a little one here that needs break through or something so right I remember I remember being a a a manager assistant man kitchen manager at Applebees and every software we had to go take inventory we get the clipboard out and we had a par we had to look here say we got three cans of beans and supposed to be five we had to go through and itemize every aspect of that kitchen and we had to to get it to par because of what is depleted we had to go order more to get us to par to make it through to the next order and so we'd have to take inventory to make sure we got enough but I wonder how often do we in our prayer lives take inventory [Music] not just now lay me down to sleep but really start looking and going wait a minute Lord my self-control my Temperance woo that's supposed to be on seven but really I got about two my patience oh we ran out of that last week [Music] my brotherly kindness I'm not talking about your circle I'm not talking about the ones that you fellowship with I'm talking about brotherly [Music] kindness that means you got to get out of your box right that you know you know this church we got we got like the east side and the west side that mean the West Side needs to come over to the east side right and the East Side need to come over to the West Side I talked to brother brother brother Daniels I saw shame and uh uh at at the brother 10's funeral and I I talk to him I said brother I said what church you go to he says here [Music] I I know sister [Music] yeah he said oh no I sit over there I oh you on a you're on the West Side see how we [Music] do brotherly kindness brotherly love friends we got to get out of our comfort zones if we want to make heaven we got to take inventory that means we got to lose our pride [Music] that way that means we got to lose our comfortableness and we said well brother Gabe I don't know what to say well but you know what am I going to talk about do I need to go get the a man sign I I need to get like a I need to get one of them pocket am man signs I just pull my pocket signs out on you and you know what because we want to be comfortable because we want to be comfortable we don't want to lose our pride because we don't have nothing to say how about saying brother I love you but I just don't know what to say isn't this uncomfortable and then you know what he's going to say yeah brother it is uncomfortable and you know what then y'all's going to laugh and then the faades are going to start falling because what we want we want comfort we want to be comfortable we want to be in our little niche we don't want to be out of place we want to make sure we look good we want to say what's good and the whole time friends we're missing it we're missing an opportunity to grow and what we really need to do is we need to take inventory and go wait a minute Lord I got so much in my life I need to lose I ain't got a place to order nothing cuz I got too much trash in my life and there ain't near a beer can in that inventory there ain't near a cigarette drug prescription peel ain't I I'm sure probably ain't got to worry about none of that stuff amongst you cuz y'all clean looking people brothers and sisters but that doesn't mean we ain't got stuff we got to lose there's things in life we got to lose this is the the only trip in life that we unpack before we leave we got to leave some things behind we got to lose some things before we want to take flight look when Paul and them was on that trip you know what they first did they didn't want to lose the ship so they started losing supplies they start kicking out supplies kicking out this kicking out that it still wasn't enough then they ate everything got real food no they tried every way they could to keep the ship they still had to lose the [Music] ship cuz God said the word said Paul you're going to suffer the loss of all things but you won't lose a life and we have that same promise we make we are going to have to lose everything amen amen we got to lose every bit of our Humanity every bit of our comfort zone every bit of our uh uh uh protection of 401ks [Music] and Roth [Music] our look we're we're we're trying to be out of debt and debt free and the borrower servant to the lender calm down I get it understand but you can get so consumed with that where it's get get get get get money money money money that you lose sight of all the opportunities that you could have had Eternal benefits and things of Eternal value and so God will put a sickness on you you say God yeah yeah cuz he trying to slow you down not to hurt you but he wants you to take inventory wants me to take inventory friends we are an invincible Army no doubt about it we have to take value in account of the individual losses in our [Music] life and when we suffer those officers we have to go wait a minute Lord what are you trying to get me to [Music] see look at your life friends maybe as we close our eyes about our heads quiet of this [Music] moment maybe there's some learning to be still we [Music] need maybe we too we moving too fast in life we're looking at that calendar and we looking at the reminders and we got everything mapped out but you know you can get your life so mapped out that you miss sight of what God has in store you can get that calendar so full that there's no room for God you say no I got room for him right here at this place but maybe he wants room right there in this place all I'm saying friends is look at your life check up [Music] see see [Music] that every eye every dots crossed and and no

of your resurrection and the fellowship of your sufferings don't get caught up in what your life you got planned out and you're going to do this year next year but listen today is the day of salvation and today is the only day that we have we may not have a tomorrow but while you have this moment in time if there's that little question mark in your heart look go settle it [Music] look to the
