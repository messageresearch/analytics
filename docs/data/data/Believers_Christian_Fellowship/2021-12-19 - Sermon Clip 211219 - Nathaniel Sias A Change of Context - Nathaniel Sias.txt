what does the rainbow represent the covenant so here is the one that represents the covenant is sitting on the throne but but wasn't that one just in the church ages he was in the church ages but now john is is caught up in a place and he's looking at the one what but you're on the throne but i just saw you in the church ages what changed he was looking at one context he's looking at one picture that god gave him now there was an invitation john come up higher yes lord immediately he's caught up and his context is now completely different he's not looking at the church ages anymore he's looking at the one that is on the throne it is a different context he was called up to a higher place see he's here and his context changes brother why do you keep saying context because we want to emphasize this point because remember it is the contradiction that we struggle with it seems that these two things are in direct contradiction but god never contradicts himself john is still the same person that he was five minutes ago he's still the same one but his context is now different the perspective of who jesus christ is is different than it was five minutes ago though john is the same person though john is the same son of god he is now looking at jesus christ in a different light he was looking at jesus christ in the midst of the context of time but he is no longer amen [Music] he's now seeing an eternal god sitting on the throne all we can go through well brother brother nathanael his body's not eternal that's right he was born in a natural condition but the one that is sitting on the throne is eternal he is the eternal god that was there from before we can perceive of it the self-existing one and he has represented himself to us in a way that we can catch it he was in a context that we could not relate to he was an eternal god he was self-existing he came down on sinai and they were afraid of him he presented himself in that context but when the time came to present himself differently he changed the vision so that the one seeing the vision could see him in the proper light the perspective changed it's the same god it's the same jesus christ john is here on the isle of patmos in this context the church ages haven't even taken place yet and he is already seeing beyond
