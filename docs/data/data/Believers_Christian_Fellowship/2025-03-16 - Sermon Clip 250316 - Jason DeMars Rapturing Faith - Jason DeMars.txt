========================================

we have to have the first principles you have to start with the foundation without any foundation the house will crumble but there is a need to go further there's an there's an there's there's a time there's an age and I believe that as Paul's writing this the church could go to two different direction they were to go on to Perfection that's God's that's the original intention of giving the Holy Ghost and the word coming to Paul now is the next step will the church go on to Perfection or or will they St will they fall away from their first love and so what what God's intention is to bring it back to that place he uses brother Branham his ministry Malachi 4 to restore us back to the original faith in order to get us to that place now now we're back to the original now the truth can be laid in so that we can go on to Perfection and so he says in verse but strong meat belongs to them that are of full age this word full age is the word Tios it means complete or perfect or maturity so let us go then the next verse says let us go on unto full age yeah let us go on to completion let's let us go on unto Perfection that's what Paul is speaking of so what what is going on to Perfection it's perfecting the emotions perfecting the outward things of church or it it what is it no it's the strong meat amen it's the revelation of the word it's not the milk we all need milk to start but it's it's the strong meat that we have to receive what is that strong meat that we have to receive what in the world did Paul start this Ian going to tell you about MDC think about that someone a prophet had to come on the scene and tell us about MDC because when we get the revelation of MDC that is going to bring us on to full age to maturity to perfection without the revelation of mzc there's no Perfection Paul's Paul is not like some preachers they're just shotgunning everything all over the place there's a purpose and a procedure and a process of why he's saying what he's saying and he doesn't finish it then he goes on in seven and he lays the groundwork for the prophet to pick it up in the last stage and say this is God on morpha and you know what else so are you
