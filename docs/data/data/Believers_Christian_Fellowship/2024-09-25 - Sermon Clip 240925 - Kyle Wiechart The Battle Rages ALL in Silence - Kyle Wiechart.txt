========================================

you know that Samson gave all his strength to God but he wouldn't give his heart God is only trying to find one person he can get in his hands he has always tried to do that you notice all down through the Bible when we find we found in Isaiah when we found a Jeremiah then we found a Samson one day but Samson gave his strength to God but he gave his heart to Delilah see you've got to give your all to God your reverence your respects you're everything that you are just be nothing just see how little you are and that's what God wants us to do God's not looking for you to do anything great and big in the eyes of the world did you know that I have struggled with that my whole life I've told the kids I've had a okay you know brother brother Chad said the other day he said you know what a pastor told him he struggled with something it wasn't until he confessed it that it broke I told the kids and brother Gabe was there too I said my whole life I have never felt that I had anything to offer I have struggled with that complex very much I thought there was no value to me and you know what I did from a complex I went out to try to prove my value value to this world I have had success in business and I went out and I would buy houses and you know what with every one of those houses I felt a little better about myself because there was an Evidence of my value and it was all in vain right and it meant nothing because I was already valued I was already a son what more value do I need what more do I need in this natural life than to see the grace of God come my way and reveal to me that I'm a part of him you're a part of him what do you have to prove from this point on you're a son or a daughter of almighty God there's nothing to prove to anybody but often times we do things out of our own complexes we try to cover we don't want the pain of letting a complex be dealt with often times we all do this in our own ways and guess what you all have complexes and don't you act like you don't if you believe the message of God and the prophet of God he said we all got them sir and we all got them I got them too and it's been one of those things I've fought with my whole life and God in his Mercy I believe will help me I believe he's helping me even now
