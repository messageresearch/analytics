true and sincere life's prayer that we will come out okay on the other end let's just pray together precious Lord Jesus we're thankful once again Lord to be gathered here father as your scriptures have commanded us Lord and as we so often pray but we would never want it to become common to us father we are so grateful that we can come here and gather as a people and and not just be a social event Lord we're not gathered here around a man's idea father we're gathered here around a person the person of the word the revealed word the Lord Jesus Christ himself Lord and we're ever so grateful that you have saw fit to come by our way in these closing moments of time and to open our eyes and to open our ears and to reveal yourself to us father Lord as the world is in darkness and gross Darkness on the people you've shed your love on a select group Lord that we don't have to stumble around in darkness and error and our own ideas but you have sent a clear and Guiding Light to us Lord we just worship you for that this evening father that's why we're here we're here to be edified yes we're here to be perfected yes but we're here to worship you father more than anything and to offer thanksgivings for what you've done for us we would just ask now that as we would come to this part of the service that you would come Lord as you've so Faithfully done in the past and that you would just pick up this book and that you would feed your sheep Father for I stand here as a Mir mortal very con conscience of my shortcomings and my lack of ability to do what is tasked with being done this evening father but we all know and agree that there is one here that can do what needs to be done and we just submit ourselves to you both speaker and hearer for you to accomplish that which you've purposed this service for in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we would pray amen God bless you Saints so good to be with you this evening we trust you've each and everyone had a wonderful Christmas day and time with your friends and loved ones and family we just ask that you would take your Bible and turn to John chap 13 with me I'd like to just continue with this thought that I presented last time of things that were and I don't intend to be lengthy this evening I just want to do a real quick review from the uh past service and then there was just a few loose ends I would like to tie up on this topic now I said that's what I intend now what happens is what happens but that's my intention so at least I have good intentions John 13 beginning in verse one says now before the Feast of the Passover when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the father having loved his own which were in the world he loved them until the end and supper being ended the devil having now put into the heart of judas's scariot Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from God and went to God he riseth from suffering laid aside his garments and took a c a towel and GED himself God bless you as you would have your seats and this is obviously the scripture that we're springboarding off of this Revelation that John records in the scripture that Jesus had is Paramount and extremely important and it put into action all the the culmination of Jesus's Ministry and the culmination of his purpose for being here on Earth uh to go to the cross and then to resurrect from death but this Revelation is the Revelation that was immediately preceding what put that into action and we know from here that Jud uh Jesus turns to Judas based on this Revelation that he has that he come from God and he's going to God he turns to Judas and tells him what thou doest do quickly so this was an overcoming Revelation this was not just a uh minor Revelation this was a major Revelation and this was an A lifechanging and an overcoming Revelation that it could literally overcome death itself and the suffering of the Cross and this is what Jesus had when he recognized that his hour was come that I must leave this world to depart to my fathers to my father and we know that these patterns lay in the scripture and we know that if this was the pattern for Christ this is going to be the pattern for his bride so when we as the Bride of Jesus Christ come to these closing moments of time to where we recognize that there is an hour here and the time is upon us that we are to leave this Dimension that we are to depart from this Dimension and we are to go back to the father in the fullness of that then it's extremely important that we have the same Revelation that Jesus Christ had Matthew 17:10 says and his disciples asked him saying why then say the scribes that Elias must first come and Jesus answered and said unto them Elias truly shall first come and restore all things but I say unto you that Elias is come already and they knew him not but have done unto him whatsoever they listed likewise shall also the son of man suffer of them so we know here that the disciples are approaching Jesus and they're starting to pick up on things and starting to recognize him for who he is and they pose the question if you are him and this is what's transpiring why do the scribes keep saying that Elias first has to come so Jesus brings Clarity to them reveals to them the ministry of John the Baptist but Jesus here himself when he's speaking of the Malachi 4 Ministry before the great and Dreadful day of the Lord he says elas truly shall first come and he attaches a revelation and a purpose to that Ministry so he truly shall first come before the great and Dreadful day of the Lord to restore all things so there were loose ends that had to be tied up yes there were uh there was a first pole that had to go forward yes there was a second pull yes but the purpose of that per Jesus was so that this Revelation that he could come and restore all things and this all things was the revelation of who we were before we were here where we were before we were here this was the same Revelation that Jesus portrayed that he knew that he came from God and went to God 1953 brother random says now the first man now he made the first man in His image and we are returning back to that image that's right to our first created image when God created me William brandham I was before the foundation of the world he made my being my spirit I wasn't conscience of anything as far as I know of but I was there oh I don't believe you're getting it but Jesus told the disciples that he knew them before the foundation of the world and Paul said here that he chose us in him before the world begin now there was some part of me Orman Neville and the rest of you you all here that's in Christ Jesus before the world ever began and here's to my analysis of that I think that the people today that are possessed with this Spirit a part of these Angelic beings Spirits which rotated off of God that never fell in the beginning and resisted the devil's lie in heaven and we obviously spent a lot of time on that last time so I'm just going to continue but I just wanted to refresh that to your memory 1957 questions and answers on Hebrews brother brandom says now when he the logos went out of God which was God coming from this one big Fountain into a body in the form of a man and it made the logos which we call theophany now if you take the theophany when you're looking at that that's a man now that's where we were in the beginning amen now you do not understand it now but you was back there in the beginning that way when God made Man In His Image he made him a theophany now there you are that's the way we are here we come from a higher being in the beginning we were in the image of God the veil and the Darkness keeps us from knowing it now but Jesus told his disciples that he was with them before the foundation of the world see we were you can't know it now but you was in the beginning I say praise God even if I can't know it now even if I don't have a perfect revelation of that now I'm taking his word for it that I was in the beginning and if this he starts quoting scripture and if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting Hallelujah and then we move into this theophany what we once lived so we can eat and we can shake hands and I just want to remind you as I'm reading a few more of these uh as we quickly review here my goal here is not to teach terminology because just in that one quote that we read brother brandom referenc her several things he'll say an Angelic Spirit um he would say a theophany he would say a uh uh uh spirit that didn't fall in the beginning he would say some part of you so there's different terminology that he's using here and there's different terminology that he'll use all the way up to the end of his ministry we know that he uh addresses this topic and who is this MDC very clearly uh we're not going to probably make it that far tonight but we know along through his ministry he would use different terminology but that's not what I'm here to teach on tonight there are people much more qualified for that there are people that have spent years studying that out we've heard teaching on that and preaching on that over the years um and I'm not saying that that's not important and that's not good I'm all for that I stand in support in support of that but I know that there is a tendency uh to Veer towards an intellectual conception at times and miss a principle so I'm not here to emphasize terminology to teach a terminology or an English class what I'm here to do is to emphasize how important this principle is because from 47 to 65 he uses a lot of terminology for this same topic but the principle never changes never changes One spec the principle is sound it is pure it is true and it never wavers God will see fit to Enlighten the terminology to us if he sees fit to do that but he's already done enough with the principle that I think we would be silly to stick our head in the sand and not believe it and not look at it and not accept it for what it is just because he'll use one word here and a different word here catch the principle and allow them to blend together the principle does not change and like I've said uh before at the end of the day if I just come back and say some part of me was with God in the beginning if that is the the bare minimum that I can muster up to have a revelation of I'm good I'm fine with that now I believe we have more Lane here to expound upon that but at the end of the day I am not here with an agenda I'm not here to make you see it from this way or this way or from this word what I'm here today is when when you get up and walk out of here at a bare minimum you can say the prophet the Vindicated prophet of God not me the Vindicated prophet of God clearly taught that there was some part of me in God in the beginning and I would never let I would never let Satan steal your joy from that Saints when you get confused on terminology or when you see how don't see how this can add to this ju don't let him take your joy away from that Saints rejoice in that stick to that don't allow education to steal that away from you or frustration of not being able to line everything up just accept the principle remember the Tree of Life brother random taught us the tree of life was spiritual principles spiritual principles that the tree of life was not a tree of terminology the tree of life was made up of spiritual principles hallelujah praise the Lord he says in 1960 of the unfailing realities of the Living God if a man is hungering for God you tell him say the Apostles Creed join the church put your name on here be sprinkled or immersed or whatever you want to that will never satisfy a hungry Soul see cuz they were predestinated of God to search for life they were once Angels who did not fall 2third of the angels of heaven fell that's these evil spirits working amongst people very religious you know the Bible says that you was just not always right here you were once somewhere else 1960 the uncertain sound and they just found out recently that your body is full of light x-ray proves that he says and that's Cosmic light that's in you that you're made up of full of light cells now that's Cosmic light but God is a different light but yet he's light now I think that that picture there is a great proof of what I'm fixing to say that God is light and when we were walking in light of God as sons of God God is Not Cosmic light but God's light operated through the cosmic light of our bodies ourselves we were absolutely at one time real genuine sons of God amen full disclaimer I don't understand that you will know the day that I fully understand that I assure you because you'll hear me screaming but I don't fully comprehend that I don't fully understand that but as I said before we know that brother brandham taught us the principle that God's thoughts are real God's thoughts are Eternal they're not like man's thoughts right that's right so when when I read this and I'm studying this and I see brother brandom make the statement that God's light operated that's a verb that is action through the cosmic light of our bodies Our cell me in an educated way I immediately begin to think there's no way this is a thought because a thought to me does not have cells it does not have you know action to it he says we were at absolutely at one time real genuine Son of God but as I say we would think that way but we have to remember that man's thoughts are not like God's thoughts and God's thoughts are real and God's thoughts are tangible and the light of God can operate through your being and through your cell and you be a real genuine Son of God and you still just be a thought in the mind of God because God's thoughts are so much higher than ours and as I said before I don't want to stumble anybody but this is to me this is just easy to understand when we accept the fact that God's thoughts May simply be in a different dimension and that Dimension when we're not open to that Dimension we say well it's just a thought of God well if God's thoughts are in another dimension they can be more real than this Dimension and the and God's the light of God could certainly be working through the cosmic light of our bodies and ourselves in that Dimension and that Dimension could just be known as the thoughts of God but it is more real than this Dimension that we set in now so the emphasis is on the thoughts of God because the thoughts of God are what is real it is what is eternal what we see here this is a thought of man this is a thought of man everything you see right here outside of these individuals everything material Goods here is the thoughts of man this this is what man had an idea and then sat down and constructed and put together brother brandom says God's thoughts are not like that he does not have a blueprint that maybe one day he'll get to and put together but when God has a thought it is real it is tangible it is eternal so much higher than our thoughts but this is just another prime example of what I wanted to emphasize when we read that through education and through teaching you know our mind starts going haywire how is it a thought but it has cells if it has Sals it's real it's tangible it's no longer a thought throw education out the window it does not exist in the mind of God it does not exist in the Realms of God we thank God that we have prophetic insight into the mind of God and that prophetic Insight is what interprets the mind of God to us not our education and what you know we learned the word was in third grade that's that's certainly not not going to to hold weight Israel and the church 1953 he says now you didn't become a Christian just coincidence because you become a Christian before you was in this world before you were born God ordained you to be a Christian from the Garden of Eden from before the foundation of the world all you say is that right brother that's the truth before there ever was you know anything there was a time that you knew amen but your mind is darkened to that now there's only been one man on Earth that knew that he was from before and that was Jesus he said glorify me father with the glory that I had with you before the foundation of the world he was the Incarnate God he could move back there and know what is I'm sorry he could move back there and know what was but our minds are blackened there obviously we know that we came different from Jesus Christ we came through the to fall and he did not and there was something that we came without that he did not even though brother brandham said he was 100% man but he also said he was 100% God so he had that capacity to move back there brother brandom says and remember where he came from not as and he makes the statement here that there was only one man that knew that now we know we stand here as a or sit here as a privileged group of people and we know that not in the perfe ction that Christ knew it though cuz he's saying that our minds are still dark to that we don't have a perfect revelation of that Jesus's revelation of that was not skewed it was not darkened it was not blackened he could move back there and have a perfect knowledge of that through the gift of a prophet that has been brought to us now we have a partial revelation of that um we have an insight into that but it's not the same as Jesus Christ because Jesus Christ was not hybrid we came with a hybrid mind we came with a with a hybrid body and again I don't have all the understanding of that but for whatever reason that has to be blackened to us that has to be darkened to us at one time it wasn't at one time brother Brandon said you knew that we didn't wonder if we were Sons and Daughters of God it wasn't a question we knew yes we knew just the same as Jesus Christ knew when he was here on Earth but now through the plan and the permission of God we have come in this condition but as I said before I thank God for a prophet I thank God for the gift of a prophet that was sent to me that I dealt that this does not have to be completely darkened to me that there has come a Vindicated word in this hour to start pulling back that spiritual Amnesia maybe not in its entirety yet but I believe we're getting there and I believe we will get get there and and we will have that perfect understanding if we need that prior to the Rapture we'll have it prior to the Rapture if we can make it with in the Rapture without a perfect understanding of that we'll make it without that but I believe that through the full word that's been delivered amen I believe that we have perfect rapturing Faith available to us even without maybe the all the terminology not lining up I believe we have been privileged and given enough that we're not we're not going to be left hanging and having to figure out terminology on a topic such as this remember the terminology is not ever what's going to change your atoms the terminology is simply The Vessel and the vehicle that God would use to try to reveal something to us it's it's and brother random taught us these principles in the Book of Revelation in the Book of Genesis he says those are books of symbols you know go God God is a spirit why does God need a marble Throne to be setting on brother Ram says no no no he says these are symbols so it's not even the symbols that are real but the symbols are the vehicle to try to get the thoughts of God over to us in our fallen condition and I believe that we understand that and know that so even though our minds are blackened there I believe that there's been light shed on that and I believe there's been enough light shed on that that the spiritual Amnesia of the principle is gone even if I don't have a perfect understanding of it he says continuing in that same message he says now we've got to come to full Doctrine I like good old shouting meetings where we just clap our hands or shout and have a good time have great powerful services and things dance on the bubble as it were but then when The Showdown come time comes you don't know where you're standing I'll interpret that if you'll allow me that Showdown time he was referring to is the trials in your life am he says when The Showdown time comes you don't know where you're standing let's get back and find out let's find out what's making us do that let's get back to the foundation see this is a foundational principle per the prophet let's get back to the foundation of why we're rejoicing let's get back to the foundation of why we're dancing let's get back to the foundation so that when the trials and the tribulation comes we're not scattered and blown like the wind blown With the Wind let's get back to the foundation the major principles of God know where we come from and know where we're going so that when The Showdown time comes we're not shaken so here's the few things that I wanted to you know kind of wrap up this topic with now in the church age book brother brandham says speaking on the topic of predestination he said before I close this subject I know there is a question in your minds you will want to know if I believe in the doctrine of preexistence I don't believe in that Mormon doctrine of the pre-existence of souls any more than I believe in re reincarnation or the transmigration of souls be careful here and see this it is not the person that comes predestinated eternally from God it is the word or seed that is it way back there too far back for the human mind to grasp the Eternal go he said for the human mind to grasp he didn't say for your soul to grasp so don't run away from it and say oh there's no point in trying he said way back there too far for the human mind to grasp Amen Let me quote a scripture to you let the mind of Christ be in you so get rid of your human mind let the mind of Christ be in you so even if it's too far back for your human mind it's not too far back for your soul amen way back there too far back for the human mind to grasp the Eternal god with eternal thoughts thought and decreed Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated so he's stating this principle Jacob have I loved Esau have I hated this is way too far back in the mind of God for you to grasp so my question is to you why do you believe it still if your human mind can't believe that or can't grasp that why do you still believe in the predestination and the sovereignty of God that Jacob have I loved and Esau have I hated and you apply you have the audacity to the apply that to your life that you were predestinated from God if that is too far back for your human mind to grasp why do you still believe it cuz there's something else besides your your human mind that the spiritual Amnesia has been stripped away from that the light of God has shed upon and given you the ability eyes to see and ears to hear he says Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated and neither was born neither had done good or evil see it was the thought and and then that thought became expressed and God brought bought back Jacob because Jacob alone was seed Jacob alone had the seed that is why he had respect to the birthright and the Covenant of God if you are true seed you will hear that word the spirit will baptize you into the body of Christ filling you and empowering you and you will receive the word for your day and age see how clear the true evidence becomes when the word of God is revealed to you I say praise the Lord for that because there has been thou hundreds of years of the truth of the new birth being skewed and being falsely represented and now he says see how clear it is once the word has been made known to you that if you are seed yeah the spirit will baptize you into the body of Christ filling you and empowering you and you will receive the word for your day and your age see how clear the true evidence becomes then I would say don't ever make it any more than what the prophet said it was if he said the true evidence was to receive the word for your day and your age let it be that there is nobody else on the face of the Earth that has the capacity to receive the full true word for this day in this age outside of the elect of Jesus Christ and I don't care how many mistakes youve made today this week last week whatever it doesn't change what the Vindicated Prophet said the true evidence was it doesn't change the fact that if you have the capacity to receive the full word of God for this day in this age as delivered by a Vindicated prophet there is only one people on the face of the Earth that has that [Music] capacity you Lord shortcomings mistakes willful Disobedience doesn't change any of that if you have that capacity it means one thing right now shortcomings mistakes and willful Disobedience will put a lot of scars on your back it it will do that it's not if it will do that but scars on your back still won't change what capacity that you have so I want to go back to this uh just just briefly here because if you would just read this in this context it would almost sound like brother brandom doesn't believe in pre-existence and he doesn't believe in all these statements that he's made from 47 to 65 but we know there has to be a truth somewhere here but brother random does not say that he says you will want to know if I believe in the doctrine of pre-existence that's the question he says I don't believe in that Mormon doctrine of pre-existence I'm not Mormon I can't tell you what that Doctrine is but he gives us a little insight here he says in the pre-existence of souls any more than I believe in the reincarnation or the transmigration of souls so me just applying biblical uh definitions to this we know that Adam did not become a living Soul until God formed him out of the Dust of the earth made him a flesh body and put a and breathed in him breathed in him the breath of life and then the scripture says he became a living Soul so brother random from my understanding is saying that Adam never existed in that condition in that form in that manifestation as a flesh man with a soul PRI to being in this Dimension and in that manifestation as recorded in the scriptures now I could be wrong here if I am our pastor will come and correct me but this and I'm open to that um like I said I am not an authority on this but this is just me applying what I see in the scriptures to the statements that brother random is making because you would you would have to be foolish to read the message and not think that brother brandham doesn't believe in any type of pre-existence I mean there are dozens and dozens and dozens of statements to where he clearly says that but he is addressing now what form that was in and the form that that was is not the form that we find ourself in now right it's not even the form that Adam found himself in before he fell so there was a different form there was a different manifestation I'll say there was there was possibly different forms and different manifestations and different Expressions prior to this one I don't know that there was just one but there was at least one and at the very least it was a thought in the mind of God which by the way again was real so real that the light of God could work through it if that was the same expression if not then there was another expression and it was just as real but he's making a a teaching here so that the people do not believe a false Doctrine as presented by the Mormons that he does not believe in the pre-existence of The Soul Man in that in this condition as a living Soul prior to this Dimension but he brings Clarity to that he said it is not the person so it's not your flesh being it's not this 16 elements that you're setting in here today we know that it can't be that because even that is in a hybrid situation but he says it's not that person that came predestinated eternally from God it is the word that is inside of that person so it is the word or he says it is the word or seed that is inside of that hybrid 16 elements that you're you are packing around that word and that seed in those elements and even though that full manifestation when I see you I see a body I see eyes and ears and so that's not the Eternal part and as brother Brandon referenced it he says you've never seen me so it's not that expression that I can see with my natural eyes here that is important that is eternal that was in the mind of God how could God it is not that God didn't know you would end up in a hybrid condition but God's Eternal thoughts would not put you in a hybrid condition that is not not how he knew you he says it is the word or the seed that is it way back there too far for the human mind to grasp but he's given us some light on that he's shedding light on that so that we're not going astray and you know there's a lot of things that tie into that first you believe that you were a a human in uh before you were in this world and then you know people went crazy with that now you weren't just a human but before this you were a buffalo and then before that you were an ant and now if you squish a fly you're right that could have been my grandmother and he says we don't believe in that we don't believe in The Reincarnation we don't believe in the transmigration this manifestation that we find oursel in right now is not the same manifestation that pre-existed what pre-existed is the word that's the Eternal part or the seed so he puts those two terminologies to it the word or the seed that is what is eternal now we want to hold that in our mind because I'm going to be speaking on that specifically now because that is very easy just to say and it becomes a cliche oh yeah the word in me was before oh yes you know the seed that was in me and that's true I'm not against the cliches but I've heard cliches all my life there is a truth to this and I want to the best that I can just cut a little piece of that off tonight and let you walk out of here tonight maybe with a little bit more of an understanding or uh Foundation of what does that really mean what does he really mean when he says it was the word or the seed that was eternal before I do that I I need to read you this other quote in the church age book he says now I know in answering one question another one is apt to come up and people ask me if Eve fell that way what did Adam do so he was just speaking how Eve was deceived and the serpent begal her and she fell uh because she did not believe the full word of God and they're saying if Eve fell that way what did Adam do for God lays the blame on Adam he says that is simple that's simple of course well of course it's simple why would we think that would be complicated the word of God this is extremely important the word of God is forever settled in heaven this is a principle we have to catch if we're going to catch anything else we have to catch this the word of God God is forever settled in heaven before one Speck of Stardust was made that word God's law was there exactly as it is written in our Bible we have to catch this so when this came along it was not the first manifestation of this amen he said this was forever settled in heaven before there was one Speck of Stardust and it was there exactly as we find it here forever settled he says now the word teaches us that if a woman don't get hung up on this principle I'm not going to preach on marriage and divorce and I don't want your minds to stay but I have to read this so you understand where he's coming from but stay focused on the principle that I'm reading here not on the example he says now the the word teaches us that if a woman leaves her husband and goes with another man she is an adulteress and is no longer married and the husband is not to take her back that word was true in Eden as it was true when Moses wrote it in the law so he's saying before Moses wrote that in the law it was already true it was already settled it was already written in heaven exactly the way Moses finally came and wrote it it had already been done and it was already settled in so much that God used it as judgment against Adam the word can't change Adam took her back he catch this he knew exactly what he was doing but he did it anyhow my question to you is how did Adam know he was exactly what he was doing and that he was transgressing the laws of God when it had never even been written praise God because Adam didn't have the Blackness on him like we have on us at that point in time that was prior to the fall he was not confused brother brandom says he was not confused he says he knew exactly what he was doing and he did it anyhow before it was ever written in the Bible That's how real it was it was so real that Adam knew what he was doing was wrong he knew it was a violation of God's word and it was so real that God could come on the scene and say you knew this was wrong and now I am still righteous even though it's not written down on paper you knew this was wrong and it is so real and settled here in heaven that I am still righteous to pass judgment on you that's how real it was the principle is that that didn't change just because we're now in 2023 we would view that as a negative example as in it's real it was real before and there were people judged by it but if it's real for the negative example it still has to be real for the positive example 1963 questions and answers on the seals is it true that every Jew born since Christ that came into the world is to be saved he says no nothing will be saved only those whose names were put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world Jew or Gentile see that's all the book holds that Myster what book and when did it come into existence this book holds the mystery of who is to be saved what book where is it it written and when did it become into existence the book holds the mystery and the book is only unfolding it now not each one's name but what the mystery of the book is while it's calling those names you finally understand that now I'm sure everybody raised their hand and said yes the book does he continues the book doesn't say now LEL is to be saved in time of this church age or Oreville or whoever no it don't say that the book it just shows the mystery it unfolds the mystery of what the thing is if you allow me to interpret that to you it infolds the mystery of what the word for your age is it unfolds that mystery of what the book is and what the thing is but we ourselves by faith believe it that's what I said the other night amen so this book is the word of God this book is the Lamb's Book of Life this is The Book of Life this is the record of the elect and he is saying that there is nobody going to be saved besides what's already on this book but this book is only unfolding itself now he says this it shows the mystery it unfolds The Mystery of the thing and he says this book holds that mystery and the book is only unfolding now not each one's name but what the mystery of the book is while it's calling those names so as this book unfolds and as this mystery unfolds it somehow reveals or calls those names amen someone said well there's no need in me trying it brother brandham brother brandom said there's only one to be saved out of Jeffersonville now you see it's showing a parable that isn't it isn't it there might be thousands saved I don't know I hope every one of them is saved but I don't know but here is the way I want to believe it I'm that one you believe the same way for you if you don't then there's something wrong with your faith you're not sure what you're doing how can you walk up there in the face of death when you're not too sure whether you're saved or not how can you go down here and say to this crippled man laying here blinded and twisted up thus sayith the Lord rise up Jesus Christ makes you whole how can you stand that old cold stiff body laying there that's dead and been dead for hours and hours and laying there cold and stiff and say thus sayith the Lord rise to your feet you better you have to know what you're talking about you say well death claims everything it's all G on yeah but when the word of God is revealed you know it's God that changes things am so he's teaching this principle that you have to know where you're standing before you're going to accomplish anything for the kingdom of God even before you're going to be uh stable and secure in your own salvation and the only way to do that is through the unfolding of this mystery the unfolding of this book because as it does that it will call your name and if it calls your name that means your name is on the book and if your name is on the book that means you can no more be lost than God can be lost because his word that book was forever settled in heaven and it was eternal and it was real amen just as real as when Adam knew what he was doing he was transgressing the laws of God it was so real then that God can now come down and pass judgment it is the same reality it is same it has the same Eternal quality that it can now not in judgment but now in Grace come and be revealed somehow some way that you would hear your name under that and that would give you a security and a stability that I came from God I'm going to God because my name is on this book I have heard my name called as this mystery has been revealed God now this is if by God's grace he'll allow me to do this this is where I want to make the rubber meet the road because you can take everything that I've said up to this point as cliches but this is where the rubber will meet the road I'm going to ask you if you can hear your name let's go to Malachi don't turn there I'm going too fast Malachi 4:5 behold I will send you Elijah thank you amen why are you happy why are you rejoicing why do you have your hands up I didn't not say your name I did not say your name that's exactly right because there is a book being revealed there is a power and the unveiling of God that can give you eyes to see and ears to hear behold I send you what audacity you in a hybrid condition you with thank you as you behold I will send you saints of God I don't care if there is only one person going in a Rapture behold I will send Benjamin seabolt Elijah the prophet and if he so cared about me to send me Elijah the prophet prophet he only has one point in doing that so that he can reveal himself to me and that he can give me a proper understanding of where I came from and where I'm going so that I will recognize it is now my time to depart out of this world unto the father he might I I'll say it like brother brandom said it I'm glad that it doesn't say Benjamin seabolt right there because there might be two Benjamin seab bolts on the face of the Earth but I am here to tell you by Revelation it might as well say that I will send Benjamin seabol born on finwick mountain in ji January the 4th 1985 I'm talking too fast I'm probably going to give false facts so don't don't pay attention to that you know what I'm getting at it might as well put my DNA chemistry makeup right there there is no doubt of who that you is I encourage you to believe it for yourself the availability to believe it to yourself is there allow it to call your name behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the heart hearts of the fathers to the children well I thought Malachi 4 spoke about brother brandom it does it does but there's also a you in there and there's these children yeah see brother brandham has a purpose to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children well who's the children I know who Elijah is but who is this you and who is this children and they're mentioned again and the hearts of the children to the fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with the curse this is the word of God is it not this is real this is eternal and and this was forever settled in heaven even before Elijah showed up in a tangible body even before God gave me eyes and an education to read the words and say behold I send you before any of that happened this was already settled in heaven that I'm sending Benjamin seabolt Elijah the prophet and he will come to a point one day he will recognize that he is a child of God that needs his heart turned back to the fathers yeah that is how the book calls your name that is how you this is what brother Brandon was talking about the Eternal part the word or the seed not your hybrid body not the condition you find yourself in but that Revelation that day and that time or that night wherever it was at in a church building in a barn in your bedroom wherever it was at when you read that and you all of a sudden had a spark in your heart to have the to have the audacity to think that's me amen what if that is me that was forever settled in heaven and that was the Eternal portion and that is what is going to stabilize us come what may Revelation 10:7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery the book The Mystery I know who that seventh angel is but the mystery of God should be finished who is this mystery because it sounds familiar to me it sounds like somebody said that to me before it it sounds almost like my name this mystery of God should be finished this final manifestation of God is going going to be finished Christ in Bride form is going to be finished saints of God the bride is made up of people and those people have names and those names are not necessarily written in Black Ink and white paper but they can say the mystery and all of a sudden something as brother Brandon would say something would come tumbling down through a mystical Channel and I would recognize that I am that mystery the voice of the seventh angel when he begins to sound when he begins to call names the mystery of whether I'm on that book or not's going to be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets and the voice which I heard you say well that's John that's not you the voice that I heard from Heaven spake unto me you said well that's John no that's me you can you can say it's John if you want to but that's meise spake to me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth and I went into the angel I went into the angel I went to the angel you said well I never went to the angel did you pick up a message book yeah did you turn on a tape did you listen to what somebody had to say about Elijah the prophet coming into the scene and I went into the angel and I said give me the little book give me the little book me me that me in the scripture is a person Saints and that person is written in the word of God forever settled in heaven Eternal real give me the book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth look at all these personal pronouns I would encourage you if there is anything that I could do tonight I would encourage you do not leave this with John and that's just not me saying that we we have a Vindicated Prophet saying that John represented the bride yes we're not out in left field on this teaching Saints we're not out in left field a prophet would say who this is representing but it has to remember what he said the new birth was is Jesus Christ revealed to the individual you can say Amen all night long when I say that's not John but that's just coming out of Egypt you got to say that's me to get into the promised land our goal is not to just come out of Egypt and wander around in the wilderness of who the mystery is and who who that thy is and who that me is our goal is to get out of Egypt get out of the darkness and get into the promised land to where we can recognize that is not just John that is me sweet as honey and I had eaten it up my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and Nations and tongues and Kings you say well John sure did do a good job on that did anybody testify to a coworker this week did anybody testify to a stranger did anybody testify to their their their family at Christmas amen that what you were doing to your coworker sir to your family at Christmas to the stranger at Walmart was forever settled in heaven and it was so real that God wrote it down thou must Pro thou put your name in there thou must speak of the true word of God to your family member that's lost and astray during Christmas in 2013 23 sorry amen remember we're still in Fallen vessels you say well nah that's too simple that saints of God that is the rubber meeting the road you make it cliches if you want to you make it fairy dust if you want to that's the reality of the word of God thou must prophesy again before many peoples and Nations and tongues and Kings let me read you one more Revelation 22:16 Jesus I Jesus have sent my angel to testify unto you just in case you don't know that angel was the seventh angel and that angel was the same angel that was in Malachi 4 and that angel was also sent to me there and I was a child so that I would not be cursed and I would not be destroyed in the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and here he is again I have sent M Angel to testify unto you this is the portion brother brandom says it is not the person that came predestinated and eternal from God it is the word or the seed you can't make it anything else do you have like some paper and ink in your heart you're going to pull out one day and be like see the word is in me no brother Rand says when that mystery is revealed it calls your name that name is eternal recorded by God himself in The Book of Life prise God it might say you it might say me it might say thy it might say thou might say whatever personal pronoun is out there and available but if you have the capacity to understand I'm the one he sent that angel to why not have the capacity to say I have my name written in the book because he didn't send that angel to anybody else besides those names that were written in the book he says nobody else but the redeemed nobody else but the elector even considered in Redemption amen I Jesus have sent M Angel to testify unto you these things in the churches I am the root and offspring of David and the bright and morning star and the spirit and the bride and the Spirit and the bride say come amen have you ever invited anybody to come into the truth of this hour based on what where do you get your Authority from who are you to invite somebody into the truth of the hour oh praise the Lord because the spirit and B Benjamin seabolt say come put your name in there don't hesitate to put your name in there if you have believed the truth and you know who the angel is and you believe what he has came and told you why can't you put yourself in the position that the spirit in me as the Bride of Jesus Christ is saying come and if you're identifying yourself as the Bride of Jesus Christ you are written in the Eternal un infallible word of Jesus of word of God that remember was forever settled before there was a speck of Stardust see now we're getting down to the reality of how we were real in the thoughts of God and in the mind of God because his word was in his mind yeah and his word consisted of people amen that's the best way I know to say it his word can consisted of people read the Bible what's the Bible made up ofah people people people and you'll find that those people that are in the scriptures that had power before God and that made a difference on this Earth had a revelation one day yeah amen that I think my name's written in that book I'm hearing a voice that sounds familiar it's telling me something that I feel I have heard before it sure Rings true in my heart of hearts there's nobody else recorded in here that I know that says they read the word of God thought it sounded good didn't know if it was them or not and they found them you know in the Millennium and in the new heavens and new earth everybody in here right past present and future somehow had some type of spiritual Amnesia stripped off of them to where they could have an individual Revelation amen Jesus Christ and that's what I was getting to earlier before I went off on whatever tangent I went off on brother brandom says the New Birth was Jesus Christ personally revealed to you how is he going to personally reveal himself to you if he never calls your name amen look at all the angels that came to people in the Bible the first thing that most of those angels did was properly identify the people they came to thou Gideon I'm probably going to get my name is mixed up now but just forgive me you know the principles thou Gideon thou Mighty Man of Valor Mary thou highly beloved of God highly favored and beloved of God you think that's what she was thinking before the angel showed up she didn't have a clue she was highly favored and beloved of God but this Angel comes with a book and he strips the Mysteries off the book and they give a proper identification Gideon Mary the list just goes on and on why let it stop with you do we think now that this is dead and he won't do this two the same thing 2,000 years later if Jesus Christ is going to personally reveal himself to you why would he not call your name and reveal your name to you amen I hope that brings Clarity of how we are Eternal and how we are real yes as the word or seed of God that was forever settled in heaven it is not just a cliche it is real if you let it be real and if you let it be real I would just say as brother random we said all things are possible to them that believe if you truly believe that you are a son or daughter of God what is not possible see this is not majoring on a minor this is majoring on a major the major is that you recognize and have a proper understanding who you are before God and if you have that now all things are possible this is what Peter teaches in the scripture make your calling and election sure because if you do that you won't fail Yeah by default if you don't make your calling an election sure what are you going to do you're going to fail this is a major this is a must amen this is the new birth amen this is Jesus Christ personally revealed to you remember the scripture says we are not born to Flesh and Blood we are born by the word of God Amen amen the word of God is what will allow you to have a new birth yeah how I just gave you the examples amen you are going to have somehow supernaturally have something come down from a Heavenly Dimension and ring true in your soul that I am that you I am that me am I am that thy and when you do that and you proper place that for your day and for your hour as brother brandom said one of these days you're going to find out God is in you you say well that's nice I like the sounds of that but brother Benjamin I am just not there yet that's fine not a problem find yourself in this scripture Isaiah 53:1 who who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of dry ground he hath no form nor comeliness and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we shall desire him he is despised and rejected of men a Man of Sorrows acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he hath borne our griefs have you ever had any griefs surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and Afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions you say I can't see myself as bride tonight that's fine see yourself as a transgressor then find yourself in the scripture and work for it I don't say that to condemn you I'm not saying that to Belo you I'm just saying if there's a progress from Glory unto Glory that he's going to call us through and if you can't see yourself as the one taking the book and you can't see yourself as the one prophesying again and you can't see yourself as the Bride of Jesus Christ saying come that's okay start in Isaiah 53 who has believed that Jesus Christ is the Son of God who has believed the report who is the arm of the Lord revealed to he was bruised for my transgressions I can accept that I'm a transgressor and I need somebody to atone for that he was he was wounded for my transgressions he was bruised for my iniquities the chastisement of the peace that I needed was upon him and with his stripes I am healed you say I can't see myself there yet that's fine do you need healing see yourself in the scriptures do you need your transgressions covered for see yourself in the SC the the scriptures here don't leave this as people 2,000 years ago yeah if you got to start off on the Bottom Rung start off on the Bottom Rung we all did here there is no shame in that the only shame is not starting off on the bottom run the only shame is thanking your bride when you haven't even repented yet thanking your bride trying to tell people to come and you don't have a clue where you're taking them to Isaiah 53 I can find myself there you say well I haven't found myself yet well here you go verse six all all we like sheep have gone astray you might not see yourself as the perfect spotless virtuous bride of Jesus Christ right now and that's okay find yourself as one that is his sheep yeah that has went astray and start working your way from there yeah I'll say it this way let him start working his way from there you work as much as you can but understand it's going to be a work that he does but he'll never have anything to work work with if you can't hear your name called he's calling he's hollering he's screaming he's not going to say John Becky suszie so forth he's going to say all of you have went astray it's up to you to believe or to reject if you're one of those all all we like have like sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone to his own way and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb so he opened not his mouth he was taken from prison and from judgment you ready and who hallelu shall declare his generation if you find yourself in all of the negatives find yourself in the positive accept all the negatives I am a transgressor I have fallen in iniquity I have went my own ways but I'm repenting for that I am a sheep of his fault and I coming back under the shepherd's word and now I will declare his generation I will declare that he is here in flesh again I will declare that he has come in the form of his bride I will declare and say come to this truth I will prophesy again with the life that I live this is the word that he was referring to and there's many other scriptural examples we can go from Genesis to Revelation and be here till forever but we have to let the book call our name and we've had a Vindicated Prophet come on the scene and tell us how that happens and now shed light and give us a proper understanding of what he means when he says we were a word a seed in the mind of God and we were real and eternal and that word was forever settled in heaven your spiritual placement was forever settled in heaven before there was one spec of Stardust he said if it was settled then I'm pretty confident that what you did yesterday today two weeks ago a month ago didn't change that amen it didn't it can't and that's his grace amen because I'm sure you just like me have sure tried to change that before and we've sure stuck our foot in stuff we didn't need to and our hands and stuff we didn't need to and our eyes and our ears and everything else and we've allowed Satan to come come along and try to change that spiritual position but I thank God it was forever settled in heaven yeah I thank God that he chose and not me I thank God that He gave the Revelation that he sent it tumbling down that he sent me an angel that he could turn my heart back it's got to be true for somebody Saints am he did he said I'm sending my word forth and it will not return void unto me I say if nobody else will accept it I'll accept it I will be that you I will be that me I will be that thy 1 John 3:1 says behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we we should be called the sons of God I say amen and amen behold what manner of love the father has bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God remember the son a son scripturally def defined a son is something that comes out of the father it doesn't include you sisters a son is just something that comes out of the father a daughter can come out of the father and it be called a son not in the perverted way that the world wants to make it today it's just terminology the scripture is using what love the father has bestowed upon us that we should be called something that come out of the father amen right therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not beloved now we are the sons of God and it doth not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is and every man that hath this hope in him purified himself even as he is pure whosoever committeth sin transgress transgresseth also the law for sin is in the transgression of the law and ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins and ye know and Ye Ye is a person who knows that who knows that he was manifested to take away our sins is somebody hearing their name called you know that he was manifested to take away your sin and in him is no sin whosoever abideth in him whosoever whosoever is a person I'm just here to say that whosoever that whosoever is it was forever settled in heaven whosoever that is it does they don't have a choice whether they're going to heaven or not they're going to make it whosoever that is yeah whosoever abideth in him sinth not whosoever sinth hath not seen him neither known him little children let no man deceive you he that doeth righteousness is righteous even as he is righteous he that committeth sin is of the devil for the devil sinth from the beginning for this purpose was the son of God made manifest that he might destroy the works of the devil remember the Son of God is something that came out of God yeah and the purpose of something coming out of God into a manifestation was to destroy the works of the devil right you say well Jesus did a fine job of that yes he most certainly did but now let me tell you what the works of the devil are the works it exposes Satan brother Brandon says revealing his works the attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's word how many have not allowed Satan to discredit God's word in their life God praise God if you do that in the fullness of the word of God by default you are a son of God you have no there is nobody else that has that capability Amen to not let discredit even a small portion of the word of God in their life there's only one class of people that has that capability I'm not talking in partiality I'm talking in fullness of the revealed word for this day and this hour if you have not let Satan discredit any of that to you amise God you are a son of God not will be you are actually you will be because it won't change because you are already and you have been the Son of God was made manifest to dis to destroy the works of the devil why are you not letting Satan discredit the word of God in your life because you think it's a good idea because you like the church you go to it's because you're a Son of God let's not make it more complicated than what it has to be Satan's work is the attempt to destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's word and the scripture says that there is Sons there is manifestations that have came out of God with one person purpose to destroy the works of the devil how many have chosen the truth over false God you have no capacity to do that within yourself amen that's right we're coming to a close in 1 Corinthians 14:37 in the church age book brother brandom says if any man think himself to be a prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the Commandments of the Lord now see that the proof of the indwelling spirit was to acknowledge and follow what God's Prophet gave for his age as he set the church in order have you acknowledged and follow what God's Prophet gave for this age as he set this church in order that proves you have the indwelling spiritu and if you have the indwelling spirit it's been forever settled in heaven Paul had to say to those who claimed another another Revelation what came the word of God out from you or came it unto you only the evidence of a Spirit-filled Christian believer is not to produce the word of God it is to receive the word of God and to believe and Obey it you say well I do everything that he's talk I dress this way I dress that way I don't cut my hair I don't wear makeup I don't do this I don't do that I have you heard him call your name because you can do all of that you can do all of that and I would say do more of that do it to the fullest extent but if you've never heard him call your name amen you're still missing it it is not to produce the truth but it's to believe to receive the truth to receive the truth receiving the truth is just not receiving conduct and order it's to receive all of the spiritual principles that the angel disseminated to receive the truth is to put yourself in those scriptures that we just read a little bit ago to receive the truth he the I think you will agree with me that brother Brandon was trying to get somebody into those scriptures correct he was trying to awaken somebody to believe that was them and that was the truth that he was delivering the other things were the they were miners not everything but the dress the Holiness movement was on scene well before that just common decent living was on scene before that that was not the point of the Angel's message yeah the point of the Angel's message was to deliver truth to produce truth so that we may receive the whole truth the major truth the truth that Jesus had I come from the father and I'm going back to the father as the musicians would please come I'm going to read you two portions of scriptures quickly as they would come and we would close it's before 9:00 so please nobody pass out fall out of your seats and wonder if I'm sick and going to fall over I'm not just having mercy on you just having mercy on you Jeremiah 29:10 for thus sayith the Lord that after 70 years this is the Lord addressing Israel Jeremiah addressing Israel remember brother brandom taught us whatever happened with Israel natural happens to the bride spiritually for thus saith the Lord that after 70 years be accomplished at Babylon I will revisit you and I will perform my good works towards you has he visited you has he performed good works towards you get Israel out of this scripture and get your name in here amen and perform my good word towards you in causing you to to return to this place I'm returning someplace amen for I know God speaking for I know the thoughts that I think towards you sayeth the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end then shall you call upon me and ye shall go and pray unto me and I will hearken unto you and you shall seek me and find me when you shall search for me with all your heart and I will be found of you you there's two people in this scripture I and you I will be found of you sayeth the Lord and I will turn away your captivity and I will gather you from all the nations and from all the places whether I have driven you have you found yourself driven in life have you found yourself someplace that was not recognizable did you find yourself some place that was not comfortable has something came along and made you realize I don't belong in this position that I'm in right now there is something drawing me there is something calling me this was I I the Lord was doing this amen I will be found of you I will bring you again into the place which I caused you caused you to be carried away captive we find ourself carried away captive in a hybrid condition but he says after a certain time period it says 70 years to Israel I'll say seven Church ages to the Gentiles after this time period I am going to hear your call and I am going to come get you whoever this you is is a real special person they ought to be the happiest you on the face of the earth I God is going to come and find somebody because this is the word of God and it was forever settled in heaven before there was a speck of Stardust and he said to somebody I'm coming to get you yeah amen Lord after a certain time period I am coming to get you and I am going to bring you again again means you were somewhere before I will bring you again into the place which I caused you to be carried away captive from you say well why did he allow me to be carried away captive from because he had to express himself brother Bron said he needed to express himself as a savior and he had some part of him come out into a manifestation of people that would somehow believe I find myself in this condition but this is not where I'm originally from and I'm now going to accept the way back that has been presented to me by an Angel messenger I am going to identify myself with that angel messenger and believe what he says to be true about my heavenly father I will bring you again into the place whence I caused you to be carried away from and we're going to close with this Psalm 139 to the chief musician a Psalm of David oh Lord thou Hast searched me and known me this was prior to 2023 thou Hast searched me and thou Hast known me thou knowest my Downs sitting and my Uprising thou understandest my thought a far off thou compassest my path and my laying down and art equ Ed with all my ways for there is not a word in my tongue but lo oh Lord thou knowest it altogether thou Hast beset me behind and before and laid thine hand upon me such knowledge is too wonderful for me it is high and I cannot attain it I'll admit that but I'll also admit it's still true this knowledge I may not be able to attain to this terminology the full context but it's still true and he knows me and he knows when I sit down and he knows when I get up and he knows when I lay down and he knows when I arise and he knows all the paths that I've taken and will take yes amen whether shall I go from thy Spirit or whether shall I flee from thy presence if I Ascend into heaven Thou Art there if I make my bed in hell behold Thou Art there if I take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost part of the sea even there shall thy hand lead me and thy right hand shall hold me if I say surely the darkness shall cover me even the night shall be light about me yay the darkness hideth not from thee but the night shineth as the day the darkness of the light are both alike to thee if thou possessed my reign thou Hast covered me in my mother's womb before I was born you covered me it gets better hold on I will praise thee for I am fearfully and wonderfully made marvelous are thy works and that my soul knoweth right well my soul knoweth right well my brain may not get it but my soul knoweth right well marvelous are thy Works my substance was not hid from thee you say what substance I don't know what substance but my substance was not hid from him when I was made in secret and curiously wrought in the lowest part of the earth Thine Eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect and in thy book all my members were written amen which in continuance were fashioned when as yet there was none of them you wrap your brain around that when none of them were fashioned when none of them were made he he was still there and he wrote them in his book verse 17 how precious and this is if you forget everything that I've said tonight just catch this how precious and if you'll allow me to interject how real how precious and how real also are thy thoughts unto me amen oh God Amen How great is the sum of them as we would stand together I am here to self- admit that I don't know how precious they are and I don't know how great the sum of them are but the little bit that I can grasp as brother random says when you come down towards the end of the road these things just means so much to us Saints am amen Saints we don't have the promise of tomorrow we don't have the promise of tonight we stand here as the most privileged people on the face of the Earth to have a Vindicated not some sketchy Fly by Night person a Vindicated Prophet per the scriptures sent to me to reveal to us these things to reveal to us the thoughts of God to reveal to us where we come from and where we're going I challenge you and I challenge myself to let the reality of that be more real to us than ever I I say let it be more real than anything else if brother brandham says the thoughts of God are real and they are eternal and they are his word and it was forever settled in heaven amen let it be settled here on Earth tonight I will remind you when that seventh seal broke it was silent in heaven it was not silent on Earth you tell me where the seventh seal was at and don't get confused on that cuz the seventh seal is simply the coming of God Amen the seventh seal is a person yeah that's right and if it's silent in heaven where they angels and the cherubims are commanded to worship Him 24/7 and it's silent there but it says nothing about silence on Earth you tell me where he was at you tell me what form he took on I'll tell you that there was an angel sent to you to tell you what form he was in let's play precious Lord Jesus father we are beyond words to express our gratitude toward you Lord these things that we have spoken as the scripture says blessed is the man who even reads the Prophecies of this book father we do not have vocabulary to express our Thanksgiving to you Lord and we're not standing here as a hottie people saying that we know it all and we've got it all and that we don't need more and that we don't need you to continue to reveal the perfect revelation of this subject to us but Lord we will never back down on our gratefulness of what you have revealed to us and I pray that you would help us to walk in the fullness of what we can grasp not with our brain Lord but with our soul with the Eternal part of us who has heard this before and I pray that you would make it manifest in our life and we open oursel to you not to just anything Lord but we open oursel to you to further reveal truth on this we love you and we appreciate you and we believe you and we just offer you praise and thanksgiving for this night Lord that we somehow supernaturally can recognize in our soul who that you is who that me is who that thy is who that thou is to recognize who that angel was sent to father I pray as the prophet admonished us may we never take this for granted no way and Lord I stand here knowing that I have and I Repent of that and I ask forgiveness of that and I pray that you would help me never to do it again but may I may I give it the weight and may I hold it amen as valuable as it is help us father as we would leave this building we would ask your blessings on our pastor and his family as there a way that you would just bring them back safely and at the the appointed time I pray your blessings on this congregation father I pray that if there is one here that has not seen or heard their name in the book that they wouldn't walk out those doors until they have for it's here and it's available Lord even if it's in Isaiah 53 just as a transgressor and they need to come for repentance and accept you as their savior Lord just in the what we would say the bare necessities and Essentials of Christianity to recognize that God had a son and he paid the price for our sins and our hybrid condition may they do that tonight and may you take that and and and water your water it with your word and your spirit and and begin a birth there and a growth there Lord and father for those that are farther along the road and have are moving from glory to glory I pray that you would move us to the next Glory father and that we can see ourselves as your bride and as the one that the the angel has been sent to but we need more father we've got to come to Perfection and we just yield oursel to that tonight we thank you once again and we pray that you would just accomplish tonight Lord what you have ordained this service for if I've said anything wrong or that would be confusing father I pray that you would forgive me and I pray that you would somehow supernaturally even even if I've said it wrong that you would make it right Lord and that you would that you would reveal yourself to this people we ask these favors in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ with Thanksgiving amen God bless you Saints brother Blake and can't you see why I'm happy for I accepted the word of the Lord the
