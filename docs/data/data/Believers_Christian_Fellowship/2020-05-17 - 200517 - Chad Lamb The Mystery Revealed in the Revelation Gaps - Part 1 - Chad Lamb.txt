it's good to be with you this morning so good to see your faces and see how many were able to gather out everybody's in the wrong spot the usual seats are shuffled so i've got to look around and find who's here and who's not and so god bless you when we don't do our naturally assigned seats it's a little hard on me i'm sure on you too well god bless you i'm happy to be here this morning and i can tell you i come with a full heart you know i've been looking into some things in the in the message in the word that's been thrilling me but i'm also at the same time overwhelmed there's so much there it's so overwhelming that i've been praying i said lord i don't know how to bring it i don't know what to say i don't know where to start i don't know where to stop i don't know what to do so i'm just depending on god under the anointing just to bring the word the way he wants it and i pray that you'll pull so we all get the portion that we have need of while we're standing let's take our bibles and turn to revelation chapter one brother franco i explained to him kind of what i was going to go into and he so graciously came up with a powerpoint for me to help me so he can visualize maybe some of these and and he set it all up and gave me the slides to use and i've been so overwhelmed and so full i'm hardly got anything together on that we'll use some of that so i asked him to turn this camera thing on so i could draw pictures if that's the way we do it i don't know if we'll use this or this or what we'll do but i tell you the word is so rich and it keeps opening up and the picture that brother branham painted for us keeps getting clearer and clearer and clearer amen and god wants us to know who we are and where we are and what's going on he wants us to know those things and and so that's why he sent a prophet and we just thank god for that but as as things clear up as things open as as something else bumps open it's almost like uh i say it this way when you begin to see something in the message that that maybe you haven't seen before haven't seen this way or haven't seen as clearly as soon as it opens i want to stop everything and read the whole message again it's like i don't want to preach it yet i want to go back and i want to read the church ages i want to read the seals i want to read you know because you never feel adequate it opens up a whole nother layer and i don't i don't feel adequate i know i'm not adequate there's no way to explain it and there's no way to even comprehend all that god has given us for when he opened those seals he took the mystery off the whole bible that's not something you comprehend in five days you know a week two weeks two months the word is eternal and it continually unfolds itself and he took the mystery off of the whole bible so that we can enjoy feeding on the lamb and keep feeding on the lamb and we haven't run out of lamb to feed on i don't think they're going to run out of lamb to feed on and so we enjoy it so much so let's just read revelation chapter 1 verse 1 together and then we'll let you be seated the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent signified it by his angel unto his servant john who bear a record of the word of god unto the testimony of jesus christ and of all things that he saw let's just bow our heads and pray dear lord jesus we thank you for this word we thank you god for the opportunity to be here we don't want to take it in vain we don't want to take it for granted lord but we want it to be meaningful we want each time that we're able to have this opportunity for it to have the impact that it should lord god we pray that you would bless us now lord we're asking that you would come down yourself that you would show on the scene like you promised you were and through the foolishness of preaching would you save the lost would you feed your sheep lord we've come hungry to feed from you would you move the man out of the way and all the inadequacies and all the failures and all the stumblings around would you move that over lord and do you just pick up a gift that's laying in a tabernacle of clay and would you use it in the name of jesus christ give us ears to hear in our heart to perceive all that you want to share with us in this hour that we live for you give your secrets to your sweetheart lord not to everybody but to your sweetheart the love secrets of what you've been planning and what you've been doing and where you're working lord i just pray that we would receive those secrets in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can all be seated if we can bring up the powerpoint i think we'll start there amen all right where do we start and where do we go the book of revelation if you look in most bibles it will say the revelation of saint john the divine that's not true he was the scribe who scribed it but revelations one says it's the revelation of jesus christ and brother mam said the whole bible is the revelation of jesus christ so that this means this book we're getting looked to this book contains the mystery of the whole bible because the whole bible is the revelation of jesus christ and now this book is introduced as the revelation of jesus christ meaning it's the same thing it comes and he says the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant john now we know because we've been through this many times for many years that there was an angel that that brought the message to john and all through the book of revelations you can see this angel speaking to john and bringing the revelation and we can find that in this in the in the book of revelation twice john tries to bow down and worship this angel and this angel says i'm of the prophets i am of a man he measures the city which is the measure of a man so you can find out that this angel is is a man a man and he's of the prophets he's of those who have the testimony of jesus christ so he would be a new testament prophet so we find out that this angel is the seventh angel or his brother branham who's bringing john john the type of the bride amen and we know that there was an angel that came that that that led brother branham all the way through so in type there's an angel coming to brother branham brother branham's the type of john because john because he's type of the bride and brother branham was part of the bride he was the wave chief he was the first part to come to harvest maturity so the types just keep rolling through but to us there was an angel that came to seventh angel to bring us the mystery of the revelation of jesus christ so we can see ourselves as typed in john in this book and when we look at this you can say let's read it again the revelation of jesus christ which god gave to him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sentenced signified it by his angel and to his servant john so he says here he's going to show them things that shortly come to pass now if we just look at that historically 2 000 years ago when john wrote this letter he says these things must shortly come to pass amen but it was nearly 2 000 years and much of the unfolding of these events but if you look at it in modern terms as the seventh angel bringing the revelation of jesus christ to john the type of the bride now when you look at this angel messenger bringing this message to the bride then these things must shortly come to pass we're looking at a ministry through the 60s and to now and from from brother branham's ministry and to now all most of these things are not mostly much of this book has come to pass so when he writes this these things that must shortly come to pass he's writing for our day friends so the book of revelation is the bride's book amen right from the very first verse he's showing us that this is a this is when this revelation comes forth and his sentence signified by an angel amen to his bride john's the type of the bride these things must shortly come to pass and i just want to say god be praised for living in the hour when we can see this because for seven church ages they look at this verse and they wonder what it must shortly come to pass and there was uh you know pre-millennials post-millennials i don't understand all that but some people think things have already happened or things are gonna happen and there's great debates because there was no angel who was sent and signified to bring the revelation yet so man was probing with the best that he could he was probing and brother graham said sometimes he got pretty close but until this angel was sent and signified by the lord jesus christ amen we didn't know amen what these events all were so there was a great debate in the church or these things because it must surely come to pass so these things happen they're over with no they're coming in the future and there was a great debate but now we've seen the angel sit and signified is that right that's the day when these things must shortly come to pass praise be to god amen i just want to look at this quote and the feast of trumpets said we'll walk in the light the beautiful light one step at a time lord coming closer to him yeah children of the light accept his word keep walking and watching more unfold don't leave it no matter what somebody else says stay right in that and just keep walking with it watch it unfold and reveal itself the word of the seed and the seed in the right ground will bring forth of its kind just before this brother branham and the feast of trumpets this is the message that i've been going through for a couple weeks and i've been through it and through it and through it and i love this message feast of trumpets is one of my favorites i've been attracted to it and drawn to it for a while but i don't know why it's one of those things you're just drawn to and don't necessarily know why but i absolutely love it and in here he makes this statement he's talking about the man that doesn't believe you know and and and and what he could see can't see and he in the vice brother of them to come up to his house and he says well i don't see your house and he says uh how am i going to get there it's dark and he says well i've got his lantern here he said well that lantern won't shine the light on the house he says well he's shining the light on the path and the path leads to the house and then brother bam goes and he makes a statement he says see that lantern will only lead for one step at a time and then he comes and makes this statement we'll walk in the light the beautiful light one step at a time lord coming closer to him yeah children of the light accept his word keep walking and watch more unfold so the light of the word amen as god continues to unfold himself amen we've had the message for for a long time we've had it in print form we had an audio but it's still unfolding amen not a new message brother branham has not added material to the message he preached it he preached the message in its entirety and he's not adding new there's not addendums to the message he's not adding i mean new messages amen he preached it he preached it all and now we've got it and been feeding on it and watching that message that he's already preached unfold into greater light and greater light and greater light and so now brother man's teaching us in order to get to the destination which is all the way home you've got to trust in the light that is that that you have to trust in where the light is leading you because if you want to get all the way home you can't hold up the light and say yep there's a path and i see some trees and i see all this and describe everything you see in the line and say well i'm just going to wait here until i get home you'll never get home friends but you've got to recognize the next step and take the next step and when you take the next step it opens up more territory that is seen in the lights and this is our walk friends this is the way the bride is walking through the message amen this is the way brother branham walked in his journey he hold up that light and he sees the next move and takes the next step amen now he can't say i'm on the path you know and you hold up the light and the path looks like this and it looks like that and i know somewhere down the end of this road is a home so if i stay on this path and stand right here it'll lead me home it'll only lead you home if you'll walk where the light is shining because from that point you don't know if it turns right you don't know if it turns left you don't go up a hill down a hill a valley you don't know all you know is this is the path that leads to home and you can describe everything you can see but that won't get you home only thing that will get you home is to keep moving forward as the light bumps out more territory and we move into that territory it keeps opening up more territory and more territory and usually what happens is every time something bumps open you just step on that land and you're so mesmerized by what else you can see you just stand there and look at it for a while and describe it and preach about it forever [Applause] right because it's a thrill so i didn't know this was here and i didn't know that was there i heard him say that but now i see i read in the scriptures but now i see i heard him say it but now i see and so now we're walking in the light as he is in the light says now children of the light accept his word keep walking and watch more unfold don't leave it no matter what somebody else says stay right in that and just keep walking with it and watch it unfold and reveal itself the word is a seed a seed in the right ground will bring forth its kind now you can see why you can see why being afraid to move forward is so detrimental to our spiritual walk fear of moving forward in the light is detrimental to our spiritual walk but moving off and with a man-made light to blaze your own path is detrimental to our spiritual walk too we've got to let the light of revelation of this true word be our guide we can't just get impatient amen get impatient because the light's not i don't know where to go next the light's not showing it i get impatient and i just go trekking off on my own with some man-made light affair that's just as detrimental but it takes faith in the light that's coming from this word and it takes patience to wait for the word to open up more territory amen but the bride will have it she may not get everything right the first time but she'll get it right she's predestinated too brother branham he makes a statement in the introduction of the revelation of jesus christ out of the beginning of the church age book said through this volume we concern itself with the various major doctrines such as godhead water baptism found in revelation chapter one through three its main theme is setting forth of a detailed study of the seven church ages this is necessary in order to study and understand the rest of revelation for out of the ages comes the seals out of the seals comes the trumpets out of the trumpets comes the viles like the first burst of a roman candle the church ages come forth almighty initial illumination without which there could be no further light but once the brilliance of the seven church ages is given by divine revelation light upon light follows until the whole of the revelation opens wide before our wondering eyes and we edified and purified by its spirit are made ready for his glorious appearing even our lord and savior the one true god jesus christ so he's saying there's an initial burst of revelation coming forth in the revelation of the seven church ages and from there another burst and another verse for one leads to the other and one leads to the other and one leads to the other and after they all lead to this and lead to this and lead to this it opens it opens wide the revelation before our wondering eyes so we can't stop at the church ages the church ages came to bring more light on the seals the seals came for the trump as the trumpets came for the viles one leads into the next amen and so so we when they and when they all burst open we stand wide stand wide-eyed you know gaping before our wondering eyes and we edified and purified by its spirit let's read that again i just want to go back up one sentence but once the burdens of the seven church ages is given by divine revelation given by what divine revelation light upon light follows until the whole of the revelation opens wide before our wandering eyes and we edified and purified by its spirit what spirit the spirit of revelation edified and purified by its spirit are made ready for his glorious appearing even our lord and savior the one true god jesus christ praise the lord brother man makes a statement in the first seal he says as we and now as we study this you're comparing it now the first three books of the bible of revelation which we have pretty thoroughly combed through that it's the church ages the seven churches now there's seven church ages seven seals seven trumpets and vials and the unclean spirits like frogs and all this goes together my how i'd like to have a great big map and draw all across the way i see it you know just how that each one takes its place i draw it out on a little sheet of paper and everything so far hit just exactly right and with the time and the ages and they have come and gone and everything has blended in just perfectly right so it may not all together be right but it's the best that i know about it anyhow this is brother branham in the first seal he's making this statement he said it may not altogether be right but it's the best that i know about it anyhow and i know if i do my best and i make a mistake and try to do my best and the best that i know of god surely will forgive me for doing for the error if i have done wrong brother branham was moving forward by revelation amen he was seeing something he was moving into it and he was sketching out he wanted to draw it out he was trying to explain it he drew it out on the piece of paper he said it's all perfect he said it's the he said listen anybody said he said it may not altogether be right but it's the best that i know about anyhow now not brother i'm saying he's not bringing the wrong revelation that's not what he's saying but i think what he to me this is just brother chad he's saying i've sketched it out and i've drawn it out and i fit it in here the timeline the age is all fit he said it may not altogether be right what i believe he means is he may have something in the wrong spot it may not have one of the details right it's not bringing the wrong revelation because it's been the revelation's been given to him but as he maps it out as he draws it out as he sketches it out it may not be it may not altogether be right but it's the best that i know about anyhow and if i do my best and i make a mistake and trying to do my best and the best that i know of god surely will forgive me for doing for the error if i've done wrong brother branham wasn't leaving the word he wasn't leaving amen what the revelation from god amen he was as a man just trying to map it out and get all the details connected he said if i get it wrong in doing my doing my very best god will forgive me and i'm going to say that as we move forward in the word amen don't be afraid to move forward in the word just stay with the message amen just say what the prophet said stay with the scriptures and if we see something we can explore it hey if we get one of the details wrong we're not going to have the revelation wrong because that's been given to us by a prophet messenger but if we get one of those details in the wrong spot we tried to map it out and we got well god will forgive us for that because why we're trying to walk in the light as he's in the light not trying to get ahead of him but trying to see what he gave us to see and enjoy what he gave us to feed on amen not that we're afraid to feed on the message because he's given us the message what part are we afraid of are we afraid of the feast of trumpets because it's complicated it's been given to us to eat it's been given to us in joy it's been given to us for edification and purification we should enjoy it amen and if we get one of the details wrong or if we try to map it out god will forgive us for that he'll correct us he'll make it right because where is our heart what's our intention what is it we want to do we want to know him our lord and savior the revelation of jesus christ our husband is what's been given to us in this hour and i want to know more about him not less and i'm not satisfied with where my relationship is now and remember understanding is always bringing greater relationship that's why as you season a marriage with time amen and you go through hard times and obstacles and trials and you go through ups and downs you get an understanding for one another amen that can only be built through time and through trouble there's no other way to have the right level of understanding for a spouse unless you hit tough times and you go through turbulent waters together you never have a proper understanding of everything that's hiding in that sister and everything that's hiding in that brother but to find out what's laying there you've got to spend time and go through circumstances and what does it do it opens more opens a greater revelation of who your spouse it's already yours you're already married is that right he or she is already yours and you're already married but you're not content and happy you want to grow in that relationship you want a better understanding and that's the same thing with the bride in jesus christ she wants to know him she wants to know him and if there's more to know i want to know i want to know the story about when you were 5 years old tell me about what happened you know i don't think if you if you don't want to know those things your spouse will say hey i just remembered i went through a real tragic thing when i was 10 yeah i don't have time to hear that we're already married i know enough about you to get me through but see we can treat the message the same way i know enough to get me through i know god sent a prophet i know what's happened in days i know about the church ages i know where the churches went wrong i know enough to get me through this isn't about information this is a person this is a relationship this is the invisible union of christ in his bride amen we never get tired of seeing him unveil himself to us it never gets boring and never gets old amen every time a new scripture pops off the page we get excited and then we get butterflies in our stomach amen what is it he's telling us love secrets and we never get tired of the love secrets so if we get details wrong god will forgive us because what's our motive what's our objective what's our hearts intent what are we trying to do start a new message we don't want a new message amen start a new movement we don't want a new movement we don't want any movement we want him him our whole desire is him our husband our bridegroom the revealed word of this hour is our mate we are the word for this day he's the revealed word for this day that's our mate we're bound we're magnetized to come together and we can't stay away from it my mate is not somebody oh my goodness my mate my brother brenham told us our mate is not somebody just in a nail scarred body off in a distance waiting some time to come back but my mate is the revealed word that i'm uniting to right now he is the word we are the word and the word and the word is coming together and we enjoy the process him may risping love secrets what's he doing making love to his bride when he when he shines the light and says come a little further he's making love to the bride that's why the bride loves revelation she loves to see him clear and clear so i just want to i just want to put my disclaimer oh all i want to do today if i can have the liberty to do it just share with you what i'm seeing in the message what brother branham said share with you what i'm seeing amen and it might not be altogether right is that okay it may not be altogether right i don't mean that the revelation's wrong i don't mean that the message is wrong or the scripture is wrong but maybe my understanding of one detail or one detail i may have on the wrong spot but if i do it with the best of my ability with a pure heart if i make an error god will forgive me amen and he'll correct us don't worry he's got a good rod and he knows how to use it so let's turn to the book of daniel if we can together daniel chapter 2. and i'm not even ready to get into what i want to get into but i just want to lay a little background let me get to daniel too sorry i'm getting excited nothing makes me happier than the revelation of the word nothing and it's hard to explain unless you've experienced it all right daniel chapter 2 we're going to go to verse 40. but i want to go to the next slide here after we see revelations 1 1 when jesus christ was given the revelation and sentence signified it uh by an angel to his servant john that's the time that these things must shortly come to pass so that's that's our marker for me that's my marker when things should shortly come to pass is when that angel that's sent and signified by jesus christ comes to bring the revelation of jesus christ to john the type of the bride then from that point these things must shortly come to pass and so now brother branham he comes from here and he and he goes in the end of 1960 he goes and he goes to revelation chapter 1 chapter 2 and chapter 3 and he preaches the revelation of the seven seals and he shows us historically what has happened to the church the preaching on the revelation of the seven church ages i mean not the seals the revelation of the seven church ages is a look back on the last 2000 years and so we we see that but before brother branham comes to this there's an event that unfolds in the world and when this event unfolds in the world brother branham takes particular interest in this event and i say this because i i believe that i could spend the rest of my life studying the historical events that took place during the prophet's life and match them with scripture i don't think we've even scratched the surface friends because when that prophet was on the scene god was movies and program forward amen and events were happening events were having a biblical proportion of biblical significance and brother brahm kept pointing to them and he would point to them sometimes in a nonchalant way sometimes directly but sometimes just off the cuffs did you see the other day and he would move on amen why because it's got to be laying there for the bride to catch it and pick it up without him coming through and explaining the whole mystery so so there's an event that takes place but i want to start by reading daniel 2 daniel chapter 2 verse 40. it says and the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron so we know that this is the vision of nebuchadnezzar that he had a dream and in the dream he was terrified but he saw the head of gold the uh breast and arms of silver uh the belly and the thighs of brass and the legs of of iron going down to iron mixed with clay and that that is the the image that he saw and it's showing four gentile world powers that would dominate amen and only four gentile world powers from babylon to rome we know that the fourth is rome and rome mixes in with the clay and goes out into the feet and to the toes amen and that is the whole gentile world domination from from beginning to end nothing extra nothing else no bonus no additions no edits and when you get to the end of this then you know you're at the end of the gentile dispensation so that's why certain things happen in the prophet's life and he point at them and they are they're major events they're not major events in our generation there are major events in the program of god from before the foundation of the world these are not just little news clips and brother branham antidotedly took it and said something about the message amen this thing was ordained to happen before the foundation of the world to send a marker upon the earth so that the prophet begin to move forward in the program of god we'll go into that here and the fourth kingdom which is rome shall be strong as iron for as much as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things and as iron that breaketh all these shall it break in pieces and bruise and whereas thou saw us the feet and toes part of potter's clay part of iron the kingdom shall be divided but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron for as much as thou saws the iron mixed with miry clay and as the toes of the feet were part of iron and part of clay so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly broken and whereas thousands iron mixed with miry clay they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men but they shall not cleave one to another even as iron is not mixed with clay and in the days of these kings shall the god of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed and the kingdom shall not be left to another people but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms and it shall stand forever for as much as thou saw us the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands and that at break in pieces the iron the brass the clay the silver and the gold the great god hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter and the dream is certain and the interpretation thereof sure daniel wasn't mincing words it is certain and it is sure and he's showing a gentile world domination all the way down to where rome and rome breaks into the eastern and western uh uh kingdoms and it goes down and it begins to mingle with clay it mingles out into the world because pagan rome became papal rome and pagan rome died and remember papal rome rose in its place and it became a church that mixed itself into the entire world and began to rule as a church but it began to rule politics and it began to rule and if you look down through history you can see this so clearly that the church ruled politics and in multiple nations and it goes all the way down into the feet and go all the way down into the toes and i just think it's a it's amazing to me that that satan's kingdom works from the head to the feet but god's kingdom works from the feet to the head because through the old testament they meant through the patriarchs and through the prophets and was building what building the body of jesus christ from the feet to the leg what was it becoming more clear all the time more clear all the time building up until finally through the old testament was was bringing forth jesus christ amen in a body of flesh and finally it was capped off by that great head that come and it was god in flesh emmanuel and then from there a piece was broken off amen and it was sowed and now it began to build amen through the through the apostles and prophets now building up through the seven church ages building from the feet to the legs to the arm all the way up to the finally the headstone comes back the headship of jesus christ the word comes back to cap it off to cap off this image which is jesus christ in bride form so satan's kingdom diminishes as it goes it can't get any better it gets stronger and it breaks and it tears but it doesn't get better it just gets stronger the political system and it goes from the head to the feet but christ builds from the feet to the head and and when the headstone the stone that was cut out of the mount without hands when at the time that the headstone comes it crushes the feet but caps the bride at the same time the same stone that's smiting is the same stone that's that's capping or vindicating or completing destroying and completing at the same time that's how the word of god works brother branham comes into the the thyatiran church age and i'm reading out of the church age book he said now along with that i have just said recalling the vision of daniel the last part of the image the last world power was in the feet that was iron and clay see iron is the roman empire but now it's no longer solid iron clay is mixed in it yet it is there and running world affairs in both the democratic nations and the more despotic ones it doesn't care it works in communism it works in capitalism it works in democracy it works in socialism it doesn't matter it can cross all lines he said the roman church is in every nation it is mixed up in it all let me give you a little something on the iron and clay remember when khrushchev beat his shoe on the desk at the u.n well there was five eastern nations there five western khrushchev spoke for the east and president eisenhower for the west in russia khrushchev is clay and eisenhower means iron the two main leaders of the world the two big toes of the feet of the iron and clay were side by side we are at the end of it all this is an important statement brother branham is not saying it's kind of like we maybe come to the end he said well this is kind of the end but it's not really the end i mean it'll go on for you know a long long time no he says we've come to the end of it all and the seventh seal is the end time seal so the seventh seal can't be open until the end of time because it's the end time seal and it finishes up everything so you've got to come to the end before the seventh seal can open because it's the end time seal so he points to this event that takes place in the world and brother branham draws significance to it he mentions it several times in 1961 he mentions the uncertain sound here the other day these conferences they've been there was mr eisenhower and khrushchev met up here in the united states eisenhower was representing all the western nations and khrushchev represented all the eastern nations did you notice there was nothing they could say they could they could get along khrushchev took the shoe off and and beat it on the desk and everything well don't you know that exactly fulfills what the prophet said do you know what khrushchev means in russia means clay do you know what eisenhower means in english iran iron and clay the east and west them two big toes of the vision of daniel we're already at the end friends praise be to god there's no question that's why when he's sent and signified about his angel to john these things must shortly come to pass because it's the end it's the capstone of the bible it's the end time in the message conference from 1961 he says now here they had another conference i'd like to speak of it just a moment the last conference they had at the u.n building where the east and the west met together where khrushchev took off his shoe and beat the desk with it eisenhower and khrushchev met eisenhower represented the five free world khrushchev the eastern communist world and that went right over the head of many people not praying not not praying concerning it there was a news event that took place it went out in the newspapers it was on the radio and he said it went over the head of most people praise god there was a prophet to bring it from over our head and bring it right to our attention because if it wasn't for that prophet it'd go over our head too so it went over their head because they weren't praying concerning it but brother benham was praying concerning it and he was able to catch something and he bringing it down now to show us so it doesn't go over our heads amen but if you happen to notice that was a direct answer and a direct prophecy fulfilled at that time it was a direct prophecy the east and the west had had fulfilled exactly what daniel said that ten kingdoms their wouldn't mix like iron and clay would not mix together and the word khrushchev in russia means clay the word eisenhower in english means iron and iron and clay could not get together he goes on to say in the end time sign seed in 62 this great meeting they just had up there between khrushchev and eisenhower you know what khrushchev means in his own nation national tongue khrushchev means mud clay you know what eisenhower means in english iron and to even make it so plain to the people even to make it so plain to the people khrushchev took off a shoe and beat the desk to make what plane we're at the feet see the feet see the shoe where does the shoe go a shoe goes on the feet what's he making plain he's not making plain his objection well you know what he was doing he was objecting to something that was being spoken in the u.n and he was pounding on the table so hard that one account says his watch came off and another says his watch broke and he got mad he picked up a shoe and started beating his shoe on the table because he was objecting to what was being spoken so brother branham he didn't beat the shoe to draw attention to the objection he beat the shoe to draw attention to the fact so the whole world would see we're at the feet we're at the feet we've got ten toes we've got two big toes amen you can't go past toes the image starts at the top of the head it works it's all the way down to the feet turns at the feet comes forward you've come to the end of it when you come to the toes there's nothing left friends that's why brother branham looks at this and he says we've come to the end of it all praise be to god so why is time still going on because the seventh seal is finishing everything one thing at a time we've come to the end time shall be no more and now everything's finishing then finishing then finishing and a cycle of finishing but the finishing has already started so we've come to the end of it all we're not sitting here waiting oh we're not waiting for something else to happen it's already happened amen everything's been triggered the events have happened and the sequence of events have taken place and now the seventh seal is finishing everything finishing and then gentile world powers now finishing denominational systems amen now finishing governments about finishing this finishing the gathering of israel finishing finishing finishing finishing until finally the seven seal will finish the purging of the earth amen and usher in the millennial reign of jesus christ finish finishing what are you in we're in the seventh seal we're in the finishing we're in the end amen we're past the end in the end of the end amen friend where we are we got to know on the map you are here where is here past the end i'm past the end amen praise be to god i read that again even to make it so plain to the people khrushchev took off his shoe and beat the desk they will not agree what's going to rule romelu rule a confederation of churches the catholicism will bind it together and right there you are the ruling power the bible says that that's the seed that can't fail this is going to get really interesting i want to read one more quote along this line from the feast of trumpets 1964. notice quickly now these supernatural demons they're under the auspices of a united nation uniting groups together eastern and western just like the right and left foot of the image that daniel saw how they wouldn't agree and mix one with another now look how brother look at the terminology he's using just like the right and left foot of the image that then saw how they wouldn't agree and mix one with one another and the word eisenhower during that time eisenhower means iron khrushchev means clay and he pulled off his shoe and beat it on the desk and when the league of nations or the u.n khrushchev did dusting off the oh my the hour that we're living the church and its condition so brother branham wanted us to see some things and brother franco can you pull on this camera thing i'm going to try to use this you don't mind if i just take some time this morning let's just teach you know i get so i get so worked up and i go off on a tangent and i say so much that i don't even understand what i'm saying i don't even know what you're catching but i want to slow down and i want to just take this through this timeline what brother branham's looking at this event unfolds over a period of time now what we have is we have post-world war ii we have the world is beginning to divide between what they call free nations and communism and the ussr is formed and it's pulling in other nations to to it it's to agreement with its worldview and and now we come to a time where the the world powers have decided we've got to have peace we want to end the cold war the arms race is not good you know they saw what happened in world war ii with atomic weapons and they they want to they want to begin to disarm but they've got to come to a peace agreement because they have to disarm together because the u.s can't disarm well while the ussr is armed and vice versa so they stay on par with one another and so if they go up they go up together they go down they go down together so they're trying to make peace where they can come together but brother branham said they won't mix the iron and clay won't mix but they were trying to mix why so that we could see prophecy fulfilled so let's see if i can write this in september of 1959 it works i'm so happy you may not be as excited as me but i'm excited right now it's september of 1959 president eisenhower invites khrushchev over to visit the united states he spends some time in the united states they start discussions about disarmament and ending the cold war and the discussions go well at that meeting or just before that meeting they agreed that khrushchev will come and visit the u.s and in june of 1960 so let's do this dash june you know what the most dangerous part of this is is i can't spell very well and it may shock you the words that i misspell it's not the big ones it's the little ones i can sometimes get the big ones it's the little ones that are bad so in september khrushchev comes and visits the united states in june eisenhower is going to go visit ussr and his visit to the ussr is supposed to be uh the finishing of a deal that they're working on to end the cold war and disarm so the iron and clay are trying to mix together and the whole world is happy about this this is what we want to have happen so they're working on it so they start uh let me see here i'm going to write some more stuff down if i've got a pen and i've got a paper i might as well write stuff down but i can't spell chris jeff so i got to find it on my paper all right there's too many h's as far as i'm concerned i can't even spell eisenhower he's been one of our presidents yes sir brian i appreciate your support eisenhower to the ussr so so in between this they've decided to have a group that the uns sanctioned that are going to begin meeting on march 15th so march 15th to april 29th is the first meeting of the 10 nation committee on this armament there's a reason this is important there's a reason i'm doing this i like all these dates and stuff i know most people could care less just cut to the chase but i like that stuff this gives me an opportunity this is the worst thing that ever happened to us friends as i know how to use this now but but this ten nation committee on disarmament was five nations from the warsaw pact and five nations from the western bloc so the eastern bloc and the western bloc it was canada france great britain italy united states and bulgaria czechoslovakia poland romania and soviet union so what are the two big toes of those nations us ussr and the usa so now we've come to this uh they're going to have this meeting and in this meeting they're going to start drawing up plans and this is the plans are going to begin the peace process to end the cold war and disarm this is a great thing the iron and clay are going to mix but there they break april 29th because they're getting ready to have a paris summit and then the paris summit is going to begin march 15th or may 15th and in the paris summit eisenhower and khrushchev are going to come together and they're going to have a summit on peace again while this plan is being worked out and then after that plan breaks then after that meeting they're going to come back together in june this 10 nation committee on disarmament finish the plans and then eisenhower's supposed to visit in june to the ussr it's a beautiful plan the world's happy about it but something happens on may 1st may 1st the ussr shot down a u2 spy plane shot down a u2 spy plane and when they realized that the usa was still spying on them and infuriated the ussr they got angry they came to the paris summit which is supposed to be a peace summit and khrushchev is furious and and he demands a public apology and all of this stuff and and the and the talks completely dissolved the person everybody goes home it's ruined why why because the iron and clay can't mix you see everybody thinks they're doing things politicians are making decisions we're doing all this no they're fulfilling prophecy they're they're setting a marker so everybody can see hey the iron of because brother brandon will pick pick it up he said they're trying to mix themselves but they won't mix so they come to the paris summit may 15th it's bad and then he chris jeff cancels eisenhower's invitation to come to the ussr they try to go in june to have the second 10 nation committee on disarmament relations are so bad they disband it and never get together again this is the only time the only time five western nations and five eastern nations came together this is it after that they added more countries and more countries there was never a ten nation committee like this again why did it show up there because the prophet was on the scene why don't we have one now because the prophet was on the scene right there and he had to be there they had the world had to be split between democracy and communism there had to be a rise of the usa after war ii in the ussr both of these nations really rose up in prominence amen after world war ii why because there's a prophet on the scene getting ready to take us through the book of revelation and he's got to have a marker that shows where we are in time amen and he got to see the marker so now uh khrushchev there there's relations completely dissolved through the rest of the year in 1960. this is all taking place in 1960. so we come to the 12th of october 1960 at the united nations and khrushchev is there all the delegates are there and a delegate from the philippines gets up and starts speaking and he's speaking on behalf of the of democracy speaking on really khrushchev called him a a u.s crony but anyways he gets up and starts speaking he starts speaking against eastern nations losing their civil rights and losing privileges and going into communism and and that's when khrushchev gets angry and he starts banging on the desk to call a point of order because he believes the man's out of order and that's where he starts banging his hand he gets infuriated amen and he picks up his shoe and starts banging his shoe on the desk october 12 1960. this all unfolded amen throughout the year the end of 1959 to 1960 but what does a prophet do a prophet looks at all of these stories together and he puts them right together and says this is that amen it's done in such a way amen nobody would piece it together it takes it takes months for this to unravel but what happens over months of time brother branham sees as one singular event in time that now now we're at the end friends when brother branham sees that when he sees them gather five in the east five in the west the two big toasts coming together in the paris summit it dissolves and breaks apart and finally winds up with khrushchev so that the world would know where we are in time takes off his shoe and begins beating it on the desk and that story goes through every major headline in every major paper why the youtube spy plane being shot down every paper covered it amen the tin committee conference on this armament every paper covered it just like amen life magazine covered the sign of the son of man in heaven why because god will testify to the world and make the world testify to his word and now this all happens it finishes october look at this october 1960. brother branham comes and preaches the church ages which he calls the revelation of jesus christ in december 1960. before brother branham moves in to the book of revelation he sees a marker that shows where we are in time and when he sees that marker where we are in time immediately after friends we're talking the 12th of october to the first weekend in december he moves right over and starts preaching the church ages starts in revelation chapter 1 chapter 2 chapter 3 and from there he marches right through the book of revelation for the rest of his ministry amen because because why he was the angel that was sent and signified to bring this to john the bride and when he does these things must shortly come to pass you see the day we live in you see where we're at friends we're not we're not waiting these things have happened hey man so let's go back to daniel fricker you can turn that off and i'll just leave it there i might need some more i brought lots of paper i have no idea what's going to happen i don't know where we're going to get but we're not going to go too long there's a lot of details i don't mean to bog you down in details but to me this is important to me this matters what was brother venom seeing and why and what did it trigger nobody else caught that nobody else on the planet put that serious sequence of events from september 1959 to october it took just a year for that to manifest nobody else knew what that was but brother branham knew what that was he knows that there was 2 10 there's 10 kings coming together in the feet gentile days are done amen now it's time for the end time sign to break forth the end time sign and the end time seal to break forth to wrap everything up to usher in the millennium that's where we're at praise be to god amen now let's go let's look at daniel now where am i daniel daniel 40. daniel chapter 2 verse 42 and as the toes of the feet were part of iron and part of clay so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly broken and whereas thousands iron mixed with myriad clay they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men but they shall not cleave one to another even as iron is not mixed with clay this is where brother branham says see they won't mix together these ten nations they would not mix together and all broke apart to show they were trying to mix together but they won't mix together verse 44 and in the days of these kings did you catch that did you catch that in the days of these kings in the days of these kings shall the god of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed it's the kingdom of the son of man it's the kingdom of jesus christ it's the kingdom of heaven and the lord himself has come amen to set up his kingdom in the hearts of his people amen that's the spiritual will to be a physical absolutely in the millennium this this kingdom will grow but i'm talking about in the days of these ten kings the god of heaven will set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed and the kingdom shall not be left to other people but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms and it shall stand forever for as much as thou sauced them the stone that was cut out of the mountain without hands and that it break in pieces the iron the brass the clay the silver the gold the great god hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter in another place he said that mountain amen it grew that that stone grew into a mountain that filled all of the earth that's going to take place from now and then from the time it smote until the until the end of the millennium it'll grow into a mountain what is that a kingdom the kingdom of jesus christ son of david will fill the whole earth amen when did it start it started now it started in me that kingdom has come and the kingdom is growing in me and it's filling all the world right now in the bride you are that kingdom that kingdom has come and that kingdom is word made manifest and you are the kingdom you are the mountain as growth from the sea when that stone came and struck it amen that was capping off of the church and from there the bride has grown and grown and grown and now in nations all around the world you have the bride of jesus christ what is it the kingdom of god is on earth and infiltrated the whole world and will through the millennium be a physical kingdom that will fill the whole world amen and i'm going to be there and i'm going to be part of that kingdom i'm going to be part of that ruling authority and that government there but how do i know because i'm part of it now i've got to recognize my part in the kingdom now because in the days of these 10 kings that a prophet of god on the scene showed us this is the end of it all right not another ten kings not a future ten kings but in the days of these ten kings amen there shall be a stone cut out of the mountain without hands a pure revelation not manhandled and it'll strike that image what is it because what was pagan what was carnal became spiritual down in the iron and the clay and it showed what spirit was in babylon the babylonian worship that came from nimrod that came from cain the false vine and its pinnacle from cain amen through nimrod from nimrod to syria from assyria to babylon and that religion has worked its way that false religion worked all his way down and come down into the clay and the iron and the feet and when that when that spiritual rock was cut out of that mountain without hand and hit that image it broke the pieces that entire false religion that entire false system the false mind was exposed the false religion was exposed because the seals the revelation was taken off the whole bible now we know how he deceived in the beginning now we know every fall how how that false vine has tripped up the true vine all the way down through it's been exposed the smiting stone has come and the smiting stone has smitten and it is growing into a kingdom that's filling all the earth praise be to jesus christ so many things we see this friends i when i say this this isn't an interesting bit of anecdotal evidence this isn't something oh it's neat that kind of fits together this is a happening that has happened and it is happening in our lives we got to get we we've got to give ourselves to that kingdom amen when we realize what's happening that's why the revelation that's why the revelation of this what does it do it edifies and purifies it edifies that prophet came to give us the revelation of jesus christ like i said he started at the beginning and walked through the book of revelation why because the revelation of it edifies and purifies because when you catch what has happened and you see world events tying together to point out a prophecy laying in the old testament so a new testament prophet can come and grab and say this is that what does it do to you are you edified are you edified that the smiting stone has come are you edified that it smote the image in the feet are you edified by that and now let it purify because what else do we care about what else matters amen what else what what job what what event what what article of clothing what new gadget what else matters amen in the face of this revelation it edifies and purifies automatically you don't have to ask somebody to give up something my goodness just give them something better and this is better this is sweet love words from our husband when he begins to reveal his secrets and you see what he's done and how perfectly he's done it and he says i did this for you my goodness your heart just begins to burst and you told me billions upon the earth and you told me there are billions of people on the earth there have been billions from the time of this debacle in 1960 amen that happened in world events through world leaders there's been billions of people that have been on this earth from that time to now and you told me i mean count what are the odds of you knowing this what are the odds of you seeing this scripture fulfill of knowing the prophecy of daniel has been fulfilled what are the odds of knowing that that puts you in a special class of human being that puts you as the sweetheart of jehovah almighty because he doesn't tell his love secrets to everybody only to his sweetheart praise be to god i love this word it edifies and purifies oh praise his holy name amen where to next friends let's go a little further now if we could take your bibles out with me and let's do this together i got this bible up here this is just a picture that brother franco took and he put together but take your bible out and follow along we go to the book of revelation and we see in chapter 1 verse 1 the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass he sent signified it by his angel unto the servant john so he he we go through from the beginning and you can see that your bible is constructed and it matches the ministry of brother branham he's walking right through this and i don't know if i can say it in a way say it correctly or show it in a way that you can see it but i pray by god that he'll let you see it i this is something that i'm seeing in the scriptures and when we get over to chapter one he begins to see jesus christ in the deity of jesus christ and he'll be able to see he begins to see that jesus christ is going to go through all the church ages and he's going to be in the midst of the seven candlesticks he's going to look at where he's going to be through all of this and and he comes to chapter two and and he begins to reveal from from john's standpoint it's prophetic from where john's at this is happening in the future from where brother branham's at he's preaching the seals from the past and so he preaches through these these seals then he comes over he are these church ages and he comes to the end of the church ages now friends i i'm going to my my brain is inadequate let's just start there and you're allowed to say amen it's quite all right with me it doesn't hurt my feelings to drop my brain is quite inadequate so if i say seals where where church ages go or church ages where trump or their seals go just say poor brother chad god help him his brain is fried the human mind can't keep up with the revelation but if you come here to the end and i don't know how it's out laid out in your bible every bible will be different but you come to the end of the seven church ages and at the end of the seven church ages you know verse 20 says chapter 3 verse 20 behold i stand at the door and knock and when you get to the end of the church ages you find jesus christ on the outside of the church amen he's already been put out is that right when john looks at that it's prophetic when brother branham points that out to us it's concurrent for him it was happening in his day so i didn't put out then we come to revelations chapter 4 and chapter 5 chapter 4 setting the scene in heaven john's caught up through an open door in heaven he sees one sitting on the throne he he sees what's going on in the throne room and then chapter five is the event chapter four sets the stage chapter five is the event or there's a cry coming out there's a legal procedure going to take place who can take this book of redemption who can take this title deep book and then there comes forth the lamb the lamb takes the the lion the lion takes the book but he's a lamb amen and all the worship breaks loose and then he tears off the seals and in chapter in chapter six he begins to reveal what the seals are so when he begins to reveal the seals at the revelation of the seals he's going to bring the revelation of the entire bible so we have i'll just say this is my own terms we have a gap or a breach a breach is like a gap in the wall we have a breach and brother branham calls it the breach between the seven church ages and the seven seals calls it a breach a breach also means a bursting force like a birth of a baby or a bursting forth of a fountain or water can also be a breach and i'd like to say it's both it's a gap a breach between the seven church ages and the seven seals and at the same time it's a breaking forth something's going to be birthed and it's going to be a newborn bride [Music] praise be to god i love all these things for me this just thrills my heart so when you come to the breach oh let me just see i don't even know where my notes are yeah brother bram says in the feast of trumpets he said go into the prophet's chamber and watch them seven steps he's talking about the pyramid now when you go the pyramid you've got seven steps and the seventh step is a big step he said go ahead to the prophet's chamber and watch them seven steps where where did the guard meet the challenge to bring the comer to the presence of the king now look what he's saying on the seventh step amen there's a challenge of the guard there's a guard there brother bam calls him a prophet we know it's brother branham's ministry himself the seventh angel on the seventh step and he said that's where the guard meets the challenge of bringing the comer into the presence of the king where in the seventh church age on the seventh step what's happening there's got to be somebody there standing in the breach on the seventh step to bring the comer into the presence of the king somebody's got to stand in the breach somebody's got to bridge the gap when john the baptist come he stood in the breach between the old and new testament and he bridged the gap and he brought the people from the old testament into the presence of of the fulfillment old testament and come into the presence of the new and living way the atonement that was going to be made of jesus christ and there was a prophet on the scene to bridge the gap and it was john the baptist and brother branham said as john the baptist in 1933 on the river those weren't just neat words as john the baptist what did john the baptist do he introduced the messiah he stood in the gap he was in the breach between the old and the new and he bridged the gap between the old and the new testament and he introduced the messiah and as john the baptist amen your ministry will do the same and brother bannon is here to bring the comer from the seventh step to bring him into the presence of the king and he's in the breach standing in the breach he's got a ministry in the breach so go into that prophet's chamber and watch them seven steps where did the guard meet the challenge to bring the cummer into the presence of the king at the top of the steps was in the seventh step there shows that we've got to come again with the same spirit that was on john he introduced the messiah brother branham is tying these things right together you don't even have to imagine it and then he's putting it right together that the one on the seventh step has got to have the same spirit that john had because he's got to do the same thing john did to introduce the messiah what is that bring the comer into the presence of the king oh praise god you know how did you come into the presence of the king it was through that seventh angel every one of us we didn't come through mom and dad we didn't come to a church we didn't come through a preacher amen it was that seventh angel and if the mom and dad told you anything they told you what the seventh angel said and if a preacher told you anything the preacher told you what the seventh angel said it was the ministry of the seventh angel that brought you into the presence of the king that's why this means so much to us it's not past amen it's going on right now there's still a seventh angel message a voice that's in the earth today amen and the bride may be speaking in a preacher and a mom and a dad and a friend may be speaking it but it's still that same voice bringing us into the presence of the king [Applause] same word we don't have another message we have one message the message has been given to us he said there shows that we've got to come again with that same spirit that was on john he introduced the messiah he was greater than all the prophets he introduced it and we've got to come to a place again to something that's going to introduce the messiah and how will the people that's believing him know it unless they're constantly in the word to know what he is i love that terminology i don't think brother random misspoke he wants to know what he is what is he he's the word made manifest in our day that's the same thing he was 2 000 years ago what was he 2 000 years ago he was the prophecies laying in the bible made manifest and in flesh he was the manifested word amen for that day that's what he was then that's what he is now it doesn't have to be in the same form to be the same one how other people believe unless they're constantly in the word to know what he is daniel said the wise shall know but the foolish the unwise wouldn't know they shall know their god now how he shall appear in the last days is to bring the people back to the word so that the bride will know her husband know her mate the revealed word who are you uniting with the revealed word the person of the word the revealed word for this day that's who we're joining forces with her mate the revealed word that's why this has to happen it wasn't to the reformers it wasn't luther wesley and the pentecostals and scriptures say it wasn't but it will come that is his promise for this age where living in the age that is coming will be in she must be identified in him any woman must be identified with her husband for the two are one and christ's bride has to be identified with him for the two are one and he is the word not the denomination the word we are to be children of the light and the light is the word which is made light for this age how do we know light except it comes from the word all right the word made flesh is the light of the age when you see it and the bible said so now we know who we're married to christ the word revealed and on display praise god god is good so that was the the breach or the gap and i titled this message i don't even know what the title but i put the gap in the book of revelation but i i don't know you can title whatever you want so then we move from there if you actually look in your bible you move from there right into chapter six right into the seven seals when you get into the seven seals you can see here in this bible you've got one two three four five uh i didn't turn the page but i'll get to it a minute but if you go in yourself you go all the way to the end of chapter 6 verse 17 is the end of the the sixth seal and then you go to chapter seven that's not the seventh seal chapter seven is a gap that's inserted and you don't come to the seventh seal till you get to chapter eight verse one now we all know this but i just wanna show this because there's gaps here and all the gaps correlate that's the important part of what we're gonna talk about today there's gaps here and all the gaps correlate praise god i don't even know how to say it right but praise god anyhow and tonight we have started on the subject of the breach between the seven church age and seven seals i was just speaking this afternoon to a friend and maybe the lord willing sometime this summer if it doesn't take me home or i get or i get to come back don't go overseas or something i'd like to strike again at the seven last trumpets and it all bridges together and then there's the seven last plagues and it all blends right together as we'll see as we go along so brother branham's saying you know the the seals and the trumpets and the vials they all blend together amen as we go along and it looks like when he gets to defeat the trumpet he says something different but he doesn't say anything different and we'll look at that in the second seal says all right now notice 17th chapter of revelation now everybody just try to open your heart and let the holy spirit teach you now they're coming to me one of the seven angels which had the i had the seven vials now you see there's seven vials you know these sevens as we are going through they all happen right at the same time following the plagues following the church ages just the same because it's all sealed up into that one book everything and everything happens just in rotation one goes right into the other and the other and to the other there's two spirits of working god in the devil so brother i'm saying these trumpets and these vials and seals one rolls right into the other which is what he said at the beginning of the church age book as is the initial illumination of the seals because out of the seals come out of the church ages come the seals out of the church they just come to trump it's how the trump has come the viles now don't worry i'm not going to try to explain them all because i don't know what they all mean that's not the point i'm just looking at the gap in the correlation of the gap there are still i still have a billion questions and when we get done with this you'll say brother chad what about this the third seal says this i don't either the third vial i have no idea i don't know i'm just going to show you something i'm seeing and i trust that if we have enough courage to step into what we're seeing and say that's the truth that's what the prophet said praise god maybe that lantern will shine a little more but i i'm still loaded down with questions friend about the vials and about the trump still loaded down with the questions but praise god there's something here that i see that i knows the truth and i'm not the first person to see it many of you have seen it too but this is exciting for me so just when you guys who have done this for a while and you've seen this you say yeah i see it just say god bless you god bless him he's getting excited god bless him amen 1965 of thinking man's filter said and i'm anxious this is 1965. august is 65. this is after he preaches feast of trumpets he said i'm anxiously waiting for the hour to where we can all congregate in one place and preach on those seven plagues the seven vials and the trumpets and so forth they all happen right in a cluster that's the reason it will take us about a week ten days or more to get through it in one single meeting if we can so brother branham he comes to preach the feast of trumpets many of you know this and he wants to preach the trumpets and he wants to do it the same way he did the seals he didn't want to think about it he just wanted to set the meeting he wanted to come each day and have god reveal to him each trumpet one by one amen and something wasn't right they couldn't get the venue he wasn't feeling right so he went into prayer and god told him you're not to preach that it's not for you it's not for the gentiles it's for the jews he said you already preached it under the seals supernaturally we may get to that quote we may not but anyways you know you're familiar with that so you would think that brother branham said well we'll just leave that alone but now he goes past the trumpets to the vials to the plagues and he says now he's he's at the end of his ministry he preached in feast of trumpets in july of 1964. here he's a year later and he wants to set up meetings for the plagues for the vials he'd be like you were just told don't do it for the trumpets what makes you can do it for the viles because brother branham is seeing something he's seeing something and he's he wants to preach on those seven plagues the vials and the trumpets and the trumpets and so forth i wish he would have mentioned the so forth he does that all the time when she begins to say i am my father one and them other things the shuck begins to pull away i would wish he left a list of them other things because that's exactly what i would go down saying preaching every week praise be to god and the trumpets forward they all happen right in a cluster see for my old denominational thinking i couldn't think this all happens in a cluster because one happens to the gentiles and then much later trumpets happen to the jews and then after that then in tribulation period you have something happen in the vials and that may very well be the natural part of it but brother branham says they all happen in a cluster and i'll tell you the cluster they happen in they happen under the seventh seal the end time sign the wrapping up of everything that's the cluster where they all happen right in that revelation of the seventh seal the end time sign that finishes everything that's the cluster of all of this but let's just take a look at this maybe for a minute i have no idea okay praise the lord brother ben said in the feast of trumpets he said the gathering of israel is the trumpets the trumpets is to gather israel notice the very first trumpet sound blood fire hail and everything scattered the ground seeing what was he doing bringing israel out of spiritual egypt see back into his homeland so brother branham is now telling us it's not for the gentiles at all it doesn't mean there's nothing in there that pertains to us it means the revelation of it's not for us it the trumpets were the gathering of israel back to the homeland that's the purpose of the trumpets so the trumpet does for the jews what the seals did for the gentiles so so now we look here at the seals there's a gap now between the sixth and seventh seal i think this is really important that we see this because it's here for a reason when you go one two three four five six a gap then you come to the seventh huh that's interesting why don't you just list all seven because when you find you get to the trumpets the same thing happens and when you get to the vile the same thing happens why is this cycle repeated i think it's to draw our attention to something and the things brother branham said about what happens in the gap then we go after the seals we go to the trumpets right after the seventh trumpet we have one two three four five we have six seven and in between the gap between the sixth and seventh trumpet so there's in your bible the way your bible is constructed when you come to the sixth seal it doesn't immediately go to the seventh seal but i'll say it this way under the sixth seal is chapter seven in chapter seven is the ceiling of the 144 thousand and it's the purging of the foolish virgin so brother brahman says in the seventh seal and then after that you go to the seventh seal why why don't you just list all seven and then put what happens to the foolish version or what happens to the fullest version into the uh the 144 thousand why don't you just put it after the seals i mean if i was writing the book that's the way i would do it keep your subjects together then let's let's let's look here the rest of chapter 8 starting chapter 8 verse 2 all the way through the bottom of chapter 9 verse 21 is six trumpets but then revelations chapter 10 and chapter 11 is injected and you don't get the seventh trumpet until you get down to chapter to verse 15. it's the same exact pattern it's not the way i would have written it i'd put all seven seals here any other information here all seven trumpets here any other information here and then let's turn over to chapter 16. and get to the viles chapter 16 verse 1 you read the six vials from chapter 16 verse 1. all the way down to chapter 16 verse 12 is six vials chapter 12 is the sixth viral then chapter 13 through 16 is another gap something's told in the gap and then you pick it up in 17 and the seventh angel poured out his vile it's the same pattern do we see that do we all agree in your bible there's a same pattern that there's a gap between the sixth and seventh seal there's a gap between the sixth and seventh trumpet and there's a gap between the sixth and seventh vial i don't know about you but my next question is why why my intellect wouldn't allow me to write it that way but god's knowledge foreknowledge wrote it that way for a reason and there's something inside of me says i want to know why my father wrote it this way because you've got to read between the lines to catch it and he wrote it in such a way that you'll see it and your bible is actually constructed to show us something oh i'm going to see if i can hurry i want to get this to you i i'm not going to dig down to the details there's a bazillion details and i love every little one of them and maybe we'll get together and i'll draw it out on a napkin and we'll go through hours and hours in little details because i like them all or maybe we'll revisit this subject again and again and again that sounds good to me too until we understand what we're looking at because for me this is not anything new it's laying in the message been there all the time but to me i'm finally starting to see what brother branham was talking about and i just want to keep looking at it and keep looking at it and keep looking at it and say god reveal to me exactly i want to i want to know what he saw and i want to know what he understood when he saw it and when he made a phrase and he made a statement that doesn't fit i wonder why did he say it that way why is it worded that way it doesn't make sense to anything else i understand but he clearly says it this way multiple times if he does there's a reason god showed me that reason so i'm going to try to just give an overview of this subject if i can god help us i want to i'm just going to look at this gap here in the feast of trumpets he says now let me say this right here that every trumpet that blowed blowed under the sixth seal we'll get to that in a few minutes where we caught the seal there all the trumpets sounded under the sixth seal now if you're going in chronological order your brain is going to sizzle and fry right now and if you and i have our old baptist or pentecostal understanding of this are what brother branham's going to say next is going to short-circuit our fuses because we think the seals are to the gentiles the trumpets are to the to the jews and then the vials are poured out during the three and a half year tribulation period and then we go i'm gonna study all this and all of a sudden brother branham is gonna say some things that are gonna take that picture and gonna gonna blow your circuits and then you're gonna say what do i believe and where did i get my belief now when i say this i want to preface this by saying all scripture has a compound meaning and a compound revelation and a compound fulfillment so just because brotherhood says it this way we look at it this way doesn't mean there won't be physical aspects and i'll take for instance the stone that was cut out of the mountain of hands and smote the defeat we've seen that happen do you believe you've seen that happen the catholic church all the protestants haven't been smoking have been ground to powder amen you've been freed from that now it's growing into a mountain but i believe and i may be wrong but i believe we'll see that same thing happen in a physical way when the kingdoms of the world are physically destroyed and the kingdom of christ is set upon the earth and i say it carefully this way and there's a reason i say it and i want to go slow because i get excited on this subject and i can just dance all over this platform and pace back and forth and preach it because i'm so excited about it because i think that they'll come a physical smiting and destroying of all the kingdoms of the earth i see it in scripture i see it i think it'll happen and that the kingdom of christ will be built but i'm so absolutely confident of the spiritual i know that's right i know that's right i know in the days of those 10 kings that brother branham pointed to and showed those those 10 kings that there was a stone cut out of the mouth and that stone has become my capstone my headstone but it's come to destroy the works of the catholic church i'm so confident of that i'm not so sure about the other it looks like it i believe it i believe it's there i believe it unfold but i'm so sure that i know this see before our mind has always been opposite i've been sure and the physical because i was taught that as a baptist or a pentecostal i've been so sure of that that i'm wondering isn't there a spiritual application could it be spiritually fulfilled also but now by the revelation of jesus christ that come through a prophet i'm so confident of the spiritual fulfillment of that word in daniel that i believe that there'll be a physical knowing that i could be wrong but i know it's already been fulfilled spiritually in the bride does that make sense to you everything in me is changing friends not changing like new religion knew this changing in a way that i finally feel like i understand why brother branham said what he said and before i'd read through feast of trumpets and just you know keep reading got that book done what did he mean by this what do you mean by that i you know was it good it was good is it the truth every word's the truth what's it mean don't ask me too many questions but we've had lots of places in the message like that we've read we've pondered over he says it in a certain way amen and i believe every bit of it's the truth he'll take two statements that look to be totally contrary totally a polar opposite contrary to one another and put him together what's he mean i don't know but i am not going to go any meanie mining mode take that one i just say he knows what he's talking about he knows what he's looking at when i see what he sees it'll make sense to me i'm willing to say i don't understand but when god by revelation opens up new territory and you see what the prophet saw amen you can walk forward in that even if you can't answer all the questions [Applause] they asked brother ben questions about the millennium there's a question he says um he says i don't know some places it looks like yes in some places it looks like no praise god i like that so all trumpets sounded under the sixth seal but brother branham said that these trumpets will be the ministry of the two prophets in revelations 11 moses and elijah and their prophecy their ministry won't start till the bride is out of the way right there and a physical rapture in a physical translation the bride is off the scene and those two prophets begin to minister and they bring the revelation of the trumpets is that right so so so so is the seventh seal open and they can't bring the or the revelation of the trumpets until after the bride is gone that's part of the seventh seal but everyone sounded under the sixth seal you see what i mean i want to draw something else we're not going to get very far is that okay i just i want to teach i love teaching and i preach too much you know the feast of the lord the seven feasts of the lord are a redemption cycle we believe that i'm just going to i'm just interjecting something so just pay attention to this for a minute you have seven feasts uh these are the feast of the lord and i hope i don't spell like lord or jesus or anything if i misspell that you're gonna kick me out but anything's possible so i'm going to write it like this in the physical fulfillment of the redemption side i shouldn't say physical it's physical spiritual you know i don't have words enough to explain this but i'm just gonna explain what i'm seeing and bear with me and hopefully you can see it and the day that jesus christ was here he was the first fruits right and and he was crucified he was taken and he was crucified as the passover lamb and and you go from passover to feast of unleavened bread to first fruits right so so you have these seven feasts i didn't plan on doing this so if i get run wrong just say hey you got that in the wrong spot you won't hurt my feelings passover unleavened bread first fruits pentecost trumpets atonement and tabernacles my penmanship is going downhill so so we have these feasts now when jesus christ came he came to who who did he come to the jews is that right he came to the jews and when he came to the jews he came as the passover lamb and he became the passover for the whole world but he came in his first ministry to the jews and he was their passover land then he became jesus himself became the feast of unleavened bread because you had unleavened bread for seven days brother i'm saying showing in the seven church ages there was going to be no leaven there's going to be pure word in all of it mixed in with man's ideas but there's going to be a strain of christ that goes through the seven church ages and then there's going to be the first the first fruits the first part to come to harvest will be taken and waived before the lord and way before the congregation and so now you have jesus death burial and resurrection in your first three feasts you got that then then 50 days later that's what pentecost means 50 50 days later or seven sabbaths later typing the seven church ages amen he comes to the feast of pentecost and in the feast of pentecost there's another wave there's wave loaves and now what was what was the grain that resurrected is now baked into the loaf or baked into the church and leaven's mixed in with it because we're still in hybrid conditions so now we're in the feast of pentecost and brother branham when it comes to feast of trump and say that's been that long gap between the resurrection of jesus christ and the feast of trumpets all three of these take place in the first month right and these all take place in the seventh month see that and in between the first month and seven months because after that comes the first church age to the seventh church age the long gap in between has been the feast of pentecost which has been the son of god the the resurrection the first fruits baked into the loaf so we understand that is that clear because brother graham says some things that's going to blow our mind about these feasts and there's just one point that i want to get to and i just don't want to belabor this but pray for me so when it comes to the jews when it comes to the cycle of redemption we've had passover jesus christ crucified unleavened bread that's that's a strain of pure word unleavened going through the church ages the first fruits he was the resurrected jesus christ then that first fruit gets baked into the loaf because pentecost has two wave loaves and it becomes christ in the church for seven church ages a long gap here is the seven church ages and then at the end of the seven church ages he turns back to the jews in the feast of trumpets and that's what brother bran's preaching and feast of trumpets and the purpose of the trumpets is to show them like the seals how god has been doing where he's been redeeming how he's brought them through how they got back how they were scout why they were scattered how they got back to the promised land and and reveals to them the their seventh trumpet which brother bram says the seventh trumpet to them is the same as the seventh seal to us which is what the revelation of jesus christ which brings them to the feast of atonement they recognize jesus christ the lamb that atoned for them and they recognized they missed it and now the feast of atonement becomes a feast of morning where everyone separates into his own home and mourns as though they lost their firstborn son and they say how could we have missed it that was him back there and we've missed it for these 2 thousand years and then that will bring the 144 000 to the jews and to the feast of tabernacles where christ will be with them and then bring them over into the millennium do we understand that cycle brother branham takes the same cycle these feasts he does something strange for the church he says in the seventh church age he said we are feasting now under the feast of tabernacles we are feasting now under the feast of tabernacles the seventh church age brother branham takes the seventh church age and the feast of tabernacles and puts them together because christ is dwelling in you he's come back in fullness under the feast of tabernacles why we've been introduced to the atonement he says we've been taken back to the old atonement the original word which bled for us and died for us and was given to us through the ministry of the apostles and prophets and was lost to the church ages now the messenger comes and he brings us back to that to recognize our atonement the bleeding bloody word and christ comes and lives and dwells in his bride in fullness and down becomes the feast of tabernacles in the seventh church so the jews are coming under the feast of trumpets number five and we're already over here in number seven this is the thing that i want to get in our head not everything that's redeemed has to be on the same timetable the jews can be into the fifth feast and we can be in the seventh feast at the same time and if we don't allow that we'll never understand what brother branham's saying we're going to be completely twisted up and confused why what we're under he says now we're under the the set we're we're under the seventh what is the seventh feast we're feasting under the feast of tabernacles the seventh church age that's why people started preaching were in the millennium why because brother branham says there's been six thousand years since the fall what fell when adam fell amen the earth also fell and the earth is an attribute of jehovah an attribute of god and so that earth has to be redeemed too so he's got to redeem gentiles he's got to redeem jews and he's got to redeem the earth but they don't all have to be on the same schedule and if we try to make them on the same schedule then we start preaching doctrine like we're already in the millennium because brother branham said we're feasting under the feast of tabernacles because brother branham clearly says in the millennium will be in the feast of tabernacles why does he say that he says because there's been six thousand years since the fall but that seventh one is the millennium and i'm not even going to spell it i'm not even going to try i can never spell millennium too many n's and too many l's and when he says when you get to that seventh thousand year he says now the earth is under the feast of tabernacles so we have a different schedule for the gentiles for the jews and for the earth and if we'll just allow that to be true and go back and read feast the trumpets and go back and read future home and all these other all the sun's like click click click click click that's what he's talking about because i don't know if we're in the millennium or we're not in the millennium is it the seventh age are we there's a feast of trump it's when did praise be to god everybody the earth can be in the sixth under the sixth feast under atonement because the blood dropped on it amen because the earth was redeemed the way we were redeemed first the water comes and washes it away then the blood comes and spills on it amen and then now christ and his bride comes and dwells in harmony on the earth what have you got now you go to the feast of atonement the blood dropping on we're under the feast of atonement we're in the 6 000 year and i know it doesn't matter years i know it's not a thousand each one but just listen to what i'm saying we're under the feast of atonement and getting ready to move in the feast of tabernacles where we all have glorified bodies and lived together with jesus christ and a glorified body on this earth for a thousand years and he calls that the feast of tabernacles but he says we're feasting now in the feast of tabernacles so is the millennium started now or does the millennium start after the rapture the three and a half year tribulation he says both because now the gentile bride has spiritually moved to the feast of tabernacles because all that was in christ is god is important to christ and all that was in christ has been poured into the church and now it's the feast of tabernacles because she recognized her atonement which was the bleeding bloody word amen and now the jews under the feast of trumpets they've got to have two prophets that show up and reveal to them what the trumpets have been all about and why they were rejected and why they were scattered and why they were regathered and what they missed 2 000 years ago and that seventh trumpet is the introduction amen what are those two prophets doing they're standing in the breach amen to connect the jews to the atonement which is jesus christ the slain lamb they're doing the same thing our prophet did for us to stand in the breach and now two prophets come and stand in the breach and say you missed it this is the atonement praise be to god and then they recognize in the feast of mourning that was him they recognized joseph right joseph reveals himself to them where is the bride at the time of joseph's revealing the bride's already in heaven brother ben said already put away in the in the heaven and the temple and he reveals himself to his brother and they begin to mourn and cry is that what happens in genesis they begin the morning christ and now he'll slay us for we've treated him so bad he says you meant it for evil but god meant it for good that's not a neat phrase amen given to joseph joseph is playing the part of christ revealing himself in the end time under a ministry of two prophets to reveal himself to his brother those two prophets are to connect them through the six seals what did the six trumpets do the six trumpets reveal the whole program to the jews from the time of christ on is that right what's the seventh trumpet the one who orchestrated the program what's the six seals it's the revelation of how he's been redeeming a bride through seven church ages and the whole plan from the fall in the garden how he was going to have a bride and restore a bride from that fall till now amen that was under six seals what was the seventh seal the one who was interpreting the six what's the seventh trumpet the one who orchestrated the six praise be to god what do we say next i don't even know what to say next there's more and more this is just the tip of the iceberg more and more and more but we've got to allow ourselves to be on a different schedule than the jews i'm seeing a schedule of redemption and a different schedule than the earth and if we do that brother branham said we can feast now under the feast of tabernacles no problem he said in the millennium we'll be feasting under the feast of tabernacles no problem but the jews are getting ready amen to have the wrap-up of their feast of trumpets if we all have to be in the same spot at the same time none of that works brother branham didn't know what he was talking about he didn't stutter and he didn't make a mistake and the feast of trumpets makes sense i don't care what anybody sells says the feast of trumpets makes sense future home makes sense brother branham knew what he was saying he got it by divine revelation he said when i'm teaching now in the trumpets he says not mine my own whatever he said is the truth and he's the one who's always told me these things he said i didn't get it of my own mind brother graham's not confused he's not mixing anything up he knows exactly what he's talking about but the brother branham he doesn't have to have the gentiles the jews in the earth in the same place in redemption they can be spread out in different spots and redemption and with that understanding when we go back and read the word all of a sudden just click click click click he knows what he's talking about the gathering of the the gathering of israel is the trumpets you got that the gathering of israel is the trumpets notice the very first trumpet sound blood fire hail everything scattered the ground see what was he doing bringing israel out of spiritual egypt back into his homeland let's go to let's go let's go to chapter 8. brother remember goes to chapter 8 verse 2. it says and i saw the seven angels which stood before god and to them we're given seven trumpets another angel came and stood at the altar i'm gonna go on down to the trumpet let's go to the first trumpet verse seven and the first angel sounded and there followed hail and fire mingle with blood they were cast upon the earth and the third part of trees was burned up and all green grass was burned out brother branham goes right to this and he points out the hail the fire and the blood you see says see all those things that moses that moses called him out of egypt with he said see this is the calling them out of spiritual egypt and calling them back into their homeland that's what he says and he says the trumpets are the gathering of israel now this is going to make a lot of sense in a minute he says every trumpet sounded under the sixth seal under the persecution of the jews notice revelation now eight and beginning the seventh verse all that was calling out of israel natural in egypt now it's the calling out of israel in the spiritual sense he was taking them ready to come to the feast of atonement remember every trumpet sounded under the sixth seal only then when it sounded are we seeing the picture friends that brother branham he really means this this is the fourth or fifth time he says this he really means this that every trump sounded under the six seal only then when it sounded so remember all the trumpets sounded on the sixth seal the sixth seal finishes the mystery did you catch that the sixth steal finishes the mystery under the sixth seal just before the seventh is opened the sixth seal finishes the mystery that's been hit in the whole bible because the seventh is the whole bible the seventh seal is christ and christ is those seals that was revealed and christ is the book the bible brother i said i see this seventh seal all the way back in genesis i can see the seven seal coming up coming up why it was all the seventh seal it was all christ being made known it was all building the family of god so it was all revealed under the sixth seal the sixth seal finishes the mystery under the sixth hill just before the seventh is open he said luke 17 30 and also malachi 4 hebrews 4 12 all these scriptures as promised this is to be between the 6 and 7 seal and the 6th and 7th trumpet catch that between the 6 and 7 seal and the 6th and 7th trumpet what's revealed luke 17 30 and malachi 4. all right can we look at the paper here brother franco between the sixth and seventh seal and the sixth and seventh trumpet brother branham's ministry is that what he said that means most of the trumpets are history we're looking for things to happen that have already happened that's why this gap is so important to understand will there be more happening in the future yes i'm sure will there be physical manifestation absolutely i believe that but what brother branham said is this ministry of luke 17 30 and malachi 4 comes between the 6th and 7th ceo and the 6th and 7th trumpet he says in recognizing your day and its message now at the end of these seven sabbaths which has been there is to be the day of atonement which was the seven trumpets and the seven trumpets was to call a day of mourning back to the sacrifice or the atonement for we find out then that israel the seven trumpets pertained only to israel and then why he wouldn't let me preach them seven trumpets i even was ready to announce it and had the halls ready and everything to go into to preach the seven trumpets there is something bothering me so bad i said keep we keep on working and billy and all of us trying to get everything ready for the air-conditioned building for this next coming week for the seven trumpets have ten days or eight days in the school auditorium but the holy spirit wouldn't let me do it for some reason and i wondered why and when i went in to pray i told the wife i'm going in and sincerely i knelt down before god to pray and he revealed to me that the seventh trumpet sounded under the sixth seal and i've done preached it supernaturally see it's the hand of god the whole thing it pertains to israel and we picked it up under the sixth seal you all who have that how the persecution of the jews and the time of the gentiles has been in the pentecostal feast the trumpets all of them was sounded under the sixth seal and we picked it up last sunday under the feast of trumpets if you all want to get it what was it to do to rush the jews from all parts of the world back into their homeland it must be there and the opening of the seals under the sixth seal the seventh trumpets sounded in the sixth seal now the seventh angel's message is to open the mystery of the seals calling the 11th hour gentile worker to receive the same pay that the first hour workers got he's trying to tell us something i want to look at one more thing and then we're going to close the sixth trumpet and the sixth seal sounds at the same time the sixth trumpet and the sixth seal sounds at the same time that can't be future do we understand because between the 6th and 7th seal and the 6th and 7th there's a prophet messenger luke 17 30 malachi 4 is fulfilled that can't be future that doesn't mean there's not it doesn't pertain to things in the future but it can't all be future and the sixth trump and the sixth seal sounds at the same time and between the sixth trumpet and the seventh trumpet there is a prophet to appear before the gentiles to call the people back to the original pentecostal doctrine and the two witnesses of revelation 11 appear to the jews to send them to jesus while the church is being taken up praise god let's look at this revelation chapter 9. revelation chapter 9 verse 13 the sixth angel sounded and i heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before god saying to the six to the sixth angel which had the trumpet loose the four angels which are bound in the great river euphrates the four angels were loosed which were prepared for an hour and a day and a month and a year for to slay the third part of men and the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred thousand thousand and i heard the number of them and thus i saw the horses in the vision and then that sat on them having breastplates of fire adjacent and brimstone and the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions and out of their mouths issued fire smoke and brimstone by these there was the third part of men killed by the fire by the smoke by the brimstone which issued out of their mouth we're getting low on time and we don't want to get too tired and too many details i don't want to miss this but i'm gonna i'm gonna just write down one more thing and then we're gonna come back and we're gonna hit this again on wednesday lord willing if we could go to our overhead i don't know how to say this i'll just say it this way the three woes in the book of revelation are three world wars world war one world war ii and world war three so let's look at this in in chapter eight revelations 8 verse 13 and i beheld and heard an angel flying through the midst of heaven saying with a loud voice woe woe woe to the inhabitants of the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels which are yet to sound revelation chapter nine verse one the fifth angel sounded and it tells all the things that happened when the fifth angel sounded then at the bottom of that that chapter verse 12 says one woe is past and behold there come two woes more hereafter so the fifth seal takes place at the time of the first world war which was 1918 it ended i think in 1918 or something like that so you realize brother branham was here for the first two woes that's astounding two world wars the woes that are in the scripture right here the first one happened during his lifetime amen and the second one happened during his lifetime and after the second woe he entered his ministry now look it says after the the fifth trumpet sounds one woe is past and behold there come two woes more hereafter two more world wars and then we move into the sixth trumpet and the sixth trumpet talks about those those demons being released out of the river euphrates and brother branham said and we'll go through all of this wednesday but brother bram said where did they go they went into the armies of hitler mussolini and stalin to bring a persecution against the jews and the sixth seal and the sixth trumpet sounded at the same time which is what war world two world war two so world war ii started in 1939 or something like that i didn't check all these i may be wrong but i'm just going by memory well you had the second woe started in world war ii brother branham gets his commission is it 1946 am i right 1946 he gets his commission because because because because because he gets commissioned at the decline of the second world war because revelations chapter 10 happens between the sixth and seventh trumpet after world war ii do we understand everything in the bible matches his ministry the book of revelation it matches his ministry amen he's growing up during the first war he's coming of age there's another war at the decline of that war amen it's going to set things in place that first war is what actually started amen there was a belfar declaration that came out of the first war because the jews helped finance some of the war and in a kickback from great britain they wanted to know what the financiers which were jews wanted and they wanted a zionist movement to move forward they wanted a homeland in palestine and the belfast declaration came out then that started the process of giving them land because the trumpets are to gather israel to their homeland and war one was instrumental in gathering israel to their homeland and set the foundation but world war ii set the stage when those demons were released and brought a bitter persecution against the jews it was doing what driving them to the homeland and changing the mind of all the nations to go back to the belkfire declaration and give them a piece of land in palestine why because the woes because the trumpets are all moving israel back into their homeland so the two prophets can show up to bring them to the feast of atonement so they can recognize the slain lamb the whole world is moving around your bible the whole world is moving in conjunction with these scriptures and brother branham's life and ministry is moving right in line with every bible we should have so much confidence in this word we've watched nations rise and nations fall in our some of our lifetimes because of this word we've watched war start and stop instantly because it was only world war one was only to start to get things rolling but it wasn't going to happen until world war ii we watched events national events the the two big toes iron and clay trying to mix but they won't mix it all fell apart to signal to brother branham that now we're at the end time you can move into the book of revelation and start preaching the church ages not coincidence not some man's fancy idea not people are easily persuaded but the bible alive in your history book a bible alive all around us where are we at in time france we're at the end of the end of the end israel's gathered back home amen when the last when the last member of the bride is gathered in and the last of the 144 000 are gathered in then there's going to mark a translation time for you and i and that ministry will kick up to those two witnesses and they're gonna reveal to them they're not going you know opening the seals was not starting each seal because most of the seals were historical revealing the trumpets is not starting the trumpets because by the time they reveal it it'll be historical amen what happened in the gap in the book of revelations between the six and seventh seal between the sixth and seventh trumpet and between the sixth and seventh vial i'll tell you what happened a bride was called out of the gentiles and 144 000 jews were called out of the jewish tradition that's what happened under what under an eagle anointing of prophets three of them all together that's what's happening in the gap gathering what gathering us to christ the word gathering them to a home so that they can receive christ the word that prophet's ministry it lifts right out of the bible and my life is intertwined with this word brother brandon makes another statement want to make one more and then we're going to close we're going to have to close if i keep going there'll be so many details i won't even know what i'm talking about after a few minutes revelations 9 12 again after war one one woe was passed fifth trumpet and behold there come two woes more hereafter the sixth trumpet all the demons release out of euphrates and go to persecute the jews to drive them back to the homeland under the sixth seal if you just listen to me here under the sixth seal which opened when this river opened and these demons came out do you believe that and went into the armies to persecute the jews that was the opening of the sixth trumpet and brother banner said the sixth trumpet and the sixth seal sound at the same time because the sixth seal is judgment and persecution tribulation so it was a tribulation brother van calls it in the seals an amateur tribulation or a minor tribulation but nonetheless it was the sixth seal and it was the sixth trumpet come open then and after it opened you have the calling of a prophet and that prophet's life is on display he's doing the sign of the prophet everything's happening but that prophet can't begin his ministry into the book of revelation until he sees the kingdom of those ten toes and when those ten toes come together he knows now it's time for the stone that can be cut out of the mount without hand it's time for the the revelation of jesus christ which is the seventh seal it's the seventh seal that crushes those powers it's the seventh seal that sets up a kingdom in the millennium it's a seventh seal that you've united with it's a seven seal you're part of it's the seventh seal that brought the revelation it's the seventh seal that gathered in the it's under the trumpets gathered israel together and in that time under the sixth seal he says everything sounds under the sixth seal everything happens under the sixth seal brothers branham's ministry happens under the sixth skill because in the sixth seal persecution tribulation set in on the jews it starts a marker it starts a time date stamp marker and from there it'll run to the end of the three and a half year tribulation period and under that sixth seal a prophet comes to the gentiles gathers the gentiles together the gentiles are called home two prophets break out in revelation chapter 11 to bring the the feast of trump it's the revelation of the trumpets to the jews amen the 144 000 are called out they're martyred they're resurrected i think i'm not sure but it looks like but the rem said they were the world goes in absolute chaos the vials are poured out everything is is destroyed in jesus christ and the 144 thousand and the bride returned to set up an earthly kingdom in the millennial reign all of that up to the millennium happened under the sixth seal where are we at now under the sixth seal having united with the seventh seal we are the very manifestation of the seventh seal revelation 10 under the sixth seal is revelations 10 between the 6th and 7th trump and i mean under the 6th trumpet revelations 10. another mighty angel come down from heaven why because under the sixth seal we've come to the seventh step and there's somebody that can bridge the gap between number six and number seven there's somebody that can stand in the gap a prophet and tie six and seven together and six and seven together and six and seven together so that we would know who we are and where we came from and where we are in the timeline and what happens next and where we're going and what what we're going to enjoy in the next thousand years somebody came in the gap and it was a prophet to tie these two together to bridge the game but let's look at verse seven but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god shall be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets do we believe that brother brahma says in the feast of trump is look i want to say one more thing closely now don't miss this how striking from the seventh angel's message he injects in parentheses somebody put parentheses how striking from the seventh angels message messenger of the seventh seal he said seventh angel's messenger the messenger of who is brother branham the messenger of the seventh seal from the seventh angels messenger of the seventh seal message in revelations 10 so what was his message revelations 10 was the seventh seal what was revelation 10 the seventh seal that's his message the seventh seal now he says from the seventh angels message in revelation 10 was the seventh seal to the seven trumpets between those times what happens between those times between the seventh angels message the 17th on revelations 10 and between the seventh trumpet that shows up in 1115 you have two things that take place you have the under the seventh seal the angel that descends the thunders the revelation under the seventh angel but then you have john in revelations 10 8 who's told to go and take the book out of the mighty angel's hand and eat the book and prophesy again what is that the seventh seal under the sixth seal in between the seventh seal and the seventh trumpet you have christ coming through a son of man ministry a prophetic ministry now you have the bride eating the book and prophesying again then you go to two prophets and then you have the seventh trumpet where are we you can put your finger right down here revelations 10 verse 11. that's me that's me and world events has lined up to bring us here and everything that's going on in the world is to promote this and everything that's happening amen is to get this bride amen to gather together to get this bride to this word amen so that she can get out of the way so that the the message could go to the 144 000. and where are we right here brother branham had a ministry in the gap the two witnesses have a ministry in the gap and the bride has a ministry in the gap and i say thank god for telling us who we are and if god if god moved nations if god crumbled peace treaties if god anointed khrushchev to take his shoe off and pound it on the table to show us where we are what anointing is in the earth now to make sure that we do our job to make sure that we're in the right place in the right time with the right revelation speaking the right words everything is moving around these scriptures friends everything that's happening all pandemics all governments all whatever is happening financial rises financial collapse you rest assured fred that everything that moved in brother branham's life there's still just as many things moving right now because this is the seventh steal i mean we're still under the sixth seal amen we're still the bride is united with the seven seal and she's prophesying again what's been said before and everything on earth is facilitating that if it looks good if it looks bad if it hurts if it feels good it doesn't matter the whole world is turning around these scriptures in this bible and you're in that scripture in this bible and so the whole thing is moving to make sure you're in the right the whole thing moved can you imagine what moved globally and how many people died amen in that world war one in world war ii just to make a place for the jews to come back to and to give an incentive for them to go back and now they've run back to that place and they're there they're their own country own money own military and they're still gathering people in by the thousands why because there's got to be a ministry of the seventh trumpet why because of this bible not because of their ideas because of the prophecy not because of some man's idea in some pretty country some nice currency and some politics politics is controlled by this word there's a lot more i want to say but we'll come back let's all stand i hope i hope some of that was clear to you i hope some of it came across and i hope it wasn't too much it overwhelmed you but i say like brother benham said i've tried to draw it out and map it out here i may have some of it wrong boy that's a big thing to say you're preaching but i know one thing what i'm looking at is the truth what brother brandon said is right what when he says this all happens under the sixth seal he's right when he says the six and seven seals sound at the same time he's right it's nothing but the truth and it's truer than truer than true amen but i just say god reveal it to us in a greater way let me see it i hope more than anything that this revelation that grows out of the church ages the seals and the trumpets and the vials hopefully in the future i hope it edifies and purifies your heart do you feel edified let it purify if god sought thought so much of you and i his brother branham his word and those two prophets and 140 000 he thought so much of them to orchestrate all the world events to make it matches scripture how can we not give him everything how can we not put our confidence in him what's going to fail you tell me what's going to fail you look at the prophecy laying in this scripture what we just went through and what brother branham saw and pointed out you tell me what's going to fail nothing's going to fail nothing that threatens you nothing that's going to harm you nothing is every nothing is going to work to throw you off god's course and nothing that god said is going to fail it may not look like what we expected it may not come in the way we predicted but nothing is going to be out of kilter he's so perfectly tuned his word and he's moved this world to match his word there's nothing going to be out of kilter friends oh i want to have more rest i say that to myself because i want to have more rest in the hour of calamity i want to have peace that passes understanding i want to be like a baby in this mother's arms amen and the whole world is falling apart but i know i can find my place in scripture and i can find how we got here and i can see the world events that brought us here how is the future not just as secure and how is my life not just as ordained as brother branham's was we're children of god let the revelation of it edify and purify our hearts god bless you be praying for me there's so many more things i'd like to share on wednesday and maybe the next sunday but i'm overwhelmed this is nothing new brother ben said all these things but all of a sudden in my heart i'm having aha moments and what's the purpose to jump up and down and say i know i know i know i know something i know i know why khrushchev beat his ch is as shoe no because the revelation of it edifies and purifies my heart seeing the seals and the trumpets and the vial it purifies and edifies my heart my god my father my husband has tuned his word in it's pre-programmed and it's not going to falter my position is secure in christ i'm part of this word and it's perfect and because that word which i was part of bled and died to pay my redemption price i am also perfect not perfect in my conduct not perfect in my thinking but perfect in the seed gene in my soul it is perfect because when the price was paid i was there paying the price with him i am perfect perfectly in line with this word and the word is going to be perfectly manifest in me because i was there and i was there and i was in the mind of god before it was ever written and i was there when it was written i'm in the print and i was on the cross and i was there amen let's just pray the heavenly father we thank you lord jesus god there's so much lord there's just so much lord it's not about information lord let it never be about that but let it be about revelation to edification god you're so perfect your ways are so perfect everything you've done is perfect and i pray god that you would just reveal yourself to me that i can see lord what your prophet saw help me god never to stumble or to falter or to change what he said or put it off in some other place but god just shine that light a little further lord and give us the courage to walk forward when we see another place to step when we see a little further in the path give us that courage to move forward not knowing where it would lead not knowing where it will go not knowing when it might turn or go up or go down but give us that courage to keep walking and lord if we can be faithful to walk i pray that you keep shining that light further and further for you're leading us home lord dear god i pray that you bless your people that you'd give us the spirit of revelation that we could actually see our bibles and see the gap in our bibles and what takes place there and that it would encourage us lord and i pray god that you would cleanse our hearts and use us for this final push we know that the end time was declared all the way back in 1960 by a prophet and we know that the end time cycle is finishing everything and one day you're going to finish our ministry on this earth and call us home let us be found faithful lord let us be found faithful to that day give us revelation give us wisdom to handle it and give us a desire from the hunger for you we ask that you would bless us all as we go our way keep us by your grace in jesus christ's name we pray amen god bless you saints i love you all i pray that there is something helpful said today i feel like i jumbled it up and i mess if you knew what was in my heart you'd be like chad you ruined it if you knew what god and god drops things into your heart without explaining it to your mind have you ever experienced that he'll drop something to your heart and you know it you know it like you know your own name but to explain it it's just something altogether different i come through the pulpit today and not under anxiety because all the things that i'm saying i have no idea how to explain i don't even understand everything intellectually but there's something that i'm seeing that's real it's true and it's showing me that we're all the way through the book of revelation the bride is all the way in revelation 22 17 and she's standing there saying the spirit and the bride say come she's come all the way to the end of her ministry she's come all the way through all of these things and she's standing here at the end declaring come come and everything i see just reinforces that lesson we're not waiting for things to happen they've happened for the bride they've happened we're now feasting in the seventh feast the feast of tabernacles what comes next for the bride nothing it's already happened the next thing to happen is for us to go because for us he's already come for us he's already come what is the seventh seal the coming of the lord but brother branham said the seventh seal was the mystery of going why because we're standing in the place we've already been revealed the mystery of his coming but what's left is the mystery of going because that's not been told yet that third part of that vision hasn't been told to us yet [Music] what under the seventh seal a prophet comes to introduce us to the messiah to make an introduction to join us and he goes off the scene in the seven trumpets two prophets show up to make an introduction to join them together you see it's all the seventh seal and in the vials we haven't got today but the viles is to prepare the earth for the millennial reign to what bring christ to the earth to make an you see it seven seals introduced the gentiles to christ seven trumpets to introduce the jews to christ and the seven vials to bring christ to the earth for his millennial reign three things that are being redeemed the jews the gentiles and the earth three different cycles of redemption three different ways of introduction but what is it they're all coming to the seventh seal it's all the coming of the lord coming to the bride as a bridegroom amen coming to an invisible union that's the coming of the lord where is he coming now he's coming to the jews amen as the slain lamb as the true atonement coming now through two prophets ministry coming to be introduced to them what is it the coming of the lord and then when he comes as king the son of david is sitting on the earth on a purged earth in the millennium what is that the coming of the lord which one's the coming of the lord they're all the coming of the lord which one's the seven seal it's all the seventh seal but which one am i part of i'm right now in that first coming he is coming me do we understand when we see these things it takes so much fight away has he come or is he coming the coming of the lord no he's not coming till he sits his feet on there no he's coming as the thief in the night no but he'll be coming to the jews my goodness it's all true friends and the prophet says it all that's why there's so much fight and so much argue because the problem says he's come and then he says he's coming and then but you understand if you look at the three cycles of redemption then you can say if you're standing here as a gentile if you're the bride of jesus christ you say the lord has come amen if you're a jew you're looking for the lord to come and if you're the earth you're waiting for your king you're waiting to be purged for your king to come and set everything in order so for me he's come for the jew he's coming and for the earth he's coming but for me he's come and i've united with him in an invisible union and i've been caught through the open door and i've seen the mysteries revealed i'm feasting in the seventh trump of the seventh feast the feast of tabernacles because he's dwelling in this tabernacle the feast of tabernacles i'm in my spiritual millennium my king sitting on the throne of my heart ruling and reigning i will be in a physical millennium but right now the son of david solomon has come and brought me into the golden age of revelation where me and my savior are united together big why because i know beyond a shadow of a doubt that the smiling stone has come and smote that image in its feet and that has grown into a great mountain and i'm part of that kingdom i don't know what that does to you but that does everything in the world to me that's my life that's my existence that's my whole heart that's everything i live for is that right there and i can't explain it right i don't understand it correctly i don't put the pieces together right but that's my whole life and we may not get it exactly right but he'll forgive me if we got something wrong because he knows where my heart is and he knows what we're pressing towards hold that lantern up again friends and see if you can't see another step and let's take that other step and see if it won't open up some more let's sing a song [Music] dressed in garments i have no earthly you're the one who leads
