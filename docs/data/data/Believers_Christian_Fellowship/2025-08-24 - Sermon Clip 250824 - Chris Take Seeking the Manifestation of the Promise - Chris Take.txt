========================================

Brother Brandham was the the the fulfillment and was the the manifestation of the promise of Malachi 45 and 6. &gt;&gt; But the point of that was to minister about the promise and point us so we could say here's the signs, here's the scriptures. Now because of that and because you believe that already when you hear the message, you look and say, "Where is Jesus? Where is the Messiah?" He said he'd come today. Where is he? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But if there's something missing, the way of God has not been yet more perfectly expounded unto you, you will stop with John's ministry. You will stop with the ministry of brother Brandham. And that's all you will receive. &gt;&gt; And you won't seek the manifestation of the promise. &gt;&gt; Because now in our age, what is supposed to happen? You and I, I say this way, the bride of Jesus Christ should be manifesting the promise. &gt;&gt; Where's the signs, Brother Chris? &gt;&gt; Show me evidence. &gt;&gt; I don't see anything. I'm sorry, but that's it. But now a son of God says, "I never been here before. I'm new to this church. Can you can you show me what it means? &gt;&gt; And they go, I knew it. &gt;&gt; You see, saints, it comes down to the end of it. It all depends on the sovereign grace of Jesus Christ. It all depends on Christ himself revealing himself to you. And if you are new, which Christ is inside of you, you're not yet aware of that. When you meet Christ and your brother, &gt;&gt; something testifies back and forth. There's a twinkle in the eye. There's a a recognition, a glimmer of recognition. And now, now you see it. And now you're saying, "God, I want to be the manifestation of the promise." &gt;&gt; That is what God is looking for. He says, "I must decrease." Where says, "I must decrease. He must increase." Elijah throws the mantle. Elisha must complete the ministry. &gt;&gt; So, we're looking to what? the manifestation of what the word says about the bride of Jesus Christ.
