========================================

let's just stick with the bible amen let's just stick with the scriptures and get this out of my mind that this is a bad group and this is a good group amen the ones he's calling accursed were priests and preachers and ministers amen people who lived clean lives upon the earth amen they were whole considered holy men by everybody around them they had families and had children and held down jobs and paid their taxes and obeyed the speed laws and went to church every sunday amen but because they persecuted the true church because they fought against the truth amen because they called blasphemous names to the things that were actually righteous and holy and clean amen he wasn't judging them because they they didn't they lived a nasty life on earth they lived a fine life on earth they they they they did good works on the earth they they may have fed the poor amen they may have have clothed naked children in africa they may have done all kinds of things but god is not calling them cursed amen because they didn't do good works he's calling them cursed because they did not receive the word in their day they didn't even treat it right they didn't even give it a a clothing they didn't even give when the word was expressed when elohim was materializing they didn't even have the common decency amen to give him a little bit of food or even be kind to him the other group that he says enter you into the joys of the lord amen the other group that he says enter in he wasn't calling them amen if you by human eyes would just look at this you'll see in that group that goes that way will be the biker with the tattoos and the sleeves and the neck piercings but there was something in him that could love an expressed attribute of god there was something in him that just wanted to do something for you it could be your neighbor it could be a co-worker it could be who knows what it will be but there's something in them it's not a c gene of god because they can't be a seed gene of god and not come all the way into the word amen but but there's something in them that loves elohim materializing they may not be able to break out of a life of sin they may not be able to stop amen the influences in their life or overcome past trials as a child and afflictions and all the things that they may not be able to get free from that amen but there's one thing that they can do and there's one thing amen that the the lord jesus christ expresses in this separation is that when i was hungry you fed me but what about these tattoos i can take care of that what about my adultery and what about what about this and what about that amen that's not in question at this judgment at this judgment what is in question is what did you do with the word when you came in contact with it could you even be nice to it amen could you even express human love
