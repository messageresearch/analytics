========================================

amen now when you see the story of Esther where does your mind go when you think about Ruth cleaning in the field and Ruth laying at boaz's feet and Boaz doing the Kinsmen Redeemer work and coming back and sowing in her a mysterious seed a hidden mysterious seventh portion of seed where do we get that from by the revelation of the open book amen that's where those things come from you don't get it from a surface reading and understanding the Greek words amen amen it's the hidden Mystery that's been hidden in the book amen remember and Junior Jackson's dream there was a great pyramid of stone there and brother Branham there was there was writing all around the stone and he was walking around this Great Pyramid and he was interpreting all the writing on the outside amen that's when the prophet was tying together the Loose Ends all the doctors who the seven Church ages but after he had finished interpreting all the writing on the outside amen there was something inside this rock in this pyramid that no light had ever shined on before amen so he raised his hand in the air he got a sharp instrument peeled the top off said there was White Rock with nothing written on it what is he talking about he's talking about Revelations 10 1-7 where the seven Thunders were never written in the Bible they're all through the Bible but what the seven Thunders uttered was not written Thunder one said this thunder two said that it's a revelation a White Rock that's inside the Bible amen that's never had light shined on before no man-age anointing could ever tell you what those it was going to take a prophet who can get it from God himself and bring it and no amount of teaching will get you to believe that we can get you to intellectually agree with it we can get you to pass the message test on it but there's going to take something Supernatural to drop that into your heart to actually believe that there was a mystery in this whole Bible a white stone laying in the midst of this throughout from Genesis the Revelation that nobody understood no Bible teacher no Bible school until one little Prophet with a seventh grade education come and in a little room the angel comes to him day by day and tells him what John heard but could not write you can say you agree with that but the time is coming when the squeeze will come down we'll find out whether we believe that or not because it can only be received by Revelation not by education we can repeat it back but you go and try to sell that to a theologian he wants to know what what verse was that where did it say that just exactly like that for us we see it everywhere it's all through the Bible this great mystery of the seventh seal it was always there it was Adam and his wife amen it was Boaz and Ruth it was King as an Esther it's been there the whole time we didn't see it until the end time
