========================================

who asked for the message to come who asked God to send the prophet who asked God to fulfill the prophecy in our day he did it himself who asked God to come down as a son of man as the son of man he did it himself who asked God to make me part of the promise he did it himself who asked God to predestinate me he did it himself it's all his doing amen so he came amen and he gave himself amen that he might sanctify and cleanse his bride with the washing of water of the by the word amen so that he might sanctify and purify and present to himself a bride without spot or wrinkle why because there's a purpose behind it all and the purpose is all the way back in the original purpose that God had given Adam a wife and that was so he could reproduce himself upon the earth and the same thing's taking place in this day God came down amen like he did on the planes of memory he did a mighty work not so you could say he did a mighty work what was he doing he was bringing you a word that would cleanse you and I and bring us back to our virgin condition like we were at the beginning so we can meet him and have a conception to reproduce Christ upon the Earth again that's the point of it all amen and so many times we find we get hung up in certain places we get hung up and God sent a prophet and look at all the Miracles that's beautiful but there's something else behind it there's a mystery in the mystery amen we get excited about the restoration of the gifts we get cited about the Miracles and we get excited about the the truths being connected back together and the correct teaching that is all beautiful we should get excited about all of it but don't stop there don't stop until there's a conception in your soul and Christ Is Made Alive In You and I that's the purpose from the beginning that was thwarted by the devil in every Church age that's what the devil has stopped amen but in this one it's not going to be stopped because God has determined amen that he's going to fulfill his promise in this day this is the time there's a place do you know where the place is can you say by faith this is the place this is where he's going to fulfill his promise this is why because Something's Happened to me that I cannot explain to you but something inside of me says the promise is for me he's changed me deep on the inside outside I still have problems I still have hybrid flash I still make mistakes I still sometimes view things the wrong way misunderstand stuff but the change didn't take place from the outside the change took place in a private meeting deep in my soul and something deep inside is changed brought back to a virgin condition so that this could be the place to fulfill the promise
