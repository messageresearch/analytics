that it is true took me all this time to find [Music] reality all I I ever really want is you all that really counts all that's really true all that really matters the Lord is you everything to gain nothing now to lose all I I ever really want is you so take the grandest thing you know that life can give weigh it with eternity's bright side one thing I have learned in all this life I've lived there is truly nothing good but God all that really count all that's really true all that really matters Lord is you everything to gain nothing now to lose all I ever re really wanted he once more all that really counts all that's really true all that really matters Lord is you everything to gain nothing now to lose all I ever really want is you amen God bless you all this evening it's certainly good to be together God bless you brother Gabe it's good to see you back in the service amen and I'm excited to have brother Stan come and I know this is the first time for many of you to get acquainted with him him and I are new friends we just met for the first time last year and had some fellowship as he was passing through on his way to visit a daughter and I so enjoyed the fellowship that we shared it was so meaningful to me and and the vision that he has for the word it was so encouraging to me and so we've found out that he was coming back to visit a daughter again he was in the area and he was gracious enough to extend his trip he and his wife extended their trip just a little bit so they include us and so they'll be heading back he's a pastor in a church in nvar Florida he's been a pastor for 17 years there now so they'll be heading back there tomorrow but I'm so glad that you can get acquainted with him because the fellowship we've shared over the last two days has been really sweet really good and so I've been looking forward to hearing him come we want him to feel at home amen we want him to relax brother brandom said the key to operating a gift is to relax amen and we I know we can help him relax amen if we'll just pull on the word and receive What the Lord Has for us so we want brother Stan to come at this time and we want him to be able to relax take his time and share what the Lord has given to him and uh we just want to welcome him amen let's sing a song as he comes consum to me Lord by the fire of your spirit [Laughter] consume me Lord and make me more you break me Lord and bless the broken pie of my life let be Lord I once more consume me thank you Lord cons me Lord the of your spirit consume me Lord and make me more [Music] like break be lordless the broken PES of my let me be used oh Lord you you know is that your prayer this evening you know if we get consumed by him there's nothing left right that's the objective you know the objective is not for us to come to some kind of a exaltation of you know the sunship is Christ in you amen the hope of glory I mean he's the son and so the the whole idea of Christianity is for us to die cuz the Bible said we were crucified with Christ if I'm crucified with Christ then there's nothing left of me the only one that's left is Christ because the life that I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God and so that's what Christianity is about it's about not accumulating knowledge but about surrender and sacrifice while you're standing thank you very much for the music I enjoyed it let's turn to our Bibles uh to Hebrews the 9th chapter and we'll read a couple of verses maybe the uh I we'll read the first uh five verses of of Hebrews the 9th chapter I'm I'm so excited to be here I I was actually here a long time ago about 20 years uh my wife and I and and and a couple of other couples that came with us uh sat right there in the back brother Lonnie uh preached a message that morning and and uh but I never in a million years thought that I would be standing in this Pulpit right here in fact that was 2005 and uh I never even thought I was going to be a pastor you know but the Lord directs our past you know we don't know you know he we're bought with a price you know we can we can have all our life plans and our goals and that's and that's fine that's fine but everything is at the mercy of his will and and you know he he knows what he wants to do with you and so whenever we're willing to sacrifice our life then well the prophet said the the the greatest enemy I had is William brandham and he said if I can get that guy out of the way he can do great things that William brandom knows nothing about and I'll tell you what if the Lord is it blesses us tonight it won't be stand price I can promise you that had a say tell him brother Chad I had a friend of M or one of the sisters in the church she and and I've been in the church since the year after it started in 1969 and there was a sister that was there probably from the mid 70s and when I became Pastor she said I know this is the Lord because I know Stan price and so so you may not know stand price but if there's anything good that happens here tonight it's going to be the will of the Lord I believe that Hebrews the 9th chapter and we'll read from the first verse then verily the first Covenant had also ordinances of divine service and a worldly sanctuary and there was a tabernacle made the first wherein was the Candlestick and the table and the showbread which is called the sanctuary and after the second Veil The Tabernacle which is called the holiest of all which had the golden sensor and the Ark of the Covenant overlaid with uh roundabout with gold wherein was the golden pot that had mana and Aaron's Rod that budded and the tables of the Covenant and over at a cherubim over at the cherubims of Glory shattering the mercy seed of which we now or cannot now speak particularly let's bow our hearts our wonderful uh heavenly father as our brother Chad has already uh uh prayed in the back there Lord we believe that we have come here by a Divine appointment we believe before the foundation of the world uh you have directed the paths of each person here and you've placed them at this place right now and we are believing father that you're the one that's send control of this this meeting tonight and and we commit ourselves uh into your wonderful and Loving Hands may may uh your word go forth and have its free course in our lives and and may it not return to us void and we pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen God bless you you can be seated I'm I'm going to preach something here tonight that I've I've never haven't preached at home we've been in a study of the book of Hebrews at home for U well about two years and uh and we're up to chapter nine and and uh the the book of Hebrews is an amazing amazing book in fact I you know if I was cast into prison and I can only choose one book of the Bible I would choose the book of Hebrews because the book of Hebrews the prophet said that did Paul is appearing law and Grace and and and that's and that's true but let's look at it a little bit deeper because the law came because of time the law came because of sin right because it was it was never you know we can look at things and we can say that it was never God God's plan covered everything okay I'm not saying it wasn't part of God's plan but when God brought Israel to the mountain he didn't offer them a law he offered them a relationship in fact if you if you study the scripture uh you know they God you know wanted Israel to come to the mountain and everything and then Moses said well hey wait you you told the people that they couldn't come to this mountain you know that that if they came to the mountain they would die or whatever and the Lord said it's not you know it wasn't that the Lord was going to speak directly to Israel but if you read the the scripture carefully they were going to be able to hear the voice of God when he spoke to Moses and it and and they said when they heard the trumpet sounding and everything they said well we don't want to hear this' you know because we're going to die well that's really the objective amen the objective is to hear the voice of God and die right but but they but they didn't want that so they said just tell us what God wants us to do and we'll do it well God did what they asked and he gave them a law but he also knew that they would never be able to keep it so he gave them a sacrifice they never asked for a sacrifice they said just tell us what we need to do but God knew that they could never keep the law so he gave them a sacrifice and that sacrifice represented Christ because there's no way that we can by commandment keep the word of God and so so the law represented a Time condition right but Grace is something that has no boundary of time amen because even in the garden you know we look at no no because Noah I think means rest and and we talk about Grace and and then we talk about the Life of Christ and Grace was extended and so forth but really Grace existed in the Garden of Eden because Adam was was created in the image of God but Adam had the privilege of fellowship with God and he never earned that amen and so that was God's grace and so and so kind of in a in in in a way that I like to look at things because I always like to as as a message as as someone's been in the message a long time I was telling brother Chad today something that's really affected my life a lot is that I like to look at things and try to understand how things would be had there never been a fall and so because eternity didn't stop in the garden that's right When sin happened eternity is going on right now eternity is right now it's it's right here right now that's right that's right right in fact there was a testimony I share this because I think this was this was really good there was a we had a watch Night Service New Year's I wasn't there but the brothers decided to have it without me which really made me happy I mean it made me happy brother Chad that they were willing to that I was not the the Lynch pen that held the whole church together that caused thing to happen so they had testimonies and this one sister she had a testimony she says I'm standing at the window washing dishes and I look out and there's my cat playing in the backyard and she thought what day does he think it is and and and she said he thinks it's just now yeah and and so tomorrow will he recognize that there was a yesterday no it'll just be today and she said that's the way God is amen there's no yesterday There's No Tomorrow there's only now there's only a god he's he said I am the I am and so if you look carefully at the book of Hebrews Paul is is really showing you the difference between Time and Eternity and so and he illustrates it this way because you would think it all of Paul's writings you know when he's dealing with Redemption and he's dealing with and and the book of Hebrews deals with Redemption but the book of Hebrews deals more with the result of redemption than it does with the actual Redemption process now he's talking about he's talking about uh here even in this chapter in chapter 10 he's talking about the sacrifice and the high priest and everything and that's that's all true but watch what he says in the book in in in the sixth chapter he says leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let's go on to Perfection now we could read that we're not going to take the time to do it but but he says he says doctrine of baptisms you know the doctrine leaving the doctrine of Christ the doctrine of baptism the doctrine of of uh of judgment the doctrine of repentance from dead works we talked all of these doctrines are things that in the message we Embrace these as being very important and they are important but Paul is saying that all of these things that we have have a result am and that's what this me message is focused on this message I've I've shared it several times on this trip even this message didn't come to teach us to evangelize right because we had evangelism the message didn't necessarily even come to establish doctrines it came to establish what the correct Doctrine was you know I mean that was all necessary but I tell you what a million years from now brother Chad and I are going to be walking in new heavens and new earth and we're never going to talk about serpent seed we're not going to talk about we're not going to talk about eternal security you know we're not going to talk about doctrines and things and and and I'll be a little bit bold with this but we're not even going to be talking about the crucifixion of Christ because we're going to be living in a life where sin never happened yeah and so when you when you look and and and you view do the book of Hebrews in this way then it it makes the book of Hebrews different because that's what Paul's really doing here he's not dealing with the Christ that died on Calvary he's dealing with the Resurrection Life he's dealing with the one that came out of the Grave amen okay and so that's what we're looking at here tonight but we're looking at it in a way that I think that it's very timely in the message right now because the message is under a great attack I mean most of you know I mean we've known for years and we've seen the websites and all this stuff and and and I'm tell you what and and I've had good conversation with brother Chad I am not here to address any of that nonsense because I don't care about it my my focus has always been on the attribute you know if if if we're here to answer certain questions about things that you know the things that are brought brought up okay I'll tell you what let me let me share an experience I had years ago I went to Nicaragua and and I have this uh I have this meeting uh with Min I don't even know I didn't even know they were going to be a ministers meeting but we got there and they have this impromptu ministers meeting and there's like 20 or 30 ministers sitting around this table and so I'm there and of course I'm the I'm the white guy I'm the I'm the American so I'm all knowing and and so they begin to ask questions and things and this one brother stood up and he says and he says D interpreter he didn't speak English but he says brother Stan says what are we going to do about all this false Doctrine that's going on well I didn't know but he's talking he's he's like looking at other brothers at the table and I said I said brother I said the problem is if we sit and we try to figure out some way of dealing with this stuff we're using the same thing to deal with it that caused it yeah I said what we need to do is we need to focus on the attribute of God because the only thing that's going to bring a Unity to the bride is the spirit of Christ it's not going to be I'm on the same page you're on the same page you know what do you believe about this what do you believe about that when I met brother Chad last year I didn't need to ask him what he believed to know that he was my brother because I recognized there was a connection and there's and there's you can't practice that you know it has nothing to do with him meeting my qualifications for a brother it has to do with recognizing something that's a part of that see that's what True Fellowship is it's a blending together so let's get to let's get to our message so what Paul is dealing with here in the in the ninth chapter we're we're Fami you know I don't have any quotes with me tonight in fact I don't have any notes at all I have some things on my heart which way I want to go but but the the we're all familiar with an Old Testament Tabernacle and that's what Paul's dealing with here but the prophet taught us and and which it's not unique to the prophet I think most of Christianity deals with the thought that the Old Testament Tabernacle represented a body okay because you have an outer court and the outer Court the brother brandham talks about was subject to the uh the things that went on around it it would it would rain and and everything would get wet it would be sunny everything would be hot you know and so forth so it was influenced by the outside art so that's your body but on the inside inside this inside this rectangle building there were two rooms and one of them was called a holy place and in that Holy place like what Paul says here we could go back and prove it but Paul lays it out there was to the left there was a golden candlestick all right and straight ahead was a table of incense and to the right was a a table of showbread and then from there there was a a veil right and only once a year could the high priest alone nobody else only the high priest could go in behind that Veil and inside that Veil there was only one thing and it was the Ark of the Covenant with The Mercy Seat over it but in the scripture inside the Ark of the Covenant there were three things there was the tables you know the tables of the Covenant there was the there was the pot of mana and then there was Aaron Rod that budded now in in the illustration of this Tabernacle it being a body the holy place is your spirit the spirit realm right and the holy of holies represents the soul amen so I want you to think about this because this is what makes this message so perfect person Al because these items this body that was represented is not the physical body of Jesus and the reason I'm going to say that is because this body needed to be redeemed amen right everything in there had to be sprinkled with blood that's right amen right but the body of Jesus didn't have to be sprinkled with blood but the body of Christ had to be sprinkled with blood right right and so this is representing something right and it and then we can say okay and here's where it's going to get real personal because we say okay this is the body of Christ we're the body of Christ here no you're the body of Christ that's right you're the body of Christ see the body of Christ brother brandham said and the and and there's things in the message that brother brandham says and we and we kind of regulate it to this and everything but then something begins to come into view and brother brandom said that he doesn't deal he deals with Israel as a nation but he deals with the Gentile as individuals amen and so what I want us to get to tonight is that this message didn't come for the bride this message came for me right this message came for me and so so what we're going to see here tonight is something I think really interesting because if we're going to look all right the the Old Testament Tabernacle it represented the dwelling place of God Amen all right because that was this place behind this holy of holies nobody could even go there but the high priest he had to First offer an offering for himself and then he had to offer an offering for the people and so God God was so holy he couldn't he couldn't you know he he couldn't be approached and so and so I want us to think about where does God dwell now he got that God dwells in you all right you are the Tabernacle of the living God's Dwelling Place all right when brother brandham talks about stature of perfect man it was his title really sat perfect man the Tabernacle of the living God's Dwelling Place all right I can take we could take if we had a lot of time I could take you and I could prove to you in the scripture in Psalms 132 it says I have chosen Zion as my place of rest that is my habitation forever who's Zion it's the bride and so we occupy a very unique place in the economy of God and that's what makes this message so important okay and so now what we're looking at we're looking at at three articles that are inside of this Ark of the Covenant all right so what what does the Ark of the Covenant ultimately represent it represents you yes right your soul and so we're given Promises to the Overcomer we're given the ability to eat of that of that hidden Mana but I want you to just drop this in I want you to I want you to consider something because we've talked about it several times this this in the last day or two eternal life is living for others and so if we have a a privilege of eating of the Hidden Mana it's not so that we can thump our chest and say we are something it is something that is causing something to happen to us look the the the hidden Mana was brother brandom said that those High PRI the high priest was the only one when he went behind that Veil he could take a a spoonful of that so the the hidden Mana that you have is for others everything that you have is for others but what I want to what I want to look at tonight and and and what I think that is going to help because it certainly helps me and and and all I can do is just share what what my experience is and that's this Aaron Rod the aon's rod that but let's go back to the number the 17th chapter and and let's let's just read this story uh because it's very significant uh to the to to to what's happening in this hour all right because there's a murmuring we're calling this message tonight the Vindication of the priesthood there is a murmuring against this bride amen there's a murmuring against the bride all right and Watch What Happens because there was a murmuring against the priesthood in the book of in the Book of Numbers in in chapter 17 it says in the verse verse and it says and the Lord spake unto Moses saying Speak unto the children of Israel and take every one of them take of every one of them a rod according to the house of their fathers and all their princes according to the house of their fathers 12 rods write thou every man's name upon his rod and thou shalt write the Aaron's name upon the rod of of Levi for one rod shall be the head of the House of their fathers and thou shalt lay them up in the Tabernacle of the congregation before the testimony where I will meet you okay so and it shall come to pass that the man's Rod whom I shall choose shall Blossom and I will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of Israel whereby they murmur against you so I want you to think about this first of all where where where was this Rod placed was placed in the holy of holies right in the Holy place before the testimony of the Lord so there was something in the Holy place that caused that Rod to Bud and that was the life of God I remember I remember I have a young man in my church I say young man he's in his 30s and uh the first time that and I and I challenged my deacons I wanted them to share the word and the one of the first times that he preached he got up and he said you know he said Jesus cursed the Fig Tree you know and he says and I and I was always wondering about that because the Bible clearly says it wasn't the time for figs so why would Jesus curse the Fig Tree if it wasn't time for figs and the and the brother said because a dead almond rod bore life in the presence of the shakina glory that fig tree it didn't matter whether it had was supposed to be have having figs or not it should have borne life in the presence of God and I thought there's a guy that's got a gift amen but anyway he says he says so Moses spake unto the children of Israel every one of their priests priests gave them rods and each Prince one according to the house so forth it came to pass verse eight it that on the tomorrow Moses went into the Tabernacle witness behold the rod of Aaron of the House of of of Levi was budded and brought forth Buds and Blossom and Bloom blossoms and yielded almonds and Moses uh brought out all the rods from before the of the Lord unto all the children of Israel and they looked and every man and took every man as Rod now watch and the Lord said unto Moses bring Aaron's Rod again before the testimony to be be kept for a token against the rebels and thou shalt quite away or take away their murmurings from me that they die not so what did he do with this Rod that budded like if I was Aaron and and God had supernaturally Vindicated me I would put like a giant banner and I would put this I would want this Rod to be shown to everybody but God said hide it in the soul hide it in the soul amen and so that is our Vindication a personal Vindication there is something brother and sister that has happened in this day and and and I'm telling you I've been in the message a long time and I've and I sat under one of the one one of the most powerful teaching Ministries you you had brother Lonnie and I had brother Brown all right and and I mean we had charts we had we had everything he didn't know how to do PowerPoint but but he but we had everything and we're looking at all this stuff on the chart and and we're seeing the church ages you know and and and the timeline and a Rapture and we see all the seals and where they fit in all this stuff and we say yeah we got it we had understanding but I'm sitting here 50 years in the message and I'm thinking why am I looking for something to happen what why why is why is the enemy trying to tell me that there's some great thing coming and and and I'm sitting in a congregation my daughter's Church in in Canada and the brother's talking about perfection and all of a sudden the the things struck me not necessarily something he was saying but just the atmosphere and and and you know what since I've been Pastor for 17 years I have preached so many times on the taking of the book and then I realize the great thing that happened was this event right The Taking of the book that's right and and it's not just something that that here's where the difference is it's not just something something that the prophet brought that he brought that he shed light on the scripture this is something that's real that happened to each one of us it must happen to each one of us there must be something that happens to us that changes our perspective I sharing with brother Chad last night you know I got I'm kind of like a out of the boox kind of a thinker you know I'm not you know I'll tell you what there's a scripture Jesus says if your I be single your whole body is full of light and I studied that out and and not that it comes from study but you know what that word single means it means if you will approach the word without a preconceived idea your whole body will be full of light that's right amen because what happens is is is we get preconceived ideas and it limits us to what God wants to do for us because you know I heard I heard a brother say one time and it's so very true I might have read it in a book or something he says we hear the thing we hear things the way we are yeah so we got a certain idea you know I I've I've preached in churches and and and somebody will come up after I preached and they'll say oh man I've been thinking about all those things oh that what you were saying and I know that there's no way that they were thinking about what I was talking about but they heard the way they were yeah and they interpreted the things that I said by their own experience am well see Revelation is something greater than that right because I I I I'd have the quote on my my tablet in the back but I but I'll just tell you what the prophet said he said that in the message word made flesh in 1954 and he's talking about Revelation he in that message all right brother brandham is like for 45 minutes he's talking about his experience in India you know and how how was so poor and you know and the things that he went through there and so forth and then he gets 45 minutes into the message and he says oh well Le's let's just open the Bible and he preaches one of the most powerful messages on Revelation that I've heard and Revelation is Faith of course and so he says in there he says he says Revelation he says as far as the human mind can go is back to the beginning because the text that he used was was uh in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and he says as far as your human mind can go as far as theology can go is back to the beginning when there is a word because your human mind needs a word right and so I'll use the example I use the example all the time I said I'll say the word cat all right so what do you what what are you thinking about you know you have you when I say the word cat you're going to think oh he's talking about you know that little Aly cat or he's talking about my little tabby cat or whatever that I have at home or he's talking about this or that but you know what I'm talking about a Caterpillar tractor and maybe there's a few of you brothers that may have thought that but but the only way that you can interpret my word is to have my thought and so the prophet said as far as our human mind can go is back to the beginning but he said Revelation takes us back before the beginning before there was a word that's where Revelation comes from because the thought we have to have the thought to know what the word is and so so you know in the message we got 1100 1200 messages and we've done the same thing with those messages that we did with the Bible there last count I had a I had to do a I did a thing for our local College on compar they wanted to me to do a a speech about brother brandom and about the message and because they a comparative religion class so I did research and this has probably been 10 10 years ago at least H I don't remember how long it's been a long time there were 40,000 denominations at that time but you know what there's probably a thousand different message interpretation because we did the same thing with the prophet's message that we did with the Bible and we thought well now we have the the correct word but what we have in the prophet's message are words amen and if we don't have revelation we don't know what those words mean right and so and so this great thing that happened all right brother brandom says in the breach and I probably other than Christ The Mystery of God revealed I probably listen to the breach prach more than any of the other ones I know I've listened to the breach more than any other Seal's messages brother brandom says that the taking of the book was the most Sublime act in the scripture all right so wow you're talking about something that's greater than the cross okay when you think about when you think about what's at stake in this book and that's what we're going to illustrate here tonight because I want we have to have and we have it in our soul but we have to have an Aaron's Rod that buds that takes away not just the attack of the message cuz that that's fruitless anyway but we got some murmuring that goes on right here you know it's it's I can't I was in the Philippines in in in September and and it surprised me how many people were looking for Camala Harris to become the president of the United States as if that was going to be something that Vindicated the message after all these years right right and it and it disturbs me yeah it's 60 years after the prophets off the scene we're still looking for a Vindication of the message right I mean that disturbs me that explains why there's an attack on the message that's why that attack has substance is because people are not engaged in the word they've never experienced the message that's message yourself and what has happened and so so we see this scripture and it says that that this this Aaron's rod in the in the before the testimony is going to be a token against the rebels and it's going to take away the murmurings from me it's going to take away all the question about it I remember years ago when the when the attack and I don't want to really even deal with this because we got something a lot better to look at but I'm going to say I'm going to say one thing about it years ago when I had a brother in the church and he says hey man he says have you seen that believe the sign website and I said well I've seen it before you know I mean I knew that it was supposed to be something good he says well he says they're really they're they're attacking the message now and so I went and looked at it and there was a there was a article on there called Humble Pie and in there they were talking about brother brandom and how did he have a gift and did was he a good man they don't believe that anymore but he did they did at that time they study the message more than we do you know because they're looking for you know something that he said that was wrong or whatever but anyway he so so then I'm reading the article and then he says you know we believe he was a good man all this stuff but he says was he the prophet of Malachi 4 and they said no so I quit reading the article because the only way that he's the prophet of Malachi 4 is if you have your heart turned right and if your heart's not turned he's not the Fulfillment of Malachi 4 right but and so to my church the way I've dealt with the attack on the message is I don't care what they say because there's nothing that's going to change the fact that the message of William brandham opened this word to me I can't take that away but it's it's more than a doctrinal understanding okay so so what we're going to see here let's go to Revelations the 5ifth chapter one of my probably favorite chapters uh in the in the Bible and we're going to see when you look at and it's very very very interesting all right because in this in this Old Testament Tabernacle all right you have around the Tabernacle you have 12 tribes of Israel amen right you have and and then you know to the East and I I didn't refresh myself but to the east you have certain ones and to the South and the west and the North and so forth you have three tribes but the head tribe that's the closest to the Tabernacle are the same symbols of the four living creatures right so in the in the in the in Revelations the 4th chapter you see the Throne of God that's right and its Flame by living creatures the same as in the Old Testament so really what you're seeing in the fourth and fifth chapter is the same thing that we see in the Old Testament Tabernacle and you can go even further than that because even as as Christians with a human influence we're looking at new Heavens new Earth but that that's like way out here even though Hebrews 12 says we've already come to that City but we look at it being way out here but do you know that the new the that the new heavens and new earth that city is also flanked by the 12 tribes of Israel and it's flanked by the 12 apostles so you have the 24 Elders here that's in the fourth chapter and you have a new city that's got 24 Elders around the throne right you see so I want you to catch the connection that's right that God is speaking to us in Parables but it always is a representation of a truth that's underneath that that's right and so the truth I'm going to tell you I'll go right to the punchline the truth of what's underneath that is the theophany body of Christ because that is the logos that God was amen that's the logos that God is all right you know the prophet said and we and we look at it and we can prove it in the scripture I mean the the the Epistles of Paul are all full of it the prophet said God has no voice but your voice right he has no hands but your hands so when did that happen when did it when did it happen did did God not really need a bride but then all of a sudden at the end time now he has a bride so now he's going to use her as his voice or maybe there's something more powerful and important that's happened in this day because because of the Fall the voice of God fell in the fall whoa complete silence but you know what that's the truth because what is the sub the subject of redemption was the bride yeah right yeah right he he he bought the whole field so that he could get the treasure that was in the field because when you look if if we're the voice of God now which we are the Prophet The Prophet was the voice of God everybody says amen but he was the first fruits of what the bride is so we are the voice of God right and so but we have we have in our Tim minded thinking we have an idea that this is something established at the end but what makes this so important Jesus said I'm the vine you're the branches all right when did you become the branches of the tree of life you were always the branches of the Tree of Life when God come down and he walked with Adam you were part of God that walked with Adam you're not not you individually not not Chad Lamb not Stan price but the word that we are is the word that was there it was the word that walked with Adam it was the voice God used to fellowship with Adam and if God has lost that voice because of the Fall which I'm going to show you in a minute if God has lost that voice then nothing can come to its Redemption until the bride puts into steps into her place that's the truth that's the importance of this messag amen all right and we're going to we're going to prove it so we see Revelations the fourth chapter John's caught up there's something interesting here because in the fourth chapter it says after this I looked and behold a door was open in heaven the first voice which I heard was out of a of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and I will show thee things which must be Hereafter so the prophet said that Revelations 4 and verse1 was a Rapture right so so how do we even see anything in the seals without taking a Rapture amise God so maybe we're in a Rapture now but it's not a physical catching away but it's stepping into a spiritual condition because the Rapture I'm telling you all right you know there was hardly a day that went by that I didn't say I can't wait to get out of here all right cuz that was my perspective that's right man you know this message has come to rescue me and to take me away from this so that the devil can't harm harm me that's not what this message came to do at allise this message came to positionally place you with the authority to take control of the world Amen because the world belongs to God he P he redeemed it he it it all belongs to him amen and so anyway so we see in this fourth chapter that something has to happen to us for us to even step into the reality of what John is looking at here praise God all right so so that has to happen so we see the we see the true you know and even Paul deals with the living creatures he said the he said cherubim's over The Mercy Seat of which we can't now speak particularly because it wasn't Paul's portion to lay out the first four SE seals for a church age because that's what the first that's what the living creatures were they were guards of the throne that's right so where's the throne amen you right so we see the reality here coming into view because of this message amen right but it's got to be something personal it's got to be something real you know I stood in I was in Pakistan a month or two ago and I said I got a revelation I know how many people's going in the Rapture yeah I do there's only one Christ Christ is the only one going in the Rapture prise the Lord amen you know I told my church at home I said how many people have to be in the Rapture for you to feel comfortable that you're one of them you know it have to be a million people oh yeah you know there's I'm as good at least at the top million what if there there's only five you know you know brother Chad there's a there's a quote nobody ever says one from Indiana one from Georgia one from amen you know in the message straight As the gate two times brother pram says I doubt a dozen people from this this generation meets goes into Rapture and so is there a dozen going I don't believe that's what he was saying but what if there's a dozen going are you one of them we have to have have something more than just a personal knowledge we have to have something that testifies inside of us amen so that's what this message came to do let's get to the let's get to the to the first verse of chapter 5 and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with Seven Seals now I I stole a check I borrowed didn't steal it Seven Seals book out of the office back there so this is going to be the Throne of God and this seven sealed book all right what is this book this book is you amen right oh well this is the revelation of Jesus Christ it's what I just got through saying because this book is you because I can tell you we call it a book of redemption because in the ninth verse it says and they sung a new song saying now are worthy to take the book and open the seals thereof now wait a minute now when when Jesus when the lamb takes the book why didn't Jesus say wow praise God now they're all going to know who I am but it was the bride and we'll get to this in a minute but they saying in verse 10 says and Hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kingom and and has made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign on the earth so something happens when the lamb takes this book all right so I want you to see this seven sealed book is in the hand of him that sits on the throne so where are you before the lamb even came to redeem you right where were you okay so here's here's something we're talking about last night because I I I I didn't understand why brother brandham said that Adam had this book cuz that's what he said yeah he said Adam had this book but when Adam fell this book went back to the throne amen but see Adam had a commission all right how did Jesus come on the earth he was born of a virgin amen why didn't Jesus just appear on the scene yeah because he had to undo the Fall by coming the way we were always supposed to come and that's by Spoken Word through the womb of Adam's race amen God was going to multiply himself and make himself have a connection with mankind Amen in a way that would make him the priest but when Adam sinned the Virgin womb became corrupt right amen because now there was no spoken word there was not there was now there was the the result of sex and lust and so that's but Jesus came and undid it all but when man fell that book went back to its original owner amen praise God and Adam who had originally been commissioned to bring forth a bride on the Earth right right could not do it that's right so Jesus Jesus had to come and and and take care of this Redemption now watch what he says and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in Heaven Nor in Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon wow and he said and I wept much because no man was found wor worthy to open the book and read the book to open and read the book and either to look there on so the prophet said in the message the breach why did John cry right because if the if nobody could open that book see the book is there yeah amen but it's not opened right we're not talking here about doctrines under the seals we're talking about a people amen we're talking about the manifestation of a people that is the Tree of Life to all creation and if that book is not made manifest right then where's Adam going to go yeah Adam Adam's redeemed but where's he going to go that's right why is why does Romans 8 say that all creation is groaning and travailing waiting for you to come to your position because if you don't come to your position they are lost yeah that's right amen there must be an intercessor amen there must be a way for the grace of God to flow amise God you say well Jesus took care of that on the cross absolutely he did so why are we looking at an event that if that book isn't open everything's lost that's right because this is the result yeah of what happened on the cross this is what was required to happen that Jesus died for so that that book could be open am and so here we see watch this so he said and one of the elders said unto me weep not I can hear brother brandom saying and his crying didn't last long and he said weep not Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David has prevailed to open the book and loose the Seven Seals thereof so John who knows the Bible and the lion of the tribe of Judah is God yeah amen so he turns expecting to see God and he sees a lamb amen right he sees an office of God Amen I want to I want to be very careful I want you to understand that I'm not doing away with the person of Jesus because all that God was was poured into Jesus am but then all that Christ was is poured into the church amen I'm not doing away with Jesus but I want us to understand something that I'm I'm going to get really bold here if there had not been a fall Jesus would not have come because Jesus came for Redemption and if there's nothing to be redeemed there would not have been an office work of redemption right right so what John has done was doing was he was looking and he was expecting to see God who was all in all he was expecting to see the fullness of God claiming that book but it wasn't it was an office work because Redemption had to happen amen look and this has helped me so much I was talking with brother Chad last night I hope I got the Liberty to to say it but but I did not all right I didn't understand there was something the prophet said that it's amazing to think that there's something the prophet said we didn't understand but he said he said you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every hour of your life and be lost yes true and I thought whoa and he says and the Bible says that yeah I thought wow I never heard that I never read that scripture and so I'm I'm I'm like asking the Lord I said what does this mean well brother brandom explains it in false anointed ones okay but I want you to think about something when God would walk with Adam I don't want my time to get away when God would walk with Adam what was he was he a God that was above us no was he a God that was with us not the way Christ was because he did not walk with Adam in Redemption because Adam didn't need to be redeemed was he was he the God in us no so he was walking with Adam and I'm going to use a term that we're going to talk about later but he was God who was all all in all because the Garden of Eden was God's full desire in seed form that's right amen it was the beginning it was the thing that God looked at and said this is very good right and so that was God in a fullness in the form of a word in the form of logos walking with man but when man sinned then he became God above us yeah right so if there was no sin there would not be an office work of God above us yeah right amen if there had and then so then the objective of the Plan of Redemption came that God needed to redeem man which was accomplished at Calvary right when Jesus bowed his head and he said it is finished it was finished there's not one single thing that needs to happen Christ has paid completely and totally the price for our Redemption now Redemption is not forgiveness of sins although that's a quality of it Redemption is restoration amen so he has made a way for us to go back to our original condition right but we don't Rec I got a quote let me read you mind if I read a quote brother and this is one of my favorite quotes I got I got and I taped these things in my Bible because I love them it it'll take me a second to find it all right brother brandham said and it's the message Oneness and brother brandham said now the first human beings disfellowship themselves from believing God by disbelieving his word and listening to the LIE of the devil so they disfellowshipped themselves all right think about this because they had a place Adam and Eve had a place of fellowship with God but it wasn't in their Humanity it was in the theophany that dwelt in them right because their theophany was created in the image of God so that was the only part you know outside and the prophet says it Adam's flesh was animal So Adam Adam's fellowship with God was not based on his flesh it was based on the this harmonious part that God had put in that flesh which was the theophany that was made in His image right and so here is Adam and Eve in harmony with with God yet they're in flesh all right so watch so so now that's the first thing that dis Fellowship this wonderful Union but now look Adam and Eve in a position to never die because that's that was the position they were in a position to never die in a position to never be old right in a position to never be sick to never have a worry and you say I sure wish I could be like that well let me I got news for you you are in the same position Redemption has done a work that we don't even recognize and so what so what has happened here okay Christ has redeemed us but we have not been made manifest we don't because I came onto this Earth and I have a gene of God in Me God amen that Gene of God listen to this is already there sitting there but I don't know who I am right right right I come into this world ignorant right not knowing who I am but Watch What Happens okay so he says I I beheld and I looked in low verse six in the midst of the Throne of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven Harps seven eyes which are the seven spirits of Gods sent forth into all the Earth we could stop on this but we're not going to and he came and he took the book out of the hand to him that sat on the throne so this book The Lamb where did the lamb come from he came out of the throne amen but he was not a separate person from the one that was sitting this is a parable it's a parable It's a drama that God is playing out because I want you to see that this is where you live the The Throne of God is in you and so what God is showing you is what Redemption did for you individually God and so the lamb what did he do he claimed you but you know what the prophet said I'm and I'm fixing to show you what the prophet said he sat back down on the throne so what happened redemption's work had been accomplished because he opened he was the only one that could open this book that's right and so now he is in the throne yeah revealing who you [Applause] are and and so and so watch so watch and when verse eight and when he had taken the book the four beasts and the 4 and 20 Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them Harps golden vials full of odors which are the prayers of the Saints and they sung a new song okay who is singing It's not the it's not the 24 Elders it's not the four beasts but it's the prayers of the Saints and the and I tell you what when brother Brandon preached the questions and answers on the seals and I love this because we we watch you know we're message Believers all right and if you're going to sit here and you're going to say that every word that came out of brother Brandon's mouth was thus sayeth the Lord then you're not listening to the same message I heard because brother brandom said 700 when he meant 7,000 he said Mary when he met Eve or he said 2 Thessalonians when he means first Thessalonians you know and some people are like oh did he did they change the Bible you know because the prophet said that the Rapture was in second Thessalonians the 4th chapter but it's in the first you know so so why was it so important because when brother Brandon preached question and answer on the seals he was asking a question they asked him a question somebody said is this group of people that sing this song I don't remember the exact word of but is this group of people is this the Rapture of saints and brother brand says no it's not and he just goes on to the next question and starts reading the next question and all of a sudden brother random saying is there something wrong here is there is there somebody sick and somebody from the audience calls out says read the scripture read the scripture again am and so brother Brandon now why didn't the Holy Spirit stop the meeting when he said 700 not 7,000 amen because I believe the Lord was drawing our attention to who it is that's in this verse so what is this song Oh this is so good this is another whole message brother Chad but third poll is a prayer praise right and so positional placing of the Bride changes our prayer all right I'm hey I'm with you I've been I've been a Christian a long time been in the message and I'm praying uh sister Jones needs a healing God will you somewhere out there he's somewhere out there will will you go and heal sister Jones I'm done with that so sister Jones doesn't get healed you say well must not have been God's will but the taking of the book puts the authority into the bride and we say they sung a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and Hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred people Nation uh people and Nation so that proves it's not the 24 Elders because 24 Elders are all Jewish that's right right so it's a people and and Hast Hast it doesn't say and is going to but when the land takes the book and reveals the contents we recognize what we are and you know what even in even in our own church different places that you go and you preach this and people are like Hallelujah brother Stan that is great and then Monday morning it's back to the old same old right but I believe that Revelation has an action yes and if you have a revelation that you are seated in the Throne of God that takes away the murmurings that takes away the rebel yeah right and you become the voice of God to declare his word amen and when sister Jones now look you know it's like the human part of us which is very much still a tempter all right although it's dead but the enemy still uses this and it's like well that guy you know let me out in traffic you got eternal life you know I mean it's not that at all right it's it's now you have the mind of Christ that's right all right let me ask you a question if you're if you are walking through the pool of Bethesda and you have like healing just pouring off of you you're going to walk past everybody say oh you're healed oh you're healed God can't trust us yep because Jesus walked past you know I heard a brother preach one time about multitudes there could have been thousands of people at the pool of Bethesda and Jesus walked past every single one of them to one man who was not even going to die because I can only do what the father shows me oh God if we had time to look at that see because the prophet said that Jesus had a vision for everything he did all right and it's really easy to understand that in the light of brother brandom because brother brandom had a vision but I I I'm sure that there are people that are here that have had Visions but I have never had a vision Vision never that I'm aware of so how do I do the will of God by faith because faith is my vision right faith is something that dwelt before sin happened amen amen and faith is the testimony of the reality that lays below this sinful World eternity is still going on right now right the reason that you can be healed tonight is not oh if I could only believe hard enough if you could get a faith Vision that you have a new body that you're drawing that healing from it's over amen right that's what faith is Faith is a is a a a vision into the Eternal it's faith is so is so real okay so let's so let's so let's look at first Corin let's look at 1 Corinthians the 15th chapter and let's watch this because I love this scripture because because what we see what we see in these office work okay what we call it brother Brenham one place I know said Office Works the other places he says office these are offices of God okay so I'm a I'm a I'm a I'm a husband uh I'm a father I'm a grandfather uh last May I became a great-grandfather right and and there's nothing I mean it's great but I'm married to a great grandmother and that's that makes me feel really old but all of those Office Works are positions that I become in different settings but it's not who I am right because the reality is the life that I am and not the office did I did I become so here in this Redemption and we're going to see this in in 1 Corinthians 15 watch this because the the the trinitarians have a field day with the scripture and probably there's people in the message that believe there's a father and a son and all that and that's fine they can believe what they want but it says in verse 20 20 uh we'll begin read verse 22 for as in Adam all die even so in Christ shall all be made alive but every man after after his own order Christ the first fruits afterward they there are Christ that is coming then cometh the end when he shall have delivered up the kingdom even the father Kingdom to God even the father when he shall have put down all Rule and all authority and power what is the kingdom you amen okay and so when he put down oh this is gets really good when he puts down all Rule and all authority then he sits down yeah on the throne that's right right and he opens the book okay so now watch watch cuz this I I I get I can I can run in place okay so so so watch what he says okay so he puts down all rule all authority and power for he must Reign the intercessory work of Christ must Reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet okay watch and The Last Enemy that shall be destroyed is death what is preventing all right we're not we're not talking about an event that happened in 1963 we're not talking about brother bandam standing at the pulpit and revealing what was in the seals we're talking about something personal that happens to you yes what is preventing you from recognizing your position and thus putting all things under the feet of God Amen that's right what is Romans 8 said this is the carnal mind is death yeah right so what is preventing God from sitting on the throne in his position with a voice your human thinking that's right so the Last Enemy oh this is this watch this so The Last Enemy that shall be destroyed is death for he hath put all things under his feet but when he has when he saith all things are under him it is Manifest that he is accepted which did put all things under him and when all things shall be subdued unto him meaning death has been conquered watch then then shall the son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him that God may be all in all so what are we saying am I doing away with Jesus no but am I doing a when I say that Jesus when he sat down on the throne was absorbed back into the office work of Jesus as Redeemer went away right why because it's not necessary anymore right and God has become the god who is all in all yeah because his voice has been restored amen and now Adam can come back to the Tree of Life this the fellow the theophany of God we call ourselves the body of Christ what does that mean does that mean a body of water what's it mean the body of Christ is a theophany logos body and what I see and and I'm telling you and and I know this I know this message goes out I don't know where but I'm telling you that all right the prophet said God is not complete without you amen amen and so this is so important to the economy of God for the bride to take her position and now let's let's bring this let's bring this to to a a a conclusion here in 2 Corinthians the 3r chapter okay because what we're looking at here is we're looking at we're looking at an event that's a drama okay and we see a lot of things that are all wrapped up in this dramatic event because really what happens is the reality is when Christ died on the cross he he finished this whole work right right but we see in the end time we see something that has to happen the reality has to be made known because now there's a living bride that's all been represented all been manifested for seven Church ages and so now it's come time to to take the position but really the work was accomplished that's right already and the proof of it is that we go back to this Old Testament type right and you have the outer CT and the inner court and the holy of holies and there was a veil that was hiding the shakina glory so where was that shakina Glory it's in you there's a gene attribute of God that's there that you didn't even know right I mean I'm a 15-year-old snotty-nosed kid smoking cigarettes and doing LSD getting into all sorts of trouble getting arrested every other week right but I had a gene of God in Me you want there's a story there's a brother in cander named John L Trudeau some of you might know him he's a good friend of mine he tells the a story about how that when he became a Christian he he'd come out of the world he was a drug Pusher and all this stuff I don't remember I mean but he was bad guy so he stole money from people he stole stuff and so when he became Christian he went about to try to make things right which is what a Christian should do right there's things that you can never make right but you know if you have the ability and God puts it on your heart you need to go do it right and so brother John L when he was in the world had stolen some tools from a man okay and some expensive tools so the Lord you know one day brother John wakes up and and he and he's like the Lord says you need to go return those tools and so brother John L says well I okay I will Lord you put it on my heart I'll take care of he says you need to do it today and he's like you know well I had things to do but you know when God tells you to do something you need to do it so so he goes to the man's house the man was a very angry man and he knocks on the door and he hears the man inside come in and he was like what do you want and he said well he says you I have to tell you I've gave my heart to the Lord and he says I've been trying to fix things that I did wrong when I was in the world and and he says I have to tell you that I stole those tools from you I knew You' stole those tools you know he was really brother John leek said I was a little nervous about how he was responding to me but he said the man said and and when he walked into the house the man's sitting in a big chair and he's got a gun you know and so like like John's wondering about what he walked into anyway the man says I was sitting here in the chair and today is the worst day of my life because my wife and children just walked out of that door and they're not coming back and I was sitting here about to blow my brains out but you came and because of what your testimony was I'm not going to do that so God put it on John L's heart to return those tools on that day yeah but you know what the story's better than that because when John L was a drug Pusher and a thief he stole those tools so that he could go and return them and save that man's life so God has been in control of everything that we've ever done no matter how bad it seems everything that we've gone through is part of the character that we are and so in this scripture that we're looking at here Paul is talking about uh when Moses would go up on the mountain you know and he would he would get the word of the Lord and he would come back down off the mountain and his face would glow and the children of Israel were really worried about that you know because well I mean they'd heard the trumpet sound and they didn't want to die and they didn't want to see the they just tell us you know and so when Moses and the prophets said that that after and Moses was God to them right until he delivered the word and then his face wouldn't glow he'd be a man whatever and so we'll pick up the story because this really brings this aspect of it into our day because we're the same as Israel when we're in the world we're the same as Israel there's no difference and so watch what he says he says and we we'll pick up the the the context he says in verse 13 not as Moses which put a veil over his face that the children of Israel could not steadfastly look to the end which was abolish abolished but their minds were blinded for until this day remaineth the same Veil untaken away in the reading of the Old Testament which Veil is done away in Christ so the veil has been done away in Christ right but even unto this day when Moses is read the veil is upon their heart so what thinking about unveiling a god what does the veil hide it's hiding the presence of God right but see we we in our human mind we can't even wrap our minds around what we're talking about here tonight what this message is about yeah I I brother and sister I lay in bed some mornings and I'm thinking you're just really cuckoo in the Gaga you know to believe the things that you believe but it doesn't have anything to do with me it has to do with what the word says and that's where the vindication matters that's something that testifies about my position that that I can't understand I can't wrap my mind around that God has no voice but my voice but our voice he has no hands you know I remember there was a brother in Haiti that was telling me get tell give me a testimony he says you know there was a brother that he said I was building a house and uh he said for me and my wife and he says I was shorts of money so I've been praying all right you know we pray for things and then when we don't get it we just don't think that we we try to because we know what we prayed for is our desire and so we go to try to make it happen when we don't just trust God that's right you know you put something before the Lord say if if your will we I want your will but really when you prayed you had a will that you wanted to to to see happen and I see it all the time you know brother Chad deals with it too you know you get people from overseas and and they you know they need a they need iron sheets for their church I hear a lot about that do you hear about that brother iron sheets for your church well have you prayed well yeah then why are you asking me because you're trying to make something happen when you need to just put it before for the Lord because I don't know about anybody else I know about me that sometimes the Lord just put somebody on my heart send them some money so maybe they were praying you know what brother brandom said beautiful quote he's in the prayer line and he's calling out a brother he says brother he says you have a certain certain disease he says I heard your prayer in prayer land he heard the prayer what what was that it was the god yeah that was part of him you know if if if if we had confidence in who the new song of the Bride is to send the word right amen okay so watch this so watch this so he says but even verse 15 again we'll pick up the context but even unto this day when Moses is read the veil is upon their heart nevertheless when it the heart shall turn to the Lord the veil shall be taken away so what has happened in this message see you're already here not in 1963 right forever you've always been here that's right but there's a veil that's right amen now that Veil is on your soul right but when your heart is turned to the Lord then the veil is taken away and you can see clearly who you are see see it's it's it's about what I see what I see you know we talk the brother brother Brandon says now you know before it was a sin to go in behind the veil before you because you'd be destroyed now now it's it you can't not go behind the veil right so the veil is taken away and so we think okay now I can see what's in behind the veil but what's in behind the veil is inside of you am right but the the secret of this message is now what's in here can come out amen that's the bride position sir the branches of the Tree of Life the ministering life to Adam I was talking to brother Chad last night and I was so brother I wanted to do backflips because when you talked about Adam having Perpetual life I have believed that for all along I've never heard anybody say that because Adam's life depended on his fellowship with God and that's what you see a new jerus Jem a New Jerusalem it can we can have a literal City okay that's great but I tell you I tell you I just be let me just be frank and you be Earnest all right I built a house 5 years ago and and I mean like we had this floor plan and this is like and my wife is picking out things and we're doing all this stuff and we've been there 5 years and now we're ready to renovate it so if you can think of the most wonderful uh magnificent kind of a building that you would want million years can we change out some of these [Music] pictures because it's not about a physical City that's right it's about a people when that City dropped on the earth the Bible says the Tabernacle of God is with men so what do we see in in Revelations 21 and 22 we see the Fulfillment of the Garden of Eden restored 13 times in Christ The Mystery of God revealed brother brandham said we're going back to Eden yeah I thought I thought we were going to New Jerusalem we are because New Jerusalem is the presence of God walking among his creation and the kings of the Earth come and they get fellowship with God Amen and it continues their life that's right because that brothers and sisters is God's only desire is to share himself with humanity and even in the message we make ourself the benefit officiary of that Fellowship when we are the expressor of that Fellowship this is a very very important position it is very very important to all creation what has happened yeah and I sharing with brother brother Chad last night you know it's it's interesting and we'll close on this lot Lord willing CU my wife will tell you that I oh no can I share One More Story but but you watch the the life of brother brandom you watch the progression of the word you know when you and he goes to the 50s you know and in 56 57 he's dealing really with the new birth you know he's dealing a lot with the new spirit you know and and and so forth and the new birth why are we so tossed about you know all these things and then he comes you know I mean a progression and he comes in 1962 then he begins putting up word but it's in but it's a process to make way for the opening of the book right so then 63 you know he's commissioned to come back and and and and he and he opens the seals had a brother ask me the other day he said did the who opened the seals I said the lamb did oh well but brother but brother Brenham did I said no brother brandham didn't open the seals the lamb opened the seals you know the the the the lamb was using Brother brandom's voice but it wasn't brother Bram brother brandom had nothing to do with it right but anyway so you watch the progression of the word but then in 1965 brother brandom starts dealing with the seed Gene of God and then he gets to to me the climax of the 1965 C Gene of God is invisible Union which I didn't understand for many years but in invisible union he says it's as though you never did it in the first place because the SE the seed Gene of God never sinned do you know that you could never even be lost you know the prophet said in 1964 and future home he said there wasn't a certain day that you were born that you were saved you were always saved that's right right you're always a part of him but here you watch the progression of the prophet and you watching what happens a month before brother brandham goes off the scene he preaches false anointed ones now why didn't he preach false anointed ones in 1956 right you know when he's dealing with the new birth and he's dealing with the with the spir oh by the way the the holy spirit's an office work too and the reason that you can be baptized with the office work of God all every hour of your life is because when he the spirit of Truth has come he will guide you into all truth if you had not been lost you would never receive the holy spirit because the holy Spirit was sent Jesus said he will not speak of himself yeah he will speak the things that I tell you he is to bring that attribute to sunship so what happens to the false anointed ones well they receive the Holy Spirit right but there's no seed of Gene there's no Gene of God to lead to sunship so they just manifest works right and brother brandham dropped that right in a month before he goes off the scene because it's in the message it's not the Benny hens yeah that's not even that's not even a factor to the bride all right I asked the church I said I said if the if if if denominations is so close it would deceive the very elect how many of you thought about stopping at the Baptist Church on the way here because it's so close it's not close at all amen but what's close is the message amen right and so brother gives us a warning amen that's right yeah amen and you know what it's the greatest battle that's ever fought all right it's not with the devil it's not with denominations it's with this it's The Last Enemy that's destroyed is death yeah and when your Humanity I I can I can have I can give a a recommendation I mean brother Chad your pastor but I would say fall in love with the message perfect strength and perfect weakness amen because that to me has been the key to this message it's not about the knowledge that we obtain it's not about all of our teaching I'll tell you what my favorite scripture in the whole Bible 1 Timothy 1 and verse5 the end of the Commandment is Charity out of appe your heart the end of all the teaching the end of all the things all of the doctrine the end of all that if it does not pro produce the Life of Christ the love of God himself in you it doesn't matter what you believe amen false anointed ones right you see and so here he is brother Brandon preaches this message right at the end when brother ran and preached The Sixth Seal he had Jesus on Mount olives all right in Matthew 24 and he goes to Matthew 24 and he begins opening the seals right and he's got he says okay this scripture is the first seal second third fourth fifth and then he skips some scriptures and then he reads you know now after the tribulation of those days and so forth he said that's the Sixth Seal do you know that those scriptures that he that he skipped were the scriptures that he used when he preached false anointed ones and in the middle of those scriptures there's a scripture where Jesus says and in that day there shall be Great Tribulation such as never has been before never will be since because it's not the Great Tribulation of three and A2 years of turmoil it's the Great Tribulation between here and here and what makes this the greatest tribulation that has ever been is what is stake yeah because if we don't come to our position everything is lost that's right amen everything that's is L the the Redemptive work of Jesus would have been for nothing amen that's a pretty important place so this message that was came to restore that came to restore the word and we say okay it came to restore the Bible and and I get that because brother bram's message was a flashlight on this word all right you cannot use brother brandom's message outside of the Bible and there are plenty of people that do you know I I've I've I've heard of people that say this is a seven seal book this is the opening of the book so which one should I read you better read this one right because this one EXP explains this one but this is where the life is amen amen and so so I I have lost my thought and uh which I do a lot and uh so I think that we'll just we're we're at the we're past the end so I think we'll just let's all just stand and U and we'll bow our hearts of brother Chad if you want to come up our wonderful heavenly father we thank you so much for the uh the freedom the Liberty Lord to share what's on our heart tonight we pray uh that it will be U uh effectual uh Lord to the hearers of that word I know it's it's always uh a Revival in my heart whenever I I have the opportunity to share and so Lord I Thank you for this I thank you for this Con congregation I thank you for uh what brother Chad has uh just in our short time of knowing each other father it's we have uh an eternal connection and I thank you so for that I pray your blessing on uh on on each one that was there in attendance those uh that are that are on the uh uh the hookup uh father I pray that you'll have your way in our life as we surrender Our Lives to you in the name of the Lord Jesus amen amen amen God bless you brother Chad I love you too thank you oh have the preeminence that you desire in my life in my life have the preeminence that you desire in my life in my life and work with our hands speak with our lips see with our eyes and walk with our feet have the prein that you desire in our Liv in our [Music] lives amen how many want to die more I wish I could die I wish I could on my own just shut off all my thinking it's going to take a revelation from God and I I sit and listen to these things I know there's a depth to what the the brother's telling that's a reality but it's not it's not something I can conjure here or I can even put together like 2+ 2al 4 it's not that kind of a thing there's a reality deep inside that God's trying to draw out of us say oh God I want to live that reality am amen oh I I wish that I could reprogram myself I realize where the problem is the problem is in the veil the problem is in the thinking amen but God has done something tremendous in the this hour friends he's unlocked he's opened the door he's unlocked the potential the possibility to by faith for us to enter into what he always wanted amen and I'm just saying God take me there I can't take myself there take me there by Revelation let me go beyond thinking let me go beyond time let me go back and connect to what was always there and when the brother showed us where where that seven sealed book was laying and brother Brenham said what is the believer the words in the book amen so the believer is the words in the book are you a Believer then where were you in the book what is the book the book represents the Believers the the body of Christ the the the the the Flesh of God amen amen right so we were there all along amen we were always in the hand of God we were always there we were always secure waiting for a time that God would unveil it to us amen say God unveil it to me more I need more of the unveiling I need more of the open I need the seals of my life to open more amen than they have so that we can do what he's called us to do in this hour amen which is come and manifest himself amen God all I can say is God help me perfect strength and perfect weakness I'm going to go listen to that message again amen let's just bow our heads and thank God for this word dear heavenly father we thank you God we realize as we listen to your word being preached Lord there's so much more of the reality of the Revelation than what our minds can even pieace together God there's an We've Come to an hour where you want to have a certain expression Lord and you've called us to be part of that expression and Lord we don't know exactly how we can do that there's no way in ourselves that we can do what you want to do but Lord we're asking God that if you would help us to die to die to our thinking to die to our desires to die out to everything and give you preeminence so that you can come and do the work that you've ordained for this hour we believe what your Prophet said Lord about us about the position that we hold we believe it Lord but we need to believe it more Lord I pray that you'd come Lord as you have tonight with with your word and rub the eyes have and our eyes of understanding our spiritual eyes we might see more clearly Lord the hour we live in in our place in that plan Lord we ask a special blessing over our brother Stan and over his wife Lord as they leave tomorrow to head home would you keep him safe on the road and restore him back to his church and the fellowship there may you bless him abundantly for what he's poured out here and God as we go over these things in our hearts again would you please Lord break them to us open them to us that they become more of a reality day by day and God that they'll become less of me and More Of You Lord and that that you will have the preeminence and you will display yourself as you intended to in this hour oh I thank you for this word I pray that you make it alive inside of me bless us as we part and go our ways and may the things that we've heard and the things that you've opened to us may they not fade away but may they be rooted deeply into our souls and may they bring about a manifestation for I believe that's the reason you spoke them to us we love you God we ask for your blessing over it all in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you all just remember this week uh the rest of the week remember
