aant God bless you it's good to have you here he's back visiting family and sister hope God bless you Sister hope she's here visiting our family this week she's with um uh she worships there with Brother Rich cob and or and many of you know she was part of the group out in Fresno for many years and I think brother Kyle's ministered out there and I think brother Emanuel went there once did you go there yeah so we've been connected in for a while so it's good to have hope here with us and anybody else is visiting you're very welcome and we want to say God bless you and while we're standing let's take our Bibles together let's turn to Colossians Colossians chapter 2 Colossians chapter 2 and we'll read just one verse together verse 13 Colossians 2:13 and you being dead in your sins and uncircumcision of your flesh hath he quickened together with them having forgiven you all trespasses amen God bless you as you're seated so when we were dead in our sins and uncircumcised in our flesh he quickened us together and has forgiven us all trespasses I don't know about you but I'm pretty happy for all the word all there all trespasses amen if you could turn with me to Luke let's turn to Luke chapter 23 Luke chapter 23 and verse we'll begin at verse 33 Luke 23 and 33 and this is the scene of the crucifixion of our Lord and it says in verse 33 and when they were come to the place which is called Calvary There They Crucified him and the malifa is one on the right hand and the other on the left then said Jesus father forgive them for they know not what they do and they parted his reignment and cast lots the people stood beholding him and the rulers also with them derided him saying he saved others let him save himself if he be Christ The Chosen of God and the soldiers also mocked him coming to him and offering him vinegar and saying if thou be the king of the Jews save thyself and the superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek and Latin and Hebrew this is the king of the Jews amen so here we see at the crucifixion we find uh we find Jesus in a terrible situation but for us it ends up being a wonderful situation because his crucifixion is our freedom amen his death brought us life and here we find uh Jesus he comes verse 33 tells us that there they crucified him and we read on to where they're mocking him and deriding him and and and here he is the word made flesh and they they have now taken his word and they've condemned him by his own word that he gave to them and they they've rejected him he's come in the fullness of the word as he promised and now they're rejecting him deriding him and mocking him and here in this scene if we could just get the scene it's brother B said it's the most pitiful scene here ever because here is the Lord Of Glory the creator of all things amen the word himself and here they are crucifying their lord the one who came to save them the one who came to deliver them the one who came to fulfill his promises everything they hoped for everything they dreamed of everything they needed was right there and they were crucifying it and and with mocking and scorings and beatings and rejection and and false accusations and everything that you could pile on was piled on and here he is lifted up on on on the shame of a cross stripped naked hung as a malifa as a criminal in a public place for all to walk by and here he is in this scene in the worst of worst situations for a human being to get in and what does he say father forgive them for they know not what they do when we see the scene if we if we could ever actually Glimpse the scene I think it would change us we could ever realize what he said and not separate it from the context of when he said it because we can say he said father forgive them that that that's a wonderful statement father forg they don't know what they do but when you place it in the context of what he was going through and what was happening and and the pain and the suffering and the rejection and the blood and the tears and and the mockings and the score and and you just put it in context it's a remarkable statement that a man could say such a thing in such a condition and such an atmosphere amen and so tonight this morning not tonight this morning I just want to talk on freedom through forgiveness and mean there's some things that are so absolutely fundamental to our Christian walk and one of them is forgiveness and it becomes so fundamental we sometimes don't realize the impact that it has in our lives and we don't realize how fundamental it is because brother B said you can never live leave the ABCs and do Algebra so we can never leave the fundamentals amen no matter how deep we go what really happens is the deeper we go the deeper the fundamentals go they don't stay shallow they get deeper and Calvary gets deeper with the Revelation with the opening of the seals Calvary got deeper now we know why a man had to come and shed his blood because we know what happened in the Garden of Eden right that's right the corruption of the blood of man now it had to be a perfect one sinless virgin born who came as a substitutionary offering to shed his blood to buy back all that Adam lost amen none of the fundamentals get any shallower with the opening of the word they all get deeper amen so here we look at Freedom through forgiveness and here we know that we have freedom because of forgiveness because Jesus forgave us let's go to Matthew chapter 6 and this service will be maybe a little different than usual there's this subject that uh these things that I'm going to share with you are things that I've shared with numerous people just in my office during counseling just as we sit together usually when I share these things it's usually sitting uh across the coffee table or a dinner table with a piece of paper and I'm drawing and I'm talking amen I never really thought of preaching on this subject before because it's something I deal with in counseling but I I I went through it with somebody recently and afterwards I just realized you know what this is something that this is fundamental to our life and something we need to understand and so I'd like to share it with you so everybody just pretend we're sitting at a coffee table you're in one chair you're on the couch I'm in a chair and we're just going to draw amen and and I'm going to use the Whiteboard today so you'll see some of my beautiful drawings stick figures and lines and arrows and amen praise God so if you'll just bear with me and let me share amen what's on my heart maybe in a in a in a way that's a little bit different in Matthew 6:9 let's turn there together uh Jesus is going to show the disciples how to pray and he says after this manner therefore pray you Our Father which art in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors that's interesting he said forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors the word as we is really interesting you can read this several different ways this is the way the scriptures always work you say father forgive us and then we'll forgive our debtors but that's not exactly how it's written it's father forgive us as we forgive our debtors so the question is what if we're not forgiving our debtors yeah and this word debtors uh it it's translated debtor or sinner or which is owed several times in the New Testament and one of the definition is one who has not yet made amends to whom he has injured one who has not yet made amends to whom he is injured that means we're supposed we're asking God forgive my debts as I forgive my debtors amen so I'm going to forgive those who have not yet made amends for the injury amen so I'm not going to forgive them after they've cleaned everything up and and made it all better and and gave retribute but I'm going to forgive them while they're still a debor amen this is simple I mean how many times have we went over the Lord's Prayer it's so simple it's so fundamental but it actually becomes really really deep when it comes to a life application and we're going to find out how serious forgiveness is and and so he says uh I'll read verse 12 again and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors and lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from the E From Evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen amen then then he says for if you forgive men their trespasses your heavenly father will also forgive you but if you forgive not men their trespasses neither will your father forgive your trespasses es I don't know about you but those last two verses took the seriousness of forgiveness up to the maximum level right cuz what happens if the father doesn't forgive me my trespasses how serious is that so now we're dealing with the most serious of subjects amen which is me forgiving others I want to read this again verse 14 for if you forgive men their trespasses your heav L father will also forgive you but if you forgive not men their trespasses neither will your father forgive you your trespasses I don't think we can skip over this principle how many of you need your trespasses forgiven how many of you need them forgiven every day on a daily basis and you don't ever want to be in a position where your father will not forgive your trespasses so what must I do I must forgive men their trespasses amen this word trespasses uh one of the definitions in the concordance is aapse or deviation from truth and uprightness a sin a misdeed so something somebody's done to you amen that made them a debtor to you because they maybe owe you an apology maybe they they did something wrong to you they defamed your character they did something they stole from you whatever they did amen it was a trespass against you amen and and now we're told to forgive them them when when they're debtors we always think about forgiving people once they make it right when they come and when they come and say they're sorry I'll forgive them but that's not what this scripture say telling us we're not to forgive them when they say they're sorry when they pay their debts we're forgive them as debtors because I want my father to forgive me my trespasses amen amen uh let's go back to Matthew chapter 5 and read uh just a couple verses there Matthew 5:43 Matthew 5:43 ye have heard that it hath been said Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy but I say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them that despitefully use you and persecute you that you may be the children of your father which is in heaven heaven for he maketh his son to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth reain on the just and on the unjust so now he's telling us that no longer eye for an eye the way you treat me is the way I'll treat you back that's all gone am because he says I say to you love your enemies amen bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you that you may be children of your father amen what's he saying he says you're supposed to be acting like your father this is how you demonstrate whose child you are amen and when we talk about coming to adoption coming to adoption is actually coming to a place where you're like the father amen you handle Affairs you handle situations like the father that's when you come to adoption that was the report that the Holy Spirit gave back the tutor gave back to the father said you should have seen the way he handled those sheep he did it just like you you should have seen you would have been so proud of him did it just the way you do it and then the father knows now I'm ready to give him some responsibility why because he can handle the situation the way I handle the situation in maturity and now Jesus is telling us no longer eye for an eye tooth for tooth now you love those who hate you you do good to them who despitefully use you amen you pray for them amen no matter what they do you pray for them you love them you do good unto them so that you can move into the image of your father so you can be like God because that's that's how God acts that's how he acted when he came for Redemption that's what Christ was on the cross amen he he was Emmanuel God With Us standing there demonstrating what he he didn't just give us Commandments he showed us what it's like in the face of some of the worst rejection persecution false accusation mistreatment that a human being has ever gone through and he's who's mistreating him his Brethren his people the ones that he redeemed the ones he gave the word to the one he's protected the one he's blessed the ones he's prospered they're the ones who are mocking him and he's up here amen where did he receive the wounds in the house of his friends and he's standing there in the worst of worst situations father forgive them amen we know that our goal in this life is to be in the very likeness of Jesus Christ to be to to to to come to a place where Christ is Manifest in his fullness in Bride form that's what the message came to awaken us to that's what the word came to BR bring the power of transformation to transform Us in to this image of Christ where Christ is now alive and a many membered bride and she will reflect him his character his nature the way that he operates and so we we had it demonstrated and now it's more than a it needs to be more than a demonstration it needs to become a manifestation in us let's go to Matthew 18 we're going to lay down a lot of pieces and then we'll pray that the Lord help us to put these pieces together Matthew 18 and verse 21 then came Peter to him and said Lord how often shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him till seven times Jesus say unto him I say not unto thee until seven times but until 70 * 7 therefore is the Kingdom of Heaven likened to a certain King which would take account of his servants and when he had begun to reckon one was brought unto him which owed him 10,000 talents but for as much as he had not to pay his Lord commanded him to be sold and his wife and children and all that he had and payment to be made the servant therefore fell down and worshiped him saying Lord have patience with me and I will pay thee all then the Lord of thy servant was moved with compassion and loosed him and forgave him the debt now I want you to look at verse 27 very carefully the man said for have patience with me and I'll repay you all so I'll pay it back I'm a debtor but I'll pay my debt but this King when he had compassion on him he said then the lord of the servant was moved with compassion and loosed him and forgave him the death this is forgiveness this is real forgiveness real forgiveness is not you know forgiveness would not have been I will now delay my judgment I won't sell your wife and I won't sell your children I'll give you more time to pay me back I'll be patient that's patience that's not forgiveness forgiveness is totally different than patience patience was okay I'll give you another year we'll see if you can pay me back but if not all I've done is delay my judgment it's still coming but forgiveness is you don't owe me anything anymore you're loose your account is clear I've taken it back to zero you owe me nothing you're now completely free that's forgiveness amen that's real forgiveness and so let's keep reading in verse 28 but the same servant went out and found one of his fellow servants which owed him 100 P 10 what was it a thousand let me go back and read what it was 10,000 talents compared to a few Pence he says 100 Pence and he laid hands on him and took him by the throat saying pay me that thou owest and his fellow servant fell down at his feet and besought him saying have patience with me and I will pay the all and he would not but went and cast him into prison till he should pay the debt so when his fellow servants saw what was done they were very sorry and came and told unto their lord all that was done then his Lord after that that he had called him said unto him oh thou Wicked servant I forgave thee all that debt because thou desired me should us not thou have also have had compassion on thy fellow servant even as I had pity on thee and this Lord was wroth and delivered him to the tormentors till he should pay all that was due unto him so likewise shall my heavenly father do also unto you if you from your hearts forgive not everyone's brother their trespasses about you but that series of scriptures I just read are so wow they're inescapable let's just put it that way there's no way to dodge it they're in they're completely inescapable amen we can't get around it and we can't get around the consequences for unforgiveness so here we we we see the story that that the man was forgiven so much and as as much as he was forgiven he didn't have the same heart to forgive his his brother his fellow servant but he treated him as if you've offended me you owe me and he forgot how much he had offended and how much he owed and he forgot that he was forgiven he should have turned around the master said you should have done as I did to you and have compassion on your fellow servant but because not now you you have no forgiveness you have nothing so this is serious this is very serious so the to me the subject is very very serious and and this last I want to look at this last sentence again I'm going to read the whole verse verse 35 so likewise shall my heavenly father do also unto you if you from your hearts forgive not everyone his brother their trespasses now all of a sudden it for me it just got deeper because this cannot be an intellectual exercise this cannot be a form or a ritual this cannot be something I do because he said I have to do it because I have to forgive from my heart Hey listen forgiving from your heart is much harder than it sounds it's not just words it's not rhetoric it's not something that you can just say and do as a ritual as a form I forgive you but if your heart is not attached to your word that's not the right kind of forgiveness because he says if you from your hearts forgive not so it doesn't matter what you say if you from your hearts forgive not everyone is brother their trespasses so what would happen if you don't do that your heavenly father will do also unto you as this servant did so as the master did to the servant so we find how serious this is I can't just say you've offended me but I forgive you but I walk away and my heart is still bitter toward you I still hold you in contempt I'm still angry with you if I'm that way then I haven't yet met the requirements that the father is looking for for forgiveness because he's not looking for words he's not looking for a church form he's not looking for rhetoric he's looking for somebody that will forgive from their heart am and I tell you that if I don't know how to put it in perspective but I've sat with many people and talked to many people who' have been deeply wounded by things that have gone wrong in their life and you don't realize how hard this sentence is it's not something you can manufacture it's not something you can make up it is not something you can pretend it is going to take the actual grace of God in your life it's going to take the spirit of God to help you with this process you're not going to do it by willpower you're not going to do it by your nice personality it's going to take somebody that can come in and do some heart surgery amen and bring from your heart a true forgiveness for somebody else amen most of what we call forgiveness is just lip service it's just a ritual because the Bible says I have to but we need some real forgiveness amen the way Christ forgave is the way we have to forgive so that we can be children of our father it's going to take the working of the holy spirit it's going to take a genuine Christ nature it's going to take reality and if we're not getting down to the reality we haven't forgiven that's why I say this message takes everything deeper everything you're not going to be able to stand if if you stand before God and you say why did you have unforgiveness in your heart towards your brother said no I told him I forgave him you're asking did I tell you I forgave you yeah he told me he forgave me that's not what I'm looking at why do you have unforgiveness in your heart that's where the condemnation is not in what came out of your mouth but what's in your heart so it's much deeper I say it's much deeper and it's also impossible but I know a God who can do the impossible this mess message brother bam says in the message the church and its condition he says how many hear this black siding oh you say I wouldn't admit that brother benen but look if that Dove of meekness is gone from you brother there's something wrong there's something wrong when you can't bear with one another when you can't forgive every person from the depths of your heart no matter what they've done or what they've said if you can't forgive them from the depth Jesus said if you don't forgive every man his trespasses from your heart neither does your heavenly father forgive you you so if there's if we're not able to forgive from our heart there's something wrong amen and I'll say it that this there's not something uniquely wrong with you if you have trouble forgiving from your heart it just makes you a human being like every other human being that's fallen and frail and subject to many things amen but but the dove of the Holy Ghost is there to work in our heart Amen to bring out the nature of Christ so that we can forgive from the heart Amen brother bam says in and Christ is the mystery of God revealed said if the brother you think he's a little wrong or sister say Lord don't let me never have the root of bitterness spring up because it'll affect him and it'll take the Christ right out of my life I want you to look at how serious this is so he's he's talking about you think a brother's a little wrong so there's some sort of disagreement or offense or something something there you think the brother's a little wrong or the sister you say Lord don't let me never have the root of bitterness spring up so when there's offenses and Wrongs it can create bitterness in our heart because what happens is when somebody has uh trespassed against us what really has happened is they've wounded our heart and I'm talking about your heart I'm talking about the second realm of you your spirit realm your spirit man when somebody has trespassed against you and done you wrong they have wounded your heart and that wound in the heart if it if it doesn't heal amen it it it starts to grow bitterness and bitterness is poison that will affect every part of our Lives yeah he says now don't never let have a root of bitterness spring up because it'll affect him it'll take the Christ right out of my life that poison acids of malice and jealousy and hatred that will just take the Holy Spirit right away from you it'll run him from the Tabernacle here it'll kill the spirit of God or drive it away from here hurt your pastor it'll do everything don't you do that so we cannot listen if we want to cause destruction all around us when we get offended amen if we want to cause destruction everywhere around us when we're offended what we need to do is hold on to that offense nurse it a little bit feel sorry for ourselves and focus on it and what it'll do is create bitterness and it'll destroy everyone that's in contact with us yeah right amen and we'll show that in a little bit so we've got to have a way we have to understand what forgiveness is I mean we can talk all day long about forgive forgive forgive forgive from the heart forgive but I found it so helpful to actually dig down look at the example we have and find out what forgiveness is what does forgiveness look like amen what impact does it have and how can I tell if I forgiven so those are the things that I would like to talk about today but first I'd like to look at two scriptures uh let's go to Matthew 18 or we're here at Matthew 18 praise God Matthew 18:7 Matthew 18:7 woe unto the world because of offenses for it must needs be that offenses come but woe to that man by whom the offense cometh I love the second phrase in this sentence when he says for it must needs be that offenses come Jesus is telling us this is unavoidable unavoidable you're not going to pass through life without somebody trespassing against you you're not going to make it very far in life without offenses coming and offenses must needs be amen these things have to be why be because I could give you mult multiple reasons I don't always know on every offense what's happening but I know one thing God is trying to display the nature of Christ and God is trying to grow us into the image of Christ amen God is using these things Amen to manifest his word because many of these things cannot be manifest only in the backdrop of white but white shows up in the backdrop of black so there must be an offense so the word can be made manifest amen we have to be Christlike how are we going to be Christlike if we don't have the opportunity to forgive the way Christ forgave God has to create in our lives opportunities so that we can manifest The Life of Christ offenses and offenses also move forward the program of God because there's prophecies that have to take effect and for those prophecies to take effect there have to be offenses somebody had to crucify the Lord amen for that prophecy to go into effect offenses must needs be somebody has to persecute the church to fulfill the word amen somebody has to create offenses it has to be there that's why amen we got to stop being so surprised amen when something happens in our lives and me act like why is this happened to me why is this happened to me stop asking why is this happened to me because brother bandham taught us that nothing happens by accident in the life of a Believer but the clock is ticking right on time and there's things that happen to us that are wrong that are hurtful that destroy us on the inside and you say how can that be God offenses must needs be it has to be there amen and what God is doing he's he's training you he's teaching us he's healing us he's building us he's doing a myriad of things I don't even I can't even fathom all the things that God is doing in every circumstance because it's multifaceted and more complex than I'll ever comprehend but one thing I know is offenses must needs be so why am I shocked when I'm offended if we could get over the shock if we could get over the disappointment and discouragement we would handle it 10 times better from the very outgate instead of saying how in the world could that brother do that to me it's all wrong offenses must needs be so when offenses come let's switch our thinking from what was me feeling sorry for myself to this offense is here what does God want me to do what does the scripture say what can I do to grow what can I do to shine light what can I do to be Christ in this situation amen let's go to Luke 17 remember I said years ago I made the statement you can only ever be disappointment disappointed if something doesn't meet your expectations it's the only way to be disappointed so if you wake up in the morning and say I'm going to have a horrible day today and you have a horrible day you're not disappointed there's no disint appointment if you wake up in the morning say this is going to be the best day of my life and disappointing things happen difficult things you're going to end the day very disappointed cu the only way to be disappointed is when something doesn't meet your expectations so many times we're disappointed in life because we have the wrong expectation of this life we expect God to keep us as babies we expect to ride on training wheels all of our we expect God to shelter us and put his arms around and let put us in a bubble and never let anything bad to happen we have the wrong expectation and because we have the wrong expectation many times we get severely disappointed but maybe we should come back to the scriptures and the message and come with the right expectation I'm here for training God's going to beat all of me out of me he's going to use circumstances and situations and good things and bad things everything in between and what's he doing he's trying to mold me into the character of the seed that he's planted inside of me he's trying to bring that Seed Life out on display which is his life and to do that he's got to crush parts of me and he's got to cut parts of me and he's got to change me amen and these circumstances that change me no longer are outside the plan and program of God the right smack dab in the middle of the plan and program of God for my life so I'm not disappointed when disappointing things happen now listen we're all human beings we all have to go through the phase of disappointment but just let the circumstances soak down a little deeper in meditation until the truth meets that disappointment and pushes it back out and say no no no God is still on the throne he knows who I am I'm his child and he doesn't permit anything unless it's for good so this is a good thing somebody told a lie about you it's ruining your reputation it's a good thing why because God wouldn't have let it happen unless it work together for good Luke 17 verse one Luke 17 And1 then said he unto his disciples it is impossible but that offenses will come but War unto him through whom they come it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and he was cast into the sea then that he should offend one of these little ones take heed to yourselves If thy brother trespass against thee rebuke him and if he repent forgive him and if he trespass against thee thee seven times in a day and seven times in a day turn again to thee and repent Thou shalt forgive him what's he saying he's saying hey these things have to happen they have to happen if your brother if your brother can offend thee seven times in a day listen if I had a brother that was offending me seven times in a day I mean really think about it seven time now I mean some of you had little brothers that offended you more than that in the day I'm talking to a brother sister in the church offending you seven times a day I mean you talk about that's going to be hard to deal with like first time okay I'll give it to you second time now third time listen this is getting ridiculous fourth time I've had I'm up to here with you but God is showing us a principle amen that God never stopped forgiving us we should never stop forgiving someone else God has never refused us forgiveness why would we refuse forgiveness to anybody else if we refuse forgiveness anybody else then God is going to refuse us forgiveness and I I I believe amen I have a deeper understanding of why it's like why why why is God saying if you don't forgive every man if you don't forgive your brother if you don't forgive everyone neither will I forgive you it seems like God's just saying hey if you don't get this perfect you don't get my forgiveness but to me I believe God understood how important forgiveness is because because unforgiveness brings bitterness yes and actually destroys our life amen and God's commandment is always for us never against us so this commandment of God is not saying I'm going to sit back and watch how you do I'm throwing everything at you every brother you got's going to be against you everything that could go wrong is going to go wrong and if you don't forgive one time you're finished that's not the point friends the point is he's saying for you to stay free you've got to forgive the way I forgive seven times a day seven time 70 it doesn't matter how many times if you want to be like your father and if you want to remain free you better forgive because the best way to get yourself tied up emotionally is to refuse forgiveness and then it begins to destroy you the unforgiving person it destroys you on the inside brother B says in the morning Church age he said the only thing that the matter get all these little differences away from you little isms little funny feelings around you for Brethren and things like that shake it away don't let no root of bitterness ever get into your soul if you do it'll caner you I want to spend some time on this quote it'll canker you says right keep love I don't care how much people hate you you love them anyhow if you can't do that you you if you can't do that you ain't sealed you got a loose place yet so come on back and get that sealed up right good with the blood of Christ it'll cleanse you from all roots of bitterness so he's telling us that what the prophet told us now if you let a root of bitterness get in and how does bitterness come bitterness comes by an offense nobody wakes up in the morning and says I have decided I'm going to be bitter today never happened no little child just sudden all of a sudden says you know what I think I'm going to turn sour and turn bitter no it always happens because of an offense because something happens that wounds that Spirit realm and in that Spirit realm now there's an offense come and that offense amen becomes bitterness and brother bandam said it'll caner you yeah it'll canker you and so we've got if we want to stay free from being cankered and free from bitterness and all the effects of bitterness then we are going to have to stay in the realm of forgiving from the heart which I want to just bring back to your memory the most impossible kind of forgiveness without Christ amen so yeah praise God I'm going to draw some pictures is that okay amen I haven't used this whiteboard in a while and I I'm I'm not very good at it but I I just want to demonstrate some things just just I just want to share with you from my perspective as a pastor things I've seen things I've gone through things I've worked with people through things I've worked through myself and begin to understand how deep this issue is because it it affects our lives in the deepest ways if you ever met somebody that they seem all right but every once in a while they just flare up get upset over something that seems trivial something see small they get upset they get angry or they get reclusive they pull away and they go hide and they won't talk to you anymore and you don't know what you did you don't know what it was you ever I mean don't don't raise your hands you might be sitting next to that person but but we all know people like we've all been that way ourselves what you find see that's not the way people want to be people don't want to be in a situation where I said every time amen you do something to me I'm going to lash out at you or I'm going to pull away and refuse to be a friend I won't talk to you for a little while but but what's always at the bottom of that is there's been an offense there that spirit's been wounded and unbeknownst to you what you did is you just touched that spot yeah and what you did was not an anywhere equivalent to what happened to them years ago or what was the most hurtful thing in their life it wasn't an equivalent action but because they've never been healed and there's bitterness and there's a root of bitterness and it's cankered there because you just barely touched it that thing's been festering for years and every time you touch it you get a disproportionate response they lash out they get angry they won't talk to you for days they'll suck they'll pout they'll pull away they'll they'll they'll do whatever that they they're going to do and you realize right there there's a wounded Spirit right there right where I touch there's a wounded spirit because that's not normal that's not why how a whole healthy heart reacts to situations right amen so we see that we've all lived with these things but we need to get free from them have you ever had a situation where you say I don't know why I always overreact to this sort of situation I can't stand it when I see somebody left out if I see somebody say something heard somebody it makes me so mad you know that not normal it's normal to say I feel sorry for that that shouldn't have happened that was a bad but to get so angry something's wrong or if you feel rejected somebody criticize something you say and you want to pull away and not talk to anybody for a long time that's also not normal and you need to sometimes we need to ask ourselves Lord why am I overreacting to these situations what they did what my wife said really wasn't that bad what my husband said what what what this was wasn't that bad why do I get get so upset why do I get so angry why do I get so deeply hurt sometimes things are buried so deep inside of us we don't even understand why we're reacting the way we're reacting but I know somebody who knows our heart and everything that's ever happened to us and he's also the one who can reveal the secrets of our heart am and if we ask him with an honest heart say God I I want to be free from this I don't want to react this way anymore would you please come and show me why why I get so tripped up every time this happens why do I get so hurt or offended every time this happens what is it that's hurting me so bad yes and by the grace of God if he'll allow an open window into your heart you'll realize that there's something there that caused some damage some time ago and you're reacting to Old hurts not new hurts and I'm going to show you this is why forgiveness from the heart is so important if we if we just draw our little heart here so we all know what this is right beautiful and there's there's many times that we have Encounters in our life with people and these people wound our heart and because they wounded us we've got something inside that's been damaged and damage comes from people a damaged heart comes from a person do you know that Jesus didn't die of crucifixion he died of a broken heart so don't be ashamed that your heart's broken it's this this is our human existence this is our human life somebody wounds us and and it depends on how deep the wound how young we were how many times we're offended by the same person or the same circumstance but sometimes those wounds can go very very deep in our hearts some of the worst wounding is the wounding that took place when we were the tenderest in our lives when we were children the most impressionable and the most tender and that's when the deepest wounds come sometimes but what happens is when we get an offence we don't sometimes know what to do about this broken heart and now something inside of us is broke and we start to get bitter because this never should have happened to me they should not have mistreated me they should not have neglected me they should not have spoke that way they shouldn't have lied about me they shouldn't have done any Myriad of things that what somebody did to you they should never have done that to you Mom should have never said that Dad should have never done that Aunt Uncle friend they should have never said those things or done those things to me and so now there's an offense that come the offense caused the wound and now because we don't know what to do about it now we just focus on the wound and focus on the offense and a root of bitterness comes in and we start to get bitter towards the person who hurt us is that right and then we pass judgment now what I I just like to share this with you this is just human nature 101 all of us have a good sense of justice we all do there's something that's in human nature amen and it was passed down from God when man was made in the image of God and M in the flesh and now it's corrupted but there's a sense of justice that's inherent to us all and we realize amen there's an action and reaction a cause and effect and when somebody does wrong that they should pay when somebody does wrong something should happen we that does everybody have that sense of justice if you steal something from me you should get punished for that and you should restore that and you in the says you should restore it more than what you take amen there should be a punishment for your unjust deed so we all have this sense of justice even from the time we're children and we realize that this wrong deed something should happen they shouldn't be able to get away for that and you see the person going Free Living their life doing what they're doing and you're brokenhearted and you're wounded but there's no there's there's nobody to judge them there's nobody to make them pay there's nobody to fix the situation and give you any retribution so you're left with all the consequences of their action and they get to go free and inside of you because of a sense of justice you get bitter right and you get bitter because you've become the judge and you've judged this person guilty they're guilty what are they guilty of you name the offense neglect abuse abandonment lies you name the offense but we've all every one of us can name offenses every one of us but we in our spirit realm we deem them guilty and there's nobody coming to bat for us there's nobody coming to defend us there's nobody making them say they're sorry there's nobody making them fix the problem nothing's happening amen so we hold them in contempt and we hold them bound to their sin because we know that they're guilty and so because they're guilty we make a little chain look at this beautiful chain and this friends is one of the saddest things in the world and now we judge them guilty and we judge them worthy of punishment and we judge them deserving and because we judge them that way now in our heart we hold them in in our own little prison they're guilty the problem is we have no authority to enforce our judgment we pass judgment as a judge but we have no authority to enforce any judgment you can't make them say they're sorry you can't make them make it right you can't make them change their ways you can't stop it so what happens is we become bound to this person because of our guilty verdict and we want we want some somehow we want them to pay for what they've done because of the sense of justice that's in us and we not may not verbalize all of this but that's what's going on on the inside and then we take this hurt this wounded spirit this wound right here and this wound is our evidence this is our evidence that they did wrong now here's the saddest part of this whole thing because our wound in our spirit is evidence that they did me wrong until they come to judgment I can never get rid of this broken heart because I can't get rid of the evidence that they're guilty so God can never take it from me because I haven't forgiven them I hold them in contempt and hold them guilty and I have to have an Evidence to why they're guilty in the hurt is my evidence so I can never turn loose of my hurt cuz if I turn loose of my hurt I have no evidence that they're guilty yeah and what does this hurt do it caners it brings bitterness it gets and the longer it goes the worst it gets and we try to bury it and we bury it and we bury it but it never ever goes away because we want somebody to make them pay for what they did to me that's the inherent sense of justice in every human being and so I can never be free completely free from this pain because the moment I turn loose of the pain I've turned loose of their guilt and I can't do that because they have to pay somebody has to pay because I'm suffering I hope you're seeing why forgiveness is so important you'll never be free until you learn to forgive from the heart you'll be bound by something your whole life and you'll continually be falling into this trap of overreacting to something or having uh you'll have relationships that go good for a while until somebody does something like this person did long ago and when they do something similar to what this person did Bam that's it that breaks the relationship causes a tension causes a disagreement causes me to pull away and then you go from one relationship to another relationship to another relationship one one one work situ start fine I go to a new job and they all my friends and all of a sudden the same thing that happened at the old workplace happens at this place and the the whole thing falls apart I go to a different church and the same thing that happen that church it's amazing how the same things keep happening to you over and over again even though you change scenarios you change locations changing locations won't change this amen changing friends won't change this changing relations won't change this it will eventually come out again and it'll happen again there'll be a cycle to everything starts off good doesn't last forever get in trouble and then we start to cycle over again change the situation change the scenery change the friends change the people change the names and we go right back to the same cycle I'm not the only one who's been through the cycle a few times am I same exact thing because until we get rid of what calls the root of bitterness we're never going to get rid of the problem and the problem is we can't get rid of the problem because we can't let somebody go and God can't take this from us when we're holding it as evidence against guilt because we need it as evidence against guilt and it comes to the place where now we like the hurt you say no way we like the hurt because the hurt justifies our wrong action attitude towards the person and without the hurt I have no right to be angry I have no right to be offended I have no right yeah so I all of a sudden protect my hurt yeah and then every time I meet a new friend all I do is talk about the old hurt what my mom did what my dad did what they did what my last Pastor did what what my brother or sister did what my co-work then in every new relationship has to hear all the details of the old hurt every new one we've got to rehearse it every new person we come in contact with it won't take long till it all comes out again that's right it's because we're holding on to it as the justification for our guilty verdict the trouble that we have is you see that chain no matter how much you're upset with that person angry with them want to get away from them and don't want them have any involvement in your life again you'll never ever be free from that person because your guilty verdict caused you to be attached to that person because you have to hold them in guilt Forever Until the righteous judgment comes the punishment comes so you are absolutely attached to that person and you will never be free from them that's why this person can be six feet under the ground and you've got a chain going right down to their casket attached to your heart and you can never get over what a dead person did to you 50 years ago and you're still affected in life today by somebody that's in a casket death won't even separate you from this hurs death won't even break this chain and you'll walk around with bitterness and our hurt and we walk around nursing this because it's our justification for being mad at my mom who died 10 years ago and she's dead she can't pay she can't say she's sorry she can't make it right she can't change anything and because you want somebody to make it right and you want her to be guilty and you want restitution you'll never never have it and you live the rest of your life getting more and more bitter because there's no hope for restitution one of the other problems we have is a heart is meant to give love and meant to receive love so we have other relationships let's say we have another relationship here we have another relationship over here we have relationships maybe with a group of people over here and these people we're attached to we want to love we want we want to give love and receive love and we want to have right sound relationships but the problem is if one of these people in these relationships touch this spot right there we cut them off because you can't touch that spot it's too painful brings back too many memories and the problem is you can never let's just say it this way you can never keep bitterness focused towards the person who first made you bitter we think I'm just upset at dad because Dad neglected us he left us he abandoned us and I'm upset at dad the problem is you can't keep bitterness only directed towards dad because if anybody else comes and does anything similar to what Dad did amen you get the same bitterness you're holding towards dad pops out towards them yeah and so this old hurt is affecting every other relationship in our life because you cannot and I I promise you this you cannot keep bitterness focused towards the person you're bitter towards it will come out that's why sometimes you talk to people and you get in a in a situation and may become tense and there may be some stress involved and you say something to somebody and they blow up and they storm out the door and you're saying what did I say well it's not really what you said it's what they never got over from long ago and you said something in similar fashion or reminded them or touched a pain point and all of a sudden you have an explosion or you have a withdrawal or you have a cut off relationship and you're sitting there wondering what in the world did I do what was it and you don't realize it's not you they're bitter towards mom and dad they're bitter towards friends they're bitter towards somebody else but they can't keep that bitterness focused that way amen it's got to pop out everywhere else and then we're always somebody in this situation is always trying to go around mend relationships touch stuff up mend relationships have a little discour discussion here have a little Fallout here and they're constantly and what they're doing is they're trying to whack off the weeds that are popping out the spirit realm and now I had a little dispute with this one and I had a little misunderstanding or I withdrawal from this and we whack it off but we never get to the root of the bitterness where it actually came from to pluck that thing out by the roots and that's what we need we need that thing to be gone amen I'm going to go back here and look at a few more things and then we'll come back so now what's the path to Freedom what do what can we do about this situation and I hope every one of you can find yourself in here somewhere level one level 10 somewhere what do we do about this situation there's actually only one thing that you can do to go free and that's forgive the guilty party it's the only thing there's nothing else you can do to ever be free there's not enough church services you can attend not enough Good Deeds you can do not enough prayers you can pray there is nothing you can do to be free the only only thing that will give you freedom from this situation is forgiveness you have to forgive the guilty party now realize you can only forgive somebody who's guilty you cannot forgive somebody who's not guilty if they're not guilty there's no forgiveness needed so if they're guilty the only way that you can deal with their guilt is through forgiveness remember because you don't have the authority to enforce your guilty verdict and because you don't have the authority to enforce your guilty verdict the only way to be free from this situation is to forgive them right amen amen praise God and so now how do I get free how do I forgive let's turn to Colossians chapter 3 together I I hope that today we can get down to nuts and bolts of forgiveness to the actual practical working the how how I'm in this situation how do I get out of this situation I've been in these Cycles how do I stop these Cycles Les that's right Colossians 3 Colossians 3:12 he says Colossians 3:12 put on therefore on the elect of God as the elect of God holy and beloved bows of Mercy kindness humbleness of Mind meekness longsuffering forbearing one another and forgiving one another If any man have a quarrel against any even as Christ forgave you so also do ye I just like for you to note even as Christ so what is the way to forgive I have to forgive even as Christ so that means I have to forgive the same way Christ forgave yeah so I have to forgive others the same way he forgave me so let's look at Ephesians now let's turn back to Ephesians chapter 4 Ephesians chapter 4 Ephesians 4:31 it says let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice and be you kind one to another tender-hearted forgiving one another even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you so here is our model how do I forgive I have to forgive the same way I was forgiven by God so we're going to look at how God forgave me because that's the model that's the model I will model to forgive others now let's turn to Romans really quick and pick up another scripture Romans chapter 5 Romans chapter 5 in verse 8 Romans 5 and8 says but God commanded his love toward us and that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us I ask you a question did God forgive you while you were a debtor or after you made everything right he forgave us when we were in sin when being yet sinners he died for us he paid the price for us he forgave us he forgave us before we asked when Jesus was nailed to the cross and he looked out at all those who had offended him and they were mocking they were deriding they were making comments they were they were jeering and teasing and laughing and right in the midst of the crucifixion he said father forgive them because they don't know what they're doing amen he didn't wait for them to make it right he didn't ask them to come and apologize he forgave when they didn't say they were sorry he forgave before they could repent he forgave them before they could make restitution he forgave them while they were in their sins and how am I supposed to forgive even as Christ forgave me amen that's the way that I'm supposed to forgive I want to read this quote from brother banham out of the Great Commission from 1958 and I want you just we're going to talk about forgiving from the heart now not from the head not with the mouth but forgiving from the heart says he says if I have found Grace in your sight through God you take my word for this Brethren if you want to be a blessing and get a blessing when a man has done you wrong and as absolutely justly I mean he has done you wrong and you know that he's done you wrong he's done you evil don't mention that you take him to prayer before God and don't take it in the way of just a selfish say well I'm supposed to do this why cuz that's not from the heart can't do it as a ritual you can't do it as a form and you can't do it as a commandment alone you have to do it from the heart so I'm going read that again don't take it in a way of just a selfish say well I'm supposed to do this but stand with your shoulder to his shoulder and stand in the presence of God our Father way a prayer should be made in the presence of God say father here's my brother he is just he deserves punishment because he has done me evil and I don't see why he did it it's just being honest listen what one of the first steps to forgiveness is to be honest just be honest don't so many times we're afraid to deal in the Realms of forgiveness because we don't actually want to be honest about what's happened we smooth everything over and say well you know long time ago mom didn't understand dad didn't understand and that's fine but remember you can only forgive people who are guilty yeah there's no forgiveness for somebody who's not guilty so if you're going to forgive somebody they actually have to be guilty yeah remember somebody come to brother bam said brother bham you know such and such a night over there I saw you you were out with somebody you took a drink and I saw you drink but I forgive you for that and brother bam said it wasn't me I was never there you can't forgive me I never did it right amen so we're sometimes were so afraid to be honest about my husband did this to me my mother did this to me my father somehow we think that and declaring that we're somehow uh uh selling them out or we're not being nice or we're but it it's just the truth yeah it's just the truth we have to identify what happened and who did it there's no Freedom until we can identify what happened and who did it my friend my mother my father my uncle my brother my sister they did this to me and it was wrong God I don't know why they did it it was wrong but God I want to forgive them from my heart really you can't forgive until they're guilty and you have to know who it is and what they're guilty of before you can forgive and this is just so to start with you have to just get honest quit sweeping stuff under the rug quit acting like it didn't bother you quit acting like it was no big deal but get down down to the reality of it and said when this happened when I was a little boy when that happened when we were first married when this happened in the church it destroyed me on the inside and this person said this and this person did that and it broke something inside of me that's never been right since start with the truth start with the reality and quit pretending there's not a problem and quit pretending nobody did anything wrong start with reality and the truth and say this happened but I want to forgive them you take them shoulder Tosh shoulder you're not there to ask God to destroy them and lightning bolts no this is a totally different situation I'm coming with my brother shoulder-to-shoulder cuz I need Deliverance amen I need to be free and the only way I'll be free is if I find a way to make them free and when I make them free I'll be free and if they don't go free I'll never be free amen father here's my brother he justly he deserves punishment because he's done me evil and I don't see why why he did it then let go let God go to talking to you and you'll see maybe what that man's been through the devil has Twisted him up somewhere caused him to do that though he's absolutely wrong before you leave the Throne of God you'll be feeling sorry for that man you'll be sympathizing with that brother and when you get back down on Earth you'll go over to that brother shake his hand cuz you know what he's been through you can't stand with a mortal in the Pres presence of God and condemn anybody I don't believe no sir even if he's a rank Sinner and what about a brother that has made a mistake though I say he's wrong sometimes he's accused wrong when he's not wrong but if he's wrong well if if we will take him to the throne of God stand there shoulder-to-shoulder with our brother knowing he's Immortal and maybe his destination rest upon our attitude towards him think about that when we come back from the Throne of God we'll realize I that we're everyone guilty and we all need help one from another and the best way to do is to pray you know we can't just go through the motion and say well I forgive this is what happened I forgive no we actually got to go like brother BR said shoulder-to-shoulder before the Throne of God and and we've got to stand there until God does a work in our heart and listen I've been through this before with things that have happened to me that absolutely were so some of the most hurtful things in my life and I'll tell you for it wasn't the first prayer I got free and it wasn't the second prayer I got free but I had to keep going back to God until from my heart I could forgive the one who created the offense because until then I could never be free and then I started to find out how is it that I know that I've forgiven like I I I I I I I say I forgive I pray I go to God and say God Amen help me forgive from my heart I forgive them and you get up and and I'll tell you how you know amen when you go back and when you think about that situation and all the same anger and frustration and hurt feelings come back it's not done yet it's not done yet go back again go back again until you're free because when you let them go free you'll be free until you let them go free you'll have to hold the evidence of their guilt and you can't let it go so when you're not free now what's it feel like to be free I can tell you because God's freed me when I can look back on that situation and I can talk about it and it doesn't bring the same old hurts it doesn't bring anger it doesn't bring I just see it as a situation that happened in my life and I can even say it was negative it was bad it shouldn't have happened it was wrong but it doesn't bring all those same emotions up in me and when I look at the brother all of a sudden I can see I can like brother said feel sorry yeah amen I could be like Jesus on Calvary and say you know what they had no idea what they were doing to me yeah they didn't they didn't understand they didn't know they didn't know how deeply I'm hurt they don't know how badly I'm wounded they don't know how deep this scar goes oh God they don't understand and when I can start to actually feel sorry for the perpetrator and see through their eyes that maybe they didn't understand and it wasn't exactly the way I saw and they didn't mean to do it it wasn't on purpose and it wasn't intentional and maybe they reacted because of things that happened to them when they were a kid as soon as I can see that picture I'm free yeah I'm free because now I'm not saying they're guilty they're bad they're the enemy they're Wicked they hurt me they must pay now all of a sudden I can say no they they hurt me because they were hurt they were they went through this and they went through that and all of a sudden compassion starts to come in your heart and you're like Jesus on the cross father forgive them they don't know what they're doing they literally have no idea what they're doing they're deceived they're blinded they're wounded they're hurt that's Freedom friends that's Freedom when we have to forgive the same way that we were forgiven which means I have to forgive before they ask brother said in the message look he said if you can focus your camera till you see that and know it cost the life of God himself when he made his life here he didn't have to give up he laid it down freely he was God he didn't have to die but he did it freely give his own life that he might bring Sons to him that his work might continue on John 3:16 Says God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believe in him should not perish but of everlasting life God so loved he gave Christ gave up his life for our forgiveness he shed his blood so that we could go free Ephesians 1:7 says in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace says in Colossians 1:14 in whom we have Redemption through his blood even the Forgiveness of sins so how were we forgiven we were forgiven for given while we were in our sin while we were wrong before we had a chance to make it right we were forgiven I'm just going to draw another picture for you draw the same the same heart and the same chain to our offender we want to have the same wound you know what we want to get free from this wound but in order for me to forgive this offender the guilty let's make him guilty again do you realize that our sense of justice that we're born with cannot just let somebody go free we know there's something wrong with that I know that that sounds counterintuitive to what I'm saying but it's the truth sometimes we have such a hard time forgiving because we know that this isn't right it's not Justice it's not just that nobody pays it's not just that there's no consequences for Action that's not right how many believe it's not right that there's no consequences for Action we know it we know it intuitively it doesn't have to be taught to us we understand that and so we have such a hard time sometimes forgetting forgiving because inside it goes against the grain of what we are how can somebody go with no consequences for action with no payment for wrongdoing with no suffering and they just get to go free but now it's not right it's not right and the truth is no forgiveness is free none nobody goes free nobody there is always a price to pay for forgiveness remember that I want you to lock that in your mind there is always a price to pay for forgiveness now let's let's look at our situation here we've got somebody who's wounded us deeply they've scarred us and it was a horrible scar amen we're dealing with it we've got bitterness we've got all kinds of problems that are Fallout this I need to get free in order to go free I have to forgive them but I've got to forgive them from my heart so I've got to go to God and say God would you please let me see this situation better and give me a heart that I can forgive the way you forgive and then when you want to turn that person free listen that's why I said I want to get to the nuts and bolts of forgiveness today because forgiveness is reality forgiveness is powerful forgiveness is just it's just I'll ask you this question I'm just trying to get this principle across I hope you can catch it when the when the master had the servant that owed him 10,000 talents and that he he begged for forgiveness when he was going to sell his wife and his children and he says he frankly he he let him loose he freed him and forgave him of his debt what was the cost of that man's freedom because it wasn't free right yeah it cost somebody 10,000 talents who did it cost cost the victim somebody lost 10,000 Talons that was the price of that man's forgiveness forgiveness is never free ever am somebody pays because you can't be forgiven unless you're guilty so let's say we want this situation to change in our lives we want this offender who is guilty and we know what he's guilty from he's from whatever he did to cause this broken break in my heart he's guilty of that so we we understand we've been honest we've been real this person did this and left me in this situation so I'm going to ask you what is the the price of this man's forgiveness the price is this wound somebody has to pay for somebody to go free did somebody pay for me to go free who paid how did he pay he bore my sins upon himself and he was suffering because of me it was me who deserved the stripes it was me who deserved the mocking it was me who deserve the beating it was me he took my place and all those wounds were on him were wounds that I placed on him because of my transgression and my sins amen but he took all the pain and he took it as payment for my forgiveness and he said father forgive them they don't know what they're doing remember God is just as well God a just God couldn't just let us go free amen without something without retribution God is also just and to remain just he can't just say willy-nilly okay you go free no in order for you to go free somebody has to pay the price for your crimes who paid the price Jesus Christ paid the price and when he paid the price willingly and forgave me now I'm free because God's justice is met amen this is inherent inside of us we know you can't just go free no I'm not just turning them free what I'm doing is I'm paying for their freedom with this pain that's locked up inside of my heart they did it they did it unjustly they did it to me and now I'm suffering with bitterness and hurt and complexes and fears and all this stuff that I have inside of me but I realized that Jesus had all kinds of things placed on him because of me and if he can forgive me bearing my shame then I can forgive them bearing the consequences for their sin I have to forgive the same way I was forgiven this is forgiveness nobody gets off free somebody pays now the question is can I be like my father yes right can I pay the price for the guilty party's Freedom can I yes can I say you don't owe me anything you don't owe me an apology you don't have to make it right you don't have to pay me back you don't have to send letters to everybody you slandered my name against you don't have to do any I am letting you go completely free am when we willingly accept this we break this and we separate ourselves from this chain and this bondage we've dragged around all of our lives now this person is completely free they don't owe me anything they don't owe me an apology a letter a Christmas card a handshake they owe me nothing this is forgiveness this is true forgiveness but in order for them to go free now I'm left holding the bag just like the the wealthy ruler was left holding the $10,000 loss and he could hold a $10,000 loss and let a servant Go free and that servant couldn't take a 100 Pence loss to let his fellow servant Go free Jesus could take all of our sins upon him and we can't take a brother saying something against us we can't take uh somebody forgetting us or or somebody stipping on our toes or somebody saying something about us we can't take a 100 Pence off fence with without getting bitter and angry and holding them in contempt when Jesus Took the whole load of the sins of the world upon himself so that we could go free you see how important this is and how deep it actually is so this is the process this is forgiveness forgiveness starts with honesty Lord this brother this sister this parent this they did this to me and when they did this it had this effect on me and Here I Am Lord wanting with all my heart to forgive them so they go free and I want to forgive them the way you forgave me but Lord I need your help because I'm really hurt and I'll tell you the next step Lord I'm willing to accept all the consequences for their actions so that they can go free guess what in reality they can never make it right anyways what if they're already dead what if the person you're hurt at most in the world is already dead what if they live in another country another state what if there's no communication no you're already holding the bag friends you're holding it as evidence of their guilt now why don't you hold it differently why don't you hold it as payment for their freedom say Lord I'm willing I'm not asking anymore for you to make them pay see our superficial forgiveness is like this I forgive you but in your mind wait till God gets you or I forgive you brother that's all right I forgive you but oh God's going to get you that's the wrong forgiveness that's not forgiving from the heart forgiving from the heart heart now com shoulder-to-shoulder with the brother and say God this is forgiveness listen this is the reality friends God I'm willing to bear the consequences for their action as payment for their release and I'm not asking you to punish them to make them pay set them free and don't judge them because of me because I forgive them and in that kind of forgiveness now you've become the intercessor and you stood in the Gap if you're going to take the consequences for their action then you're going to take the consequences for their action you're not going to pretend to take the consequences for Action hoping that God makes them pay for their actions that's not bearing the price of their forgiveness that's superficial that's mental that's not the reality the reality is I'm not going to ask God to make them pay either I hope they don't have to pay I set them free and I want them to go free I want them to prosper I want them to be happy they have no more obligation to me and God please don't judge them for what they did to me because I forgive them for what they did to me if you judge them for something else they did if you judge them for what they did to you that's fine but please don't judge them for what they did to me I set them free that is pure true forgiveness and if you can't do that you have not come to forgiveness from the heart yet and don't feel horrible if you're not there it doesn't come easy friends sometimes we got to go back and say God I need your help I'm not able I can't get over I can't get free I'm not able to Bear the consequence of their action I still want them to pay if you still want them to pay even though you're not going to make them you're just trusting that God will do it we're not there yet because how did Jesus forgive us father forgive them Father I take all the consequences for their actions upon myself s forgive them they don't know what they're doing do you realize what a powerful statement that was that day on Calvary the question is are we going to be Christlike or not this comes down to reality I said this is powerful this is deep this is not trivial this is not surface this is not mental this is the depths of reality nobody gets off free I didn't get off free it was free to me but it cost Christ the offender that offended me he doesn't get off free because I'm paying the price somebody pays for forgiveness the question is are we willing to pay to forgive really pay to where it's all on me and I'm not asking for any any retribution from the offender and asking standing in the gap for them and asking God to let them go too that's real forgiveness turn with me to Acts chapter 7 acts 7:59 and they stoned step calling upon God and saying Lord Jesus receive my spirit and he kneeled down and cried with a loud voice Lord lay not this sin to their charge and when he had said this he fell asleep this is forgiveness you know what he asked God God do not hold anybody here accountable for stoning me yeah who paid the price for their forgiveness Stephen was paying the price for their forgiveness because forgiveness is never free Stephen was willing to lay his life down for his brothers so that God would not judge them for stoning him and when did he forgive them when Stones were beating off of his skull in the midst of being stoned they were stoning him he was calling on God the Rocks were hitting him and he fell to his knees and upon his knees he said father lay not this sin to their charge what's he saying God I'm I forgive them you forgive them don't hold anyone who threw a rock accountable for hitting me with a rock and killing me and you know what I believe God honored it and they went free for that they may have done something later that brought their condemnation but he was standing in the Gap he was playing the part of Christ he was being like his father and was forgiving while he was paying the consequences for their actions that's genuine forgiveness and you know who was standing there watching over the coats while they're being stoned amen it was Saul who would later become the Apostle Paul what if he would said God don't let one of them get by with this judge them all what would have happened to Paul Paul was forgiven by Stephen you have no idea what forgiveness does for the other person amen realizing that we're not not just people born in this earth living life we are products of God we are children of God we're little Messiahs amen we're here on Earth representing Christ you know what happens if you hold a grudge and hold somebody accountable and never forgive them I would hate to think of what happens but somebody's Eternal destination might might might might hang on the balance of our attitude towards them in forgiveness do you remember when job went through his trial and job three friends they kept accusing him and accusing him and falsely accusing him amen at the end of that trial although job himself had made a mistake amen God come and deal with job and job repented but you know what God Said to those three friends he said do three friends go back and have job pray for you if job doesn't stand in the gap for you you're toast so what was job praying about what was the prayer over amen there could only be one thing God would you forgive them and let them go because if not they were doomed it was job who who was offended by their remarks who had to stand in the Gap God didn't even deal with them directly God said you offended job go back to job yeah and if job doesn't pray for you you're finished do you realize what the consequences of our unforgiveness could be because a coworker said something they shouldn't have said took something they shouldn't have taken got a promotion over us because of Lies they told and we hold bitterness towards them can you imagine what the consequences could be for some sons of God who refuse to forgive let us forgive all men let us forgive all men the same way we were forgiven God let them go it's okay I'll take it I'm not asking them to pay and I'm not asking you to make them pay I'm asking you to let them go free because of me for my sake I bear the consequences of their actions that's what job was doing when he was standing in the gap for his children offering sacrifice praise be to God brother B said why am I and why am I against organized religion he said if what is the purpose to the church the life that was in Christ isn't reflecting in you don't you stand still if you haven't got patience virtue all these things in Temperance and things and godliness and brotherly kindness and all these things that's required of you no matter what you've done no matter how much you shouted how many churches you've joined how many feathers you pin into your yourself don't do it wait till genuinely from your heart you can forgive till your in your heart you have brotherly kindness no matter if they're pulling handful of beard from one side you can turn the other cheek with sweetness see until those virtues no matter what they say to you say oh God help me help me God to where I can get to the place where in the offense I can forgive like Stephen did like Jesus did that I can get to the place where wow they're plucking handfuls of beer I can say father forgive them they don't know what they're doing that's what God's growing us to friends this is what adoption looks like adoption isn't just being able to call fire down adoption is coming into the place where you can conduct yourself the same way the father does again he says for if you love those that just who love you as we shook one another's hands as dearly beloved in the Lord that's good but can you also love the unlovable that's the thinking man's filter that's the spirit of Christ in you loving those who don't love you then you have the reward of God now but now if you do it as a duty you still haven't got the thinking man you're only up in the second cycle but it's from your heart you really love him then you're breathing through the thinking man's filter and it satisfies a holy man's taste that you know from your heart you forgive everybody everything no matter what takes place that's the Forgiveness that we're called to why I say it's not a light thing it's heavy amen Proverbs 18:14 I'm just going to read to you but Proverbs 18:14 says the spirit of man will sustain his infirmity but a wounded Spirit who can bear wounded spirit is what's caused all this trouble and off fence and a wound how are we going to get free from it there was a situation brother Ben found himself in we talked about it last time we preached but when he went through a series of deaths his father died his brother died his wife died and now he's standing by the little Crib in the basement of the hospital where his baby's dying and he goes to pray to God and like a black sheet comes down and that black sheet coming down begins to uh uh he said God like he wouldn't talk to me he said when he stopped talking to me Satan started and what did Satan start doing he started accusing God to the prophet he started saying you know he wouldn't have to speak the word just one glance and she'd be healed and of all the people you prayed for and you've served him and this is how he'll treat you right and look at what Satan was trying to do Satan was trying to take this wound that was being Afflicted to brother brandom at the loss of his wife his baby his father his brother and he was trying to get brother brandham offended at God right he was trying he was making accusations about God's love for him and God's care for him and God's righteousness and God's justice After all you've done staying up all night preaching going out on the street doing all of this and he'll treat you like that oh my goodness that slick devil how can he say a thing like that about God he's trying to take the wound amen that's being Afflicted upon brother brandham and he's trying to create an off towards god listen the reason I bring this up friends is because that's exactly what some of you are struggling with something happened in your life and you say how could God let this happen to me Hey listen that's the devil whispering in your ear how could God let this happen to me what do you mean how are you exempt from life like everybody else have life why is all of a sudden you're supposed to be in a bubble when all God's children have to go through life have to be afflicted have to grow have to do why what makes you think he's dealing with you wrongly you realize that's a that is a reflection against the character of God those false accusations are actually demeaning the very character of God as if he's not righteous as if he's not just as if he's not perfect as if he's treating you differently than somebody else and you're getting an unfair treatment amen that's the whisper of the devil and what the devil's trying to do is get you offended at God why did you take my baby why did you take my husband why did I lose that job why did this all fall apart why did you let this happen to me amen listen that is not not God that's the devil speaking through you stop talking like that right now say God why didn't you say my children why did you let him go to the world why did you do that's accusing the righteous holy God of doing wrong and it's all the devil trying to get you and I offended at God because if we get offended at God we do the same thing that happened right there we hold God in contempt of doing us wrong and we nurse a wound thinking God's guilty he could have stopped it well of course he could have stopped it he could have come on the scene he could have healed he could have showed up sooner he could have saved my baby's life he could have not let that car accident he could have five minutes earlier he could have five minutes later he could have he could have he could have some of the wounds in our heart aren't towards other men some of the wounds in our heart are towards God because the devil gave us a false Narrative of what happened like he was trying to give the prophet a false Narrative of what was happening God don't love you and he don't care for you like he should you served him and this is his reward to you he's done the same thing to some of you you can never grow spiritually being bitter towards God why did I have to be born in this house why was my mom like this why was my dad a drunkard why yeah why didn't I get the opportunity as another God why did you let them and not me sometimes we just have to be real honest really honest and if we've got that kind of offense towards God because of a false narrative from the devil we need to come back to the truth and say devil you're a liar for he's my father and he loves me and does everything perfect and everything is for my good and for the benefit and for the kingdom never did he allow anything to hurt me he did everything to mold me and make me and perfect me and when I am tried I shall come forth this gold because he's ordained it so from before the foundation of the world and Satan you're a liar brother Brandon went so far down that road until he got to the point where he said I almost agreed with him and I almost said if that's the way he does then I'll stop preaching that's what brother BM said he got to that point he says but then it went down to the soul and there was something there was eternal life down there and said Satan get thee behind me mean we need to go a little deeper outside of our emotional realm outside of our broken heart and go down to the Eternal and say Satan you're a liar god is perfect and everything that happened to me is for good for his good for my good and he's going to make me into a Son of God and there's not anything that's going to ruin my life everything's going to make me and you're going to find out someday you got to be real some of our offense has been towards God but we're afraid to admit it why didn't you preserve my marriage why didn't you let me get married why why do I have to stay this way and why listen don't dare think that I'm going to ask you to forgive God you ain't got to forgive God he didn't do anything wrong you got to fly higher and ask God to forgive you for thinking he did wrong you got to be the one to say god Set Me Free from this wrong thinking God I'm sorry I condemned you I'm sorry I I defamed your character I'm sorry I entertained thoughts like that God would you forgive me for that's not right amen that's the reality friends but now let's go back to our drawing now we've cut the guilty free they're no longer responsible to us and we're not responsible to them but we hold this wound in our heart I just read to you it said the spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity but a wounded Spirit who can bear when it's all said and done when forgiveness when true forgiveness is given and the guilty is set free the victim is still sitting here with a broken heart you're still sitting with a broken you may not have the bitterness anymore you may not have the contempt or the anger but you're still got the wounds the question is what am I going to do now well I've got good news for you we have a Healer with a bomb in Gilead in Luke chapter 4 turn with me to Luke chapter 4 Luke chapter 4 verse 18 Luke 4:18 said the spirit of the Lord is upon me because Heath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind to set at Liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord what is part of Christ's Ministry is the son of man Ministry it's to heal the brokenhearted do you believe he still heals broken hearts yes he said Deliverance to the captives we've been captive for too long by all of these hurts and these bitterness and he's to set to set at Liberty them that are bruised that word bruised means crushed you know what he's here to do set us free from all these Old Wounds amen there is a balm in Gilead There Is A Healer that doesn't just heal our bodies but he heals our hearts he's here for physical and spiritual healing amen he can he can heal us he can deliver us he can set us free let's look at Psalms 34 together just want to finish with just a couple more scriptures Psalms 34 Psalms 34:1 17 Psalms 34:17 the righteous cry and the Lord heareth and deliverthat heart and saveth such that be of a contrite spirit many are the afflictions of the righteous but the Lord out of them all that little all word again he's near those that are of a broken heart he's nigh unto them and save as such as a contrite spirit is that still true today you know what our Lord can't do he can't take what we're holding on to if we're holding on to the hurt as evidence of guilt so that we're Justified and the contempt we feel he will never ever take that away never because he's a gentleman he won't prior hands apart and rip it out of our hands we're actually holding on to it because we need it to justify our feelings and our hurt and our desire to see wrong things made right God will never take it that's why the thing that you have have to do first is truly forgive from the heart and set the guilty free free completely free and you now now what you know what I don't need anymore I don't need any evidence anymore because I set them free there's no court case there's no trial there's no penalty there's no judgment there's nothing they are completely free I don't need to remember anything they did to me I don't need to catalog it I don't need to file it I don't need to store it I don't need evidence against the day that Calamity finally comes they are completely free I don't need it anymore all I need is to be free from what I'm holding on to and I'm willing to hold it so they can go free I'm holding this for their freedom but I'm asking my God God will you heal my broken heart will You Mend up the broken places you know what happened to me you know the effect and I set them free and if I have to live all my life this way I still want them to be free but I believe that you came to heal the brokenhearted and to set it Liberty those that are bruised I want to turn to one more scripture together I'm going to read two more but this let's turn to this one first Peter all the way back to First Peter I want you to think about this 1 Peter chapter 5 First Peter chapter 5 verse seven casting all your care upon him for he carth for you he's not just going to take it if we're holding it if if we' still got a court case we still got judgment pending he's not going to take it but when the case is closed the innocent or the guilty is turned free dissolved of all guilt free to go now I don't need evidence anymore amen what I need is healing and he says cast all your cares upon Him for he carth for you that means if I give it to him he'll take it is that what the scripture is saying if I give it to him why haven't I given it to him before because I needed it for judgment you see why we struggle with things so long amen it's our own subconscious holding court case and holding guilty if we would just go and and forgive the way Jesus forgave us and set the captives free set the guilty free then all of a sudden I'm free now to cast upon him all my cares all my anxieties all my worri everything that's troubling me I can give it to him because he cares for me amen but I never let him have it because I still needed it I needed to nurse it I needed to rehearse it I needed to go over it with every new relationship I had but oh how wonderful it' be to be free not to need to rehearse it again and talk about it once more and and go over the catalog and remember the sequence of events and the orders that happened because I they're guilty oh I would love to just be free and forget about it there's things that happened to me that I had to go through this exercise with and listen friends sometimes I forget that it even happened or if I go back I still have a vague memory but there's no pain at attached to it anymore so when I go back there I said well something happened but the details Escape me you know what happened when I was still nursing the hurt for judgment I remembered every detail every infraction and the order it happened in right why because I was still judging but when there's real forgiveness and there's genuine healing and there's scriptural forgiveness the way Christ forgiv he puts our sins in the sea of his forgetfulness we can't be like God I wish I could forget everything but I'll tell you what happened when I didn't need to remember anymore there's a whole lot of bad details that just went out of my mind I remember something happened but I forgot some of the details sometimes my wife and I will be talking and she'll say do you remember when that and that happened and I say no I forgot I had forgot and she goes remember and I couldn't I can't pull it up then she'll give a couple more details I said oh I remember praise God that's Freedom friends that's genuine Freedom through forgiveness we think there's things in our life will'll never get over that's not the truth there may be things that molded us shaped us that God's using for something but there are things that you don't have to be bogged down by the rest of your life that are handicaps that hold you down you can be healed but you can't be healed until you forgive because if you don't forgive you'll not be forgiven why is it if we don't forgive we'll not be forgiven why is that because if we don't forgive then we're still holding on to somebody else's sin and won't let it go so we're still guilty but when we forgive we can be forgiven and you know what I'm just going to draw this there's a bomb in Gilead there's an oil of the Holy Ghost that God can pour out and heal our broken hearts and may God heal our broken heart you can say God heal me God heal me God take this away God take this anger God take this this God take this he can't take what you're still holding on to he can't take what is your evidence against your brother he can't take what you need to still condemn somebody else but what he can take is what you don't need anymore and what you can cast upon him he can take from us I want to read one scripture together and we'll close let's go to Second Corin Ians musicians if you can make your way up please brother Blake come on up second Corinthians chapter 2 2 Corinthians chapter 2 in second Corinthians 2 let's read from verse 5 but if any have caused grief he has not grieved me but in part that I may not overcharge you all sufficient to such a man is the punishment which was inflicted of many so that contrarywise you ought rather to forgive him than comfort him lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with over much sorrow wherefore I beseech you that you would confirm your love toward him for to this end also did I write that I might know the proof that you the proof of you whether you be obedient in all things to whom you forgive anything I forgive also also for if I forgave anything to whom I forgave it for your sakes forgave I it in the person of Christ lest Satan should get an advantage of us for you are not ignorant of his devices what you mean if I don't forgive Satan is going to take advantage of me absolutely it's going to bring a root of bitterness into your heart that'll canker and'll cause all kinds of division and problems and it'll hurt every other relationship in our lives and Paul says you forgive who you forgive I forgive whoever I forgive anything I forgive in the p as the person of Christ that Satan doesn't get advantage of us because we're not ignorant to his devices it must needs be that offense has come you know what you and I need to be offended amen let's just change the way we look at the world we must be offended why must I be offended because Christ has to be made manifest in Bride form what how am I going to display the Forgiveness that Christ gave unless I'm offended am how am I going to show brotherly kindness and love unless I'm offended offenses must needs come praise God when they come will they hurt yes will you get wounded yes can you forgive yes can you forgive from your heart yes with the help of God and if you forgive from your heart is there somebody that can heal your broken heart yes you know what when we're trying to look to the guilty party to heal our broken heart we're going to always be disappointed because that person many times can't take back what they did it's done what they said the way they acted it's done they can't take it back they can't make it right so we're holding on to this hurt always waiting for somebody to make it right make they they never can make it right they can never take it away they can never undo it so why don't we just cut them free and let them go and take this hurt to the one person who can actually take it away we're looking to the wrong place to get healing we're looking to the wrong place to get better we're looking to the wrong thing to come out of where we're at we need to we need to come back to forgiving the way Christ forgave us for setting people free for bearing the consequences for their actions and letting them go and then going to the one who's got the bomb of Gilead who promised to set at Liberty those were bruised and go to him and say God would you heal my broken heart I did what you asked me to do would you come and heal me Lord and I don't believe he'll tell you no but I believe he'll heal your heart and let's all stand together let's not be ignorant of his devices offenses must needs be praise God have you been offended lately perfect that's according to prophecy have you been hurt has somebody done you wrong wonderful now the words of Jesus are being fulfilled in your lives now the question is will the rest of the scriptures be made manifest and I believe the answer to that is yes Lord amen let's sing that song Blake he has forgiven me he has will he has forgiv me my sins are all washed from his me by the blood of the Lamb of he has for me sing it again he has for my sins are washed from his M by the blood of the Lamb of he [Music] has for will he has for me my sins are was from his meory by the blood of the Lamb of [Music] he has [Music] for amen let's all bow our heads together just want to ask you if you know that there's a wound in your heart that you've been holding on to because you've holding somebody in guilt you're holding them condemned for what they did to you I want to ask you if you'd like to let them go today if you would like to set them free if you'd like to cut the chains that bind your heart to them it's the only way that you can be free is if you first set them free amen I want to ask you too are you willing to pay the price are you still expecting somebody else to make it right are you willing today to let the guilty go the same way Jesus let you Goen are you willing to let them go before they ask are you willing to pay the price they can't pay are you willing to bear the consequences for their actions and let them go completely free not even judged by God that you're going to ask God to forgive them on behalf of you for your sake can you forgive from the heart can you ask God to help you let them go completely free can you see maybe they suffer too May maybe things haven't been so easy for them either can you have compassion even on the one who's hurt you even on the guilty if you want to let them free I believe God will come and pour out his spirit and help you from your heart to let them go free for that's what he's commanded in his word that's what his desire is for his children and I believe with all my heart in this atmosphere he'll help you today if you can just lift before him your hands and say God I want to set them free I don't want to hold them in contempt anymore I want to forgive the way you forgave me I I want them to go free like you made me go free and I don't hold them accountable and I'm not asking you to judge them I want you to let them go free too oh I believe that's what he wants from us that's adoption that's maturity that's the life of Christ can you touch that pain again in your heart can you go back to the place where you were wounded can you go back to the most hurtful event in your life and feel the pain the way Jesus felt it at Calvary with the piercings in his wrist with the piercings in his feet with the stripes on his back with the Thorns pressed into his brow with his eyes seeing the mocking and the scourging in the moment of pain he said father forgive them can you go back to the most painful incident in your life Can you feel it can it feel sharp and hurtful can it bring tears to your eyes and at that moment can you say father forgive them they don't know what they're doing to me can you let them go free can you set the captives free can you be like your father can you be a child of God displaying the character of God I believe he'll help you if you come with an honest heart and you desire maybe you heard things differently today like you never heard them before maybe your understanding of forgiveness is different than what it was I encourage you to act upon it act upon it immediately that's God allow you to forgive from your heart and may God take all root of bitterness out of your heart and pour the bomb of Gilead in and heal your broken wounded spirit and may you go free may your relationships be better may your outlook be better May the freedom in
