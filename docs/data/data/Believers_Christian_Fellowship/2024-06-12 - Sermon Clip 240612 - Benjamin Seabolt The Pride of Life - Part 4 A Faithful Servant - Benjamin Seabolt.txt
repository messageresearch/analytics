========================================

I do not want to be part of something man has built not position not program not church not even manifestations nothing carnal nothing spiritual if man has built it I don't want any part of it I don't even care what position I would have in it maybe I'm number one maybe I'm number two maybe I'm number three if man has built it I'm out I don't want anything to do with it but if God is doing it if God has built it I would count it a privilege to be number 400 out of 400 and you know what's really really powerful about position 400 is if God has put me in position 400 I will never be position 401 and I don't have to worry about what number 401 is doing better than me I don't have to worry if number 401 is more spiritual than me I don't have to worry if number 401 has a better Ministry than me he'll never be 400 because God made 400 so now your anxiety can just go away your depression can just go away that's right and you can just rest in the fact knowing I am number 400 amen and God has made me number 400 yes and I just thank God I'm part of the number amen amen and if God has made you part of the number nobody can take you out of the number so now if I see number one or let's move on down to the list if I see number 15 making a mistake falling out of the way not being as spiritual as he should or really just being a bad guy I don't have a problem going to him and trying to encourage him to get back into position number 15 because as a result of that I'm never going to be more than 400 if he falls out of number 15 God will put somebody else in 15 but it's not me I'm 400 I know my position so why don't I try to keep number 15 in his position and if he by chance falls out let's let's prop him back up let's pray for him let's encourage himen let's bring bring back to his memory You're Number 15 I'm using numbers but you can put positions in there whatever whatever example you want to put in there you get the principle amen amen if God has built it it's going to be sure and if God has built it we don't need to circumvent anything God if God has built it let's rest in what God has built
