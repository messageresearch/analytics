========================================

so Joseph now is forgotten and he's still in prison God knew that this man in order to fulfill the vision had to know how to rule and Reign so he started training them in Piper's house you know what he would have picked up in Piper's house potier was an Egyptian the Bible's careful to tell us he was an Egyptian and he was at a captain in the guard do you know what he would have picked up in Piper's house Egyptian culture Egyptian customers Customs Egyptian politics cuz he was in the house of a high-ranking official he would have figured out quickly how things work in Egypt you know what he would have picked up in prison All the gossip from the king's Palace because the the prison he went to was the one where they keep all the king's prisoners so he would have picked up all the political undercurrents oh yeah that was the best training he could have ever had to ascend to the right hand of pharaoh he had seen it on both sides he had heard it from both sides and in both places he was given responsibility as a ruler to rule and Reign and God and be in control of people and God was absolutely working an absolute beautiful plan it was probably more perfect than we could imagine he probably overheard things in that cell and that prison that saved him trouble when he got to the throne I don't know I but can you imagine so God's plan was absolutely perfect amen and God's going to work his plan in us he's going to have a perfect plan and he's going to work it in our lives and he's doing the same same things with us today you have to believe that he's doing the same things with us today he's bringing us in an ordained plan he's bringing us an ordained way because he has a goal in mind he has an objective in mind and he's trying to bring us into Christlike character so why so that we can rule and reign with him and in so doing he's got to put us in places and in situations where we have to learn how to handle situations and we have to hear things and experience things and see things amen that we didn't want to hear and we didn't want to experience and we didn't want to see because we would if we planned Our Lives my life would be so cream puff cake eating sweet as honey every day of my life I would never learn anything if I got to pick I'm glad he doesn't let me pick cuz I mean I'd still be a little baby on the floor Kicking and Screaming every time he didn't answer my prayer immediately I'd be throwing a 2-year-old temper tantrum so God In His abundant goodness and Grace he's got an objective in mind and everything's moving to that objective and faith in that is what gives us the right attitude in the midst of Trials
