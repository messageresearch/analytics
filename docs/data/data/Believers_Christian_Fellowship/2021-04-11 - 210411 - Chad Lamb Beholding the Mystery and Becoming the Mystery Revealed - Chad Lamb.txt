opportunity yesterday to call and talk to sister kathy and unless god works a miracle they don't expect brother joe to come out of this brother joe's lived a long life and angie and i had a privilege just a couple weeks ago maybe two or three weeks ago to go visit them and it was a really wonderful visit brother joe was feeling good and we got to visit with him but he told us then he goes i'm ready to go and so if the lord desires to take him home then we don't want to hold him here but if it's not his time and this is just the enemy then the enemy can't prevail so we just want to remember sister kathy at this time that the lord gives her strength and that god has his way but he brings a lot of peace and comfort and if it's time for deliverance he brings the deliverance either physically in his body or deliverance to escape his body either way for our brother that he might be free amen let's just uh bow our heads and ask the lord's blessing over sister kathy in the reading of the word and then we'll read our scripture dear lord jesus we thank you god for the privilege of gathering together again and lord may we never take this for granted well it's such a privilege lord not just to be able to come lord into this place that's consecrated and dedicated to you lord but also to be here together with one another that we might put our licks of fire together and we might lord worship together in unity and harmony and love god this is a privilege lord and may we never take it for granted but it mean may it mean something to us every time we can gather and lord as we look to you we are asking you to feed us as your sheep lord as we're gathering here lord we know that sister kathy is there with brother joe and lord as far as the doctors can see lord there's no there's no way there's no hope but lord you're our hope lord you're more than able to raise him up if that be your plan but god if you're calling our brother joe home may go home in peace with no struggle with no pain god either way may you deliver him from the condition he's in now by raising him up or taking him home and god would you be with our sister kathy and their children strengthen them lord comfort them be a very present help in a time of trouble may cathy find herself lord enveloped in your love may she find herself undergird by your strength and may she know that something supernatural is taking place all around her and god today as we look to your word as your children we're here to feed from your hand lord as you're the great shepherd we pray god that you would break the bread and that you would give us lord of your own hand the portion that we have need of in this day and may the lord you open our eyes and may we see you more clearly than ever before may you rub the eye salve fresh in our eyes and may our eyes be opened may our hearts be opened lord may we see you as you are may you draw us up higher from the carnal things of this life into the spiritual realities that are all around us well we love you we give you preeminence and that's that you take your place in the service in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can all have your seats i mean let's look at ephesians chapter three and i'll give you my title but i'm not going to go directly into it there's a there's some things i want to say as i move forward but for a title i'd like to talk about beholding the mystery and becoming the mystery revealed beholding the mystery and becoming the mystery revealed and i would like to start reading here in ephesians chapter 3 verse 2. i'm just going to take my time this morning and lay down this foundation these principles but as we read in verse 2 it says if you have if you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of god which has given me to you word how that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery as i wrote a four in a few words whereby when you read you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of christ which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men as it is now revealed unto us holy unto his holy apostles and prophets by the spirit so paul was saying that a dispensation has been given to him a dispensation of the grace of god to give out to us to give to you word amen and how this is the mystery of god which that mystery is known in christ and it wasn't known in previous ages as it was now made known unto the holy apostles and prophets and i say we live in a day like the apostle paul is talking about we live in a day where the mystery of god has been dispensed amen through a dispenser like paul was a dispenser of the mystery but there's been a prophet in our day brother branham who is a dispenser of the mystery amen and he's looking back and he he's been given the revelation the amen of the seals the revelation of the mystery of god and and he's been able to look back and be a dispenser of that mystery but the dispensation was given to him to us word it wasn't just given to him for him amen the dispensation of the grace of god and of the truth was not given to paul for paul it was given to paul for us word and the dispensation of the mystery of grace amen in the mystery of christ was not given to brother venom for brother branham it was given to brother brennan for us and so now we know what the dispensation of this mystery is here for it's for us and there was a purpose it was given to us and that's what i want to speak on a little bit we've talked about it many times in many different ways but i'd like to speak on it again because it's not in vain that this mystery is revealed that when paul was given this dispensation of grace and he was given the mystery that was in christ that was contained all through the old testament but had been missed it had been missed had been missed and then christ had come and man it made been made manifest and it was god in flesh and he was here to pay the price of redemption so his elect could go free and when paul would pick up that dispensation and he would go back down through the scriptures and show how this is exactly what god was talking about this is exactly what the prophets were speaking of amen he was what paul was not doing is paul was not amen he was not building intellectualism or teaching knowledge so that there would be a gaining of knowledge because the gaining of knowledge was not going to do anything amen but the revelation of the mystery was going to change people's lives and so the the mystery in our day that's been given out to us was not for an accumulation of knowledge for knowledge sake it wasn't to say that i know what happened in the garden of eden now i know about the godhead and i know better than another church knows and i know better than rest of christian who knows that wasn't the purpose of the dispensation of the mystery in this day but the mystery came to us to change our lives just like it did in paul's day paul brought the mystery amen and when the mystery when the mystery when the dispensation the mystery was given out amen in that mystery truth now hit the elect seed amen who had been gentiles who had been given over to heathenism who had been in all manner of sin when that mystery was given to them amen there was something in them that could recognize that as truth amen and when they when that when that when those two pieces came together the dispensation of the mystery the truth that had been hid in previous ages but was now made manifest when that came no if they were stuck in idolatry if they were stuck in false worship whatever they were in amen when that revelation came to them of the mystery of christ and what's the dispensation they're in and the privilege that they have now and the opportunity that's come to them quickly amen something sprung to life they came to it and it changed their entire life it didn't make them a scholar it made them sons man they didn't know they were sons they thought it was for jews now they found out that it was for gentiles that this dispensation now the mystery was that it was for the gentiles also and that he was going to call a people out of the gentiles for his namesake and we found out later that they called a people out of the gentiles for his namesake to be his bride amen but they didn't realize that in that day they thought it was only to the jews and now the dispensation of grace was coming to the gentiles so that he could call a people out for his namesake and when that truth came they didn't sit back and say now i see it it's so plain when they saw it it was more than just i i understand something i've got another bit of knowledge amen i have another a bit of trivia where i can pass a test or impress somebody with my knowledge but the revelation actually changed who they were it actually changed their conduct their attitude it actually quickened them to life amen the spirit came in and began to indwell them and changed everything about them that was the purpose of the mystery let's turn to second corinthians i really don't want to get ahead of myself i really want to lay this foundation second corinthians chapter 3. and i want to spend quite a bit of time in second corinthians chapter three and i'll begin at verse two by the time we're done we may have gotten the whole rest of the chapter second corinthians chapter three verse two apostle paul says ye are our epistles written in our hearts known and read of all men for as much as you are manifestly declared to be the epistle of christ ministered by us written not with ink but with the spirit of the living god not in tables of stone but in fleshly tables of the heart i want to pause here and pay attention to this because when the when the dispensation of grace and the and the dispensation of the mystery came to the apostle paul he did not go back like moses and go right another table of stones amen that was a dispensation in that day and that dispensation had a purpose amen but now he's in another dispensation and he's given he's giving out the word of god just like moses was giving out the word of god but in the previous dispensation it was written on tables of stone amen but in this dispensation it's not to be written on tables of stone this mystery this word that is coming forth from god through his prophet in paul's day is not going to be administered amen and distributed the same way that it was in moses's day because in moses's day he was given two tables of stone but in paul's day and then moses also was told to write a book of ordinances and moses got the commandments of god and he wrote a book of ordinances ordinances so he had two tables of stone with the ten commandments and he had a book of ordinances and the apostle paul came along and he says now amen he says now you are the epistles now it's not tables of stone but written in the fleshly tables of the heart amen now it is not to bring forth a new testament as far as another table and another book of ordinances but now it's time to bring forth the living word living in you paul's showing this is a change over the previous dispensation so let's read that again ye are our epistles written in our heart known and read of all men what he's referring to here is now he's saying that that that well let's pick it up in verse one just so you can see do we begin again to commend ourselves somebody was questioning paul and paul's authority and paul's credentials or need we as some others epistles of commendation to you are letters of commendation from you paul's now paul's authority is being questioned somehow some way and paul is saying do we need a letter of accommodation to you or do we need a a letter of accommodation from you ye are our epistles written in our hearts you are our letter of commendation your life in the gospel is that was paul's credentials paul was looking at you and saying you've been transformed you were a heathen you were packing idols i mean you were worshiping devils amen but now you are the evidence you are the epistle amen you are our commendation because it's not it's it's not about a new doctrine it's not about a new church order it's not about the pharisees for the pharisees and the sadducees for the sadduce it's all different now paul is saying i am i'm not looking for a letter of commendation i'm not working for anybody i'm working for god amen you are our epistles written in our hearts you're the evidence that he was a an apostle er epistles written in our hearts known and read of all men and then he goes on to say for as much as you are you are manifestly declared to be the epistle of christ or the letter of christ ministered by us written not with ink but with the spirit of the living god not in tables of stone but in the fleshly tables of the heart and such trust have we through christ to godward not that we are sufficient in ourselves to think anything as of ourselves but our sufficiency is of god i want to see here i want to read down a few more verses who also have made us able ministers of the new testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life now he's saying the same thing who is also made as able ministers of the new testament not of the letter we are not going back to a book of ordinances this is not going back the old testament we had i mean the law we had a book of ordinances we had tables of stone we had all of that and now i'm not coming in this new testament to give you another book of ordinances not the letter this new testament is not for the letter this new testament is the spirit amen it's actually the life of the word it's not just the written word but now it's the life of the word that's being ministered it's a change in dispensation it's a total change it's a total new way of thinking amen for those who are raised as jews amen because you know god when he brought them out to sinai he delivered them from egypt with a mighty hand he actually brought them to sinai to be engaged to them amen and to be married and they accepted the terms of the engagement and now god was going to take them as a bride but when he come down to speak to them on the mountain they ran away from him they ran they were supposed to come up into the mountain but they ran far from the mountain and they told moses amen don't don't let god speak to us anymore unless we die but you go to him amen now they're calling for somebody to go between and that's not what god wanted god wanted a personal relationship but but it had to be this way amen and so now they said you go and whatever he tells you will do it and brother branham said this is where they made their fatal mistake amen they wanted a law they wanted something they could do when god had him under a grace covenant because abraham was under a grace covenant not a law covenant adam was under a law covenant if you do i will amen if you do this then this will happen but when it come to abraham amen so that god could secure it he could not make it based off merit because now by the fall no man had the merit to live all the law so he couldn't make it by law he knew it failed so he made it by grace knowing that his grace can't fail and so they were under a grace covenant amen and under a grace covenant they would god sent him a prophet god delivered them out of egypt god fed him on the way amen god parted the red sea all by grace by grace by grace by grace and by grace he was going to come and speak to him with his voice he was going to show his power and his glory amen but they could not endure that which was commanded they could not come to him amen so they ran afar off and they refused the commandment and they told moses you go get the instructions and you come back with the instructions and we'll keep the instructions and god god complied to their request because it it fit his desire to reveal himself amen and so now he come down first the ten commandments were spoken on the mountaintop they were not written in stone they were spoken and this was god was going to give them the commandments and add nothing else to it this is all he wanted to come into a covenant with his people but they ran away and they wanted moses to go get the the commandments and go get the instructions and then they would do all the instructions so when he goes up now now what was the god spoken word spoken directly to his people now was engraved in stone become firm become hard become unflexible and now they moved from a dispensation of grace to a dispensation of law and now god gave him the request he was going to now give them instructions through a prophet and that prophet will give the instructions and they said that they would keep all the instructions but the problem was they were never able to keep all the instructions they moved from grace to law for something that they could do only they couldn't do it now the apostle paul is coming and he's administering the new testament but not the letter because it was the letter that killeth amen because the latter amen paul says i i had not known sin but by the law amen because the law made sin exceedingly more sinful because once god said this is wrong and you find inside of you amen the inability to keep from doing that amen all of a sudden what was sin in you becomes exceedingly sinful and you don't even know it is sin amen until the law recognizes it as sin and then you cannot escape from it so the letter killeth the law became condemnation because they moved from grace to law so now in the new testament the apostle paul is not bringing them another letter but in the new testament it's a dispensational change but now he doesn't minister the new testament in the letter he ministers the new testament in the spirit because this is the only way to overcome i'll read verse six again who also has made us able ministers of the new testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life but if the ministration of death written and engraved in stones was glorious so that the children of israel could not steadfastly behold the face of moses for the glory of his countenance which glory was to be done away how shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious for if the ministration of the condemnation be glory much more did the ministration of righteousness exceed exceeding glory for even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect by reason of the glory that excelleth for if that which is done away was glorious much more that which remaineth is glorious so now he's showing he says now there was a glory to the law but there was a glory to that which brought death so much glory that when moses came down with the word his face shown that they could not endure the glory of his countenance and he had to veil his face amen and unveiling his face amen he was hiding from them the glory of god they could not endure but now paul's saying now if that was glorious and that was the ministration of death amen that was unto condemnation and that would be done away or fulfilled or completed in christ amen now that which is in righteousness which is in christ will be more glorious still yet that's what paul's saying so now we see a dispensational change moving from the letter to the spirit this is the new testament now let's go to ephesians back to ephesians and go to ephesians chapter 2. they said i'm just laying in a little bit of groundwork here so be patient we'll do a little bible study to get started ephesians chapter 2 verse and you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins wherein in times past you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit thou now worketh in the children of disobedience among whom also we all had our conversation in time past in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desire of the flesh and of the mind and we're by nature the children of wrath even as others now if we stop right here if the apostle paul had just brought them another letter of the law amen all he would have done to the gentiles is kill them because this is the condition that the gentiles were in they were trapped in the flesh trapped in the lusts of the flesh they were stuck in this position and if all paul did was minister the new testament with another letter amen superseding the the letter the law the commandments the book of ordinances of moses with a new book of ordinances amen they would they would be stuck in the same situation the jews were stuck in but this is a different dispensation he ministered the spirit now let's read verse three again among whom also we all had our conversation in times past and the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desire of the flesh and of the mind and we're by nature the children of wrath even as others but god who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead and sins hath quickened us together with christ by grace ye are saved and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace and his kindness toward us through christ for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god not of works lest any man should boast so now we come to this he's telling us now that that you all had your conversations in these evil things in times past but when we were dead in sins when you were dead in sins not knowing god not free from sin when you were dead in sins amen let's read this again verse 5 when we were dead and sins hath quickened us together with christ by grace you are saved and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus so now he's bringing to them something different than he brought that moses brought in the law and the ordinances because the people asked for the instructions they got instructions now if they could keep all the instructions they could approach back to god but now he's coming with not the letter he's coming with the spirit but he's giving them a revelation of a mystery he's saying when when christ raised up you raised with him and now ye are seated he hath past tense and now we are seated he hath raised up you are now seated in heavenly places in christ jesus amen so now all of a sudden he took it away from all the ordinances and keeping this and achieving trying to achieve yourselves back to god and now he goes right back to christ which is god's achievement and shows us that our position is already achieved and with our position already achieved amen now we're not trying to get to a certain place he's showing us that in christ we already arrived amen so all we have to do to be benefactors of this position amen is to get in christ and how do you get in christ by one spirit we are all baptized into one body by holy ghost baptism now we are in christ if you're in christ now you're the benefactor of your position which you already had when he died and when he raised and when he ascended on high you already went a total different way of thinking friends he comes with something totally contrary amen to what they asked for they got what they wanted but once they were stuck and what they asked for they found out it was it was it was a it was a carousel to nowhere amen it was an escalator that you never could climb fast enough because man couldn't overcome his own fallen nature he couldn't conquer himself he could not fulfill all the law so god came himself as his son and god fulfilled his own law see god is always just and when you understand the scriptures you understand the nature of god god is always just amen god now he says he's required the law now he can't just wipe it off because he's already established it so what he must do is he must come down and flash but it's got to be virgin born it can't be hybrid anymore amen it's got to be a virgin birth and by that virgin birth he would live his own life through that man and fulfill all his law and when he fulfilled all his law he would prove that now he is a pure spotless clean lamb and that one who had the first one who climbed the escalator the first one who kept the commandments pleased only the father did all that he had commanded the first one now could become the substitutionary offering for everyone else he fulfilled all the law and he took my place so that i could by grace take his he became the substitutionary lamb the lamb of god that would keep the word of god that would keep the law of god that would fulfill the law and die in my place and free me from the bondage that's in the law not that there's anything wrong with the law paul says the law was perfect there was nothing wrong with the law the problem wasn't the law the problem is me so christ fulfilled the law to break me free from the bondage of the law so that now he could cleanse me by his blood redeem me to the father and fill me with his own life and now it's not me that liveth but christ that liveth in me and so now we were we were stuck in this and we're stuck in that but when he raised him up you were raised with him and all of a sudden now the the treadmill religion the the trying to overcome and and it all comes crumbling down and we realize i'm already seated in heavenly places in christ jesus i've already been raised up with him i've already been quickened i've already been raised up i'm already seated in heaven my position is secure and what happens is all of a sudden there's a freedom of liberty that comes the spirit comes and then we can live a life that we've never lived before let's go to matthew 26 i'm still laying a foundation so bear with me matthew 26 these things are very familiar to many of us but it's so good to have these things in our understanding as we move forward have it fresh matthew 26 and 26 we're at the last supper the lord is eating with his disciples verse 26 he says as they were eating jesus took bread and blessed it and break it and gave it to the disciples and said take eat this is my body and he took the cup and he gave thanks and gave it to them saying drink ye all of it for this is my blood of the new testament which is shed for many for the remission of sins now let's go over to hebrews 9. read one more scripture while we're here hebrews 9 and verse 15. hebrews 9 15 and for this cause he's the mediator of the new testament that by means of death for the for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance so by means of his death what did he die for for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament did you have transgressions under the first testament yes lots of them but he died for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament so that we could be freed and so that that law could be fulfilled so that we can move on to the dispensation of grace that's what jesus died for now let's go to romans 8. romans 8 and verse 1. there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in christ jesus no condemnation no judgment there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus had made us free from the law of sin and death for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh god sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit for to be carnally minded as death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace because the carnal mind is enmity against god for it is not subject to the law of god neither indeed can be so then they that are in the flesh cannot please god but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of god dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit of christ he is none of his so now to be free from the law of sin and death you must be free from carnality you must be free from the flesh now how are you free from the flesh when you still live in the flesh because when you're in the spirit you're free from the flesh because before your new birth came amen you did what the flesh wanted to do you were subject to the desire of the flesh you were subject to the will the will of the flesh and the lustful desires of the flesh but once the new birth came and the spirit came in there came a power that will conquer this flesh even though you're in the flesh you're not of the flesh you can be in the flesh and of the spirit because you're now in the spirits and it's the spirit that gives us power over this flesh amen that's why without the indwelling of the spirit amen without the new testament which is a new covenant without the new covenant of life coming in what life god's life the life that was in christ coming into us without that we could never live free because we could never overcome because not it was not that the law was weak but my flesh made it weak i could never overcome myself amen but god had done something so that he can open a channel up so that he can doubt impart his own life into us and now his life in us can conquer this flesh praise be to god and now by the revelation we're no longer carnally minded but spiritually minded not living to the lust of the flesh verse 9 again but you are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of god dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit of christ he is none of his and if christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness you now are living in a body how many of you are living in a body it's a body of flesh is that right it has a spirit is that right but if you have been made alive in christ jesus then your flesh is dead dad what do you mean and dead dead in the fact that it does not control me there is another life that controls me before amen the spirit well the flesh was alive amen the flesh was very much alive and it was very much in control amen but by the new birth and the indwelling of the spirit i reckon therefore my body now dead and lived by the spirit so i'm living in a dead body i hope you're living in a dead body and we'll understand more as we go let's just keep reading we're standing if christ being you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness but of the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you therefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh for if you lived after the flesh you shall die but if you through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body ye shall live this word mortify i just look at the reference in my bible in the center column of my bible it says to make to die the doings of the body if you mortify the deeds of the body if you make to die the doings of the body so it so let's read that again but if you threw the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body you shall live so it's the spirit that tells you no your body says yes but through the spirit you do mortify the deeds of the body you kill it when the body raises up and says look here taste that take that touch this and the spirit raises up and mortifies the deeds of the body and says no way amen this i'm a redeemed vessel i've been given to the lord i'm not going to go that way i don't want to go that way there's so much confusion sometimes in the new birth amen because god takes away the desire for sin but we still live in a flesh body and brother brahm said you have a sticky culkerberg nature then it's going to be tempted the body can be tempted amen so you have to reckon it dead and not you just the tabernacle that you dwell in and you're alive by the spirit you're alive in christ and now through the spirit you must mortify the deeds of the body for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father the spirit itself bears witness with our spirit that we are the children of god this new covenant did not bring us back into bondage of fear afraid that we would be lost afraid that we'd be cut out afraid we wouldn't be good enough afraid we wouldn't measure up but it's brought us in the spirit in our spirit that agrees with our spirit and that's deep within us that calls out abba father i realize i have a father i'm not trying to get a father i have a father i'm not trying to become a son i've always been a son to different dispensation a different way of thinking let's go to john 16. john 16 and verse 5 but now i go my way to him that sent me and none of you asketh me whether goest thou but because i have said these things and to you sorrow hath filled your heart nevertheless i tell you the truth it is expedient for you that i go away for if i go not away the comforter will not come unto you but if i depart i will send him unto you so now you know no doubt the disciples are just men like you and i and when jesus said that he's going to go away all of a sudden you know they're going to feel that separation they begin to sorrow no man even asked him uh they mean sorrow began to fill their heart he said nevertheless i tell you the truth it is expedient for you it's good for you that i go away they're thinking it is a bad thing when jesus would leave because they were under the dispensation of god with us amen they had come from the dispensation of god above us and we know brother brahm told us that it's god above us god with us emmanuel and god in us they were with they were in god above us amen and we talked about this last sunday at communion but and god above us god became a father he became a law giver amen and the ordinances came out and he became a shepherd over a flock and all of these things but but in god above us amen he had to move deeper and now become god with us for the purpose of redemption amen and to reflect and display the very life of god jesus was the reflection of the father jesus was the manifestation of god and so now they're in the dispensation of god with us and i tell you who doesn't want to have god right there next to you amen who doesn't want to be in a boat with god who doesn't want to be eating a meal with god who doesn't want to be across the table with god god emmanuel was with them they wanted to be there but jesus is telling them i'm getting ready to leave you god with you is getting ready to go amen and no doubt they're feeling remorseful we can't do this without you don't go away don't leave us we love this dispensation amen but he's saying it's expedient for you that i go away because if i don't go away i cannot send the comforter to you amen and you cannot come into the dispensation of god in you because the mystery of god could never be completed amen with god above us so the further the mystery what is christ the mystery of god revealed when god was going to reveal himself now he had to come as god with us and god with us was a further declaration of god manifesting god as the son and the and the son was portraying god he was displaying god i mean he he was the very manifestation of god and flesh and that was god with us what was god doing he was revealing the mystery and that part of the mystery was wonderful amen god with you touched you and you were healed and god with you amen broke the bread and god with you amen cursed the storm and god with you helped you walk on water and god with you was a wonderful dispensation amen but that wasn't the last part of the mystery to be revealed there was more mystery to be revealed that could not be revealed under the dispensation of god with you amen there had to come another dispensation for the further revealing of god and so he says jesus is telling them you're sorrowing because i say i go away but you don't know it's the very thing you need amen i'm going away amen but i won't leave you comfortless i will come to you you're not going to be on your own amen you've never had the power to overcome amen now you see a man of flesh who's completely overcome the flesh and overcome the devil and completely fulfilled the law and now you see it and it's amazing amen but i'm telling you jesus said i'm telling you there's something good for you that's comforting something that's expedient for you you need me to go away you don't any longer need god with you what you need for the further revelation of this mystery is god in you because the god that's in you was the one who walked on water was the one who broke the bread was the one who cursed the storm who was the one who kept the word of god amen was the one who brought every demon subject to the word now that's not going to be with you because you could get separated from that over some distance but now that same god is going to be in you to bring the further manifestation of his his mystery revealed we couldn't do it under any other dispensation peter could not overcome peter and the dispensation of god with us because in the dispensation of god with us peter's selfishness rose up and his self-desire rose up when he began to rebuke jesus when jesus says you know i'm going to jerusalem and be evilly mistreated and they're killed and raised again on the third day and peter took him he said far be it from thee and begin to rebuke the lord and the lord said get thee behind me satan see peter could not overcome peter judas could not overcome judas and the dispensation of god with us the disciples began infighting amongst himself on who was going to be the greatest in the kingdom you never hear of them doing that after the dispensation of god in you in the dispensation of god with us amen it could portray god in the form of son amen but his son has to have a bride to finish the masterpiece and that bride amen has to have his same life his same nature same character she has to be a reflection of him just as christ was a reflection of god the bride has to be the reflection of christ and the only way to do it was for him to go away and into going away he was crucified and paid the price he fulfilled all the law and became the substitution so that he could cleanse us by his own blood and purify our vessels by purchasing paying at the redemptive price for all the transgressions that were under the law and purifying us from all those transgressions under the law so that he could justly step into this tabernacle and live his own life in us paul was a minister of the new testament but not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life brother brahm says in the message the unveiling of god said and that's god he changed himself from pillar of fire to become a man then he changed himself from that back in the spirit again that he might dwell in man god acting in man what he really was jesus christ was god acting in man in a man and man that's what he was he had changed from the pillar of fire and then had come in which was a veil in the wilderness that hid god from israel moses seen the shape of his body but really he was hid all the time behind this pillar of fire which was the logos that that went out from god now we find that here's now since pentecost god not acting in a man not acting in man now he's acting through man he was acting in a man then then jesus now he is acting through man that he has chosen for this purpose god in the form of man he changed himself from the form of god to a form of man further down a couple paragraphs down he says now when it said here that he emptied himself or poured out now we would think like this that he vomited up the english would have emptied or poured out from him see something went out of him that was different from him so like poured out if you take a glass and brother members explain the actual language if you take a glass and you pour out something something leaves something and you have two different things if i take a glass of water and i pour the water out of the glass of water well i had water and i had a glass and i still have the glass in the water somewhere else but brother bram saying that's not this term he said you could vomit up or the english word emptied out or poured out from him see something went out of him that was different from him but the word kinos in the greek does not mean that he vomit up or his arm went off or his eye went out another person that is he changed himself he poured himself into so god he didn't he didn't just pour himself out and then what came out of him was now sever them he poured himself into another form he changed himself he poured himself into a man into another mask into another form not another person went out of him called the holy spirit but it was he himself you get it he himself poured himself into the people christ in you not something separate but it's him amen now in the new covenant in the new testament we look at old testament new testament but it's an old covenant with the people under the law amen but there's a new covenant with the people and it's a covenant of grace based on faith and not out of yourself it is a gift of god and under this grace dispensation now he comes to dwell inside it's a dispensation of the spirit how beautiful how wonderful to think god pouring himself into the human being into the believer pour out it was part of his drama to do so god all the fullness of the godhead bodily was in this person jesus christ he was god and god alone not a third person or a second person or a first person but the person god failed in human flesh that was my foundation now let's go back to second corinthians for some reason i had to lay that down and i don't even know why but praise be to god we laid it down second corinthians chapter three i'm going to pick up where we left off now in verse 12. and i want to get down to the text that i that i used for this title and which i the title was beholding the mystery and becoming the mystery revealed verse 12 for second corinthians 3 and 12 seeing then that we have such hope we use great plainness of speech and not as moses which which put a veil over his face that the children of israel could not steadfastly look to the end of that which is abolished but their minds were blinded for until this day remain at the same veil untaken away in the reading of the old testament which veil is done away in christ but even unto this day when moses is read the veil is upon their heart nevertheless when it shall be turned to the lord the veil shall be taken away now the lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty or freedom freedom not bondage but freedom now the lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty but we all with open face behold is in a glass now open face he's just referred back to the veil now remember moses when moses had the word i mean he was so bright that they could not endure his brightness so he put a veil over his face and that veil obscured the brightness or the glory from the people and then now paul says but now this veil is on their mind and now when the when moses is read the veil is upon their heart he said but we with open face what he's saying is is we didn't open our face he's saying we have no veil there's nothing to separate us from seeing the glory of god which is now not hidden behind the veil amen the veil is taken away in christ amen now there is no veil the veil the glory the truth the full light of the gospel there's no veil to veil it away from us now we all with open face beholding as in a glass is where glass is mirror now we all with open face beholding is in the glass the glory of the lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the lord now this is a tremendous statement because we with open face now the veil is taken away in christ so when in christ when the veil is taken off the heart and we with open face are now to behold as in a glass the glory of the lord amen it says we are changed into the same image so now when the veil is taken away in christ what what takes away the veil the revelation now when the veil is taken away we with an open face behold is in the glass are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the lord so the veil must be taken away so that we can see clearly this image and what we see clearly we are changed by what we see after the veil is taken away now in the message it is the rising of the sun brother bam says now the very essence of the message that was sent that he has risen from the dead we his beneficiaries we who share the resurrection with him draw benefits from this by proving to the world that he is alive we cannot do it by word only we cannot do it by some tradition of man we only reflect exactly what we're pointing to so you can only reflect what you're pointing to and the veil has to be taken away to see what we're pointing to i'm afraid today that too many of us are not getting people to christ we're getting them to church to a theory but we must get them to christ he is the only one and the only one that has life he that has the son has life let's go to first corinthians chapter 2. first corinthians chapter 2 and verse 6 how be it we speak wisdom among them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of this world nor the prince of this world that come to not but we speak the wisdom of god in a mystery so paul was speaking the wisdom of god in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which god ordained before the world unto our glory which none of the princes of this world knew for had they known it they would not have crucified the lord of glory but as it is written i have not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which god has prepared for them that love him but god has revealed them to us by his spirit for the spirit searches all things yea the deep things of god i always want to point out here that the spirit searches out the deep things of god there are deep things of god but the spirit searches out the deep things of god so we should never be afraid of the deep things of god because that's part of the manifestation of the spirit to search out the deep things of god for what a man knoweth what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of a man which is in him even so the things of god knoweth no man but the spirit of god now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of god which things also we speak not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth but which the holy ghost teacheth comparing spiritual things with spiritual but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of god for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned so now now paul's saying i'm speaking the wisdom of god in a mystery not the wisdom of the world or even wisdom that the world will understand because the world cannot understand this because no man can understand it without the spirit no the spirit of a man understands the things of man but only the spirit of god will understand or comprehend the things that be of god so these things that paul's speaking he's not speaking natural things as of carnal but he's speaking things that are that the spiritual things comparing spiritual with spiritual amen so that now they that these things that will be known their foolishness to the world because they're not carnally understood so you see it can never be textbook friends because it cannot be carnally comprehended it's paul did not come down to set something up new so that they can start a new school and then the new school can start a debate just like they did with moses's law but now he's bringing something that can only be discerned because he's preaching in a mystery form and the mystery form can only be revealed by the spirit you have to god god has given the word in a mystery god has known it a mystery there is a mystery of god and only the deep things of god can be known by the spirit of god so paul is preaching the gospel in a mystery he's not bringing a letter he's bringing the spirit amen because he's bringing in a mystery and the only ones that will know what paul was actually preaching are those who get the spirit because they are spiritually discerned now i hope you have your spiritual jacket on because brother branham brought us right back to paul's teaching and brother bannon brought us to the mystery of god amen because the seventh angel was going to reveal the mystery of god amen but he was not going to do it in a way that was intellectual that would start a textbook and start a debate because the mystery of god is only known by the spirit of god and he's not teaching in ways that carnal minds will comprehend he's teaching it comparing spiritual things with spiritual so how does he begin teaching the sin the mystery of god revealed in the seventh seal he has to compare spiritual things with spiritual so he goes back and he begins to show you god's original creation in the garden of eden god made a man and out of a man came a woman and then he united the two together and then god went and took his rest so what's the seventh seal it's not carnally comprehended friends it's he's comparing spiritual things with spiritual things so that the spiritual mind will pick it up because you can he speaks plainly he speaks openly he speaks boldly amen he's not speaking in code he's not speaking another language he's speaking plain english but he's preaching it in a mystery he's preaching the mystery in a mystery that cannot be carnally pieced together the more we carnally piece it together the more weird stuff we're going to come up with but it's spiritually discerned and we're in the dispensation of the spirit where where jesus himself said it's good for you that i go away it's good for you that i go away because you need the comforter you need the holy ghost you need the teacher that'll teach you all things that i have said this is the dispensation that we're under that's why the message cannot be understood without the spirit paul's message could not be understood without the spirit he says to man it's foolishness because it can't be comprehended by carnal mind it's only by spiritual discernment so even paul's message was foolishness to the carnal mind paul's message could only be understood by the spirits that's why there's so many denominations and every seminary has failed because they tried amen they tried to explain it through wisdom and reasoning and knowledge and understanding and in doing so they would divide and divide and divide and divide and have so many different kinds of understanding that is some confusion because they're trying to intellect the knowledge amen to understand what paul taught amen and you can't understand what paul taught and without the spirit of god [Music] and we cannot understand what brother branham taught without the spirit of god let's move on in the revelation of jesus christ from the church age book brother man said oh how we need revelation by the spirit we don't need a new bible we don't need a new translation though some are very good and i'm not against them but we need the revelation of the spirit and thank god we can have what we need for god wants to reveal his word to us by his spirit may god begin by a spirit to give us continuous listen closely may god by his spirit by his spirit may god begin by his spirit to give us continuous life-giving and prevailing revelation life-giving you see when people begin you know sometimes you'll you'll see people who will chastise individuals who who feed off the revelation of christ and who ser by the spirit search out the deep things of god and and they say oh you know it's always got to be a revelation it's always got to be mystery it's always got to be this but brother brenham said the revelation of the mystery is life-giving it actually gives life to the seed it actually gives life to the to the god that's on the inside to the attribute of god what gives life to that the revelation by the spirit is life-giving friends you know you know some people want to simplify the message and dumb it down all they want to do is do what the baptist did to paul's message and we're not going to do what the baptist did to paul's message to this message of this hour it was preached in a mystery it's revealed by the spirit we're not here to water it down and simplify to where we can get anybody to pass the test abc pick one all right you got a 95 you're a believer it's not that way friends god secured it by revelation god kept it a mystery amen so that it'd be hid from the eyes of the wise and prudent revealed unto the children of god and so we preach a mystery yes it's a mystery it's a deep mystery of god there's the deep things of god but i tell you friends the spirit is here god wants to give revelation of his word god wants to reveal himself god wants in this day to unveil himself he wants to be known by his bride he wants to unveil himself to his bride so what we must do we must pray for continuous life-giving revelation when paul preached the mystery amen and the jews rejected it amen but the gentiles picked it up the jews were more versed the jews were more educated they were more versed in the law and the prophets amen they had more opportunity than they had more scripts they had more access to that even in the proselyte jews which were the gentiles that were innocent the synagogues amen they still weren't born jew they still weren't raised up who knows when they became proselyte jews but they didn't have the advantage and knowledge they didn't have the advantage in education they didn't have the advantage in having it in their original language but when paul would preach the mystery the jews would reject it and then the gentiles would hear him gladly as many as were ordained into eternal life heard him gladly receive the truth amen why because this revelation is life-giving to the seed amen it's life-giving to the attribute and nature of god so paul didn't have to change it paul just preached the mystery so now i want to read this this verse this sentence again may god begin by his spirit to give us continuous life-giving and prevailing revelation that means the revelation is life-giving but the revelation is also prevailing it will prevail everything else in our lives this revelation will prevail our will it will prevail our past it will prevail our education it'll prevail our own thinking it has to be prevailing revelation then he goes on to say oh if the church if the church could only get a fresh revelation become by it the living word manifested who wants to be the living word manifested it'll take a fresh revelation amen not an education but a fresh revelation amen oh if the church could only get a fresh revelation of god and become by it the living word manifested we would do the greater works and glorify god our father in heaven and christ is the mystery of god revealed he says he is the first fruits of the resurrection is that right watch then what is he he is the head of the body which is the church bride then the bride body must follow the head for it is part of his resurrection and part of the mystery what mystery the mystery of christ who is the mystery of god revealed so the bride body must follow the head what is the head the head is christ what is christ the anointed word amen and brother said the anointed word for your day amen so they must follow the head for it is part for it is part of his resurrection whose resurrection his resurrection who's part of his resurrection the bride it's part of whose resurrection his resurrection i thought she'd be part of her resurrection no she's part of his resurrection because brother brahm said the word has been laying dead now for years but it's beginning to rise amen rose through luther rose through wesley roasted pentecost but now she's standing on her feet amen now amen she's part of the resurrection and part of the mystery it's possible it's impossible for it not to go oh my it's part of god's mystery how god revealed himself here and raised it up by the word so he reveals his church and raising it up by the same word it's part of his threefold mystery as the head was took from the grave so must the body follow him back to eden where the head of the family the man the bridegroom the bride being the body of the bridegroom must follow the bride because that's the head and the head is revealed and come back with eternal life and the mod the body must follow that you got that and the head is revealed and come back with eternal life and the body must follow that because it's husband and wife again and as long as you're impregnated with the same word which is his body you've took his body become in him when you took the word not the creed the word oh my this bride body is part of the mystery part of the mystery and the mystery is revealed by the spirit of god and the message is this the sign of the answer i'm going to go through a sequence of of quotes here but is this the sign of the answers when brother branham comes in december of 1962 and he preaches about the vision that he's had of the little birds coming and then the bigger birds and the constellation of angels and he's being called to go out west amen for the revelation of the seven seals and he's coming and he's telling all this he's telling the dreams that happened from the believers he tells the vision and now he's in here and is this the sign of this the answer and he's preaching this before he preached the seals now he's going to go out west he's going to go move his family out west he's going to have the experience somewhere around january of the sword being dropped into his hand which is the sword of the lord which is the word of god placed in his hand and he said it fit my hand just right because the word came to the hand of the prophet amen and then in in i think early march he's going to have this experience with the angels he's going to come back in the mid part of march and he's going to begin preaching the revelation of the seven seals but here he is in december of 1962 before he goes out west he says and the seven thunders right in the revelation here of jesus christ it's some mystery does not the bible say that this this revelation of jesus christ and when you go all the way to the beginning of the book of revelation it begins in verse 1 telling us that this is the revelation of jesus christ so the book of revelations is the revelation of jesus christ amen and brother branham is now taking that and he's saying these seven thunders and he's going all the way over to revelations 10 1-7 in revelations 10 7 thunders uttered their voice and john said i was about to write amen but a voice from heaven said write it not and seal it up and so now brother branham's looking you know he sees the symbols here and the symbols here and interpretations here and symbols here and everything is in symbol form with some of them already being interpreted in the church or in the book of revelation but he gets to these seven thunders but the seven thunders don't have a symbol they don't have any revelation they don't have anything behind them they're sealed up but brother branham knows that this is the revelation of jesus christ the book of revelation is the revelation of jesus christ and the revelation of jesus christ has to be finished to his bride before she can rapture it's got to be finished so he knows that there's something there in those seven thunders there were seven thunders that uttered voices but john was told not to write so there's something laying in those seven thunders that have to be revealed because it's the revelation of jesus christ does not the bible say the revelation of jesus christ why there is some hidden mystery then of it hmm what is it the seven thunders have it for john was just about to write and a voice come down from heaven said don't write it but seal it up seal it up put it on the back side of the book it's got to be revealed it's the mysteries in revelation 10 7 we know what so well says but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel that's this prophet when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished finished so brother branham knows these seven thunders have to be revealed there can't be the mystery of god continue on past the days of the voice of the seventh angel amen he's got to sound this mystery so there has to be a revelation of those seven thunders when they shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets then he comes to the first seal and he's preaching the first jesus says now takes the book of seals and breaks them and shows the seventh angel for this alone the mysteries of god is the ministry of the seventh angel now we just come through the church ages with even history prove that the angel's message of the seven church all right reveals all the mysteries that's been in the past all the things in the past revelation 10 1-7 that's to be so brother i'm saying this is the this is the ministry of the seventh angel is to reveal those hidden mysteries what the seven thunders utter this is the ministry of the seventh angel so those things that john was told not to write up they were revealed they were spoken john heard them they were something there was something to it something was actually said but what was said was sealed up amen but john is told at the end of the book to seal it not amen so there has to come a time that what was sealed is going to have to be unsealed and this is the ministry of the seventh angel further in the first seal he says and then there's coming forth seven mysterious thunders that's not even written at all that's right and i believe that through those seven thunders will be revealed in the last days in order to get the bride together for rapturing faith because what we got right now we wouldn't be able to do it there's something we've got to step farther we can't have enough faith for divine healing hardly we've got to have enough faith to be changed in a moment and be swept out of this earth and we'll find that after a while the lord willing find where it's at the brotherhood is saying there's got to come a revelation there's got to come something that will step us farther and brother branham had preached his ministry all the way up he's in the first seal amen he had tied together the loose sins that was left off to the reformers he had brought back the correct teaching of what paul taught on baptism on serpent seed on godhead and then he restored back church order he'd restored back all of this but he said there's something that's got to come there's a mystery in the bible there's a mystery under the seven thunders there's a mystery of god that's got to be revealed by the seventh angel and he said that's got to come to take us a step further praise god and christ is the mystery of god revealed he says he has showed or revealed in every type that's in the bible if you notice i'm skipping from sergeants that's the time before to the seals and now after the seals he comes and preaches christ is the mystery of god real remember the ministry of the seventh angel is these mysteries and when you go to revelation 10 7 he said in the days of the voice of the seventh angel the mystery of god shall be revealed so there is a mystery of god that has to be revealed so there's mysteries to be revealed plural but there's a mystery also to be revealed and he has to reveal the mysteries before he can reveal the mystery and in revealing the mysteries he will be declaring the mystery amen that's why you can't put this in a textbook you can't sit down in sketches on a diagram of somebody oh i got it now it doesn't come by education friends it comes by the spirit it's a mystery and the mysteries are revealed by the spirit christ is mr god revealed he has showed or revealed it in every type that's in the bible what does he show this great mystery the mystery of god because by the time we get to christ as the mystery of god revealed brother branham's finished revealing the mysteries see the revelation of the seven thunders was revealing amen revealing what the the what the seven seals were what the symbols were of the seven seals because when the seven seals were open in revelation chapter six amen there were six of them opened in revelation chapter six and we saw a white horse rider and a black or a red horse rider black horse rider we saw all these symbology and now brother brenham under the thunders the thunders contain the revelation of what all that was and brother branham goes under the seven thunders and and he begins to reveal all the mysteries but there's a there's a seventh amen there's a seventh mystery there's a seventh seal and when you look at seven seal in revelation chapter eight when the seventh seal was opened there was silence brother bennett said silence nothing was spoken nothing was revealed there was no symbol amen and he said over here in revelation 10 when the seven thunders uttered he was told not to write see silence he said it must be connected together so the seventh seal was silenced no symbols no nothing there were the the the seven thunders that uttered no symbols no nothing there was also silence so these two things go together so under the revealing of the seventh seal amen christ himself will come to open the seals because only the lamb can open the book so under the mystery of the seventh seal amen christ himself will come amen to reveal the mysteries under the seven thunders amen will reveal and tie together the loose sins and reveal all the mysteries and brother branham will go through six seals and in six seals he will go through great explanation the white horse means this it symbolize this this time in history this happened and great details of much information all the way through the six seals but when brother branham gets to the seventh seal brother branham doesn't tell you what the seventh seal is and the same way he told you what this first six seals were because in the first six seals he's revealing the mystery but in the seventh seal he's revealing the mystery because it's the mystery that revealed the mysteries i hope i'm not confusing you just read the message and come listen to this again and just just lay in the presence of the lord and ask god to bring revelation and all the sudden things will begin to click and you say i know what he's talking about now but the mystery was the mystery of god amen in christ as the mystery god revealed and christ himself came amen and that's what that cloud represents when you look at the cloud brother man first saw it as a pyramid of angels a constellation of angels the seven angels amen representing amen the church age is complete now come down but later he was told to take the picture and turn it to the right and when he turned it to the right he saw the face of christ and he recognized this was the headship coming down this was the lord coming to open the seals he christ is the mystery of god he is that mystery that was revealed in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when that mystery is finished and that mystery came down to reveal those six mysteries and in revealing the six mysteries he was actively revealing the seventh because the seventh seal in revelations one is silence no symbols and the seven thunders which is the revelations contained under the seven seals was silence nothing written and the two go together so at the time when the lord comes to reveal the seals he comes down and by revealing the seals he's showing you who's here he's dispensing the revelation of the first seal and the revelation the second seal the revelation and brother ben is saying i hope you see what's going on it's going on all around you i hope you're catching it i hope i don't have to come right out and say it and now the seventh seal himself christ the mystery of god is present because he's the only one that can open the seals brother venom can't open the seals only christ can open those seals so christ was present opening the seals and what's he doing he's manifesting the seventh seal because only the seventh seal christ can open the six seals so when brother branham comes to the seventh seal he begins talking and in the seventh seal he goes back over the sixth seal because they all overlap one overlaps the other even in preaching he has to overlap them because they always overlap each other everything he did was perfect these seals and now when he when he's preaching the seventh seal he comes to the seventh seal and he gets just to the part where he's about ready to tell you what the seven seal is because you kind of learn his cadence you kind of learn his demeanor through the first seals he would start off and he would kind of go back and reflect back and then he would lay the foundation and go through the scriptures and he would start to break it down he's doing the seventh thing and the same thing in the seventh seal he's going back over the sixth deal he's laying it all out he's reviewing back now he's getting to the part where he's just about to lay it down and he says i feel to stop right here because in the revelation of the seventh seal in revelation chapter 8 1 there was silence but he is going to preach the seventh seal he is going to teach the seven seal amen but he's not going to do it according to carnal mind so the carnal mind will pick it up into reasoning but he's going to do it comparing spiritual things with spiritual things so after he says stop i feel to stop then he says do you remember the baby shoe when you can't teach these things spiritual things the pentecostal babies now remember the tent the tent is the third pool and when he in the tent vision he's caught up and he sees this great big tent and he sees the platform and you know all of that the angel says this will be your third pool but then brother bram says now remember sabino cannon that sword in my hand what's he doing he is comparing spiritual things with spiritual things so that the spirit can come and pick it up amen because it was taught in a mystery paul taught it in a mystery that the carnal mind could not pick up and brother bannon what's he doing he is preaching the seventh seal but he's not going to do it with information he's not going to do it saying this equals that and this week was that he's doing the same thing comparing spiritual things with spiritual things he said now remember the sword in the hand and remember and when when brother bram tells the prophecy of the sword dropping through his hand he said it just fit me just right and we know all that he said this is the sword uh the king sword and he said the sword is the word fit my hand just right but then the voice says this is your third pool so brother branham after he says stop i don't feel to go anymore. he goes to the vision that was prophesying a third pool and he goes through the experience and spilling pinot canyon says this is your third pool so that you would know that the third pool would come that it was the opening of the word that christ had come because christ is the only one that can reveal those seals see he's preaching the seventh seal in the mystery and it wasn't the information it was the life brother branham was displaying the seventh seal because it was elohim in his flesh could turn his back to the tent until sarah what she was thinking behind her he was manifesting amen only christ only christ could open those seals but he tore off those seals and threw him down to a seventh church aged messenger who gave him out to the people so here he's now working in and through the seventh church and messenger what is it it's christ it's the seventh seal because who's giving us who's giving us the revelation of the seven seals it's coming from the seventh church aged messenger who opened it christ it could only be him but where's christ at he was in that little man what is that that's the mystery of god revealed that is the mystery in our day that is the mystery of god finished he was showing it finished the mystery of god was god above us then god with us and now god in us god above us is father god with us his son god in us is holy ghost what is it it's the godhead it's the mystery of god being finished in our day friends amen and it's preached in a mystery form but it takes prevailing life-giving revelation amen and by that revelation we can become the word made manifest in this hour praise god i don't even think i finished my quote he has showed it or revealed in every type that's in the bible what's he coming to the seventh seal therefore the entire bible is the revelation of god's mystery in christ hmm the entire bible is an expression of one goal that god had one purpose he wanted to achieve in the entire bible and the acts of the believers in the bible has been in type in expressing what god's great goal is and now in this last day he has revealed it and shows it and god's help well you'll see it right here this morning what the lord has had in his mind all along and has expressed it what's brother bradham doing comparing spiritual things with spiritual further in christ is the mystery he says here come luther through he only preached justification or he only preached justification just pounded away in that age he didn't know what the age was here come wesley through and he pounded his age through see a lot of outfalls come from it the other church is raising up and then here come pentecost pounding away and they organized and went right back into death again as we'll get to it in a few minutes right back into death and then comes the revelation of the mystery to reveal what it's all been about that's our day then comes the revelation mystery to reveal what it's all been about where these little doctrines like luther brought out catechism and everything and wesley brought this that and the other these other things then pentecost brought out organization just the same and father son holy ghost baptism and things not knowing any different then come back in the last days and picked up all these mysteries and clearly explained it revealed it why it's all the last day when this great mystery that god had in his heart is being revealed all of that has to be finished all in the last day all the mysteries revealed all the loose ends tied together so that this great mystery that god has had in his mind since before the foundation world so it could come now to be revealed that's why if i could just explain in my with from my own heart that's why you know we can we can labor on doctrines but doctrines weren't the point i hope you i hope you don't misunderstand me because i don't belittle anything but you had to understand serpency to understand the fault to understand yourself to know why there had to be redemption to know who you really are see it's all about revealing this mystery in the end time without serpent seed you couldn't have the mystery of god revealed you wouldn't know who you are and if you don't know who you are you can't know who god is because you come from god and without knowing who you are you cannot have the mystery of god cannot be finished he come to preach godhead because without the proper understanding of the godhead we don't know who god is and if we don't know who god is we don't know who we are and if we don't know who we are then we can never receive the mystery of god finished so the doctrines have been uh such a opportunity for fight and debate and strife and it's been such an opportunity to write books and to to to set down uh doctrinal beliefs but that wasn't the point he had to tie together those loose sins all those things that were left off in the ages they had to be finished up so that we we could receive the mystery of god we couldn't even receive it without understanding these things without the teaching of the church ages you know what went wrong and how god possibly if you didn't know the church ages you would have no i no concept of being able to receive luther as an elected of god you couldn't have when you heard that he smoked a pipe and you know called the jews christ haters and even conspired to have a persecution brought against them you can never look at luther and the day we live with the what we have now you could never look at luther and those in his day and say that he had the same holy ghost you have today like brother branham said you never call him unlike seed of god but you had to understand amen the revelation of the seven church ages and the revelation of the seven church ages would help you understand how the body of christ has been growing how it was cut down that bride was cut down it was eaten by all those uh insects amen and it went to ruin in the entire churches but god has been building it back to restore the the bride tree you see all of these things we can fuss on and argue about and debate with this church and group and with this church group and this denomination and that denomination but you know you can get somebody to agree with you that maybe it was adultery in the garden of eden that caused our ruin but that's still not the point the point was to catch the mystery of god revealed the point was to understand who god is what his plan was what interrupted his plan how he's been going about to redeem his loss and his plan and who christ is who we are in christ because without that understanding then the mystery of god is not finished to you so if we want to fight about doctors i don't want to fight about doctrines the doctrines were to bring me to this all that brother venom labored in to teach the manifestations of the spirit the demonstration of the life of christ was all to bring me to this the healings the miracles the prophecies the visitation of angels the the the visitation in a cabin all of those things were to bring me to this so that we could see the mystery of god revealed again he says in christ the mystery god revealed but all this mystery is revealed only as he promised to his bride hell is against this truth why do you think hell would be against this truth because when you with open face look in a glass you're changed into the image you behold from glory unto glory and if the devil can keep a veil over you or a veil over your heart when you listen to the messenger read the word then he can still maintain his control and he can still sit as a squatter on this earth amen because it's the mystery this is the last part to be revealed is the mystery of god is to be finished and when the mystery of god is finished amen and the bride is fully assembled and then under the revelation then sin's curse is broken amen and he's lost all of his power so he has to keep the veil in your mind he has to keep the veil in your heart he has to keep the veil over the word and he's got to keep us fighting about doctrine and fighting about brother branham's life and fighting about this and fighting about that and fighting about holiness and fighting about whatever amen i'm not interested in fighting about any of it because everything was to push me and drive me to this revelation let it drive you to this revelation don't get hung up like a pharisee don't get hung up like a sadducee on whether you know whether this will happen in lame whether this will happen in new heavens and new earth all of that is to drive you to this revelation and we can start debates over doctrine and we can start condemning another church and condemning another preacher and condemning all these things when what's the point the point is to get the people amen to the revelation of god in this day not to see it but to be it amen but to manifest it but to live it it's got to be a living word in this day and if satan can stop this revelation of the mystery of god finished to be manifest in you and me he is one that's why the devil will let i mean he'll encourage your brother to hurt you why he's trying to put the veil back over your heart start contentions and strives why if he can just keep you from the revelation of this mystery you can believe the church ages you can accept brother branham as a prophet of god you could receive him as a seventh church age messenger but if you don't come to where his life lives in you revealing the revelation of the mystery of god finished in this day then satan has defeated the word of god so the next time that you feel lured into a debate just back out because that has nothing to do with what we're here for i've taken the bait more times than i'd like to admit and i'm ashamed for and it's done me no good but what's done me good is to sit down and read christ as the mystery of god and the weep and to realize that god doesn't want to just show me something he wants to show the world through me something he wants to pick up his bride this day and he wants to peel the mysteries away amen and tie all the loose ends together so that she will have the foundation to understand who she really is who she was intended to be how she got in this condition and what he's done to free her from this condition so that he can take the veil off of our heart that he can take the veil off of the word so we with open face can behold him in perfection the mystery of god revealed and be changed into what we behold from glory and to glory amen and then there'll be a living amen then you don't have to point anybody to anything you are it you are the mystery of god revealed you are the mystery of god being finished in this day because the mystery of god is christ christ is the mystery of god revealed and christ has to have a body and the bride is the completed body of jesus christ and you are here to manifest this mystery will you be able to explain it probably not i haven't done a thorough job today but yet you get it how is that because this is the mystery of god paul taught it in a mystery but only discerned by the spirit brother branham taught the mystery only discerned by the spirit jesus was the mystery he was the mystery he was emmanuel he was god with us he was god in flesh he was the mystery and the mystery was being manifest and they were too blind to see it but did that stop the manifestation did that stop the purpose of the manifestation did that stop the work of redemption blindness cannot stop god's work now god is working in and through his bride what's he doing he's revealing the mystery what mystery the mystery of god that's finished in this day he's revealing the mystery christ's body the last part of his body being put together to complete the body of jesus christ and when the last one comes in then the rapture will go so here is completing the body of christ and christ is the mystery of god revealed so here we stand as the completed part of the body revealing the mystery why is all hell against this revelation because this revelation is destroying hell's authority it's destroying hell's lies all of the mistruths and misconceptions that have come through the church ages this revelation is dispelling all of it and this revelation amen is actually going to prevent us from falling into the same trap our forefathers fell in without this revelation you can't help it i'll read that brother bam tells us that let's let's keep reading but all this mystery is revealed only as he promised to his bride that's why you can't explain it friends it's only revealed to the bride hell is against this truth of the revelation of this mystery but the bride is standing on it that's her stand now if you want to stand for something stand for this well i stand for this and i stand for that this is the bride stand the revelation of this mystery why do you hunger church why do you thirst it's the father trying to reveal this hidden secret to you but you let so many things get it out of you you let your job you let your wife you let your husband you let your children you let the cares of the world you let some past you let somebody else get that out of you when you know that way down in your heart you're thirsting hungry it's god trying to reveal it to you see the revelation the last day is here again in christ the mystery of god revealed he says what did they do sold out to reasonings of wisdom and education like eve did fallen angels did wesley was a man of god but what followed him fallen angels got into it what was the angels first creative beings of god but fell for lucifer's wisdom fell for lucifer's wisdom and you see what they became fallen angels and organizations from men of god who has went forth to establish truth in the earth before that truth could go on and proclamate and get on to the real revelation of christ isn't that amazing those men were bringing truths but those truths were supposed to go on and proclamate and bring us to the real revelation of christ but what happened they cabbage down on that truth and they didn't get on to the real revelation of christ it was truth it was right it was god's time it was the word for their day but those men were supposed to go on and those moves are supposed to go on to proclamate and bring forth the complete mystery of christ let me read that again but before the truth could go on and proclamate and get on the real revelation of christ fallen angels came in and took it over and made denominations out of it that's the reason the revelation of the seven seal mystery had to be unfolded to keep you from doing it again the seven seal mystery had to be unfolded all the mysteries of what's happened down through time what anointings was was fighting the church what anointing was upholding the church what happened down through time in the church they said all the seven seals had to be opened why because of that cycle has got to stop amen and it's going to stop by this revelation now you see it why they left off if luther would have went on it had been here why because luther was elect if wesley would have went on if pentecost would have went on what would they done now there is only one thing can happen there has to be a message at the end time when there is nothing else can follow it and now the ecumenical world has set up such a regime that there can be no denomination and do not uh not nothing else follow it you're either in it or you're not in it the fruit is in the top of the tree and the light is shining on that predestinated fruit and she is ripening into christ-like fruit bringing forth the same mellowness and sweetness and the same spirit that he had in him i hope you see it i'd like to say i hope you see it but i hope you don't have to say i saw it but i hope you see it i hope there's a bride under the revelation of this ministry that is growing into christ-like ripeness that's the point you can see brother branham and you can see the wave sheath and you can see the ministry of christ in him and that prophet and you can see him out of the scriptures and you can see the scriptures fulfilled in him you can see all of that but all of that was to produce something even the ministry of the seventh angel was to move us to this even the forerunner ministry the ministry of malachi 4 was to bring us to this so that she is ripening into christ like fruit what was the point of the message to get you and i to be christ on this earth with the same character with the same conduct with the same surrender to the father with his same obedience to the word ripening in the christ-like fruit bringing forth the same melodiness and sweetness and the same spirit that he had in him i hope you see it and i say this morning i hope you see it i hope you see it in me i see it in you i hope it continues to grow to where all it is is the manifestation of him she's reflecting him he she's the body he's the head his intelligence his leadership his guidance reflected down in the manifestation in his body his body acting out his mind that's the day we live in that's the mystery being revealed today and the message the rapture brother behind says well then in wesley's age the works that he did testified who he was and luther's age on reformation why sure it testified who he was in the days of the pentecostals the restoring back of the gifts and restoring the restoring of the gifts speaking in tongues casting out devils and the gifts why it testified there was no joke about it people said when it first raised up i read the books on the history of pentecost they said it can't last long it'll burn down it's still burning why is because you'll never put it out god said it would be there it's that portion of the word and no more could you put that out and then when the bride is being called how are you going to put it out it's the revelation of the manifestation of the word made true and we're living in that day praise be to god i'm getting ready to read a part of a sentence but i want you to pay attention we're living in that day praise be to god the revelation of the mystery of his self the revelation of the mystery of his self where is he going to reveal it in you and i it's the revelation of the mystery of his self let's go to romans 16. romans 16 and verse 25. now the hymn that is the power to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of jesus christ according to the revelation of the mystery which was kept secret since the world began but now is made manifested by the scriptures of the prophets according to the commandments of the everlasting god made known to all nations for the obedience of faith to god only wise be glory through jesus christ forever amen this has been a mystery this is before the foundation of the world but now the mystery is being revealed not in letter but in spirit paul came with the new testament the new testament he came to preach not in letter for the letter killeth but he came to preach it in spirit and now is the day at the end of the ages the last day for the revelation of the mystery of god to be revealed i'd like to say again not in letter but in spirit god wants his life living in his bride the end time to manifest this great mystery it says in christ is a mystery god revealed he says but the revelation came through the blood see through jesus christ who is the blood of god creative blood in the womb of mary and paul knew him by revelation that's how we know him today is the only the only way you could know him not say i'm methodist that means nothing i'm baptist that means nothing i'm catholic that means nothing but by the revelation that god has revealed the word to you he is the word and the word how you know it's revealed it lives itself and it expresses itself through you this is what i want to leave with this morning how do i know it's revealed because that a knife that i now live i live by the faith of the son of god amen i died and i do mortify the deeds of the body by the spirit it's not me that lives any longer but christ that lives in me how do i know this mystery and god's revealed this mystery to me because it lives itself and expresses itself through you i want a greater expression do you then we with open face must be beholding in a glass the image of the lord we must be changed by what we see see you will live your revelation let that sink in you will live your revelation and so if we don't like the way we're living maybe we need to pray for revelation because you will manifest what you believe is that true you will live your revelation and the the revelation that you have will become the manifestation of your life so that's why when we look at the manifestation in our life and we see you know what i'm not happy with the manifestation of my life it's not time to go back to the letter of the law it's time to ask for god to give you an open face an unveiled face an unveiled heart to behold him in the glass and be changed from the image that i see what do we need we need to see him as he is today we need this great revelation that the seventh angel was to come in the days of the voice of the seventh angel the mystery of god shall be revealed we need that revelation we need it with open face we don't need a veil on our heart a veil on our mind we need an open vase to look at it as in a glass and be changed into the image that we see when we look at this great mystery brother bam said christ is the mystery of god revealed when we look at the mystery we see christ and when we see christ we are supposed to be changed into what we see until we reflect what we're pointed to that's why i think we've done a disservice in the message trying to educate trying to fight the baptist and to fight the catholics and to prove that our doctrines are true i think we've done a disservice all the doctrines was to make christ manifest in you and i believe that what god wants in this day is a living epistle written of christ displayed to the world the life of jesus christ that's what he died for and you in this resurrection in this day is his victory the church is his victory and the reason of his death and i say god strip everything else away from me until all i see is that perfect image of you that the prophet brought in this day the revelation of the seventh seal and when i see you the scripture says you're looking in a glass what's a glass a mirror and when you're looking into christ somehow it's you become the reflection the reflection becomes you and what he is you are and what you are he is that's the purpose of the revelation in this day [Music] let's go to romans 8. romans 8. i just want to read a couple more scriptures will be done romans 8 and 29. for whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren what did god want he wanted the revelation of this mystery in you christ is the mystery of god revealed under the voice of the seventh angel the mystery of god shall be finished and god who he foreknew he predestinated are you predestinated to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren if you're predestinated you're be you're predestinated to reflect christ you're predestinated to be conformed into his image let's go to first corinthians 13. first corinthians 13 and 8. charity never faileth but whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether it be tongues they shall cease for there be knowledge it shall vanish away for we know in part we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect has come then that which is in part shall be done away when i was a child i spake as a child i understood as a child i thought as a child but when i became a man i put away childish things for now we see through a glass darkly but then face to face now i know in part but then shall i know even as also i am known and now abideth faith hope and charity these three but the greatest of these is charity remember we started in second corinthians 3 18 that we with open face or beholding us in a glass are changed into the image from glory unto glory but now it says when that which is perfect shall be done away when as a child i speak as a child verse 12 for now we see through a glass darkly but then face to face now i know in part but then shall i know even as also i am known brother branham he he refers to this scripture and questions and answers he said in first corinthians 13 says when that which is perfect is come that which is in part shall be done away with so all these little things of jumping up and down like a kid trying to talk in tongues and all these other things when that which is perfect and we do have today by god's help the perfect interpretation of the word with divine vindication then that which is in part is done away when i was a child i spake as a child i understood as a child but when i become a man i put away childish things see this comes at the end of first corinthians 13 which is the love chapter charity agape love which we know is the capstone when brother brennan preached the stature of a perfect man when he got to the statue of a perfect man it was capped off by what the capstone which was love which is god himself capping off the individual and when we come to this revelation this rev that what we have in this day is the perfect interpretation of the word with divine vindication brother brahma said when the perfect has come that which is in part shall be done away are the partial understandings done away when i was a child what would this do it brings us to full maturity to bring us to the capstone of love to a marriage union now everything we do is motivated by love jesus christ when he come to manifest the father he didn't manifest the father because he was obligated to he didn't manifest the father because he was afraid if he didn't he'd be lost he didn't manifest the father because he was trying to achieve to a goal and get to something so that he could have the kingdom of david at some time no but he had an understanding of who he was all the way back when he was 12 years old when mary and joseph come to gather him up when he's been left behind amen and mary says my father and i sought thee with tears he says did you not know that i must be about my father's business what was he doing he was discussing the scriptures with the elders what was his father's business his father's business was the word all the way back then he knew who he was and jesus was not motivated by fear he was not voted by achievement he was not motivated by reward what was his motivation love the father loved him and he loved the father what did his revelation produce fear anxiety nervousness about the future what did his revelation produce his revelation produced in him a love for the father that would surrender self to the headship of the father and god in this day has opened the seals he's opened the book he's opened the mystery so that we could see what so that we could see our position in christ you hath he quickened up you're already quickened and you're already seated in heavenly places in christ jesus you were on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world and written an indelible ink and his blood will never be removed why did god show you that way why did god show us all these things so that we wouldn't have to be motivated by fear or the letter of the law or an achievement system or trying to finally get good enough to get something from god the bride is not worried about trying to become bride she's bride because he chose her to be bride she doesn't have to earn that position or try to become the bride she's not straining to become bride she is bride and the revelation god gives personally to each one of us in our position frees us it brings liberty in christ i don't have to strain i don't have to meet goals i don't have to work my way up what do i have to do i have to take this perfect revelation that's given us in this day and with open face look at it observe it become one with it and be changed into the image that i behold from glory unto glory that's why if we if we don't preach the mystery amen we're never going to get somebody to the manifestation because the manifestation comes amen from being changed into the image that we look at and if we don't even see what this great mystery was what the seventh seal is amen what are we going to be changed into we're going to be changed amen into forerunner followers we're going to be changing the malachi 4 promoters and i promote malachi 4. but you understand what i'm saying we're going to be changed amen we're not going to recognize our position because we won't have the right image of god we won't have the right revelation of god that's being finished in our day and we can never come into the manifestation of that revelation until first the veil is taken away and the message came this day to take the veil away so that i'm not afraid of not going in the rapture i have to go in the rapture my name was on the last book of life he came to me and revealed himself to me he doesn't do that to everybody [Music] i didn't come to him he came to me i didn't understand my study he gave me eyes to see and revealed it to me by a personal revelation i i i am here because i was there and i'll be there because i was there i hope you understand that not because i acted right or i did write or understood right so many people have been manipulated into all kinds of positions in this message because they've been taught that if you don't believe this right you can't be bride or if you're bride you believe this or if you don't see this you're serpency that's not god how god motivates that's not how god taught jesus christ that's not how god brought his bride up amen brother branham never taught us that way of course he said the bride will see this absolutely but what does he do he takes all the bondage away and he shows you seated with him in heavenly places and when you see yourself already there then comes the liberty of the sons of god see when somebody begins to preach that way they're taking away your liberty they're making a requirement for you to be bride but god put no requirement on me the only requirement is faith and that came by grace and it was a gift i didn't try to believe i didn't read until i believed and understood i didn't go to a bunch of different teachers i just for some reason believed and the longer i looked the more i believed and when i looked again i believed more and i looked again i believe more and more and more and more and you know what happened as i looked more and believed more i began to change more [Music] as god plucked me up out of a sinful life things began to fall away and as it began to lift me higher in the revelation the higher i go more things fall off not because i have to give them up not because if i don't give them up i won't be bribed and as god lifts me up the higher you get the further you can see and that's why revelation builds upon revelation upon revelation because as you go higher all of a sudden you can see things you can never see down here and if somebody is trying to define you because you're not up here and they're taking away your sonship or your identity as a bride and part of the mystery you will never get up here it's impossible for you to rise up here because you can only come here if you know who you are not by the letter but by the spirit so you end up with a lot of people pretending to believe doctrines they don't understand and learning how to rehearse phrases and repeat certain phrases that they don't understand so that they can be part of the bride but that's not what god did for us god came and he peeled away the seals he showed us what's happened he showed us the mystery plan from before the foundation of the world all the way to new heavens and new earth and when you saw it you said that's beautiful amen and he come like paul and says you've already made it when he made it you made it amen he made it for you amen you can't be lost you can no more be lost than god can be lost if you've got god in you you've got zoe life eternal life it never started it'll never end you can never be separated from the love of god you can never be lost you can never be diminished you can never be cast out and when it was preached to you that way you said tell me more show me more i want to see more we with open face and be holding in the glass you used to be holding the glass darkly but when that which is perfect has come that which is in part is done away and what we do have by god's grace today is the perfect interpretation of the word with divine vindication i encourage you just to keep looking at it and keep being changed from what you look at and what you look at may become you and you keep becoming what you look at until the two become one what's that that's the message of the hour i hope you understand it because i'm not going to be able to explain it let's read one more scripture and then we'll be done musicians you can go ahead and make your way up and brother ben as well romans 8. we're going to go back and read this again but i want to continue on romans 8 and 29 for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate then he also called and whom he called then he also justified and whom he justified then he also glorified i want to ask you are you trying to get glorified or have you already been glorified you've been glorified that means it's finished friends it's already done verse 31 why shall we then say to these things if god before us who can be against us he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things who shall lay anything to the charge of god's elect it is god that justifieth who is he that condemneth it is christ that died yey rather that has risen again who is even at the right hand of god who also maketh intercession for us who shall separate us from the love of christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are counted as sheep for the slaughter nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor high nor death nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord if you're that secure can you be at rest if you're that secure are you in there under any pressure if you're under that secure god has done all of that for you because of his love can you not just love him back that's all he wants god doesn't want your deeds as righteousness they're filthy rags he has showed you his great love now all he wants is somebody that'll love him back and when you love him back you'll have the same attitude same surrender same obedience as jesus christ did when he loved his father back the father loved him he loved the father back christ has loved us and we love him back that's what he wants in this day let's all stand praise be to god what a day we live in friends i say let's keep looking at that image let's keep looking at that glass and ask god to keep revealing more to us that we might seem unveiled more and seem unveiled more and see who he is more that we can be changed from glory unto glory by what we behold let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus we thank you for this day you've given us upon the earth god for the privilege of hearing these things lord many wise men many prophets of old have longed to see this day but lord it's our privilege it's our opportunity it's our calling god so many men who have gone on before and lived their portion of the word faithfully they've paved the way for us to come and god you have so showed us your plan you have so revealed the mysteries you showed declared yourself in us and we see you lord unveiled before us what was the purpose of you unveiling yourself before us so that we can behold you and be changed into the image that we see god there's not a one of us that can do this ourselves there's not a one of us that can be good enough lord that can conquer the flesh all by ourselves but lord through the spirit we do mortify the deeds of the body let your spirit live in us lord there's anyone here lord who's not received your spirit i pray god that they would just open their heart now and say lord just come to me lord i receive you in the fullness of your word come and change my life lord open my eyes that i can see lord may you go and lord quicken to them life lord and bring that seed that eternal predestinated seed to life may that life begin to live out from each of these vessels lord till it wouldn't be us anymore it wouldn't be the life that i live now but it'd be the life of christ living in me god we love you we thank you for the picture you've painted in this day for the image you've given us for the pure true interpretation of the word that we might see you as you are and by seeing you we can be changed into your image for god we know that we've been predestinated to be conformed into your image change us now lord may we reflect you may our heart be singly focused on you may every other thing fade out of you but this mystery lord may become everything to us this great love story this great secret mystery may it become our total focus may become our life and may it be what we live and manifest to others god have glory through us finish your purpose through us finish the work in this day we pray in jesus christ's name amen god bless your friends beholding his face [Music] [Music] with [Music] in a secret place there in the spirit beholding his face to run in the [Music] race [Music] in a secret place in the spirit beholding his face i'm gaining new power [Applause] [Music] [Music] amen oh i tell you friends the liberty of the sons of god in this day we're free from laodicea we're free from our flesh there's been a quickening power that'll quicken us right out of this flesh till that day with the spirit we'll mortify the deeds of the body until these atoms are changed we've been quickened brought to life out of dead denominationalism out of debt of sin and ignorance the bright light is shining this day what does it produce in us i say lord let it produce an unfeigned love a love for my lord a love for my god a love for his plan a love for the mystery a desire just to surrender to him and be like him oh we we're not here to make message believers [Music] that sounds odd but that's not what we're here to do we're here to display the mystery and gather the body and when the body is complete when the last one comes in then the rapture goes i'm not interested in making somebody believe something that they weren't predestinated for i'm interested in being all that he called me to be and let that light in that life draw the elect don't focus in the wrong spot just keep looking in this mirror of his word until you're changed into the image that you behold just keep keep in the message keep in the word stay in it and be changed from glory into glory and trust me it'll have an effect on everybody else around us it's him it's him and us [Music] in a secret place in the spirit beholding his face gaining new power [Music] is and lord my heart is [Music] [Applause] i've [Applause] [Music] won't you [Applause] is open [Music] won't you come inside fill up all my [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] won't you come inside your lord i need you more and more one more time lord my heart is open won't you come ever too about [Applause] every door [Music] [Applause] i just want to [Music] [Applause] to please lost in his presence found in his likeness to hear him say well done someday i just want to please my lord [Music] be in his will in every way to be lost in his presence found in his likeness to hear him say well done someday and i just want to please to be lost in his presence found in his likeness to hear him say well done
