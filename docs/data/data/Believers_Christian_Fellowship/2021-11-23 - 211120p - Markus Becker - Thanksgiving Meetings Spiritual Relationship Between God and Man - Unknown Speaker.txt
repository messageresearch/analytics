father knowing how you feel for your people father you are not just some high priest but you have feelings father for us you know how we are you know how we live in these conditions father how we are still in these human elements but there is some part of you right in us father father this evening want to continue with that subject and father may you speak to each and every one of us may you give an answer to someone and father you know our desire is not to become religious in this message father we want to be we want to grow in a statue father having real spiritual fellowship bless thy people israel wherever they are bless the nation of israel father bless thy bride here in lima and around father bless the churches all around our most noble brothers father may your name be glorified ask it in the name of the lord jesus christ amen god bless you brothers and sisters thank you for the for the wonderful songs and let's open the word of the lord in the book of john and wishing you all for my heart god's blessings and uh john chapter 18 verse 28 that is the uh the scenery is jesus right before pilate and here we see a a a a a tragedy and we see some kind like a drama verse 28 eight sorry then let the jesus from caithus unto the hall of judgment and it was early and they themselves went not into the judgment hall that is a critical point the jews lest they should be defiled but that they might eat the passover pilate then went out unto them and said what accusation bringing you against this man they answered and said unto him if he were not a manufacturer we would not have delivered him unto thee then said pilate unto them take you him and judge him according to your law the jews therefore said unto him it's not lawful for us to put any man to death that the saying of jesus might be fulfilled which he spake signifying what death he should die then pilate entered into the judgment judgment hall again and called jesus and said unto him art thou the king of the jews jesus answered him say thou this thing out of thyself or did others tell thee of me pilate answered am i a jew thy own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me what hast thou done jesus answered my kingdom is not of this world if my kingdom were of this world then would my servants fight that i should not be delivered to the jews but now is my kingdom not from hands pilate therefore said unto him art thou are killing them jesus answered thou sayeth that i am a king to this end was by born and for this cause came i into the world that i should bear witness unto the truth everyone that's of the truth here is my voice pilates said unto him what is truth and when he said this he went out again unto the jews and said unto them i find no thought at all may the lord add his blessing to the reading of his word we may be seated now i greet you all in the house of the lord for this evening and it's a great honor for me to be here and so our brother from michigan is here we have time a little bit to fellowship after church but before the preparation i think you know how it is then you're concentrating on the word of the lord and i just want to say it's a great honor it's a great pleasure pleasure and privilege for me to be among you and uh to really have these kind of meetings and we were greatly blessed already this morning and uh really wonderful uh the way how it is expressed and and you see everybody is his original we cannot copy one another we are originals ourselves god wants us to be that way god have different flowers in the garden and we must be ourselves and that is the best way how we can be and and uh blessed be the name of the lord and uh just wonderful thought was very very truly blessed this morning and so um we wish our brother well and wishing god's blessing for tomorrow morning service now i will continue and especially the end of the service of this morning i thought it would be matching perfectly in the thoughts that i was preparing for these meetings and it really fits it seems that we have the same father same inspiration somehow it works together huh and uh yes i i i would i would like to make a drama and i would like to for you to relax and sit down listen especially to the first part because there are some things that can be controversial or it can be touchy but it's not touchy at all but it thinks reality that we are have to deal with and we will deal with it one of the aspects in the third poll is we recognized our own nature we recognized from where we came the opening of the word was not just some information about luther about wesley but the seals was taken away from around us and it needed the opening of the word and so we understand once we understand who we are we understand our actions and we understand others and we are faced in the future with with with difficult and complex situations and sometimes we try to handle them with methods from the last century but it will not work we need the methods of today because it's a new challenge and when the enemy and the enemy comes in like a flood then the lord will raise up a standard against it so the challenge of today needs the answer of today exactly so if not we will be defeated and in that question i would like to to title that subject for this evening spiritual relationship between god and man and we see clearly in this scripture that we are reading that jesus is brought before pilate if you read that scripture again you will see we have two sceneries one is in the hall and one is outside because the bible always said um therefore he went out to the jews the jews that did not went did not went in into the hall so we have two sceneries the same person but we have a communication which is outside to the jews and we have a communication between him and pilate so outside of the jews out there where the jews were it was shouting it was just accusation it was just it was just slow guns it was just uh it was not an intense debate jesus couldn't even say something they had made their mind up they had they had already their their conclusion they were just shouting crucify him but here in that hall is quite a discussion going on something in that little room something that is now between two men pilate he knew how to deal with noble people with kings with uh pilate took care of that part of palestine he knew how to deal with this and you could feel pilate he could not bring it to the point but he felt this man is special i mean he could feel it he could not bring it because he didn't know jewish doctrine but he could sense this man is different so he now starts a conversation and you have to see that jesus he was he was completely bound uh and here comes pilate and he asked him are you a king and jesus answer questions back i mean this is pure rhetoric amen you ask a question you answer give the question back um did you tell it by yourself but in other words do you have revelation who you are or did somebody tell you where a man so so the more he is questioning back the more pilots get insecure because in that little situation you find out jesus is the one who's bound he's ready for crucification but it's him the master of the situation it's not pilates leading jesus was jesus now leading him once you know who you are you take every spirit under your control and spirit taking spirit under your control means you understand if you cannot change anything you have to wait until god changes it faith in god means patience to until god facing god is not is not it's not a little child stamping on the with his foot on the ground until god has to do something god has to do nothing i mean we're not children we're not toddlers we're not uh have you ever little seen seen a little child that that he's in a supermarket and he wants to have some chewing gums and the parents and no no chewing gum and he just throws himself on the on on the face and just i want i want you know the church is not like this we're not like this this is pentecostal babies no we have grown a little bit into a maturity knowing my father knows best sometimes god's no is better than our yes once we understand who we are and that our father cares we can take things how they come that's so important because jesus now he was asked a question and he goes back and forth and backs it and in the meantime pilate's wife come and say look i had a dream about that man he's a just man you better have nothing to do with him so the more evidence has come the more pilot now understand i'm in a real bad situation right now i want to release this man but once i release him and that's the problem of politics therefore be always a free man of god amen you don't have to stand before your brother you have to stand before god for your fault be a free man of god because here is pilate and again and he goes out and there is just shouting and crying and this is and he comes back and he speaks to him again so we have two two setups and it comes to the point that he asked him a question are you a king and the thing is this we are americans i i just say we okay let me let me be an american for some time okay let me give give me a green card for two hours okay okay let us be americans okay because you are americans are germans anyhow what are you french english what are no what is your doctrine brother marcus no taxation without representation that okay i'm in but we are americans and even this church sometimes people just say the law has nothing to do in the church no we are still on american grounds do you understand this all our finances are controlled by the estate and it's good to be that way we have to be under law we have to be americans if we have a problem here we call the american police if somebody has a heart attack we call american doctor so we are part of the society don't forget this we are not in heaven yet we're in america but our kingdom is not here at the same time we have a representation up in the other dimension so if you become mature you learn to live in both worlds amen blessed be the name of the lord because you have your manage you have to manage your life here if not you have to go on an island at the same time you have to understand you're not belonging to america you come from another country and you will go back to that same country can you say amen so he asked him the question are you a king he says yes but this is not my country here my country doesn't belong to this earth i come from another country and i hope i can talk this evening to a bride who says i don't belong here i come from another kingdom i'm just a pilgrim i'm a just just a representative on this earth can you say amen so we see a case and therefore i said would you will you open it brother franco is that fine yeah therefore i said i'm i'm i'm i'm not sad if you don't tell too much aim eamonn especially in the beginning this is a little girl who they you can find them on youtube as i'm dealing a lot with people who left the message and who left the church who left christianity i have i heard sometimes brother marcus we were in a sect so here we have on youtube especially people who come out of uh organizations like the jehovah witness or the hormones for an example and these people explain why they left it's heartbreaking because for all of them it's very very difficult because the church became a family for them but the pressure became so big that they couldn't stand it anymore now we have a big responsibility i'm a minister in this message i'm a just small a small hillbilly that nobody knows i know this i'm aware of this or some people know me but we have a responsibility to lead the people in the right direction and the question of us is do we want to make a cult or do we want to grow in christ do we want to have a health healthy growth or do we just want to be church members of some idea so some of these young people when they when they came the the the the the subject or the the nature of a of a sect is you can do whatever you want but you cannot ask questions they don't like questions and we have to understand we have a message which is waterproof we cannot fear questions in fact we must allow our young people to ask to be critically or to be skeptically because if the law cherries they would take the batoon and you can only stand for something that you fully grasp the young generation cannot live by slogans they must get the vision catch that vision we must allow them to ask once we are afraid of this it means we are not sure about ourselves if you're sure ask if i cannot answer please i cannot answer yet what happens and i make some the service that i have i was preaching different times already is sometimes young people have questions about strange ideas that comes up um i just take it from the world we have now a new thought which goes about uh which says about the what they call the flat earth so i'm not interested i know there's some questions some some some quotes of brother brandon about this about that and people say brother marcus what do you think about this what we think about that i always say look i don't have time for these things i will never my major on a minor i'm we preach about the gospel we preach about things that change our life and the flat earth will never change my life we think about things with substance essential things but it's there and the question of the flat earth is not a it's not a message problem it is a problem worldwide since a couple of years outside of this message there's conventions in america about the thought the earth is flat right fine okay that can be like this i'm i couldn't say but uh these people completely unbelievers they were asked the question and look why it's so dangerous and why we need the mind of christ like the sister was singing they asked the question they would ask the question yes look we have a lot of astronomers went up americans you know baldwin and how the armstrong and we had russians all of them looked out of the window and all of them said the earth is a globe what are you doing about that and these people they say honestly all these astronomers are or astronauts they were all lying they were lying so the russians were lying like the americans so in other words they said nobody flew up until now i said okay that means we have what you i think you call it the nasa nasa is not correct over there in houston that means we have thousands of people working for the nasa and in the morning it is said to these people look uh you don't exist you get your pay bill you do as if we are working here but when you come home [Music] we had we were working on a rocket but we don't exist in reality that means it has nothing to do with the message of the hour but once you follow conspiracy theories you see the world through that glass and then what you see is the world and is the center of the world and all the rest are lying once you enter in this you will never have a true perspective about things therefore we need the mind of god therefore you have three sources of information one is the news and you can be skeptical second is conspiracy theories and there you should be skeptical and the third one is the open word it comes from the throne of god can you can you say amen it's a it it it's a mindset of seeing the world as somebody wants you to see it but we have the mind of christ and we're thankful for a message which shows the balance in all things then what is always the same for these kind of groups they claim for eternal destination and we heard yesterday extra ecclesia la salus means outside the church there is no salvation now brother branham explained to us outside of christ there is no salvation that's a big difference because they claim eternal destination to their group because when they say outside of the church there's no salvation that means outside of our church you so you're binding people to a system to a building to a doctrine to a ministry and this message to came to set us free from all those things so we are so we are respecting everyone but we are family of god therefore all these groups they think in in in local church terms we think in a family coming from this from the foundation of the world can you say amen so what happens is this is they put up a setup as if the church is the family and there's a truth behind that but you will see once you leave the church you will see how your family works because people will let you down um and and sometimes it's ridiculous that for example you are in a group and all these young people that said these things in the moment when we were questioning them the moment we were not any more accepted you know we could have come with all kind of immoral problems they would have said uh no problem the blood of jesus christ has a way but no questions about authorities so and it makes it dangerous because these young people say we were raised up in the mormon church we went to sunday school all our friends are there all our our our our family is there we went to youth camps we loved it but once we had the question we were out and the third was this you are in such a group and people say ah you are an eagle right we come from the foundation of the world we were always together and you are theophany here and mighty of an idiot and once you leave the same people would say okay they left us because they were never part of us once after years they come back and people say people would say oh wonderful my brother who was always a brother before the foundation of the world i mean i mean who wants to believe that who wants to believe that that is cultish if somebody is a brother is a brother maybe he doesn't know who he is he's in complete spiritual amnesia but he's a brother he's a sister jesus sister so what happens is these young people observe us and they have a right to do they must do because we have nothing to hide there's nothing to hide and i remember that that i was asking brother lonnie many many years ago it was some clash in a church and i asked him when we were younger we were more militant about certain things today we're trying to find solutions you know before we were more we were not yet mature and he said something i never forgot and i said brother mark brother lonnie what is about this ministry he said brother marcus look a a minister especially a pastor he makes a lot of decisions he says in all his life hundred of his decisions will be very very important with repercussions 100 of all his decision will be very important he will find out later that ten of the of his hundred decisions were wrong they were not sin but they were wrong completely wrong exactly why should i reject a man who make made 90 good decisions if he just made 10 big mistakes exactly so we do these things and the faster we see them the faster we we we acknowledge it the faster we brings it back on track the faster we are back on our own track so it's so important but there is a generation that is watching us as i said i was on a minister's meeting in in north carolina you see a minister making a mistake and you see the other ministers just shunning the men once i understand the man is a good man of god he's my brother he's a good ministry if he does a big mistake then my duty is to be with him not to avoid him i mean because i'm not like kane who says uh uh uh uh am am i am i the shepherd of my own brother no we are family of god and family of god shows itself when when things go wrong when mistakes are making then the family of god shows their quality the rest is just you are accepted as long as you are fitting in our system amen these young people were suffering a lot among this so as i said on the minister's meeting sometime even in the message of the hour we we come into problems and then we live what we call cold war we isolate and we ignore it's just the expression that we don't know who we are we cannot handle that situation that's the problem therefore we make cold war you are there i'm here but family of god must have feeling for one another you cannot live in eternal cold war because what do you do in the rapture well you're saying the reps okay cold war is over we must grow into a statue that we can handle situations that you know who you are and you know who's your brother your sister exactly so so sometimes we make some some some turns and we are we are we are observed by a generation who wants not only to see if we can preach because preaching is a gift but can we solve problems it takes more than good preaching this takes the holy spirit in his time so in all these groups they are creating images i always say this they sing uh it's so i'm so glad being part of the family of god but once a person has a problem he's not anymore part of that family it these songs have a value when you're down not when everything is working perfect but when we make big mistakes then the family of god shows who they are exactly so i was a couple of weeks ago in peru there was a split of a church it's a long story and they told me brother marcus you're the only minister coming to this place we asked different when they don't want to come because they know if they enter in that problem they are part of they will be made responsible for their problem they it seems that they that that that they are afraid of their reputation i think that's wonderful nothing to lose i have no i have no name i've know nothing so we jump into the problem because problems need solutions and god will will bring more complex problems in our life not to not to chasing us but to prove us the holy spirit is more than good pitching preaching not more than i love the message i love this i love god brings situations where we can see where we are and how we handle situations can you say amen that means we are we are facing problems a brother said to me the minister he said brother marcus i have five children in reality i have four the fifth one is a homosexual it's not my child i said certainly we're against homosexuality that's sure but it's still your child because he has a soul and you stand before god and god placed that church that that child in your family sometimes we think is is just kick him out is the solution kicking up puts him out of our sight but there's no solution i think if there is a solution we must have a solution can you say amen i said no no you have five children one is homosexual amen not only those who function perfectly perfect are our children they're all our children and they need an intercessor they need many situations in this message need a man who is standing in the gap standing in the gap knowing that the situation has no solution but jesus is the way can you say amen it takes more than than than just doctrine therefore we we see these things pure in therefore we have to pay attention what they say is we were indoctrinated we were influenced i will not make the same parallel but you know what the jesuit's saying what what hitler said and what they call the hitler use they said give me a child for five years we will mold them for the rest of their lives so we have to pay attention not to indoctrinate so they become ambassadors of our doctrine of our standard uh we are this and we are that brother we are responsible that these youngsters find christ not just to be so they said we were we were quite indoctrinated i give i give an example we cannot radicalize them there's a nice song that we have in the message of the hour it says push play and obey i i accept anyone who doesn't accept ministers okay somebody says i believe just in tapes i say god bless you that's fine go on i said i believe in tapes plus ministry amen where's the problem if you believe just in this god bless you i respect you please respect me too but if a youngster sings uh i say my own words if they tell us any lies we just push play on the oblate obey we have to it has to be identified as a propaganda song this is not a song for the love about the love of christ about what jesus means to me this is pure propaganda this is indoctrinating the children already for an idea that i have it can happen more easy than we think that's it be the name therefore the message that we believe is not a denomination but we have denominational spirits in it the message that we believe is not a cult but something we have cultish elements and it takes a good balance to take people into the right direction we should never radicalize them or are are bring some kind like an in in in introduct indoctrination um brother branham preaches a message he says he says taking sides with jesus that means not taking sides for marcus becker taking side taking side for jesus not taking side are you for this group are you against this truth we take side with jesus so we see god in this group and in this group and we we see a family can you say amen that's so important here we have the next picture that shows um this is a picture which was done by the um by the holiness movement it's shalotta from germany i think it was 1870 it is called the broad way and the narrow way and the situation was very very clear there's two ways in life and we accept this from the bible and there is two ways either you're on this way and on that way there's only two choices this way or that way okay so we believe we are all on the narrow way but we have to understand some of our youngsters they go to broadway and the message of the hour showed us that somebody can be predestinated seed and being long on the broad way we see even the family of brother branham i mean his own son seeing the angel of the lord and needed his time and we see how brother brahma had that sovereignty of waiting until god calls him back if we believe that god calls people we can rest somebody leaves us never never throw dirt throw blessings yes but and what throw blessings amen never throw dirt because this will hinder him to come back easier these youngsters who go in the things of the world they need an intercessor they need an ester they need for somebody standing in the gap and says maybe they don't know who they are but i know who they are that is the way how god dealt with us when we were in the world god said alright that's my boy blessed be the name of the lord you see therefore we are not a cult we are church of the living god if we are church of the living god let us live like this let us act like this let us put all cultish nonsense away we have a message coming from the presence of our father blessed be the name of the lord so we have these two these two lines and imagine what happens is if a boy or girl leaves the message of the hour in between of or leaves the church in between of a very short time becomes completely worldly i mean we have a young girl in our in our little village coming with blue hair blue hair and one of the older sister was so shocked blue hair blue hair i said yes i mean she's a sinner therefore she she wears things like a sinner what do you want i mean she's just expressing what is she needs christ who who do you think will give her christ you do you think that the catholic church will have an answer for that girl or or any kind of occultism or whatever you're the answer for that girl so if you don't give a hand nobody can give in because you're the christ for your area but but sometimes we fear that i understand that that that that that uh that we're fearing there's an influence coming upon us if we but i mean don't we know who we are i understand we have some young people and here's what the bible says and i understand this because what happened is this when you leave a cult when you leave a cult it says if there if there come any unto that second john and bring not destruct him doctrine receive him not unto your house neither beat him god speed amen don't greet him this is biblical but you have to make it fit for the things of this world if somebody comes with a doctrine and he is telling let me talk about against the message of the hour you have to stop him just not here not here talk to your dentist talk to your dentist if you have a possibility yeah i had my the uncle of my my wife was a thing he was an unbeliever he always tried to evangelize me when i was and i was ah and they said yeah you know about this girlfriend but not here but you understand these youngsters said the moment we left the church if you are a jehovah witness and you leave the church you are not allowed anymore to see your family the moment's the same you're not allowed anymore if you will not see your grandchildren you will not see your children that is the spirit of fear to keep them in some kind like a group brother god beware that we ever enter in such a thinking because these ones if you know who you are you can give a hand to somebody who fell down brother brahm said these pharisees that would would never go into that stable in jerusalem because it was too much stinking they would look at that so god had to call shepherds sometimes i think we we have to pay attention not to become pharisees by saying oh i cannot deal with that no no no hey sinner needs a hand standing in the gap somebody who said brother you are stinking but you're my brother sister you're stinking but i see something more than your stinking body i see an element of god if somebody once loved god i believe there's some speck of life still in them they don't want to know and they don't want to accept something they are in complete amnesia but you are not an amazing amnesia i give you an example therefore what is hurting people who are leaving christianity is they walk on the street and here you have a precious sister or a precious brother and he sees somebody was formerly in the in the sunday school and now he comes as a sinner he walks as a sinner and here and here comes the precious sister you understand this hurts the feeling because they say for many many years i was precious so-and-so precious sister so and now i'm nothing i mean if somebody is your brother your sister he stays your brother and your sister keep him as your brother your sister in your heart you might disagree a hundred miles but if you're keeping up in your heart you will always have a feeling for that person i'll give you an example now now look for example the jehovah witness and it's tragic but we have to see these things you will be confronted if there is another generation you will be confronted as us in some cases that people say we were in a sect and you have to have an answer and then we have to say look maybe you maybe that was your impression maybe we did things a little bit out of balance maybe you're right maybe you're not right maybe it's just your excuse for your worldly living we have to see but there is a case that i heard about abuse child abuse over there and that one of these girls gave her testimony you see so she is abused by her sunday school teacher he's an older man she's just a young girl so she goes to the elders he said here he abused me with words with deets with uh whatever happened there and they say okay the bible says they have their handbook how to react on situation and you cannot bring accusation against an eldest if without two or three witnesses that's the bible but you will never have a child abused with two or three witnesses no will never work because if it's in the church these people know how to react easily they know how to they know how to maneuver these things that there is no witness okay so we have to update these things for our time so what happened this was given in the bible to to to protect the ministry but we have to protect the young children the same way today different it's another age it's a sexual age an immoral age so what happens is they said the girl says now i come before some kind like a tribunal ten eldest no woman i'm the only woman now i have to give all details what happens i have to tell the whole story intimidated just by 10 older brothers they are the eldest in the local church and here comes the brother who is the offender he is he he's the he does these things and you just have to say no this is a lie so and they asked the girl do you have witnesses no so case is settled and then that girl said this and they came to me and i said you cannot talk to nobody about this because you put blame and shame on the name of jehovah and so she had to carry that burden first if we do this do you understand that then we protect the church protects the offender but the church has to protect the victim do you understand that and somebody leaves they don't leave because of the doctrine because they understand have no protection they are so religious that they don't understand their case bring it in our life can you say amen so so there's a lot of things these these kind of thoughts come from calvinism calvinism he come is a is a further form from reformation and calvin was a man who was very strict and he wanted to establish his the city of geneva to be a pure city if you want or not but you have to understand if if you want to force holiness on people they become religious but not free you cannot reform an unbeliever you have first they need a new birth and then let's start with that kind of change in their life if not they become miserable message believers i mean calvin uh his the calvinistic doctrine i have a presentation but i will go in another subject today is this we are predestinated and we are predestinated to have success with god and for god the calvinistic idea was the base for the success of capitalism because calvinists know two things in their life praying and working there's no other thing going to holidays is already sin it's wasting god's time so you pray there's two there's two situations in life you're in church or you are at work the rest is wasting god's time so they become wealthy healthy pure precious uh if you're working 12 12 hours per day that's fine but it has it has nothing to do with the gospel therefore you see it became successful so that all protestant countries became rich amen and there's a there's a book about it the the the the basis of protestantism is or the basis of capitalism is protestantism because their mindset was if we have success god is pleasing we're pleasing god and we invest that money back all catholic countries are poor countries i mean even america is founded by the pilgrim fathers they were coming out of calvinism pure holiness movement you know holy uh how do you say liking to work no idle time disciplined all these things but that it has nothing to do with gospel gospel is heart and soul gospel is relationship to god i mean therefore brother branham picks it up and the calvinism and his strictness he speaks about sardis and he said he was nothing else than angry men worshiping god he said now let me read it out of the greek listen how it reads therefore leaving the principles of the doctrines of christ the atoned one we should push towards now i can read it he's reading hebrews chapter four i think it's brought out and not laying again the form here we are not laying again the form of reformation from the works causing death now this is lexicon it's absolutely not an interpretation at all it's just a greek word for what the english says and it says no we don't want to listen here not laying down foundations of reformations from works causing death now i will get it in your mind that's what i'm speaking here forms of reformation causing death paul said leaving the principles going to perfection third pull not laying again the foundation of repentance from that works faith towards god doctrines of baptism laying on our hands resurrection of the dead eternal judgment reformation causing death was the right word that's actually what paul wrote see what he's trying to do now brother brandon warns us there is a religion that looks good but it's dead therefore sardis was the time of the reformation and brother ramsey said it you have the name of the bible say that you live but you're dead amen you can have all these things but the most important thing that we have relationship with god can you say amen i mean therefore the things that i was that i was you make next one please that i was preaching until now do you see the claim for eternal destination these strange ideas the young people creating an image pure influence indoctrination is not a relationship between god and the man it's just a group listen sometimes people our group and our group and our church is is the best of the world and who do you want to talk about who's your father god or do we speak about another group can you say amen and our organization that we have we are we are sober we have a thousand people in this message um it's your organization your father i feel sorry for you we preach about heavenly things and then we preach about another another thing that we are here on earth but we have a heavenly family we are part of it can you say amen therefore you see sometimes people become ambassadors of a doctrine i have to to come to bcf to really let them know what the true word is you can sometimes see you are on a convention you see when people say amen or not i mean this is now only bcf but how they play around and you say for example i want to say one thing the baptism of the holy ghost is a definite experience and then he says but at the same time you receive the holy ghost without sensation amen wonderful amen and people think they can now applause to a preacher so that their opinion now is winning the the contest but we are too long on the way about this don't be an ambassador for a doctrine be an ambassador of christ give your brother give a hand if you even if you think he's wrong but if he loves the message who will now decide when the voice comes to brother branham all that you loved and all that you loved you will be there who is now deciding who is in or out who's the one who wants to decide amen amen keep these people as the family of god said i'm not agreeing but hey he let my heart be in the right tune for you if not you will make a circle where at the end only you yourself be the rest the only one amen and your children they come out of a sect you can be in a healthy church but your family is in a sect never compare families my children and your children in my yeah because of my forget these things amen we're individuals before god and brother we do our best to serve the lord and if you see if you feel sorry for your brother marcus just pray for him amen just saying mention brother mark is a nice boy good boy not nice boy by the good boy i mean he gets a haircut from jeremy so he's a little bit handsome in in that way amen so here we go the family of god this was one part and now now do you understand why we are preaching what we are preaching the opening of the word the third pull your identification amen therefore you need if we don't grow in the world sooner or later we fall into any kind of a doctrine so there is no stand still in the message of the hour you have to go forward if not you will come into denominationalism with the picture of brother branham at the wall and we think we are better because we know more brother it never worked until now it will not in the future or we are better because we have more miracles he said then better go to benny hinders than most miracles we are better because we are have a father can you say amen so here we have uh a precious man by the name of constantine and we go now in the positive side constantine he was one of these caesars one of these rulers over there in rome and rome was divided into two parts so human nature never likes an opponent therefore that's what i said many people in this message cannot handle opposition and god gives us opposition he wants to sh he wants to draw out of us what's in us many people cannot so they enter into a cold war but cold war is not the answer man exactly so and you say okay everything is said we will we will put brother so-so out we will never invite him uh we will put the family out the problem is finished god sends another problem because he wants to train us amen exactly so so here he we have the human nature of two opponents and constantine says look in this saloon is no room for two make a shootout okay billy the kid against the daltons okay here's here's a shootout billy the kid and the dolphins we were now tombstone we are back in tombstone because here is now some great fight between two roman emperors god is thinking in his mind that christianity will take over now for the next two thousand years the middle of europe and he is inspiring constantine constantine was a pure heathen he was not a christian he was a deal maker you make a deal tremendous tremendous deal so when he was going into that battle he he the night before or the day before he saw a cross over the sun and he hears these words hawk signal vince's in this sign you will win and he doesn't know that god but he thinks that sounds good so he puts the cross upon all the shields of his soldiers and they fight against maxenzius at the milivian bridge in rome and they win so from that time on constantine is not a believer but he is now propagating that god who gave him that victory he doesn't know who that god is called they call him christian christian but he seems to be very very powerful so we will make him our god for our our god protector instead of soul invictus now we have now two churches and these two churches have two big schools the two big schools in east rome and restroom is the divinity of jesus christ because with something he is just a man he's created and something he's part of god and both have their scriptures some said yes jesus said himself me and the father are one and the other one said yes but uh at the cross he said my god my god why did you forsake have you forsaken me so there were two big schools and you understand the problem when now rome rome turns to be one to be one kingdom and the christian doctrine the christian religion shall be states religion uh it is important that the leaders of that religion understand their own doctrine because you have to explain to all these other religions what they now have to believe and if they're not sure of themselves what do you explain to them you say it's a tremendous god but he doesn't know his own doctrine so therefore constantine he brought them together on that consul of nicaea that was the original brother bram said they should not have gone there exactly but they came together and and constantine was a deal maker he said look gentlemen i'm not interested in the solution but we'll have one solution if this consult is over we have one solution either jesus is eternal or he is just created like an angel that was the purpose of the nazi encounter constantine was not interested in the result he wasn't unbelievable he was an emperor exactly so the question is quite interesting because here we have that council and brother blame said and that is what constantine his successor did and i see an afternoon i see here they invite invited the people of god to convention and when the church sat down to eat and rose up to play partaking of church from ceremonies and pagan feasts named after christian rights she was trapped she had committed committed fornication and god walked out now the question was this and i want you now to put on your spiritual jacket to understand what our brother was preaching this morning there is a big difference between created and begotten or birthed created means i'm manufacturing anything i'm doing thing but birthing means part of me comes out of me i created many things i built many things but i have one daughter my daughter was not created my daughter was begotten and part of me of my dna is in my daughter that's the difference between something which is created and something which is begotten it's part of me the greek word is homo uzios means of the same nature as of the father therefore brother abraham said god in the beginning created the angel it was the first thing that he did and then he says the first thing that came out of god was the logos and i never understood what was now first but it's clear both are right because one was a creation and another thing was the birth exactly so so we see that brother brahm says he says he first was god jehovah and out of him let's just picture now a little drama so you can get it let's see coming out of space where there's nothing let's make it a little white light a little mystic light like a halo that was the logos that went out of god in the beginning that was the son of god that came out of the bosom of the father that was what was in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us in the beginning was god and then out of god came the logos a part of god that went out of god rather it was not a second it was the same person we don't have two gods we don't have a father and a son the son is the father and you say amen so there is no not two souls and not two gods and not two lords amen you can have two opinions you can have a spiritual nature and a human nature as we always say you you take two jews and you have three opinions oh as they told me in south africa they said brother mark is in south africa they need only four persons four persons all no matter if male or female to start four churches and five political parties because many people are double-minded to choose three opinions you can have it but you will not have two persons in the godhead that logos was not created it was birthed out of god can you say amen so then brother brahman says this and the eternal thoughts of god let me ask you are the thoughts of god eternal if you can see it this will then you will see many things god is unchangeable in both essence and behavior we have studied that and proven that already god is infinite in his ability so therefore his god must be omniscient if he is omniscient then he is not now learning nor is taking counsel even with himself nor he at any time adding to his knowledge if he can add to his knowledge he is not omniscient the best way we could say that sometimes he will be but that's not scripture he is omniscient he has never had a new thought about anything because all his thoughts he always had always will have he knows the end from the beginning because he's god does the thoughts of god are eternal they are real and now you put on your spiritual jacket they are not simply like a man with a blue plant he has drawn out which one day will be translated into substance in form but they are already real and eternal and part of god [Music] i mean the family of god now i tell you one thing brother brahm said so often god was alone with his thoughts is that correct that means he was not alone he was never wrong he was alone with his thoughts amen and if it's if it is so in what form ever there's no time no not for me but he was not alone he was alone with his thoughts so you're beginning you come from very very far away very far away amen um how do you see how it matches with this morning you see i mean look at this so one thing is here if according to what brother brandon said if the bride was in adam or eve was in adam and the bride was in christ part of christ really part of christ when god took made eve he took part of adam it's the same substance it's like when when when when when michelangelo had that little statue of moses and was hitting with the hammer brother said that was a true masterpiece because that was calvary and he said and when he was hitting it he was part of his knee was just flew away but you understand the substance of the statue and the statue of that little piece is the same substance [Applause] therefore we were reading what we were reading this morning he calls us brothers because we come from a royal family amen amen so so what happens is if the bride was in christ was in him and christ was melchizedek in theophany form in the old testament that means the bride was in melchizedek [Applause] and if and and before there was mercastic it was the pillar of fire that means the bride was in that logos and if the logos comes out of god that means the bride was in god [Applause] nobody can preach you out nobody can preach you do you understand this message is not a sect cannot be cannot can because it speaks of the family in heaven it speaks of your theophany it speaks of more than membership and be a nice person here no no i was born to be a bride even if you leave bcf you still are bright or if you come to bcf you are bright [Applause] nobody can preach you out you are not part of a system your joy doesn't come everybody in bcf loves me your joy comes from your father [Applause] as a minister my joy is not that everybody's tapping on my shoulder because sometimes we have to say things to correct that's so the joy is if my father is happy about what i said but if god is in you i'm i i know there is some kind like a connection of yes it fits you remember brother branham he brother branham brought the gospel to our hearts because martin luther was a typical german amen more on military things [Applause] but brother branham was a melancholic man was writing poems even about his fault he was asked by by the christian prison please please read the poem about the fault brother ramsey i couldn't do it but that was the man writing a poem about his automobile that was our messenger the two sides so so he tells that story you have to make life to these things what the brother was preaching this morning how it fits together he said he said here is a young man he just plays violin you know and he gives his first concert and the people are so enthused they stand up and they're singing in uh they're shouting bravo which means great or bravissimo that means very wonderful and brother ram said this the boy is not interested what the audience is but right up there is his master and if his master applause the voices [Applause] brother we do not think that we're tapping one another's shoulders you are maybe not a preacher nobody knows your name but god knows your name all heaven knows who you are let your words be born in a manger of my heart you are more than just a bcf yen that is already much bcf is much you're more than just i'm a message believer you're more than this before there was a message you were there [Applause] and by no means we are branhamites by no means we are fans of anything in this message we come from god but as we are coming from god we understand god's voice to the messenger blessed be the name of can you say amen so so you understand and i give you some examples and i would like to make it for the young people to make tangible some of the things do you understand if we are children of a father we have to act like our father we cannot stay pentecostal babies in this message and he said this and he said this and i'm giving up a hey we had this time and god said to all of us marcus stand before me like a man stop being childish stop being over sensitive stop these things where were you man when the sons of god were shot in such a way he said do you understand there's even many people that cannot forgive they cannot forget um it's because they don't know exactly who they are it's still pentecostal baby with a very nice stock train but brother god calls us to go higher than this blessed be the name in a maturity here is the man uh here we know that these pictures uh that was done by by 1950 houston coliseum we see how reverend best comes to to to uh to to now blast against the healing ministry of brother branham we see how rf f bosworth comes and now matching him ff bosworth he is a doctor he comes out of the baptist church he knows their doctrine so what happens is this that that when ff boss was comes brother bryan said i allow you to go only if you don't make any kind of a fuss so the debate starts and f boss was just says one said do you reverend best do you believe that the seven compound name of jehovah referred to jesus christ and that was all and brother blame said this i even never thought about that [Laughter] so he learned the lesson brother brown was great enough to learn from his brothers and from his sisters once you see a man you know who thinks he's the man of the hour you know he didn't understand very much exactly so so so when this happens was too much i always said this reverend best was not good enough reverend beth was not good enough he was the best for the baptist church but not for the message amen so so when he was blowing up he was making some pictures uh with his fist under the the the chin of ever boss what here because what brother abraham says he says and god did not allow that these pictures were developed god had so much respect for a baptist minister brother don't you think that we have to think twice if we talk anything about ministers in this message we have no right to expose anything god is exposing amen we have no right to talk things to to to put assumption or whatever god in his way will have great respect for his family many times we mean well therefore i'm so against all these chat rooms and so forth i always tell our young people no comment because one day you stand before god no comments about nothing keep a man of god in the hands of god you are not his boss if he feels to be this way let him go i'm a traveler i go to many churches there's many things that i don't agree very much with it whatever kind of things but i said look that man is placed here for his church if he feels that way let him go if he asks me i give him a i can deal with it but if i'm not asked i'm not have no right now to renovate the whole church amen god did not allow that how many so what happens the the man who made this picture was a critic of brother branham and he thought it is just psychology and and and was not a believer anyhow and we know and i believe that was really the starting point of our most number brother chair to show how brother branham was hunting and he went over to to to to set this boy free from the electric chair and one week later he came and he met those angels very clear from the bible because the bible said it that way the boy who was now on in the death row was the son of the critic who made the picture of the pillar of fire that was his son and now i want to show you one thing about the patience of god we say we know that brother brain said to i think to fred softman he said these angels were waiting for me here all week so first of all we say what a noble man william branham was the man who was criticizing him he's going to save his children his child going there for a whole week by car to to to to to houston speaks to the governor convincing the governor showing the governor mr governor i don't know if the boy was guilty but he said god did not kill someone in in the god never killed cain who are you to kill that boy and the governor understood and and pardoned the boy so the father was so enthused about brother branham he said the very man that i was criticizing is now coming saving my son do you understand how far we are sometimes away that way of dealing with things how far away we are but here comes something greater not only brother branham waited six days the angels waiting for what for a boy who was an unbeliever do you understand this the angels waiting six days so that this boy could be saved from the electric chair god is interested in life we say this is just sawdust no message no nothing stameron god thinks different and the more we enter into maturity we think different become we are less judgmental and more helpful because we know one thing if god doesn't help the person nobody will help him you understand you will become queen esther amen can you say amen amen here is here is eric liddell let me put this on again because can you say amen so far i mean here's eric liedell eric liddell was a runner in the in the beginning of last century they call him the scottish locomotive he was having he was heading to the olympic games for two finals in the first one i think it was 400 meters he was the favorite the second one he just entered into the final so he was a preacher in some kind like a anglican church and he was a runner and a football player at the same time what happened is this his final where he was the favorite started on a sunday and he refused to run though the gold medal was our issue and even the the the minister the prime minister tried to intervene because he was running for england was quite an expensive thing to to to to to bring these sporters in this place but he refused he said sunday will not run he said sunday is the day of the lord so during the week he never had another final but he was not at all the favorite for it so when he was uh right preparing for the for for for that run for that race the american trainer so there's many good things in america the american trainer came and gave him a leaflet just a piece of paper and he put it in his pocket and he was running that race and he was winning as a great surprise so when he was getting his price uh his gold medal whatever he's pulling out that little piece of paper that the american trainer the coach gave it to him and it was a leaflet out of the bible in the first book of psalms where it is written those who honor me i will honor brother it matters to serve the lord amen it matters to honor god because god will honor you god will not forget because god is a gentleman god loves to bless people brother if somebody is in the world and he is he knows nothing about the gospel and he just gives you a glass of water god says in my mind he will get his reward for this that's our father so christians are generous people christians therefore i was i was new in the church and i came and here come this youngster into sunday school i came in like this i did not know who the parents were but i found out who their parents were because the couple came in like this brother the way they came the children came you honor god sometimes people come into the church like like they want to go to for beach volleyball if it's wonderful this afternoon's beach volleyball you don't have to change even it's wonderful brother you honor god in many ways by your clothing by being early enough by praying by praising by being there not sleeping in the church but being there said i always say sleep in bed and pray in church don't pray in bed and sleep in church amen amen have you have you ever seen some we have some kind like a like a church service or we make some kind like a family altar and here comes here comes satan [Music] [Laughter] and then you see people sleeping and there's only wait one way to wake them up this is my last thought and then at the at at the end of the church they come and shake your hands brother marcus it was such a blessing such a blessing what did you dream of a mercedes benz or [Applause] but we have to understand when we come to church we are in a spiritual warfare amen do you understand this you will never sleep in a soccer game in a football game never but once the word of god starts i mean [Music] have you ever seen that you were for example winston you were sick and just a little flu just a little and then you hear a voice you cannot go to church you will cross a pandemia right with your flu no don't you no no no have you ever heard that voice that means that voice speaks english and german [Applause] do you understand do you know if satan tells you no no you better stay home and you say to say no you stay home you stay home you get it i mean the way these these little things pleasing god pleasing god little things the more sacrifice you bring the more god blesses you brother if our attitude is right god takes care of the doctrine but if our attitude is wrong then our doctrine can be fine it is just knowledge nothing more to puff us up and think where this where it is forget it if your heart is right with god the holy spirit will bring that doctrine in its time can you say amen blessed be the name of the lord here we have brother brahm he is he is that great man of of donovan words it happened i looked over to his ear i seen his ear all swallowed up it said what's the matter donovan that ear he said brother branham he has been there all long time i don't know i just miss caught him by the hand there was a big cancer on his here never said one word just held it it was off my brother in a day or two after that there wasn't even a scar left it was his respect to the god of heaven by the quickening power killed the cancer and spared the life of donovan words brother if you want to teach your children something is to respect god and he respect his family first the preachers not because they are preachers but because they are always visible whatever they do and then respect the family of god if it's a sister if it's a brother if it's an older one if it's a young one brother even our children we have to respect them because our children are our brothers and sisters because if we are both having a car accident we have the same theophany the same age our children are not our little animals they belong to god they are just under our care for some time but our children our brothers and sisters can you say amen so all these things god for god they are important we think we just honor the great preachers but i believe god is in in the behind the flesh of a little sister blessed be the name of the lord can you say amen amen here's brother branham come and as i said we should have come directly into our theophany although in that sentence there is a contradiction a very nice contradiction brother brahma said we should have come in our theophany and and and we came like adam now adam was first in a theorem exactly so so we leave these kind of schools there but here we bypass let's say we bypassed our theorem and we landed in north carolina god never asked us do you want to be white or black male or female god never asked us and god puts us in the body that we don't like i mean if if if we would have been asked who should be your father i would say mr rockefeller but god puts us in simple situations god puts us in minds where we are we are standing in our own way now i want you to put on your spiritual jacket you must see both sides if not you get frustrated we are heavenly beings but still we are living in america we are in revelation chapter four that is very very clear absolutely taken up but at the same time tomorrow morning you go to work you work for general motors you are not dancing around the throne you work for general motors you have a family you create the children if you want to have a new baby you do it the conservative way you don't you don't you don't speak it into existence you have to do it the natural way can we say it like this amen you live in this world but at the same time you have to manage your life on this earth if not we can become a cult here's brother branham and put on the spiritual jacket brother branham receives the baptism of the holy ghost as a young boy but in the message on the wings of a snow white dove he says i was a neurotic all my life that means before his conversion with his conversion and after his conversion he was a neurotic okay he says i was a melancholic all my life exactly that means we have a new body which is growing into us our own theophany but at the same time we are still living in these elements therefore one of the pentecostal wrong doctrines was the perfection of our body we will never perfect it because we will leave it one day and go into our eternal body therefore i always say this i'm a very sympathetic person but you don't know me i live in a german tent i mean but if this earthly tabernacle will be dissolved that is for me the tenth vision if this earthly tabernacle will be dissolved i will enter into my real body in my real in my real being so here we have brother branham the seals are open he is full of the holy ghost and he wants to give up whenever brother branham wants to give up god comes on the scene and he takes him up onto a higher level he comes in the cave and says i explain to you your peculiar birth brother brahm is down he's he he is depressed and god says if i show you behind the curtain of time will it help you he said it will help him he brings him up he sees these people brother bram said i'm not the same anymore he comes back two years later he preaches the present stage of my ministry he said everybody has forsaken me all forsaking me this and this and this you understand he's a man who was so much in his men and colleagues thinking god comes again says i have to cheer up my messenger he says here he is in clifton's cafeteria the boy says he brings a prophecy because thou has chosen the way you will have and which portion of heaven is god doesn't say and we will see therefore what about our theophany if you will have it theoretically you have it already god will not say just before your death ah what about brother sons was he always in church did you always pay his thai things maybe he gets a theophany theory is not a reward it's your true body your geophone is older than your your natural body because it's an eternal body coming from the presence of god amen so so here we have the man he gives up in his mind but part of eternity is in him there's something in you that cannot give up anymore can you say it's not here but it's here amen so so so so so whenever god comes he brings him on a higher level and here here comes that voice he says look to the west and what does god say to brother bran that's your life what does it mean that's your life i ask you the question when were these mountains when were they created 1963 they were created when god formed the earth knowing that his seventh angel will be a melancholic type of a person and then god says no it doesn't say look you have the open word you have this he said let that stand if there is ever a doubt in your mind remember this place do you understand we have these things in us but still in our mind we can be completely in amnesia and god all therefore it's so good to come in the house of the lord because god always remembers us of our true identity therefore we should not preach trump we were preaching about the blood moons or no blood moons there was nothing wrong with but it never helped nothing we have to preach about things with substance preach about covet no kuwait and trump and we preach about biden or whatever these things we will never change let's speak about things [Music] amen can you say amen can you say amen so one thing is sure amen god says to brother branham this is your life and i tell you one thing as much as the spoken word is in your heart but this is your life can you say amen so there's one thing sure if you are on the mountaintop never become arrogant oh that family and their children yeah only believe only believe that something is wrong because god says okay we will send you the next valley but if you are in the valley never give up never give up because one thing is arriving the next mountain is coming can you say amen god has a vision about our life god is not nervous when we become nervous because we have a representation can you say amen therefore that is the story behind israel god is placing everything in his mind according to his plan i mean so even theodore herzl you know whenever a nation was destroyed they never came back you take the at stakes you take the incas you take the mayas you take the mongols you take the assyrians the persians the egyptians whenever a supernation was destroyed they never came back but only one nation that's israel and brother brahman said it like this he said if a revival ever dies it will never come back so don't waste your time trying to bring a pentecostal revival in a church this thing is over we have more than we ever had amen because brother bram said we live on the ashes of the revival at the same time he says the bride did not have her revival yet that means it's another revival then we had it in the former ages another form so god thought about israel being in their place even theodor herzl we go to argentina or we go to uganda but god let them that they were right in palestine and god was leading even the second world war so they had to go back into their homelands and brother abraham said this in the seventh seal he said there will be 12 000 of all nations of all tribes he said they don't know who they are but god knows them that means in 2000 years god was always watching their families the same for you do you remember you have a theophany and you are theophany has a certain look but the brahman said meter had the same black hair over there as she had here so god had to form your image according to your own theophany you cannot have a theoretical with black hair and blonde here on this side because it matches so god had to put over many generations the father and mother together that you have the look that you are can you say amen brother blame said in the message things that are to be god was planning our birth for many generations we are not here by accident we are here because we are ambassadors you can say i came into this world to be a light can you say amen you are a light at that place where you are nobody can take your place don't you understand how we have to grow to become that light how that church has to leave childish things unmuch immature thing to come into the position that we have that we should be can you say amen so look at this finishing amen man when we were talking about that young girl we cannot help somebody who comes out of the jehovah witnesses we cannot help god has to call that person to the message of the hour but we can do a lot of things for our own young people to be very much aware do we lead them into a cult or into the freedom of christ that is our great responsibility amen here is a young man and he is i got many of those some of these cases and brother i want to tell you one thing the message that we believe has a transforming power but it is it takes time the time is over that we make a prayer line and santa claus comes and prayers and and puts all our problems away it is a process every church service that we have is a therapy amen because we were born the wrong way and we are molding more in the image of our true being who we are really it's a process it's a dying it's not only being baptized at baptist with the holy ghost no then it's a dying from day to day from situation and god puts more possibilities to die we ask for a picnic god brings problems because he's not interested in us being blessed and going to the tribulation god sponsor takes us home but he needs to find character here's a young man and this is just an example he's way overweight we're not not we're not talking now about the physical we talk about the natural the spiritual okay because i see a lot of people here they are overweighted so don't feel don't feel attacked right now okay we speak about the spiritual. but brother and i and i got several cases here's a boy he has given up okay that way he cannot work he's just he just hangs around i always call him the couch potato a true couch potato cannot work cannot stand up he's just hanging around the question is how can i help this brother how can i help the boy if i love him i want to help him i can tell him and i hope i'm not finding the right words i can tell him you are just a fat loser that's true but does it help him we can't tell him the truth but does that true help truth help that boy will not help it it will just bring a bigger complex so his father comes you're you're worthy for nothing man in your age i was building already two houses you are hanging just around so he will become more and more introverted his mother comes oh the poor boy he he cannot he cannot move anymore so i have to bring him back breakfast to bread she's not helping neither because because if that boy finds out the only thing that i have to do is just lay down and somebody comes and brings it to me i will lay down more and he brings more that is the problem in when people have to come out of their couch but that boy has to find out now the boy comes into the prayer line and he says pray for me that i will lose weight spiritual that will not work that will not work the thing that he has to do he has to move and he has to eat less and has to eat the right thing but he wants to go from prayerland to prayerland thinking santa claus comes and takes his problem away [Music] i told you many times we were unbelievers and and what happens i was fan of arnold schwarzenegger and sylvester stallone so we were watching those films and and i remember that arnie he was just making his breast mess and i was just a young boy so we were making bodybuilding and i went before the mirror and nothing moved but what i learned is this if you want to have muscles you need have to eat a steak you cannot eat mcdonald's and if you want to have spiritual muscles you cannot eat facebook you need spiritual food in due season [Applause] that boy needs somebody who loves him he must find a friend somebody who read because love is not words love you you feel if a person loves you you feel it if he just wants to correct you you feel but you if if somebody loves you you feel it he first needs a friend he first needs the content and one thing is sure superman is in that boy he just needs training and he just have to change his diet and you tell him look if we make our training together in one year from now you are a runner he doesn't believe but he needs somebody who paints that picture for his eyes that's how it works in the natural and the first thing he will not even come out of his couch and he needs someone who puts him the sports shoes on his feet that's that's our ministry brother that's our ministry helping him out and he cannot run he will just walk for 100 yards and he goes back on his couch and we say the training of today is finished great done wonderful tomorrow we make 10 yards more and he has but he can only start if he has a vision that it works that superman lays in me i make it i can't make it if i have the discipline do you understand what brother brandon did with us when he said quickening power brought us behind brought me behind the curtain of time and i see all of you there he shows no matter how much you are standing in your own way but you're there already how may no matter how much you suffer with with with whatever it is traumatizer child abuse uh your own no matter what you're suffering with but you're already there and the thing that you do is you watch now that picture of that perfect person and you are now developing into that same picture [Applause] do you understand what this message makes with us and brother ram said if you want to get healing he said you must see yourself to be a healed person and you're walking into that image step by step do you understand how important is that we are not preaching a complex to the people what they are not but we have to tell the people who they are because we did not know who we were and then our father came down and said you are not from georgia you are not from ohio you live in an ohio tent but your true being comes from another dimension you did not know who you are but i know who you are because i play i place part of me in you and then this message starts slowly but surely to form us not to reform us but by the opening of the word we find out who we are truly can you say amen blessed be the name of the lord here's what brother abraham said it's such a wonderful blessing to know the lord jesus as our savior to know him as our healer and looking for him to come as our kingdom to set up a kingdom on earth that we shall rule and reign with him for a thousand years with him he said and i told you last time here there was a new ministry coming i spoke with some of the brethren today i was telling them about what happens just remember that's the first time i was here you remember the lord had told me something was going to happen changing in the ministry it happened said another one is going to happen and it happened now there is another one greater far greater than all the rest of them put together already confirmed and ready i hope it happens tonight i just might say that i don't have time to explain it to you but to the president who doesn't know about it it's wonderful it's such a great thing for the people and i am grateful to god that our is soon at hand when god is going to help his children especially it will be for those who can't muster the faith to raise up and get a hold of god like they should i believe the lord is doing providing a way for us now to take care of them also some runs into faith that they just can reach over and receive anything that's great faith some of them has mustered seed faith and has wait so long to get through i believe the lord is making a way for those people now i don't know when it will be but it will be just as certain as i'm standing i it will be his brother brahmi speaks about the changing in his ministry and it doesn't deal any more with william brennan but god will change his ministry to help those who are weak in faith those who want to make it but they cannot make it those who are weak in themselves and god says i come down myself personally i will be your faith i will be your rapture blessed be the name of the lord so he reveals our true identity he says we shall rise in him we become part of him the easter the revealed secret of god like it was then life after death we are now alive who were once dead in sin and trespasses the true easter seal has broken death from around me and i'm alive the easter seal at the beginning broke the seal of the roman seal the easter seal that was that he was sealed up a man when he died was gone but broke the seal and revealed the secret and now god by his holy spirit has broke the seal from around our lives and christ is revealed as he lives in us for now we are quickened with him the opening of the seed is not a doctrine that we know it's revealed who we are and once you know who you are you know you made it already there once you know you made already there you understand this is human nature and you leave human nature like this because some of the things you will never change we always thought the new birth takes everything out of it but reality found us if this is so i believe there's no one here who is born again because i know you too well inclusive your precious brother mark because we know one another too well that we're not living on slogans but i believe here's a lot of people born again but we still have that old nature but we have something in us which is greater than that old nature takes it in his control we have that black dog and we have that white dog can you say amen so therefore we see the picture here and we see and brother branham this picture was made in 1959 and brother bryan refers it to the book of ezekiel and to revelation chapter four so here's the grace of god he said we say the church has to go up yes but what about god coming down in our dimension amen amen god coming down helping his children so these things that we see the revelation 3 4 is reality for us brother when we come into the house of the lord believe that the angels of the lord are there believe that the pillar of fire is there but ah that means brother marcus we are past the rapture spiritually we are in raptured condition absolutely but isn't it true we are still in revelation 3 from our normal living because general motors is not around the throne amen your working place on monday morning is not around the throne it is in lima ohio so we are living here but at the same time we are already in revelation chapter four can you say amen lester be the name of soul so once we understand we are we can now grow because we know we have our earthly being but we have our true identity is now influencing us more and more and more that she becomes him can you say amen so therefore that's what i said this morning everybody who does not want to grow you will end up in a sect some guru is waiting for you who wants your money who wants your membership wants to have him in his place he wants to manipulate you he wants to correct you he wants to rule over you he wants to reign over you somebody will get you amen but if you're in christ nobody gets you amen you have a father and then you go to a church you are subject to the church it's not a problem for you at all but your but but but your identity is your father you don't have to fight for a doctrine you don't have to fight for ideas you don't have to fight for conspiracy theories if covet comes from this does it come from a monkey or does it come from a laboratory that no matter where it comes from god allowed it it's here we have other problems in just kovitz my soul is more important than my kovic we preach about other things we bring people into another dimension can you say amen at the same time we know how to rule our families a young boy came to me he said brother marcus i'm not working anymore not working that's fine because we have a social system and so it's we have a social system in germany which allows you not to work he said i'm not working i'm a christian that's fine he said no because in millennium we are not working so i feel that we're already portraying what is million we're not working there so i'm not working here brother i think that is the false interpretation of that whole thing um we have to work we do things we have family we have headaches we have things we go to the dentist we go everywhere but at the same time there's some part of us already in that other dimension we're feeding not from a man with freedom from the body word of the son of man we are not a sec this message is not a sect no this is family of god somebody is missing you're not throwing dirt you say this is my brother god bless him god help him god call him god if if you want to come back here's an open door we take care of one another my brother is not he's isolated a little bit let's move let's visit my little brother how are you doing brother yes there's problems and i made mistakes yes we all made mistakes let's go on like a brother said if somebody throws dirt on you you just let it dry put it away go on let nothing stop you can you say amen you must handle both dimensions if not you become cultish we have seen these people amen they cannot even say goodbye oh hello shalom [Music] shalom i'm already yeah i'm already what already in lima ohio what i mean if you have children you make yourself ridiculous you must be a man's man you must stand on this earth and at the same time no i have a connection in the other dimension i'm i'm not a hillbilly from lima ohio i'm part of the family of god my true identity is there i'm waiting for my body change can you say amen amen finishing amen amen here's what i wanted to read two two two more that i'm leaving can you say amen do you understand we're just what we heard this morning putting into practical things into a practical here's what brother blame the resume of the ages not for one moment i do bring a message to the people that made that they may follow me or join my church or start some fellowship or organization i have never done it will never do that is the last page of the church books i have no interest in those things but i do have an interest in the things of god and people and if i can accomplish just one thing i will be satisfied that one thing is to see establish a true spiritual relationship between god and man that is a true minister of god he's not putting people to himself but just make a relationship between god and man once once that ministry of eliezer brought rebecca to isaac when when when when rebecca saw isaac brother that is the problem too much people in this message they want to marry eliza they fall in love with eliezer but rebecca just falls in love with isaac amen in the evening time and they went in their mothers attend the tent vision exactly so and what did eliezer do which was withdrawing himself my time is over my ministry is over amen amen this is the last one hallelujah amen this is made by by national geographics i mean this is an eagle attacked by a craw or some kind like an animal okay this is an unbeliever and he made a little film but one of the pictures out of it so the crow is sitting on the back of the eagle and just hitting him on the head and that eagle when he was attacked that way did not do anything was just flying okay was not fighting that bird on this back but at certain time that eagle just rised up and went up and up and up and that eagle knew one thing hey my friends if you you better you better lose your grip because i go now in a region if you want to follow me brother you got a problem man you got that he was not fighting that thing he just went up you will not fight the devil you're not you will not change politics you will not change your country the thing that you have to do is rising up into another dimension right around the throne knowing who you are really even if you see weaknesses in your life you can say this is not my true being this is this is the body that i live in if god doesn't change i will die with it what can you do if you're sitting in a wheelchair if god doesn't deliver you you're the same eagle has nothing to do with your inner being god allows many many things in our life so don't never look on your own on your outside body look on the on the eternal part which is right in here can you say amen and therefore we come to church always oppressed and depressed amen and here if god allows then we just take that okay brother you want to make a right with me [Music] and we go up in regions where he doesn't understand anything if the musicians would come blessed be the name of the lord this message i want to repeat myself is not a cult it's not a sect it's not a denomination we are not supposed to do anything about that this message is god's plan for his children blessed be the name of the lord i mean maybe you have a nice song like do you have the song as the deer pants for the water i mean let me finish with that little with that little thought i mean i hope that somebody comes out of these meetings and says from my outside i'm just a hillbilly from lima ohio but i'm but i'm more than this what is your purpose to criticize around in the no my purpose is to be a light for my father on my job where nobody else you are an intercessor absolutely so because people will be judged one day the way they treated you this changes our attitude on work amen we know how to behave ourselves amen we know what one thing nobleness obligates nobleness no bless oblige nobleness obligates amen and if we say if we're really mispleasing god by being childish there's something in us that says i have to make these things right it's not correct because i'm i'm a child of a of a mighty king this bride has a high calling brother one day she will stand and what she will judge things how can we judge eternal things if we cannot even judge our marriage little things in the church so god wants a church to really become in becoming mature if you play softly the song amen [Music] david if everything is closed don't fear that you that want to make it longer but again putting a little bit heart and soul to that thing i mean maybe that's my ministry to put heart and soul to the doctrine man but all the bible is the revelation of our father we find ourselves in that brother bran speaks about david and his gallant soldiers mighty man he calls him brother brandon refers to them in the message there's a man who can turn on the light david was such a tremendous king and these people they loved that man so much when david was in bethlehem or in that cave and the man were around him david had just a wish just a desire [Music] just a fresh string from the well in bethlehem amen and these men and brother brahms said this this man so much love david love is not a feeling they so much love that man that the least of his wishes were command for them love is mortar i hope that we can talk to somebody who disagrees with us that we give them a call and said hey brother one thing i want to say you i love you brother honestly not just blah blah blah blah blah brother i really love you we disagree but i want to say i want to do nothing in my life to hurt your feelings because i know who you are and if i did please forgive me i mean well i mean i hope we tell sometime our wife hey honey after all this year i'm still loving you they're loving you you say do you do it brother marcus no i don't do it no i should do i know i should do but but i'm i'm in my own way i need god i need god to change things in my life i need god but i won't be changed because we're children of a father but what i'm doing is calling some time brother and saying hey brother i want to tell you one thing i'm just thinking about you i'm a little bit over this guy but just want to say i will i'm just praying right now for you that you know he is a brother on the other side of the ocean thinking about you and you see how that blessing always comes back to you sometimes we should more express these things so these men they were just fighters but the brahms said they were man that not no they know they did not knew what what what fear was they said that general squatskopf in the iranian war that was the type of a man he did not know what fear was so he was i think was the first parachutist over there in in the iraq war fighters you know you can see them all these tattoos he said and they went out to take their sword one took the bucket you touched my bucket smack your face man [Music] 14 miles through philistine countries just because of the wish of the king he did not the king didn't say you you you that is how sects work they command you they tell you what to do you you you you do this but in the house of god is different if it's not love it must be your our own will not somebody telling us always what to do like the jehovah witnesses and you go now evangelizing this in this street no we're different we do things as a spirit tells us no we're not we're not an organization we're a family of god okay you give me my liberty and you have your liberty okay i'm not your commander god must be your commander okay so when they came back and gave that to david they were so touched and he took that water as a water offering before the lord said that was the blood of these men do you see how the blood becomes water and the water becomes blood and when david became king at that same time this man came into their position [Music] same time no matter what the world tells about the message we know what it is we're not interested what somebody writes in any kind of crooked website about the messi we know what it is so don't waste your time i mean we understood that's our father talking to us and brother brahm said this he said these men knew that david one day will come into power they knew it by revelation so you know who will come into power jesus christ and when he comes into power we come into our position everything is a big love letter of god god and his children the bridegroom and his bride and we are part of that whole picture this bride is not manhandled she's in the hand of almighty god so let us sing the song and let us pray together god bless you all [Music] deer panties fall the water sold my soul longer than [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] should [Music] my friend and you are my brother [Music] [Applause] [Music] i want you to [Music] for you [Music] my [Music] you [Music] i want you more you can say [Music] joy [Music] me [Music] me [Music] now while the music is softly playing i know i'm over time i beg you really pardoned for this but i make an altar call but the altar is in your heart okay but i don't want to have that we're just raising hands by raising hands i think we don't want to get to enter into a sector as a chair we don't want to have a cult no the brothers brother stephen we want the people really but it takes you yourself to really say heavenly father let me grow let me grow into that image let me be pleasing to you many of our reactions that we've showed in the past were just human nice nice nice message believing human people acting and reacting god sees it he overlooks their children that's fine but hey we have to come up a little bit higher is that okay for you amen if you really feel it in your in your heart you say lord even if it takes pressure even if it takes molding and training even if i have to come out of my comfortable couch my couch potato thinking of just going to church and but lord let me be what you desire for me to be before the foundation of the world let me be a true bride let me walk like it talk let it dress like it react like it take all these green things out of me and let me ripen in the sun and if you really feel it on your heart you can raise your hand or you can even stand up i mean ask brother franco not to fail into the audience because i believe these are holy moments that we should never interfere this is between each and everyone i will close my eyes the same way but my desire is really to live for the honor and the glory of god being a message minister not to act like a denominational pentecostal baby but being a man of god who understood things in life let me have patience with me myself and let me have patience with others let me have grace for those who criticize me let me have a feeling for those who doesn't have feelings let me have an open hand for those who don't see the light anymore let me have grace let me be a person who can stand in the gap because i understand the need of my brother in need of my sister lord don't let me be just a giving just commands what is wrong we all see what's wrong it's not very difficult to see what's wrong but let us be men and women standing in the gap and if we see something wrong and our brother or sister stand before the throne and ask for mercy and take the position of those angels as we heard this morning and so help my brother help my sister and help me myself to always keep my heart clean loving before you father lord and if there is something that is mispleasing you i don't speak about the things of the world of television whatever that's bad but don't let even worldly thinking political thinking come in my mind let me be a free man of god following let me never be intimidated by nobody but let me stand before you that when pilate came and said are you a king and you can say yes i'm the son of a king just in earthly vessels but in me i'm a son of the almighty father take our hands let it not be just nice meetings father and say it was a blessing it was fun it was great but let us say lord let me grow come a little bit higher in your presence to act like you to think like you and heavenly father i'm so minded about that fact that even the angels were waiting for six days until that boy who was an unbeliever who was set free from the electrical chair that was your spirit you were commanding those angels waiting on the prophet heavenly father let us have that same attitude for those who don't know who they are maybe they are very nasty to us but don't let us be back nasty we're sons of a king we're different so we ask your father for the service for tomorrow morning will you take it in your hands speak to us again through our most noble brother shambo bless our muslim pastor for the chat for these meetings and the brothers all around that's the brand and family father rest the pastors all around that are here bless their ministry breath their life and bless their churches so we lay everything into your hands ask these things in the name of the lord jesus christ amen that's fine for you i'm giving over to the pastor we sing again i have a father if that is okay for you i beg your pardon i was too long i know it i just see right now the watch please forgive me your german hillbiddy i have a fight [Music] me [Music] [Music] he knows [Music] he knows why [Music] he [Music] let's all stand and sing it again am [Music] you'll [Music] never wear [Music] [Music] he's [Music] amen amen how many been encouraged by the word and also challenged by the word amen it's a challenge to come up higher in the life of christ amen what good is the word if it doesn't change our lives what was the point of the message to bring us an identification so we could keep acting the way we always acted and continue on acting the way we acted in denominations but i believe it was to reproduce the life of jesus christ in bright form that she becomes a reflection of him and all we can say is god help us [Music] god help us what we desire is to be your representation on the earth the ambassador from heaven lord but god we need your help amen come into the life born wrong raised in what we were raised in heard what we've heard experienced what we've experienced but all we can say is god help us this is our desire but i believe one thing for sure if our desire matches his desire we can have what we ask for amen amen how many believe that's his desire to have himself manifested in a mini-membered bride so i believe our desire matches his desire and i'd like to say lord manifest yourself in me knock off those parts that need knocked off lord amen bring out the parts that need brought out but lord don't let me continue on in a way that's not pleasing to you amen the bible said jesus christ went about doing good [Music] so jesus christ is is on earth again in a many bitter body what should she be doing amen going about and doing good amen i say god i'll give you this body if you'll take it amen i'll give you my life if you'll take it you've got some work to do amen i can't do it only you can do it there's a work cut out for you lord but if you want this body you can have it amen if you want this life you can have it and i don't know how you'll do it there's a lot of work yet to be done but if you want a vessel to live through i'll give you this one amen but you've got to do the work i can't do it amen all i can do is give it to you you're going to have to supply your spirit and manifest your word amen and i believe if that prayer matches god's heart and two desires match his and yours i believe he'll give us what we ask for amen amen god's been good to us friends i love the word of the lord i love when the word corrects i love when it admonishes i wonder i love it when it encourages i love it when it calls us the eagles to fly a little higher god is so good amen when you start flying he said that's good you're flying praise god i'm proud of you you're flying now let's come just a little bit higher amen and we thought we were already flying as high as we could fly we thought we made it to the top but then god always raises the top and says okay now fly a little higher and he's proud of us each time we move amen but i think god for us i think what we're seeing is he's raising the top again and he wants us to fly a little higher and i say god if you'll help me i'll follow you amen god bless you be be in prayer as you go be in prayer for tomorrow's services play for pray for our brother marcus that the lord will restore to him more than he gave out amen the lord will bless him abundantly and strengthen him man he has so much still in his heart so many places he goes so many things that he does and i just pray that the lord will bless him in his ministry bless his family bless his home church and i pray you bless the same people praying for our brother stephen chimbo as he comes in the morning to bring the word lord willing man and god bless you if you can make it here we'd love to have you again and we know that the local churches will be in their own churches and god bless you and your services but those who've traveled up will be here all weekend god bless you we hope to see you in the morning amen let's just bow our heads and thank the lord for his word lord jesus i thank you for your word lord i thank you god on how you take a vessel of clay and you use it lord in such a supernatural way for god we can realize it's not the clay it must be you nor we just ask god that you would help us to match the picture you've painted in your word god you were so good to us that when you brought a wave sheath on the earth in our day you plucked up the first part of the word to come to harvest maturity and that part of the word came to maturity in a vessel that was the prophet of the age and you waved it over the congregation and you didn't wave it over as to say here's what you must be you must be perfect see if you can attain to this but you waved it over showing that the same word that brought this to maturity will bring the rest of the crop to maturity so god you've already shown that you can live your life and man you've already showed that there can be human flesh that can reflect your very life your very nature your very power commit and can be the word made flesh in their day and you did it in our brother william branham and you waved that before us to show us not that we have to climb to this but to show us that whatever brought him here will bring you here too and we believe that lord we have confidence in that process that by the bright shining light of this august sun you will bring us into rapture maturity lord god i pray that you'd help us lay in the presence of this son and bake all the greenness out of us lord that we might be all that portion of the word you've predestinated for this day to manifest your life we believe it we accept it by faith we allow the process to work in us lord and we have confidence that you will do what you said you will do oh how we
