so when abel comes to bring his offering this is not uh this is not if i could say it this way this is not reading on a piece of paper you must offer a lamb and then giving a lamb but this is catching something from the mind of god that has to do with why he must make an offering to begin with why he is outside of the garden why he is wearing animal skins to cover his naked see it's so much more than just take a lamin off for a lamb he's caught by a revelation a divine revelation so much more than slay this lamb he now knows why he's outside of the garden he now knows why he must make a sacrifice he now knows why he's wearing a garment of animal skins cain has no idea why he's outside of the garden why he must bring a sacrifice and why he's wearing a garment of animal skins so in this hour amen the message is not a see and repeat message amen it is not i see and i do and that brother's right i'll do like him and i'll be right amen it is not that we worship by revelation amen god has revealed to us his plan from before the foundation the world what was in the back part of god's mind amen before amen that the world was ever created and we're worshiping christ by the revelation of christ in this hour not monkey see monkey do repeat after me this is the form and this is the ritual this is how we do it in the message that is not acceptable to god he's not punctuating that he's punctuating and vindicating what he revealed and when we worship by revelation it's vindicated and punctuated that that's right
