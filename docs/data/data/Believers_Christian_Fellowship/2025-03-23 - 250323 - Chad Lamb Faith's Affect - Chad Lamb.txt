who are traveling out ministering brother Jim Swanson is across town at bible Believers ministering this morning for them and brother Gabe Smith and his family are in Ontario Canada ministering for brother Dale langstaff so let's bow our heads together and we'll ask God's blessing dear heavenly father we thank you God for the grand privilege you've given us of gathering together again for we know Lord this is a tremendous privilege you've granted to us and we feel privileged to be here and God we want to remember our brothers who are away the gifts that you placed in them that you intend to use in other assemblies and other places I pray that you inspire them and anoint them and use them mightly Lord and may your word go forth true and clear here may it have an effect in the lives of those who hear it God we're asking the same thing here this morning that you would take this vessel under your control and God that you could take Dominion Lord over each of us Lord and may your word find place in us and may it grow Lord and bear fruit and bring back a manifestation a harvest unto you Lord we're asking that you would take preeminence among us and that you would have your way we love you we thank you for this privilege and we yield ourselves now to you in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you while we're standing let's take our Bibles and turn to the Book of Luke amen I just want to say congratulations to brother Mike and sister Carolyn sprunger that was a major Milestone may God bless you in your anniversary also want to greet our visitors we glad to have my mom again you know her sister Debbie but she's mom to me and so we're glad she made it up and it's always a pleasure and some of the Ritter family are here so God bless you it's good to see you guys as well amen and everybody else visiting God bless you I see you have some visitors but may the Lord bless you and we want you to feel very welcome here amongst usen let's look at Luke 18 and verse 8 Luke 18 and 8 I tell you that he will avenge them speedily nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth may may God bless you as you take your seats amen so we want to look at this subject of uh Faith once again we preach about all the time it's such a theme through the scriptures and uh but the question was nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the Earth so when the son of man cometh what is he looking for Faith amen and so I'd like to take for a title uh this morning Faith's effect Faith's effect because that Faith should have an effect and that effect should uh be move into a manifestation and so we'd like to talk about that subject and I'm just trying to get myself to relax because I got many many things that I want to share but we may not get to them all I understand that we'll be conscious of time and and usually when I say there's a I've got a lot of things I don't want the children's Hearts to fail for fear we won't we won't be here three or four hours and maybe not the children maybe everybody's but there is much you know I've been looking at this for a long time and we preach on these things all the time but they just keep coming uh into greater Clarity all the time things that meant so much to us before mean more to us all the time and God is really uh constantly growing us in our Revelation and growing us as his children in our manifestation everything we should be growing amen the one thing we do not want is to become stagnant and I say God help us when I feel that old lethargy creeping into me it scares me and I say God I don't want to be stagnant I want to grow I want to keep moving in this plan amen if we're still here and haven't take the body change there's more for us amen more to manifest uh uh more seed to find more word to display more to be revealed something there's more of something and I want it all I don't never want to get complacent or content and say well that's enough for me God Amen but if I've come to God's banquet if I've come to his his Feast if I've accepted the invitation and come to the spiritual Feast I want to taste everything he's got laid out in the buffet amen and so God's been so good to us and so faithful to us amen and he's kept his promises to us and but I never want that God's faithfulness to cause complacency because all is well and things are under control oh and I don't I don't ever want that and I said God help us to constantly fight against that and keep pressing forward you know the first chch AG failed because they stopped pressing forward in the spirit amen and we don't want to follow that pattern that pattern's been broke amen for the church in the last days that we won't go back through the denominational Cycles amen but we'll break free from what tripped us up before and keep pressing towards the mark of the high calling in Christ Jesus amen so when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth that's the question Amen in uh in the message brother B says God will continually has been separating separating and that's what he's doing tonight that's what he always does you can see it in every meeting he is separating Faith from unbelief he speaks out he declares himself to those who will believe him and have faith in him in another quote brother B said God is always separating he's separating Faith from unbelief he's separating light from darkness and how does he do it he always does it by his word amen because God will bring his word amen and those who believe the word will move to the word and that automatically cause separation from light and darkness it brings us out of Darkness into light amen amen but then there's always those who don't believe and they remain in the condition but his word brings a separation and that's how he separates by his word and as you know we just uh finished a book for our our tape service we went through uh is your life worthy of the gospel and as we were going through there amen it so many things just were speaking to me and that's what was really affecting this this message this morning so just hold in your mind everything we discussed and remembered and is your life worthy of the gospel because I I'm drawing from that quite a bit amen and whenever we do a tape service I go through that book in that tape probably five times by the time we're done and so for for me you know I go through it just to see if that's one that we want to do so I listen to it and I read it then after we go through it I I go through it again and make my notes then I go through it again the day that we play it and then I go through it again with all of you here and I say praise God that's a privilege that I have but as we go through it then all of a sudden it just goes deeper and deeper and deeper into our hearts that what we learned when we went through that tape is what makes your life worthy of the Gospel amen and it's not the works that you can do it's not how how well you can perform the things that God have said but what makes our life worthy of the Gospel is that we actually heard the invitation and when we heard the invitation to the spiritual Feast we came amen amen because who was not worthy when when he was speaking there in Matthew 22 he says those who were bidden didn't come were not they're not worthy to eat of my supper what made them not worthy is because when the servant called they didn't come so then he goes out and he says go to the highways and byways and go to the lame and the Halt and the blind The Afflicted and and and bring them in and when they brought them in the servant came to him and said there's more room and he said go Amen to the highways into the hedges and and find compel them to come in both the Bad and the good that's probably my favorite scripture in that whole thing the Bad and the good he wasn't looking for good people that he could invite he was looking for whoever would come to the invitation some of those who came were bad people same thing in the scriptures those who came to Christ some of them were bad people they would have been labeled as bad harlots and prostitutes and tax collectors and things like that they were bad but they came the good people who would have been considered good the Pharisees and the Sadducees and the religious and those who never missed a church service and did everything right amen they didn't come proving they were unworthy and the bad were worthy amen so God was looking for faith somebody that would believe his word amen so let's turn together to the Book of John and let's look at John chapter 6 so that's just a brief synopsis of is your life worthy of the Gospel but when brother Venom ends he doesn't leave it just there because he starts to show amen that that kind of faith that genuine faith in the present tense word of God it actually will produce a life of that word so you can't just leave it with I believe the word for my hour for my day but that accepting that that that feasting at the at the Lord's uh uh Feast at the spiritual Feast will actually bring a manifestation of the very thing we're feeding on Amen and that's how he ends that message and starts showing it so it's not just one-sided and we can't just say well I believe the message of the hour I'm secure but but because that's what the Pharisees tried to do they tried to say I believe Moses I believe Moses and we keep all the law and we're fine but when God came to them in the form of Flesh in Jesus Christ they rejected that manifestation of the word showing that all their good deeds and all their good works amounted to nothing amen because they didn't believe a amen so now we're going to go to John chapter 6 I'm going to pick it up in verse 47 and once again very these things are very familiar in verse 47 he says verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me hath everlasting life amen praise be to God Amen not will have amen already has that's the evidence what and we're going to get into this here and and brother clear on this the true evidence of the Holy Ghost is being able to receive the word for your day and this is what Jesus says anden he says right here I say unto you he that believeth on me what was he he was the the word made flesh for that day and hour he was the promise being fulfilled in front of them amen and he that believeth uh uh I'm sorry let me read this again I say unto you he that believeth on me hath everlasting life amen said I am that bread of life your fathers did eat Mana in the wilderness and are dead this is the bread which cometh down from heaven that a man may eat thereof and not die I am the living bread which came down from heaven If any man eat of this bread he shall live forever and the bread that I will give is my flesh which I will give for the life of the world and the Jews therefore strove among themselves saying how can this man give us his flesh to eat then Jesus said unto them verily verily I say unto you except you eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you who so eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life and I will raise him up at the last day for my flesh is meat indeed and my blood is drink indeed he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and die in him as the living father hath sent me and I live by the father so he that eateth me even he shall live by me this is that bread which came down from heaven not as your fathers did eat mana and are dead he that eateth of this bread shall live forever these things said he in the synagogue as he taught in capernium many therefore of his disciples when they heard this said this is a hard saying who can hear it so now Jesus comes and he begins to say at the beginning of of this what we read uh he that believeth on me hath everlasting life then he starts to tell them what he is who he is amen he starts to describe himself to them I am the bread that came down out of heaven and he says he that believeth on me hath everlasting life so what is brother what is Jesus doing here I say it this way he's challenging Faith because he says he that believeth on me hath everlasting life then he starts to describe what he really is and now he says I'm the Mana I'm the true Mana I'm the bread of life I'm the bread that came down from heaven and whoever eats me will have eternal life and all of a sudden these people sitting here amen they came to hear Jesus amen they were Disciples of his this was brother man says part of the 70 that went from City to City preaching the kingdom was coming doing Miracles and signs they were here the 12 disciples were here other disciples were there they were gathered because they were believing in Jesus they believed in his ministry they were supporting the work they were preaching it amen and now he begins to he begins to say things like my flesh is meat indeed my body amen you have to eat me and my blood is drink you have to drink my blood and and and brother bam says he doesn't explain it amen because it's the point wasn't to explain it cuz he's not trying to educate them into Faith he's looking for Faith praise God when the son of man cometh will he find faith not a program that educates everybody to have the right answers right it's not about getting the right answers and I say it all the time it's not about getting a perfect score on the test amen so then he he he says all these things and he makes it so difficult and and in some ways you look at this through your human mind and you say this is so unfair how could they know how could they understand how could they comprehend they never heard anything like this before amen and and it wasn't unfair because those that had a seed an eternal seed Gene of God on the inside they didn't have to understand to say I don't understand but you're you're the you're still the one for me I still believe in you okay you say You're The Bread of Heaven you say I have to eat your flesh you say I have to drink your blood I don't know what you mean I don't know how I'm going to do this I don't it doesn't make sense to me and I'm a little worried about what you just said but there's something inside of me says I still believe in you this is what they said here in verse 61 when when Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it he said unto them does this offend you what and if you shall see the son of man Ascend up where he was before it is the spirit that quickeneth the Flesh propit of nothing the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life but there are some of you that believe not Jesus knew some didn't believe so what was he doing he was testing faith for Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believe not and who should betray him and he said therefore said I unto you that no man can come unto me except it were given unto him of my father amen from that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him then said Jesus unto the twel will you also go away you think about brother B does such a good job dramatizing this he says you know the crowds start to disperse the the the healing campaign and revivals are fading away people start leaving him he starts saying things that are so OD and so contrary to understanding and he starts and what's he doing brother B said he's thinning out his crowd amen because what does he want does he want a crowd no he wants seed he come to find his lost sheep his lost sheep are the children of God the children of God have a predestinated seed there's something in them to believe with what's he looking for he's he says I came not to save the world but to save mine that are in the world and what's he looking for his that are in the world and how will he locate them you're the ones that can believe right now all this crowd was gathered around Jesus and they all would have said we believe in Jesus we believe he's a mighty man of God we believe he does great Miracles we believe he's a prophet of God we believe all of these things but when he started to put the faith test yeah amen they started walking away and brother Bram said it was so discouraging to the disciples because they like the campaign they they liked the big movements and revivals and they started fading away and they started walking away and and everybody's leaving and that's not what the disciples wanted they wanted a restoration of the Kingdom they wanted to kick the Romans out they wanted to establish him as king this was so contrary to their thinking it was going the opposite of what they thought was going to happen in that day and what they thought about the scriptures now everything's backwards amen and so they walk no more with them then said Jesus unto the 12 will you also go away then Simon Peter answered him Lord to whom shall we go thou H has the words of eternal life and we believe and are ass that thou art that Christ the son of the Living God Amen Jesus answered them have not I chosen you 12 and one of you is a devil and he spake of Judas es scariot the son of Simon for it was for he it was was that should betray him being one of the 12 Jesus I'll just say it this way Jesus didn't try to preserve his crowd or his reputation he wasn't interested in looking good or being popular he came for one purpose and that was due to the father's will and he came to seek and save that which was lost amen and he knew he could do it by the word the disciples brother mam said the disciples didn't have any better understanding than the ones who walked away they didn't have a clue either what eat my flesh and drink my blood meant but they they knew one thing we believe and are sure that thou art the Christ the son of the Living God they had faith in him regardless of what he said was confusing regardless of the things they saw around them were confusing regardless of everything went contrary to what they thought the Bible said what they thought was going to happen in their day when it went completely backwards they still believed in him because of the believe in him ha eternal life praise God brother Benham says in the unveiling of God may the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of his word now my subject this morning I trust that God will reveal this and each time if you who take the tapes and listen and I hope and trust that you've had a spiritual understanding of what that God has been trying to get over to the church without saying it right out see it's a thing sometimes we have to say things in such a way that it might thin down it might bring some to go out some to leave and some to ponder over but that's done purposely it must be done that way then it might be that someone would say you mean God would purposely do a thing like that he certainly did he does yet and he said one day when he had thousands around him he said except you eat of the Flesh of the son of man uh Son of God or son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you so brother R teaches us this principle and brother bandham is is showing us that even in the message that he's bringing he's saying things and and he says I hope you're catching I hope you have a spiritual understanding of what God has been trying to get over to the church without saying it outright and he says sometimes things have to be said in such a way amen that it might thin down so now brother Venom also is not trying to preserve a crowd I mean he tells us in spoken word is the original seed that the revivals are dying amen amen they're dying they're fading away and he said my Ministry is the worst of them all amen Billy Grahams is fading Oral Roberts is fading he said but there's been a seed planted and now see what Harvest comes forth from that seed and now when he comes to amen when he comes to priest the seals he says now that will cause 10,000 of my friends to leave me they're going to think I'm saying that about myself I'm trying trying to make myself a prophet or something amen but he couldn't smooth it over he couldn't always explain it all amen he had to do it was the ministry of Jesus Christ once again coming maybe with hard sayings or confusing things or something that it may he may not come right out and say it he may not make it so easy amen you may have to have a spiritual understanding to see what God is saying it may be easy to misunderstand what he's saying or get the wrong conclusion about what he's saying amen but God does that purposely listen that's not just about the message friends that's about our lives too amen there's things that happen to us and all around us we may not understand it may be contrary to the way we thought serving God was going to be or if I give everything to God Amen what it'll be like God will shower a me rewards upon me and all of the sudden we give our all to God and life goes into absolute chaos and we spiral out of control and we think this can't be right everything must be wrong amen and God doesn't explain it all to us why because he's trying to prove that Faith that's down inside things go confusing and God doesn't always explain everything right away right because he's looking for faith brother brandom tells us in anointed ones at the end time they he says they're preaching a historical Christ and that's what they're believing is a historical Christ so but the Bible said he is the I am not I was or will be I am right now that's the present tense truth that's what's always stumbled the unbeliever and that's what's always captivated the believer amen and the believer may not even understand or comprehend what it is that they believe and what it is that they're is drawing them amen but the present tense the I am God is the God Amen that the seed is always attracted to amen he said they're teaching a historical God just like they're trying to live in the past well Wesley said so and so or so and so said so and so you're refusing the promised word of the day the Mana that's clearly identified of the day and so we know the message of the hour is the word for our day amen and when the son of man cometh he's looking for what faith faith not a high intellectual understanding faith and if he's looking for faith above everything else then maybe he'll constantly change circumstances in our life that require Faith to be made manifest because if the question question is will I find faith if what he's looking for is faith if he's looking for his sheep who can believe his word then he's looking for he's looking for Faith so how do you find Faith amen the same way you find Faith all the way through the Bible all the way from the beginning to the end how did he find Faith he would bring a challenge amen there would be a challenge and in the challenge would be the word amen and there would be those who took the word and there would be those who refused the word and that's how he found faith in every regeneration in the Bible yeah that's how he found faith in Noah's day amen there was a challenge coming up because now there's a prophecy that God's going to destroy the world because of the sinfulness of man and God tells one man he doesn't tell the hierarchy of the world he doesn't come to counsels he tells one man who's his prophet and that man believes his word and the manifestation of him believing that word was he started building an ark and the Ark was the testimony that he believed God yeah amen and it also was the very thing that condemned the rest of the world because what condemned them was a man who would believe the word and not just give lip service to it or say I believe it but a man who actually believed it and that faith that he had in the word of God had an effect on him and the effect it had on him is he went to working on an ark amen let's go to Hebrews chapter 11 I just want to read this the Hebrews we'll go to Hebrews later again but I want to read verse 7 Hebrews 11: 7 by faith Noah being warned of God of things not seen as yet moved with fear prepared an ark to the saving of his house by which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is by Faith by faith how did he do it by faith amen by faith Noah being warned of God of things not seen as yet moved with fear why because he believed what God told him yeah he actually believed the prophecy he believed what God told him amen and he went into action preparing an ark his faith faith had an effect on him and he prepared an ark for the saving of his house by the wit by what by his faith in action he condemned the world why was the world condemned because there was a man on Earth who would believe the word and who would obey the word and who would act on it amen and that became the condemnation of the rest of the world Abel was a condemnation to Cain yeah because Abel believed the word and when he believed the word by Revelation he acted upon his faith it wasn't able just says oh it's a lamb I got the Revelation no that Revelation had to go into action he actually had to take a lamb and slay the lamb and when he slayed the lamb God and testimony and witnessed that his faith was correct when he saw the manifestation he accepted his offering and rejected Cain's Cain was condemned by what by the faith of Abel that was in action amen amen praise God so praise the Lord Brother bam I'm going to go into a couple quotes where brother bam talks about this Faith being the evidence and in Feast of trumpets he says he said an angel or the man said and he's talking about when Elohim comes and visits Abraham on the plains of mamory and he steps into flesh and he comes in flesh with two other angels and they come to Abraham and he says the angel or the man said why did Sarah say that in her heart in the tent behind him why did she say those things cannot be see a man in human flesh like a prophet yet it was Elohim Discerning the thought that was in Sarah's heart behind him and Jesus said as it was in the days of lot so will be at the coming of the end of the world when the son of man not Son of God when the son of man will be revealed so brother B's taking the scripture and pointing us right back to that incident with AB Abraham when God came in a body of Flesh and discerned the thoughts of Sarah in the tent behind him and he said God Jesus Christ promised that this will repeat again in the end time says hadn't had it through the age see that perfect continuation of the scripture here we live in it the Mysteries even of the baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus and away from the Oneness idea and these other things how the Holy Spirit has moved that in and showed it perfectly and the true baptism of the Holy Spirit the token and everything and he placed it and how he placed every reformer and everything just exactly and see right before our own eyes and it's not in a corner it's World known Jesus the son of God revealing himself by the scriptures making the scriptures that has been promised to this day like it was to that day and all other days live and to believe it is the evidence of the holy spirit amen to believe what that we've had a repeat in our day of what happens on the plains of memory amen that God God Elohim working in human flesh could discern the thoughts of Sarah and the tent behind him amen and and brother B says as it was in the days of lot as it was in the day days of Noah we're coming back to this time where this manifestation will come on Earth again and we've seen it and we believe it amen how many believe it amen amen worldwide when you take a senses worldwide how many believe that in the In the Flesh of William brandham was Elohim working the same sign and he worked to Abraham now he comes to Abraham's seed and he shows the same side because the son of man is coming looking for Faith amen worldwide take a senses how many believe it why is it so rejected worldwide why is it you believe it friends it's not an easy thing to believe unless you have a seat of God and then it's easy amen if you try to go down the intellectual route it's not an easy thing to believe that there's one man one man in all the world this man who came was born in Kentucky lived in obscurity didn't have a great education and you you're telling me that that one man that that was God in him and that sign of discernment was the Fulfillment of Luke 17:30 you're telling me in that man is the Fulfillment of Malachi 4 you're telling me that this is this is you're you're trying to tell me that this is Revelations 1:7 in that man right there and we say amen amen intellectually how can you make it work intellectually amen it's not to mean it's not made to be worked intellectually CU When the son of man cometh what's he looking for Faith so he does it in a way that requires Faith amen again in Feast of the trumpets he says what is the true evidence Jesus said that you believe that I am he and he is the word that's the true evidence what is the true that you believe in me and he is the word amen why didn't they get it why didn't the Jews get it they were righteous men they were good men they were holy men and there were all kinds of people but to whom is predestinated to hear the word and how do you know whether it's the word each one says this it's the promise of the Bible being Vindicated of that age and there you are then you come back to where the holy spirit is amen it's the word made manifest for our day it has to be Vindicated and proved out which God thoroughly did again in is your life worthy of the Gospel he says the word is the truth right and the spirit of God will recognize his own writing he's identified by his writing it speaks of him and you're identified by believing it amen and it gives you your credentials of identification who wants credentials you want credentials you're a Believer you want credentials amen you're a child of God why when the word that God promised before comes into manifestation and is Vindicated by God and something in you says that's nothing but the truth amen that's the Vindication that's your credentials of identification but you say well I've never done this and I never saw a vision and I never did this Mighty thing that's not that's not verification of identification friends there's many many people in the world that have worked many miracles and not believed the message amen but what is your credentials of identification when you saw the manifestation of the word for your day you believed it amen amen don't complicate it keep it simple amen amen when brother bam says this he's he's in no way doing away with the fact that there also must be life that follows that because we've seen I think anybody who serve God any length of time you've seen people who make a confession of something they claim to believe something but none of their actions match the faith that they claim to have yeah see see talk is cheap talk is cheap anybody can say anything yeah and for whatever reason they can they can repeat what they've heard want to fit in or uh been raised a certain way and feel like this is but and don't even have a revelation of it everybody anybody can say anything amen but God has a way of cutting past the speech and getting to the reality so brother brandham is showing us what the true evidence of the Holy Ghost is and who a True Believer is but in no way even in is your life worthy of the Gospel what made them unworthy was not coming to the spiritual Feast what made them worthy as they came but then brother Brenham goes on to say but to receive the Life of Christ will manifest The Life of Christ that's a life worthy of the Gospel that that life will bear the fruits of the spirit that there will be there that faith will have an effect and that effect will be seen amen and even in saying that there's so many things that we preach and say that I feel like qualifying because if we go too far down any road am mean we get ourselves tripped up somewhere and so when we go down this road and we say there'll be a manifestation there'll be a life amen there will be the Life of Christ on display and then you go and you trip up and you fall down and you stumble and you say then the Satan will come and tell you see you didn't have it because if you really believed it you wouldn't have done XYZ has anybody ever been there besides me you can't possibly because you failed here and because you told a lie and because you did this and yeah right right but brother bam is so good we're so God is so good to us to give us a message and let us have the recordings and the tapes and the life brother bham told that that that the actual life of the Prophet becomes the word manifested so now what what is the word manifest inside our Prophet he's showing us when an adopted son of God part of the Bride when Christ gets control amen and dominion and a man what it begins to look like amen and does everybody believe that that he was under the control of Jesus Christ that he was manifesting the Life of Christ inside that man no man can do those Works brother Brandon would tell the crowd when he would begin Discerning and calling out he said says now you didn't touch me I'm just a man I'm just your brother you touched him your faith touched him where was him him was working through him and he says it's not me it's him that's working through this vessel that's who you're touching amen it's not the flesh but it's God in flesh and the prophet's life becomes the word made manifest but God so Faithfully shows us amen that though that Prophet had come to maturity though that Prophet was a tool in the hand of God though that Prophet was manifesting the end time signs the scriptures were alive in him he was the word made flesh amen that God was showing he still convinced his wife to lie to the lawyer and had to repent he still concocted a plan to where he could run away from his responsibilities and get away from the pain and go away and God had to stop him and correct that's right so praise God I can still be a Son of God Amen he told us you still have a sticky cck bur nature this old guy here has got to be made over again it's still amen fallen in corruption it's Redeemed by the Lord but we're pressing towards the fullness of adoption which the wi the change in the body and until then he says you'll always have a sticky cber nature that will that'll trip you up that'll bother you and so now I'm not I'm not going to let the devil take away my sunship every every time I fail because I got a sticky Cocker nature and neither am I going to take away the sunship of my brothers and sisters because they fail because not one of us would do that to the prophet of God Amen but if our brothers and sisters we heard them tell their wife tell the lawyer I'm not here I'll step outside and all of a sudden we'd be like he just lied he may not be a Son of God we've all seen each other do wrong things especially you live in a house with a few people but that's not going to take away my sunship and I'm not going to let that take away your sunship what we're looking at is those who have something inside of them that can believe the word for the hour and then they receive the life of that word and the life of that word is changing them from Glory unto Glory unto Glory we're growing into the fullness of the stature of Jesus Christ I'm not there yet but I'm certainly not what I used to be and if you see me stumble and fall then please help me brother and forgive me but I'm pressing towards the mark of the high calling in Christ Jesus because there's a life inside of me pushing me further down the roaden brother B said I backslide every day if he backslide every day then I must be up to like 10,000 per day even brother Perry Green in his testimony he tells us that brother bam looked at him and he said he made this statement brother Perry where God has me living now most of what you do would be sin for me but brother Brenham never made it sin for Perry he was not requiring Perry Green live the same life that God required brother brandham to live amen he was living the life God called him to live and he wasn't putting that requirement on somebody else right neither was he pushing Perry away like you're not a son of God but brother Brenham had the perspective God has grown me and revealed things to me and the Revelation the faith and the word should produce a life and if that Prophet had seen in the back part of God's mind and he had got Revelation upon Revelation and had talked to God and God had talked to him it should produce a life it should have an effect and his walk should be higher than his poor Brothers who's never heard the audible voice of God and met God in a cave yeah in the form of an Angel so don't believe the devil's Li eyes we're all going to make mistakes you're still going to make mistakes you be like well I've been serving God 40 years I'm further down the road well just guess what you're going to make a mistake so just go ahead and plan on it but what God is looking for is Faith and that faith will have a manifestation it will have an effect on us and it will produce a life but but I don't know how we're going to come to Perfection until this body is made over again perfection in my soul yes maturity on the Inside Man absolutely but what am I going to do Paul says who can deliver me from this body of death oh Wretched Man that I am but I thank God through Jesus Christ with my flesh I serve sin but with My Soul with my mind I serve the truth thank God Amen amen praise God so what is your credentials of identification I haven't messed up in two weeks I've been at every service cuz brother bandam says be there every time the doors open well I believe that's true I believe we should be but that's not our identification that's not the credentials of identification amen the the the credentials of identification is I believe the present tense manifestation of Jesus Christ amen the word Made Alive in my day amen praise God let's look here at Hebrews at the beginning of chapter 11 the deacons have replaced our glass C cup with plastic I wonder why we're GNA have to invite brother Jason dears back it's a lot safer up here now amen we thank the deacons for looking after us keeping us safe amen Hebrews chapter 11 verse 4 by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh amen you know Abel's gift testified of his faith he didn't just do something randomly he did it by faith and God honored his faith amen verse five by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death it was not found because God had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God but without faith it is impossible to please him you know what that means to me that there's nothing that I can do in a Works program that will please him if it's done without faith amen amen that's right that doesn't mean I shouldn't and do good works I I'll say this way good works aren't evil they're good obedience is never wrong amen but without faith it doesn't do any good yeah because without faith it is imp impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him amen so what is God really looking for for Faith amen when I read this verse again yesterday it said uh by but without faith it's impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him I looked up this word diligently seek again it's translated in two words diligently seek but it comes from one Greek word and it and it's it's translated uh to seek carefully to inquire to seek after the definition is an investigation a subject of subtle inquiry and dispute I thought that was really interesting that God um without faith it's impossible to please God for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek him those that are investigating God seeking after God and there's a reward for that I I love this scripture because so many times we we we come to the place where we say well I believe well it's wonderful to believe but when we look at the scriptures believing always produced something all the way through and down the Bible the believing always produced the life in this kind of believing amen you must believe that he is is but you also must believe he's a rewarder of those that seek after him to investigate to inquire after and and and it makes me believe that God is pleased when we seek after him and want to know and investigate his things because if we believe in him we we we can only come to him if we believe in him but if we come to him we should seek after him diligently not this I believe and then I go on about life and I'm so busy with work and I'm so busy with a house and I'm so busy with school and I'm so busy with all of these things that this is what I do but I believe so I'm okay no you got to believe amen that he is but he's also a rewarder of those that investigate him and seek after him and want him and want to know him and want to know about him and want to experience him more deeply amen striving reaching forth in the spirit seeking amen those are the ones that he rewards amen amen it's not a reward because you did the checkbox of Good Deeds he rewards them who seeks after him and I wonder what he rewards them with well probably good health and long life and no because what are they doing they're diligently seeking him so what would be the reward for those who are diligently seeking him maybe he reveals more of himself that's the reward I would want if I'm a diligent seeker of him the reward I want is not long life and good health and all that the reward I want is him because I'm a diligent seeker of him so what would I want I would want the thing that I'm diligently seeking after not diligently seeking after a good retirement not diligently seeking after a work promotion not diligently seeking after a piece of property but diligently seeking after him my reward would not be any of those things but my reward would be more of him amen because that's what faith will produce that's what true faith will bring that kind of Desire brother M tells us that Satan didn't believe he said he believes the word we know that Devils believe and they tremble amen but he didn't believe this manifestation of the word when it come to this brother B said he couldn't believe that humble little man being that word he believed that God would send a son he believed there would be a messiah the devil believed all of that but when he saw it coming in this humble little man of Jesus Christ he didn't believe that was him so when he tempted him in the wilderness he was saying prove it to me prove it to me prove it to me but Jesus had nothing to prove because he knew who he was amen because he knew who he was he could just combat the word he could just combat with the word and just keep bringing the word because Jesus never came to this earth to prove identifi himself he came to do the father's will he didn't come to identify himself and declare himself he came to declare the father amen so because of that that Satan didn't believe and then brother Ben moves to Judas and he makes this statement in the message identification he what made him turn he actually doubted the claims of Christ being the word he could see that man eat with him fish with him out there and everything else and him being the word he could believe it he couldn't believe he was God but he he but he was judas's character used him to do this has your character done the same so brother saying that Judas it wasn't that Judas didn't believe that Jesus was a man of God it wasn't that he didn't believe he was a prophet or a holy man or a miracle worker he saw all of that he believed all of that but what he doubted was that that man amen that that man he doubted the claims of Jesus Jesus Christ being the word he couldn't believe he was God but he was am and lean not to your own understanding and again goes into Judas he says there was one man who did Lean to his own understanding and his name was Judas the scariot I don't see how he could have done it he had walked face to face with Christ just like Eve did in the beginning he had seen the Vindication he had looked at God in the face like Eve did in the cool of the evening Eve looked at Christ in the cool of the evening in the garden and Judas had sat in the cool of the evening in the Garden of Gethsemane in many places and had looked at the same Christ and had heard him teach prove himself by the word Vindicated by to be the prophet that Moses had spoke of would be raised up and told them in the scripture who he was and all about it they had seen it proved by God that he was and then he leaned to his own understanding oh how could he do it it was because he never had it down here in the first place he wasn't a gerti seed amen he was the son of predition What Judas had every Advantage friends yeah we would think it's impossible for him not to believe he walked with him talked with him he he didn't just hear the parable he heard the explanation of the parable when they went to eat dinner and they said explain to us and he explained to them yeah amen he wasn't just there for the sermon he was there for the explanation amen he wasn't just there at the healing campaigns amen but he was working behind the scenes and he saw everything that L up led up to it he saw every Miracle he said every stage of the journey he was there in the boat when he said peace be still he was in the boat when Jesus came Walking In The Water he saw Peter walk on water he had every Advantage friends I mean you you and I go back and we try to imagine how in the world could Judas do what he did it was because he didn't have a gerti seed on the inside he was just doing it from the intellectual realm and intellectually could say he walked on the water Judas never denied it he broke bread and fed 5,000 he never would deny that that was all truth and he saw it and could witness it was the truth the problem he had is he couldn't believe that that man was actually God in the Fulfillment of all that scripture why it takes a seed Gene of God am he couldn't fully accept the word for his today brother bam said is your life worthy the gospel he said I was telling someone this afternoon in a little meeting I said every son that's born of God has to be tried first chastened I remember when I had mine or my greatest hour when a man is born again there's a little spot like the size of his fingernail that God injects into him system and it falls into his heart and there anchors then Satan makes him prove it and if it ain't there you're gone I don't ask me questions on what that thing is the size of your finger now I don't know all I know is what brother Benham said something God injects of his own life there and there's got to be a seed already there for it to connect with and when it does when that comes Satan will make you prove that it's there yeah and if it ain't there you're gone brother B says I remember mine said my greatest hour when my my brother had died and my father had died then my wife died and then my baby died and I stood there at the at the side of my baby's crib there in the hospital cheing the flies away her eyes Crossing cuz she's suffering her dying amen and like a black sheet come down God wouldn't even answer me and the devil goes to speaking to me and he starts saying amen how could God how could you say he's a good God and he won't heal your he said he all he would have to do is just move his finger and brother bam started saying that was right he says After all you've done for him he said that's right staying up all night preaching that's right and brother bam was starting to agree with the intellectual reasoning of the devil how could he be a good God and you've preached out here he's a Healer and he's a good God he won't even he done it for others but he won't even do it for you when it comes to your own baby and brother brandham was he said this was my darkest hour this is his hardest trial this is when God was making this was when God was proving a son listen God is not proving Us in good times and God is not proving us when we're sitting in church hearing the preaching and everybody saying amen and we're saying amen with everybody but God is going to prove his child and what's he going to do look at what he did for the prophet look at what he did for everybody in the Bible to prove that they were his children amen they he throws them into the circumstances that are impossible into a lion's den into a fiery furnace into all kinds of situations why because there's something inside that will believe Amen brother said somebody told him after tells his testimony he says uh it's a good thing you held on to your religion and brother B said I never held on to it it held on to me if it wasn't for that predestinated seed he would have fallen in that hour brother Brenham was weak he was tired he was believing the reasoning the only thing that held him was there was something inside to believe with and the word tells us that we're saved by grace through faith and that none of ourselves it is a gift of God so brother B took no credit for holding on he took no credit for having great faith he took no credit for overcoming he said it was something in me holding on brother B says uh and the show us the father he says but sometimes God lets Affliction hit his people to test them for their faith he was testing a saint not rebuking a sinner and God does that to test he did it to job he didn't do it to job because job was a bad man he had brother B said he had confidence in job and he wanted to prove job yeah what does that say for you and I maybe he's got more confidence in us than we have in us and it's not us he has confidence in he knows what's inside he knows how to get the life to manifest and to get the life to manifest amen there's got to be faith that overcomes an obstacle for Faith to manifest there must be a challenge to Faith amen brother man makes this statement I thought it was so interesting he said there was a uh there was them kind like Nicodemus the secret believer come by Night slipped around said Rabbi we know you're a teacher from comes from God no man can do these things you do except God be with him look at little gyrus now now remember in the day that the these men were there gyrus was the the chief of the synagogue Amen in that time there was such a fuss over Jesus such a polarization that if you claim to be his disciple you were no longer allowed to come back to the synagogue there was a pressure coming from the high priest and all of that and so now that's why Nicodemus came to Jesus by night so that he wouldn't be seen because of all the religious pressure that was around him gyrus was a secret believer he was the chief of the sinagogue but he was a secret believer but listen what brother Brenham said look at gyrus he maybe acted like he didn't believe in Divine Healing till his little daughter was laying at the point of death God has a way of pulling that out and making you show your color and then when it come right down to the spot he was a Believer and it just had to come to a spot to make him see it you know we we see people go through things and we sometimes think in ourselves I could never go through a trial like that they lost a loved one maybe lost a child maybe had a a major rejection something horrible in your life he say I can never I could never I can never and the reality is you can never but if God's placed something down inside of you there's a faith that can overcome every Challenge and every obstacle to Faith and sometimes we don't know how much a Believer we are amen we don't know what's on the inside of us so God Amen will allow a little something to come and J gyrus wasn't sure he believed in Divine Healing maybe gyrus was a little secret believer but God would let his daughter come to the point of death amen so now he didn't care what the what the chief priest said he didn't care what Jerusalem Council said now he knew that this man has power in him that can heal my daughter I know it and now it didn't matter what anybody saw or what anybody thought the circumstance drew the faith that was hiding in gyrus and brought it to the surface for everybody to see because remember there was a multitude pressing Jesus so tight amen gyrus comes up to him when he comes out of the boat he crosses back over the sea there's a press there's so many people there and he says please come and heal my daughter what's he doing he's making a public confession that I believe that you can come heal my daughter amen now it didn't matter what anybody else in that City thought amen he didn't care about his reputation anymore God was drawing true genuine Faith out of the man and God knows how to do it to us too because he knows what's on the inside amen he knew it was in job so he squeezed him he knew it was in all of his children so he could put the Press on them because what came out was Faith let's go to Genesis 22 if I could just say if we believe what brother bandam said in is your life worthy of the Gospel that the ability inside to believe the word for our day is our credentials of identification listen if we could just come to that realization that that's something God put in me before the foundation of the world that would come like a magnet drawn to this word and that's my identification as a Son of God now I don't need to get tempted by the devil to start proving things like the devil come to Jesus if thou be the Son of God do this and if thou be do this and if thou be do that Jesus was never there to vindicate or declare himself so he never took the bait guess what you and I are not here to declare ourselves we're not here to prove we're sons of God we are not here to prove that we are we're not here to prove anything we are here Amen to we are here to identify him just like Jesus was here to identify his father so he would only do what the father showed him he wasn't doing anything to prove to Satan that he was a Son of God he was willing for everybody to doubt who he was because he had nothing to prove he knew who he was he was only there to declare the father and you and I are only here to declare our bridegroom and so it doesn't matter what anybody says what they think and how much they deny you're not a Believer and you're not a this cuz you don't believe that and you don't do this listen don't start jumping through the devil's hoops and trying to prove amen you'll never satisfy the devil he'll come with another question or another standard or another set of circumstances to prove it you have nothing to prove you're not here to prove yourself you're here to identify Christ and when Christ wants to show himself in you he knows how to put the squeeze down to get himself out yeah amen so go God now if we can just come to a true identification of our sunship Who We Are by God's grace by the revelation of the hour by the identification that the prophet gave us now if we could just learn to rest when we hit the circumstances because circumstances will not change who we are amen circumstances are not identification yeah amen our faith in the revealed word for our day is our identification yeah so now let the wheels fall off the bus let everything fall into ruin let's stop running around with duct tape to save save our reputation or save this or I won't look like this or just let it all fall to ruin because it doesn't matter what somebody else thinks about me amen God's given me a witness in my heart I don't have anything to prove to anybody I'm not here to make anybody think I'm a Son of God I'm only here to manifest his life when he wants a manifestation out of me amen and until he wants a manifestation out of me I just sit quiet that's what Jesus did amen until the father showed him the father when the father wanted to declare another part of his word he brought it through the sun until then Jesus sat quiet he went to the he went to the trial and pilot at all never said a word didn't defend himself didn't need to defend himself he wasn't there to defend himself oh friends let's not get nervous every time we start getting into a situation let's just say hey if God wants to manifest himself he'll manifest he knows how to do it I don't know what he's doing I don't understand the circumstances but I know who I am and I know he loves me and I know all things work together for the good that everything's ticking right on time that nothing's out of cater with God I don't have to start getting all nervous and wonder am I Son of God am I a message believer am I this and that that's the trick of the devil we need to go back to the beginning and say what makes me a Believer what makes me a Believer is I believe and then God knows how to manifest himself and we go to Genesis 22 verse one and it came to pass after these things that God did tempt Abraham and sent un Toto him Abraham and he said behold here I am and he said take now thy son thine only son Isaac whom thou lovest and get thee into the land of Mariah and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of and Abraham rose up early in the morning and and saddled his ass and he took two of his young men with him and Isaac his son enclaved the wood for the burnt offering and Rose up and went into the place which God had told him when God comes to Abraham and speaks to him God is proving Abraham this is a test I think like unlike any other amen Abraham take thy son you know the one you waited 25 years for you know the one you were mocked and laughed at over yeah because you told him that you're going to have a son by by Sarah and everybody laughed and then you got older and you got older you got old and everybody mocked you and and they laughed and and they said every year it was another joke you had that baby yet brother brother Abraham and no nope but I still believe God and now take that very thing amen that Vindicated I told you the truth take it and slay it yeah and Abraham didn't argue he got up got the wood got the servants got the son got the knife got everything he needed and went by this time in in Abraham's Journey he had learned a few things let's go let's go down uh to verse 11 and the angel of the Lord called onto him out of heaven and abrah and said Abraham Abraham and he said here am I and he said lay not thine hand upon the lad neither do thou anything unto him for now I know that thou fearest God seeing thou has not withheld thy son thine only son from me the question is was God in doubt whether Abraham loved him or not but God was proving a son and he was bringing a manifestation out of Abraham amen for you and I and in the Book of Romans if you go with me to Romans chapter 4 I want to read two different takes on this action one from Paul and one from James and if we could just go through it together and just take a couple minutes Romans chapter 4 Romans chapter 4 verse one what shall we then say that Abraham our father has pertaining to the flesh ha found for If Abraham were justified by works Heath wear of to Glory but not before God for what sayith the scripture Abraham believed God and it was counted to him for righteousness now him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of Grace but of debt but to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly his faith is counted for righteousness so in the eyes of God what made Abraham righteous was it his works or his faith it was his faith but then if we go to Romans Chapter 2 if we skip on over to Romans Chapter 2 and brother REM does such a good job of explaining the difference between Paul and James and we're not going to go into all of that I just want to highlight it James chapter 2 verse 17 James chapter 2:1 17 even so faith if it hath not works is dead being alone yes a man may say thou Hast faith and I have Works show me thy faith without thy works and I will show thee my faith by my Works thou believest that there is one God thou doest well the Devils also believe and tremble but wilt thou know oh vain man that faith without works is dead was not Abraham Our Father justified by works when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar seeing thou how Faith wrought with his works and by works was Faith made perfect and the scripture was fulfilled which sayith Abraham believed God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness and he was called the friend of God you see then how that by works a man is Justified and not by faith only does that sound different than what Paul said Paul said a man's not saved by works but by faith and now James is saying you're not saved by faith only but by works and brother brandham goes and he and he starts to break this down and and he says uh works his faith Express and this is the message where he really explains it he said what God saw in Abraham was his faith but the works was what man saw of Abraham's Faith so Abraham's Faith didn't need to be displayed to God God already knew that he believed but his faith had to be on display for others to see his faith and that's what James was saying show me your faith without your works but I'll show you my faith by my works because what I believe will produce a life what I believe the faith has an effect on me and the effect it has on me will reproduce something out of me amen because I truly believe everybody in the Bible who truly believed God that Faith had an effect on them and they moved into a demonstration and Daniel demonstration Noah demonstration Moses demonstration David demonstrated tell me one person that just believed God and there was no demonstration of their faith in the Bible the Bible is a record of their faith on demonstration so true Faith always brings a manifestation always because faith has an effect on us because if we believe it it changes everything about us if we genuinely believe it it changes the way we think it changes the way we act it changes all of our conduct and it changes what comes out of us amen because it's genuine faith and we know we get a little insight from the book of Hebrews because the book of Hebrews tells us what was going on in Abraham's mind that's what we don't know in Genesis 22 in Genesis 22 we hear a commission we hear him get up we hear him go do it and we hear that God is pleased with him amen but we don't know what's going on inside of Abraham and we can only imagine can you only imagine if God told you to take your son your only son that you waited 25 years for and slay him can you imagine the thoughts that would go on in your mind yeah but it says in Hebrews 11:17 by faith Abraham when he was tried offered up Isaac and he that had received the promise offered up his only begotten son of whom it was said that in Isaac shall thy seed be called accounting that God was able to raise him up even from the dead from whence also he received him in a figure you know what that tells me that Abraham was walking up there to that place of sacrifice and although God was asking him to do something that was completely contrary to his thinking completely contrary to reasoning Abraham was walking there by faith according to Hebrews 11 and what was his faith in his faith was in the original promise God gave him I will give you a son and I will raise him up and he will be a father of Nations and so now Abraham's saying God can't lie Li God can't lie he told me in Isaac shall my seed be in Isaac a father of Nations and Isaac will be the blessing God can't lie God's telling me to kill him what does that mean I don't know but God can raise him up because I received him from the dead now he can raise him up for the I don't know what God will do but I'm going to go slay him in faith and faith in what faith in the original promise God gave him oh God help us to have this kind of faith if God called you and told you you're a a son or daughter of God if he revealed to you himself amen and that's your new birth what is the new birth Jesus Christ revealed to you personally now nothing that comes after that will change that original promise your circumstances your difficulties when everybody turns against you when everything goes sour in life it doesn't change the fact that he's introduced himself to you and he's become one with you Abraham in the trial of his life wasn't doubting the word yeah it's not that Abraham just went up there in obedience with no faith with I don't know what's no he didn't know it was going to happen but he he he believed God's word he offered up his son by faith Jesus says in Matthew chapter 7 turn with me in Matthew chapter 7 and I want to finish up looking at a few thoughts here not that I'm finishing don't get the wrong idea we're just moving into the home stretch we maybe rounded one of the last Corners Matthew chapter 7 Matthew chapter 7 verse 21 he says not everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven amen many will say unto me in that day Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works then will I profess unto them I never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity amen it goes to show that Jesus he's saying not everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord they were calling Jesus Lord but just because they called him Lord didn't make him their lord yeah and he says you sayith unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven and if you read this it can almost look like it's works now again what James was saying that not just that says Lord Lord but he that doeth the will of my father but I think it goes back to the same principle that it's not just those who say Lord Lord or call him Lord or believe in him as Lord but those who have genuine faith will always produce an outcome what is the outcome they will keep the word amen not just ones who say Lord Lord but those who actually do the will of my father how is it we do the will of the father not by human effort not listen not by Creed not by Dogma but by faith amen how was it that Abraham did the will of God by faith how is it we and I do it by faith because our faith will produce a life let's go a little further let's go over to Luke chapter 6 now this is where I really want to drill down and this is I'm really getting to the context of what I've been meditating on what I've been thinking about what God's been dealing with in my heart Luke chapter 6 verse 46 Luke 6 and 46 he says and why call ye me Lord Lord and do not the things which I say this is in a very similar context to what he said in Matthew why call you me Lord Lord and do not the things which I say because the very term Lord is showing lordship and rulership and showing submission yes so the very title of Lord when we say you are Lord Lord Jesus I love you Lord when you call him Lord you're saying you're the master and I'm the servant I'm submission to you so then Jesus is asking a very fair question he said why do you call me Lord Lord and don't do the things which I say it doesn't make sense like it doesn't make sense for to say lord lord it's like you go to work and you say hey boss and you don't do anything the boss says and the boss could say why do you keep calling me boss if you won't do anything I tell you to do this is very similar to what Jesus it's it's a very fair question why do you call me Lord Lord and you keep doing whatever you want yeah why you call me Lord Lord and you won't heed my word why do you call me Lord Lord and you won't obey what I say Amen you're just saying something out of your mouth and remember what I said in the beginning talk is cheap anybody can say anything but Jesus right through it he said uh let yeah let's go to John chapter N I want to add this scripture into the last two I read and then we'll talk about it John chapter n John 9:39 and Jesus said for judgment I come into this world that they which see not might see and they which see might be made blind and some of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words and said unto him are we blind also Jesus said unto them if you were blind you should have no sin but now you say we see Therefore your sin remaineth see Jesus was willing to have mercy on them if they were blind but because they claim to see and to believe the word of God now he says because you say you see Therefore your sin remaineth because if you see why don't you do this is the question why called me Lord Lord and don't do if you say you see then why don't you do if you say we believe Moses then why don't you believe me what Jesus said he he says in John 5 he says uh for had you believed in Moses you would believe in me for he wrote of me so the very statement I believe in Moses that statement became their condemnation yeah the very statement I see and I know the truth and I see the word and I see the light and I know what Moses said and I read the Bible that's very and the statement Lord Lord all of that becomes condemnation because if you see why don't you do if you understand why don't you do what he said amen and this is what Jesus is saying he says because because you say you see your sin remaineth because why you're manifesting unbelief if you say I see and then you don't do amen what is sin unbelief I see it but I don't believe it I see your manifestation but I don't believe it I see Moses and all that he said what Moses said is standing in front of you how can you claim to say I believe Moses but you don't believe me cuz Moses wrote of me right praise be to God brother Jesus also said if you love me keep my Commandments amen so what's he showing us he's showing us that if he's Lord if we believe he's Lord faith will produce an action I will surrender to him as Lord if we say we see and we have a revelation revelation will produce an action I the revelation will bring me into surrender obedience that we can say all kinds of things but the reality of it being true in our lives will manifest itself and that's what Jesus waso exposing their hypocrisy you say you believe but your actions show that you don't Jesus or when God called first Saul to be king of Israel he called him he exalted him he had Samuel anoint him and he went forth to do the work of God but he never fully obeyed God now he believed in God and he worshiped God and he believed Samuel was God's Prophet but he didn't do everything Samuel said which now all of a sudden makes you question did he believe Samuel was God's Prophet because if you truly believe Samuel was God's prophet the mouthpiece of God then if God said through Samuel then then I would do what Samuel said yeah because my faith tells me that that was God not Samuel right amen it's simple right yeah it's simple but why do we make it so complicated it's very very simple if that's God's prophet and that was God's Prophet speaking to me and I disregard what the prophet said my manifestation proves that I don't believe that's the mouthpiece of God or I don't believe in God or God's Not My Lord or whatever because if that's God speaking to me and I believe that it will have an effect on me and I can't just continue on doing what I'm doing if I believe that that doesn't mean people don't believe it but there's an intellectual faith and there's a genuine Faith amen so then he calls David now he tells Samuel don't worry Samuel I've got another king and this king is after my own heart and and he goes and anointing but when we pick it up in the book of Acts he begins to reveal what is his own heart he says he called David a man after his own heart that will do all my will so what is it to be after the heart of God to surrender and believe and Obey and manifest that Faith let's go to Mark 10 remember we're in the home stretch I don't want to lose anybody just because of time Mark chapter 10 Mark 10 verse1 17 says and when he was gone forth into the way there came one running and kneeling to him and asking him good Master what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life this is the story the Rich Young Ruler and brother B talks about it several times he kneeled to him and asked him good Master what shall I do that I might inherit eternal life and Jesus said unto him why callest thou me good there is none good but one that is God it looks here like like Jesus is rebuking him for saying a good Master but that's really not what he's doing he's testing his Revelation amen what brother BM tells us he's testing his Revelation he says why do you call me good right cuz there's only one good that's God so do you have the revelation of who I am or not why did you call me good amen I love when the prophet explains the scripture to us amen verse 19 thou knowest the Commandments do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness defraud not honor thy father and thy mother and he answered and said unto him master all these have I done observed from my youth so I say he's qualified what do you think he did it all he must be a real believer verse 21 then Jesus beholding him loved him said unto him one thing thou lackest go thy well way sell whatsoever thou Hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come take up the cross and follow me and he was sad at that saying and went away grieved for he had great possessions let's go back to the beginning of this story when he was coming along the way there come one running up to him and kneeling and said good master master in Israel means teacher one with the authority to teach this man runs up to Jesus kneeling listen it look he looks super sincere I mean he's falling on his knee one knee two knees I don't know how many knees but he's falling down and he's saying good Master what must I do to inherit eternal life when you just look at that statement and look at that man you say oh he's so sincere he wants eternal life that man really loves God but his actions later proved that he didn't want God and it proved that he didn't believe Jesus was the good Master yeah right because if he was the good Master the perfect teacher amen the one that he could get the answer for how to have eternal life from if he really believed that when the answer came amen he would have taken the answer so he looked super sincere he looked genuine amen he had done all of these good things he had kept all of The Commandments from his youth he ran up kneeling in reverence and respect good Master what must I do to inherit eternal life and when he he went to the very spot amen that this man was struggling with and he says hey if you sell everything you have give to the poor take up your cross and follow after me you have treasure in heaven and he walked away grieved because he had much riches and all he did was proved he proved what he wanted the most he proved what he wanted the most what he wanted the most was his riches not eternal life you know when we when we preach like this it seems hard but it's real friends this is real life this is what we've seen all around us and people claim all kind of things we've claimed all kinds of things and when we come to find out when push came to shove my claim wasn't actually what was in my heart and God keeps working on us and working on us and working on us till everything of self starts getting out of the way till what comes out of our mouth and was really what's in our heart and God will make us prove it amen test us let's look at Luke 19 this is the story of zakus and brother bam dramatizes this many times and tells zakus was a little tax collector and he was shrewd and he was also corrupt his wife had been praying for him Jesus is coming into town and it says in uh chapter 19:1 and Jesus entered and passed through Jericho behold there was a man named zakus which was the chief among the publicans and he was rich so who came to Jesus in The Last Story kneeling call him good Master it was a rich man here's another rich man only the last rich man that came kneeling looking so reverent and so honoring and good master that one that that rich one had done everything in his life right now we're coming to another rich man who has done everything in his life wrong amen he's crooked he's a thief he's stolen from people he's a crooked tax collector I don't know how you can get any worse than a crooked tax collector I mean we all love the IRS right I'm so glad there's nobody in the church that works for the IRS amen and it says and he sought to see Jesus who he was and could not for the Press because he was little of stature and he ran before and climbed up into a sick of more tree to see him for he was to pass that way and when Jesus came to the place he looked up and he saw him and he said zakus make haste and come down for today I must abide at thy house and he made haste and he came down and received him joyfully and when they saw it they all murmured saying that he was gone to be guested with a man that is a sinner and zachus stood and said unto the Lord behold Lord the the half of my goods I give to the poor and if I have taken any From Any Man by false accusations I restore him fourfold and Jesus said unto him this day is salvation come to this house for as much as he also is a son of Abraham do you see the different results in the two stories the Rich Young Ruler who had kept all of The Commandments believed Moses went to synagogue did everything right come to Jesus reverently respectfully kneeling down and calling him good Master when the good Master gave him the answer to his question he didn't want it he wanted his own money he didn't have faith everything that he was portraying wasn't what was really down on the inside he wanted life with no sacrifice he wanted to give up nothing and have everything he wanted the easy way now Jesus comes to zachus zachus does not come to him respectfully zakus does not come and kneel down zakus does not call him good master in the Dr traumatization brother bam said zakus had heard so much about him he was curious but he doubted if he was real and called him an impostor and said he's probably swindling the people why because zachus could believe that because that's his own nature he's he's putting his own nature Amen on to Jesus and he climbs up in a tree cuz he's not got respect for him he's not honoring him he's wanting to hide from him and he's just wanting to peep out and see what's really going on and Jesus comes under his tree and he knows by discernment zachus is up there and he says zakus come down for today I must go abide in your house and and Jesus comes to his house under much criticism because he goes to the house of a sinner but the reality is who was The Sinner who was The Sinner because sin is unbelief it was the rich young man who walked away from Jesus not this zakus he come reverently he come with all the accolades he come with all all the Commandments have been completed in his life he come ready amen and he he he did not believe zakus came the wrong way as soon as Jesus comes to dinner Z listen Jesus never told zakus what to do or what to say or what did he need for salvation zakus stood up and said Lord I give half of all my goods to the poor how did he know to do that Jesus never required it he never asked him to amen Jesus told the Rich Young Ruler if you do this you will get this Jesus never said that to zakus he never promised zakus anything this came out of the faith that was inside zachus he stood up he caught the Revelation and he realized amen half of everything I got I give to the poor if I stole anything from anybody I'll restore fourfold and you might say well you know the request of the Rich Young Ruler was give everything if he gave everything he wouldn't have anything to restore what he stole after he gives half to the poor and he pays back four times everything he's taken he may not have been left with a nickel to his name friends yeah how did he stand up and do what the Rich Young Ruler missed doing and the Rich Young Ruler heard the sermons heard the testimonies supposedly Liv the life but who had the life second he is because faith has an effect when he come in contact with Jesus Christ and recognize who this was it had an effect on him and that effect came into a manifestation how is it we could go to church and go to church and go to church and live for ourselves and live for ourselves and seek things of the world how is it that we can claim to love God and not not keep his Commandments how is it we can claim all of these things friends there's got to be a reality to our faith how is it that Samuel or Saul could call Samuel the prophet of God and when the prophet of God told Samuel slay everything keep nothing alive what was in Saul that he could keep things alive he didn't believe that this was the mouthpiece of God how could he if he had respect for God and because we say we see our sin remains I say friends if we say that we see that puts us in a responsibility amen if we believe there should be it should have an effect on us how many times we say we believe brother brandom is the mouthpiece of God he's a prophet to the age he's the generation it was the manifestation of Christ and then we leave our books lay weeks on end and we don't read what he said we don't listen to tapes what do we do keep doing what the Rich Young Ruler did but I say God if this really is you this really is the son of man come to reveal yourself to us how can I leave that book lay how can I not listen to your voice how can I not not worship with my brothers and sisters how can I not be at church how can I not hear the message preach how can I not see friends our faith has to have an effect on us it's got to bring us if we claim to believe it amen then let's believe it amen if we believe it it should bring us into an action amen amen don't think I'm condemning anybody I'm condemning myself we all live life we all get busy but let's come back to our first love amen let's go back to the realization of what we believe what we've claimed to believe and what we claim to believe it should affect everything about our lives it should affect the way we think it should affect the way we we talk it should affect our fellowship it should affect where we go it should affect what we do it should affect what we allow on our mind it should all be affected by what we believe the devil is constantly trying to pressure us and pressure us and pressure us and get us away from the very thing that brings life but oh God help me never be like a Rich Young Ruler let me be like zakus as rotten and stinking scoundrel as he was when he came in contact with Christ he was ready to give everything up for Christ that's what I want to be the Bible tells us that Nicodemus came to Jesus by night brother BR talks about this he said don't condemn Nicodemus at least he made it that's what brother says it over and over it's easy to condemn Nicodemus but don't condemn him at least he made an effort yeah he was afraid of his friends and he was afraid of of rejection and all of that but but so Nicodemus was a secret believer but when Nicodemus comes to Jesus by night he says Jesus we all know that thou are a teacher who is all of us yeah thou are a teacher sent from God for no man can do the things that thou doest unless God be with him he's testifying for the whole Sanhedrin yeah we all listen it's obvious we all know that you're a teacher sent from God well if they all could see he was a teacher sent from God why didn't they do what he said they wanted to kill him you're a teacher comes from God like like okay it's obvious we get it we can see Miracles and we can't deny death and we can't deny this and that okay you're a teacher from God but we don't like what you teach right wait a second you said you're you call him a teacher that came from God but I don't like what you teach well what does that mean this is a teacher sent from God if I don't like what the teacher sent from God teaches then I don't like what God's teaching right no wonder or sin remains amen so Nicodemus comes and testifies we all believe you're a teacher for from God but their actions proved they didn't believe it they believed it intellectually of course 1+ 1 equals 2 okay you do all these Miracles and all these things you've got to come from God but the real Faith down on the inside they did not have it because if they did they would come to him differently they would have listened to what he said but Jesus one day goes by Samaria to a little well side because there's an appointment there a predestinated appointment that was Saul got Mind Of God before the foundation of the world and there's a little Harlot woman living an unclean life she's as bad off as zakus was she's had five husbands the one she's living with now is not her own husband she's been in marriage and divorce and marriage and relationship after relationship and she's nobody nobody calls a Believer nobody goes to her for information nobody asks her what God's thinking or says nobody wants her opinion on the subject is that right Jesus comes and starts Discerning her life under the discernment the same thing all the Pharisees saw the same thing every religious leader in Jerusalem witnessed with their own eyes he begins to do for her to discern her life and she begins to say ah I perceive you to be a prophet I've got questions about serving God yeah where do those questions come from there was something down inside of her was just waiting for a teacher to come from God somebody that she could get the answer to her question and what was her question how do I worship God how does God want to to be worshiped I'm taught by my ancestors on this Mount you Jews say on Jerusalem and Jesus says listen neither here nor there but the day is coming when God seeketh those to worship Him in spirit and truth and the woman steps back she's not witnessing anything different than the Pharisees witnessed she steps back she goes we know that when Messiah comes he'll teach us these things and Jesus says I that speaketh it to you am he Nicodemus says we all believe there a teacher sent from God but he snuck in there at night yeah because of his friends this little woman was no good rejected nobody wanted her an outcast in society and when she come in contact with the living world for her day says she dropped her water pot she left her water pot and went running into the City and said see comes see a man who told me everything that is not this the very Messiah this isn't a secret believer she's not coming at night she's not hiding out from the opinion of everybody else she believed she came in contact with the Living God for her day and she believed it so much she didn't care what anybody thought they didn't think much of her anyways I'll tell you friends it's really good to go ahead and let your reputation get ruined from day one it's so much easier she didn't care there was a big difference between her and Nicodemus and her and the whole Sanhedrin counsel because you say you believe your sin remains we believe you're a teacher from God then your sin remains said they couldn't accept it because of their tradition but that little woman could accept it because brother B said she had a predestinated seat of Life inside of her said why couldn't the Pharisees they seen the same thing they heard the same thing why couldn't they accept it he says because they had no representation in heaven but she had representation in heaven she was a SE genene she brother said she was a thought that had fallen from the mind of God and when she came in contact with God it manifest not with words but her whole life changed brother B makes this statement I'm going to finish with this quote out do is your life worthy of the gospel and it's quote when I read it had huge impact on me and I didn't I didn't dive into it much when we went through the to the tape because I I wanted to save it for this but it was so interesting he says when God sends the Holy Ghost and knocks at a man's door and he deliberately turns it down sometimes he's going to turn it down for the last time and when you won't be a and then you won't be a privileged character you can sit in a church and listen to the gospel and agree with the gospel you might do so much to say I know it's right but never put a finger on it to help it yourself see you just listen to it because you say I believe it's right that's just sympathizing with it I could say I believe that's a $10,000 that don't mean I got it I could say that's good cold water but refuse to drink it you know what I mean and this is eternal life and to refuse to do it one day you'll cross the line between judgment and mercy and then you won't have a privilege to come and receive it now this is the statement I want you to think about to you people who come here I'm not responsible for those or other ministers speaking to but if it's right you owe your life to it what more could you ever find that would be more of a benefit to you than and to know that you can have eternal life then listen to this what if I was given away capsules here that scientifically proven scientifically proven that this capsule would make you live a thousand years well I'd have to get a militia out here and swarm them away from the place you wouldn't have to make an altar call for it you just have to beat them away from it to live a thousand years that little word picture did a lot for me friends what if we had a he said what have I had a little capsule scientifically proven without a shadow of a doubt you can take this and live a thousand years listen the church would be full the deacons would have their hands full trying to keep down the crowd try they'd have to lock the doors because too many people would press in amen and and and if there was an offer come and get them Hey listen you don't have to make an altar call you don't have to say listen your mama's in heaven don't you want to see Mama one day and and this and that listen all you got to do is say come and get it and there would be Stampede down to the front to get them why because people want their own life think about it friends what God is offering us is eternal life what God is offering is himself you know we'll go to work on time because if you if you're too late to work too many times you might get a dearit and you won't get a raise next time and so we'll go and we'll do extra work to get a raise but we'll be late every Sunday for church but on time for work because if I'm on time for work I can get I can gain something what's more valuable spend all of our time and all of our energy pursuing things that have no Eternal value but what has more value friend friends we we treat the things of God as if they'll always be there and we can take them or we can leave them my church intendance doesn't really matter whether I'm early or not doesn't matter but the prophet said it matters the word of God says it matters our devotion our daily reading the time we spend in the word our prayer time all of that twitters away so that we can buy and sell and build and have Hey listen we got to buy and sell and build and have there's no way to get away from it but if we truly believed what God has given us I think it'll affect our lives I think if we really if we really believed if you really believe that this is your home church and that God is going to feed you from this Pulpit spiritual food for spiritual growth you'll be here amen you'll be early to pray that that poor man who's just a broken vessel will surrender so God will speak to me if we believe it if we don't then our actions will prove what we believe if we believe this is where God placed me this is the ministry I sit under this is the message of the hour this is the word of of life then if we really believe that that faith will have an effect on our Liv lives amen and the manifestation that comes out from us will manifest what we believe so Jesus says you say you love me you love me you love me it's easy to say you love me but if you love me keep my Commandments you love me you love me there's all kinds of songs all over the world in christiandom about loving Jesus yeah how much they love Jesus and Jesus is all their love and won't do the simple things he says in the Bible he said if you love me keep my Commandments listen if we say we see then our sin remains so you know what I want to say God helped me to see the right thing Amen brother B said brother B said you're not getting it you don't see it like you should he said frankly I don't see it like I should you know what I think I think we're not seeing it like we should I'm praying God makes it more real to us friends more Vivid more personal more in my heart that God that I can say what I believe amen comes into a life because not because I have to live it but because I believe it it automatically becomes life see friends this is a natural thing this isn't a this isn't fake this isn't put on this isn't a crow putting peacock feathers in that won't work it's it's actually a growth that comes from the inside a life of faith that starts to push everything else out and it starts to manifest the life that's on the inside a sheep is not man as a manufacturer wool a sheep Bears wool what does God asked us to do believe him just believe him surrender if we call him Lord let him be Lord if we love him obey him let our lives testify of what we actually believe and the reality is we all have struggles we all have backslidings we all have coolings offs we have warming UPS we have revivals in our own life we have fresh outpourings of the Holy Ghost but friend if you find yourself in that situation where you're cooling off and you need a fresh outpouring of the Holy Ghost cry out for it amen if we find ourselves getting laxed and lethargic about the things of God and pulling back from the things that are the most meaningful things that have ever struck this Earth and we find us a taking a shot attitude but God forgive me and fill me again with your spirit God give me a fresh outpouring I need to come in contact with you again don't be ashamed to cry out for it don't don't just go on in lethargy don't just go on like the Rich Young Ruler acting like oh great good Master but when the requirement is more than I want to give I walk away from the good master I just kneel at no let me come back and say good Master please help me amen that's that that I'm having a hard time I'm struggling with the request but God I believe it's true help my unbelief be real be genuine be honest be 100% be on fire no halfway no 50% this message is Jesus Christ right amen do we say that amen right if we said it we just made ourselves responsible to amen if we said that this message is Jesus Christ then by our own mouth we've made ourselves subject to this message in this day why because he's Lord and I want to say Lord Lord but the real lord lord from my heart be my Lord my Lord be my king be my God be my guide be everything to me God forgive me for getting distracted with things of the world forgive me for getting tangled up and tied up you know God is so good to us friends that he'll allow Calamity to come into our lives so that we have no place to go but back to him he knows what human flesh is like and what the Temptations and struggles of Life are like and he knows listen friends he understands but God will allow things to come in our life barriers and and hardship and difficulties in our own personal family failures and all of these so that we can get back to what's important back to what listen when I first came to this message nothing else in this world mattered to me my other relationships fell away family strained everything went sideways and upside down and backwards but it didn't matter to me I didn't care if I had a job or didn't have a job I had the truth God let me stay with my first love help me not to cool off that was what happened to Ephesus let there be there let there not be an Ephesian cooling off in US am listen we've all every one of us who served God for a while we've made great sacrifices to be where the word is some of you have sold out and moved cross country sold your houses gave up maybe good jobs maybe took a loss on your home had to come to Lima amen maybe left a beautiful place and came to a beautiful place gave up relationships gave up status gave up friends gave up the church you grew up and gave up the traditional teaching of your parents how how many of us when we first come to this we gave up everything and we lost everything we lost our reputation amongst our friends we lost our friends we lost contact with family we lost everything and we were happy why because we were like zakus we were we come in contact with a living God we were like the woman at the well we come in contact with the Living God and we were it didn't matter anymore say God let that Faith still have an effect in my life you who moved me from the place I grew up all my life from the area where I had Root Down you pucked me up and moved me amen why because I wanted the word more than I wanted family I wanted the word more than I wanted my job I wanted the word more than I wanted anything else I say God I still want the word more than anything else help me God help me God what a shame to pluck up and move what a shame to sell out and to find ourselves embroided and Tangled in the world again and going cool and slow when we were red hot and on fire CU it was everything to us let's go back and say God I love you I really love you you and I really want you to be Lord in my life this Faith that's inside of me is calling out for Action obedience surrender remember the Bible tells us what what God wants he said do I take more pleasure in burnt offerings or in obedience burnt offerings looks good and says we love God and we're giving him but really obedience is really a surrender to God and giving to him and I say God bring me back to my first love am and let's all stand together I wonder what church would be like if everybody who came got a raffle ticket and at the end of service we gave away a solid gold bar you wouldn't miss church because you have a scratchy throat but if we had a capsule that could prove you could live A Thousand Years listen friends don't get in your mind that I care anything about church attendance I'm trying to get people to come to church I'm just pointing out what happens in our life amen if we're not diligent and faithful and stay with the word God help us don't ever let us get to the place where I I believe this message but then when our life it's like really do we believe the message is it true but I wanted to be like zakus everybody knew something happened to that man I wanted to be like the woman at the well everybody knew something happened to that I don't want people looking at me and say well I think they believe I'm not sure please God help me not to live like that amen listen friends we need God we need the life of God we need the spirit of God if we receive the word of God by receiving the word of God we open ourselves to the life of the word and let the life of the word come in and live the life of the word brother bam told us with Samson that God can only use Samson's strength because he couldn't get to Samson's heart and brother Benham said God can only use what we surrendered to him and the Rich Young Ruler wasn't willing to surrender all but zakus was and I say God give me a heart to like zakus give me a heart like the woman at the well give me a heart amen like your Apostles amen who dropped their Nets and followed you give me that kind of Heart Lord let that be the faith that's expressed in me am God bless you all I love you all I hope you know I love you amen these things are real friends these things are the things that we face and deal with and we've got to be honest we've got to we got to we got to go back and say why was I willing to lose everything but now I can't give up some sleep or some time or even hurt feelings listen before I didn't care who hurt my feelings I was going to come hear the word amen I didn't care about anything else but this message I said God bring me back to that reality in my life you know what I believe it's still there for me and for you and for all of us if it ever moved us once it's still there to move us friends if it ever called a life out of us it's still calling a life out of us what happens discouragement life get beat down we get entangled and embroider embroiled but I don't want it no more I hope you're the same way I hope you're feeling the same way you know what I want I want to be fervent on fire red hot I want to get to the end of the day or the beginning of the day and I can't wait to read what's next in my book cuz I'm reading Feast of trumpets or statue of a perfect man I can't wait to open my bible and see what the next chapter has for me because I'm in love with him God help us all amen God help me would you pray for me and I'll pray for you

love you we want to serve you your Prophet told us we don't come to church to see our good places we come to find our bad places we come to find the place where we need to grow and God I found places in me that need to grow God I Repent I'm sorry Lord for the laziness the lethargy Lord you know my heart and how I get Bound in my mind with troubles and discouragement and I let it get to me Lord and I pull back and I nurse that discouragement until it keeps me from joyfully loving your word for my first love and my passion and desire for nothing but your truth God if there's anybody else Lord that falls into that condition from time to time I pray God that you would bring bring a fresh outpouring of your spirit may you sweep through us now and burn out Lord all the things that are hindering us Lord May no Little Creeper vine get a hold of us and pull our plant down May no troubles or cares opportunities or blessings May none of it Lord get in our way for God there was a time for each of us where nothing else mattered but you and that's still what we believe that's still in my heart that's still in the heart of your children but God I pray I pray Lord that it wouldn't be that the greatest response would be if we had tablets that could make us live a thousand years that that would move us and that would bring a crowd and that would cause a great Revival and rejoicing for God you've already given us eternal life you've already given us your perfect word you've already given us the truth the reality how could anything be more attractive how could anything be more desirable how could anything have greater value God I pray you help us Lord may it not be that we have to have something special to get a response may it be just your lovely word that we love so much may we not ever have to move to programs or entertainment to keep a crown cause people to want to come may it not be because what we do and Showmanship and workup but God gather us as your people that love your word that love you and you only that are not here for each other that are not serving you because of friendships because of relationships because of gain but we're here because we love you because you revealed yourself to us because you are worthy of our praise and we love you so much God may we make a fresh consecration of our lives and surrender all over again for God we need more of you you have no hands but our hands no mouth but our mouth no eyes but our eyes God you you choose to work through us but God you have to have a vessel that will surrender to you and will empty out Lord Jesus I want to empty out right now Lord let your children right in their seats right now empty out God I pray you'd bring to their mind anything that's getting in the way whether it's work relationship discouragement whatever it is Lord that's starting to drag us down I pray you'd remove it right now in the name of Jesus Christ Lord May your children lift their hands to you and declare Lord I need you to free me Lord I want to come to my first love I want to love you passionately fervently with the desire to reach forth in the spirit God may you cleanse us with the washing of the water of your word may you forgive us as we repent Lord and may you bring back that freshness Lord that fresh Love and Desire Lord we know you've never changed it's us who've changed forgive us Lord
