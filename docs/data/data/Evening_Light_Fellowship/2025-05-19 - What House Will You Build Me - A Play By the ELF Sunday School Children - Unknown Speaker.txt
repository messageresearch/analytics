========================================

Long ago, there was a king who was devoted to his people, serving them faithfully, honestly, and sincerely. King David was a man after God's own heart, who re reigned over Israel for 40 years. During his reign, the ark of the covenant that held the Ten Commandments and represented God's presence among the Israelites had been held captive by the Philistines. King David gathered all his soldiers and all the people of Israel to rescue the ark of the covenant from enemy hands. When they returned to Jerusalem, David called for Zadok, the priests, and the Levites, and said unto them, Ye are the chief of the fathers of the Levites. Sanctify yourselves, both ye and your brethren, that you may bring up the ark of the Lord God of Israel, unto the place that I have prepared for it. Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the Lord, with shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and with symbols, making a noise with sulties and harps. David danced and played, and the great crowd sang with joy, giving praises to God and worshiping the Lord Jehovah. [Music] Don't you know it's time to praise the Lord and sanctuary of his spirit? Set your mind on him and let your praise begin. And the glory of the whole [Music] world. You live within the praises of his people. He love to hear us call upon his name. So set your mind on him and let your prayers begin. Let the glory all this place. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Don't you know it's time to praise the Lord in the sanctuary of his holy spirit? So set your mind on him and let your praise begin. The glory of the Lord will fill his way. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord the Lord. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. [Music] Years after bringing the ark of the covenant back to Jerusalem, King David desired to build a temple for the Lord. But God did not permit this as he was a man of war. Solomon, his son would be given that honor, which would take years of challenges, decisions, and accomplishment. This is a story that tells how obedience and faithfulness brought blessings of wealth and wisdom to a king who was chosen to build a house for Jehovah. It also shares how today God once again has provided a place for his people to gather to praise and worship the King of Kings. Most importantly, may we be reminded to be a holy temple that Christ can dwell in, having first place in our lives. Listen and watch as the evening light fellowship Sunday school children share through scripture and song, "What house will you build [Music] me as weather? May your spirit work within us as we gather. May we glorify your name. Knowing well that as our hearts begin to worship. We'll be blessed because we can. will be blessed because we came. As we gather, may your spirit work within us. As we gather in, we glorify your name. Knowing well that as our hearts begin to worship, we'll be blessed because we [Music] came. We'll be blessed because we came. [Music] I'm alive. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Then King David answered and said, "Call me Bash. Sheba. And she came into the king's presence and stood before the king. And the king said, "As the Lord liveth, thou hath redeemed my soul out of all distress, even as I swear unto thee by the Lord God of Israel, saying, Assuredly, Solomon, thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in mystead, even so will I certainly do this day." Then Basha bow her face to the earth and did reverence to the king and said, "Let my lord king David live forever." And King David said, "Call me Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet and Baniah the son of Jehoa." And they came before the king. The king also said unto them, "Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon and my son to ride upon my own meal. bring him down to Guehon, and let Zedoth the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel, and blow ye with the trumpet, and say, "God, save King Solomon." Then ye shall come up after him, that he may come and sit upon my throne, for he shall be king in mystead. and I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah. And Baniah the son of Jehoeda answered the king and said, "Amen." Amen. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] Glory. Hallelujah. Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. And so that the priest took a horn of oil out of the tabernac. Tabernacle anoint Solomon and they blew the [Music] trumpets and all and all people said God save King Solomon. God save. [Music] And all the people came after him. And the people piped with pipes and rejoiced with great joy so that the earth went with them. [Music] And David said to Solomon his son, Solomon, my son, know thou God of thy father and serve of him with a perfect heart and a willing mind. For the Lord searchth all hearts, and understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts. If thou seek him, he will be found of thee. But if thou forsake him, he will be cast off forever. Be strong and of good courage, endure it. Fear not, nor be dismayed. For the Lord God, even my God, will be with thee. He will not fail thee, nor forsake thee until thou has finished all the work for the service of the house of the Lord. [Music] [Applause] [Music] As David begins addressing his son, the sc the court scribe comes forward bearing a scroll. David receives the scroll and places it in the hands of his son. It contains the plans for the temple which David himself has drawn under the inspiration of God and my people. As for me, I had in mine heart to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the Lord and for the foottool of our God. But God said unto me, thou shalt not build a house for my name because thou has been and of war and has shed light. How be it, the Lord God of Israel chose me before all the house of my father to be king over Israel forever. And he said unto me, Sol Solomon, thy son, he shall build my house and my courts, for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his father. Moreover, I will establish his kingdom forever, if he be constant to do my commandments and my judgments as at this day. Now therefore, in the sight of all Israel, the congregation of the Lord, and in the audience of our God, keep and seek for all the commandments of the Lord your God, that ye may possess this good land, and leave it for the inheritance for your children after you forever. Now set your heart on your soul to seek the Lord your God. Arise therefore and barely the sanctuary of the Lord God to bring the ark of the covenant of the Lord and the holy vessels of God into the house that is to be built to the name of the Lord. Take it now, for the Lord has chosen thee to build an house for the sanctuary. Be strong and do it. 1 Chronicles 29 tells us that as all Israel stood before David, he spoke, saying, Solomon, my son, know thou the God of thy father, and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind. For the Lord searchth all hearts, and understands all the imaginations of the thoughts. If thou seek him, he will be found of thee, but if thou forsake him, he will cast thee off forever. May we too continue to follow the words of King David and seek the Lord daily. As the king knew the building of the structure would be great. Chapter 29 shares that David spoke to the people of Israel, saying, "Moreover, I have set my affection to the house of my God. I have of mine own proper goods of gold and silver which I have given to the house of my God over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house. Who of you my dear people will offer willingly consecrating himself today to the Lord? Then the chief of the fathers and princes of the tribes of Israel and the captains of thousands and of hundreds with the rulers of the king's work offered willingly [Music] Let us give to the house of the Lord. Let our feet stand in your gates. Let us give to the house of the Lord. Let our feet stand in your gates. We will pray for the peace of Jerusalem. May all love you be secure. May the world always be peace within your walls. May goodness and hope always endure. Let us go to the house of the Lord. Let our feet stand in your gates. Let us give to the house of the Lord. Let our feast stand in your gates. [Music] They gave for the service of the house of God, of gold, 5,000 talents and 10,000 drs, and of silver 10,000 talents, and of brass, 18,000 talents, and 100,000 talents of iron. And they, with whom precious stones were found, gave them to the treasury of the house of the Lord. Then the people rejoiced for that they offered willingly, because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the Lord. And David the king also rejoiced with great joy. And David said to all the congregation, "Now bless the Lord your God and all the congregation. Blessed the Lord God of their fathers and bow down their heads and worship the Lord and the King." And they sacrificed sacrifices unto the Lord and burnt and offered burnt offerings unto the Lord. on tomorrow after that day even a thousand bulllocks, a thousand rams and a thousand lambs with their drink offerings and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel and did eat and drink before the Lord on that day with great gladness. And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time and anointed him unto the Lord to be chief governor and Jadok to be a priest. Then Solomon sat on the throne of the Lord as king instead David his father and pro pres and all Israel obeyed him. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Let's go. [Music] [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Um, I meant to build a house again. Huh? Have fun built his house on the walk house on the walk his house on the rock and the rain down. Down the bus came up. The rain came down. came up. The came down and the came up and the on the rocks the [Music] world on the Lord Jesus Christ. So build your house on the Lord Jesus Christ. So build your house on the Lord Jesus Christ. [Music] house wash down goes the wash on. [Music] [Applause] When King David knew the end of his years were drawing near, he gathered the leaders of Israel together and told them to support Solomon so that he would be successful in this great task. After his death, King Solomon made preparations to build the temple. Phoenician builders were called, and he had great ships bring logs of cedar, juniper, and cypress wood from foreign lands. Gold, silver, precious stones, and tons of stone carved from distant mountains were brought to Jerusalem. He ordered iron, and more bronze than could be weighed to make nails and other things for the great temple. 1 Chronicles 22:15 records, "There were workmen in abundance, heers and workers of stone and timber, and all manner of cunning men for every manner of work." First Kings 6:7 tells us, "Solomon had the stones finished at quarry, so that no hammer or chisel or any iron tool was heard in the temple while it was being built." Every day the children of Israel worked long and hard to build the temple. [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] For more than seven years, Solomon diligently embarked upon this great work, building a temple for the Lord to dwell. We have seen God repeat history through a man of God, our pastor, Brother Ron Peterson, praying, planning, and working hard to have a place for God and his people. Let's take a minute and watch the work that has taken place. [Music] God is building a house. God is building a house. God is building a house that will stand. It is being put together by the one we [Music] s Christ is head of this house. Christ is head of this house. Christ is head of this house that will stand. Christ is Lord. Christ is king. Joyou praises we will sing. Christ is head of this house that will stand. We are part of this house. We are part of this house. We are part of this house. that will stand. We are members of the body in Christ. We are made one. We are part of this house that will stand. God is building a house. God is building a house. God is building a house that will stand. It is being put together by the lively sound weather. God is building a house that will stand. Christ is head of this house. Christ is head of this house. Christ is head of this house that will stand. Christ is Lord. Christ is king. Glorious praises we will sing. Christ is head of this house that will stand. God is building a house that will stand. But when God came to his own temple, the church, the the people, when he came to them, he filled it. The temples that were dedicated just like he did at Solomon's temple. He filled it not with creeds, not with denominations, but with himself. He filled the temple. Praise the Lord. Amen. With his shakina glory. Amen. God always fills his temple at the day of dedication. He fills his temple. He fills it with himself. The same thing today. God will fill every temple that will thoroughly dedicate itself to him. Amen. Any persons that will the temple is not this little building here. The temple is not the one in Salt Lake City. The temple is not the one in Rome. Amen. The temple is you. Amen. You are the temple that God wants to dwell in and express himself through it. The all nations might know him. You are living images of God that God wants to work through. Praise the Lord. And any time that any man or any woman will forget all the falsehood that they've heard in the world and come back to the line of the scripture. Amen. And will keep in line just like Solomon did to what Moses did, Moses did to what God did. God always respected it. And if we'll come back to the original dedication, Amen. and will open our hearts and empty ourselves. God in dedication as we give it to him will fill our temple with his shakina glory. Praise the Lord. Then the living God will be moving in a living church among a living people and will spread forth his glory. Amen. Then together someday, one being this way and one this way and one one part of the country shall come together to make the bride. Amen. will be caught up in the air to meet him. Amen. Now this lovely church this building that the people with their tokens of their livelihood with their love for Christ the worshippers has dedicating today this place of worship that people could come and worship. Now my sincere prayer is that every worship will worshiper will dedicate his own temple to worship in the temple that's being dedicated for worship. Amen. Praise the Lord. That's the real dedication. While building the temple, the word of the Lord came to Solomon, saying, "Concerning this house which you are building, if you will walk in my statutes and execute my judgments, and keep all my commandments and walk in them, then I will carry out my word with you, which I spoke to David your father. And I will dwell among the people of Israel, and will not forsake my people." When Solomon had finished the temple, it stood four stories tall, 90 ft long and 30 ft wide. He made beveled windows for the house. It was built of stone cut from mountains and prepared in the quarry, so that neither hammer nor axe or any tool of iron was heard in the house while it was being built. A door to the middle chamber was on the right side with a set of winding stairs leading to the top. The interior walls of the building were completely covered in cedar wood and decorated with beautiful carvings of cherubam, palm trees, and open flowers. For the entrance to the inner sanctuary, he made doors of olive wood. The walls and floors were covered in pure gold as well as the whole altar. Not one spot of stone was showing. There wasn't a single service of the temple that was without decoration. It was truly a beautiful, magnificent sight. [Music] We dedicate this temple. to you Lord. Let your glory fill the sanctuary. Be enthroned on the praises of your people. Lord, we agree in unity. This is your house. Father, come and dwell. This is your house. A holy house of prayer where the lost and the lonely bring their burdens and their pain. This is your house. This is your house. Lord come and dwell. [Music] Holy Spirit, overflow this place. Decorate our walls with grace and [Music] mercy. Let healing and redemption find searching soul. Lord, have your way. We humbly pray. This is your house. Father, come and dwell. This is your house. In a holy house of prayer, where the lost and the lonely bring their burdens and their cares. This is your house. This is your house. This is your house. Father, come and dwell. This is your house. A holy house of prayer is where the lost and the lonely bring their burdens and their peace. This is your house. This is your house. Come and [Music] dwell. Over the years, God has blessed Evening Life Fellowship and the use of our church. Let's watch some of the memories that have taken place here. [Music] [Music] Come my child, there is a place when you're lost, You will be found. You be safe. And you be alone. You will hear the sweetest sound. This is the place where we pray. This is a place where we cry. This is a place where we start till death do us part, where we say goodbye. Here we leave all our pain. Find forgiveness and grace. Here we walk down the aisle. Dedicate every child here in this sacred place. Break some bread. Come share the wine. At this table there is a place. Bring your fears and take his peace. Come and share this holy spare. [Music] This is the place where we pray. This is the place where we cry. This is the place where we start till death do us part, where we say goodbye. And here we leave all our pain. Find forgiveness and grace. Here we walk down the aisle. Dedicate every child here in this sacred place. Holy, [Music] holy, holy, holy, holy God [Music] Almighty [Music] [Applause] Emmanuel. This is the place where we pray. This is the place where we cry. This is a place where we start till death do us part where we say goodbye. Here we leave all our pain. Find forgiveness and here we walk down the aisle. Dedicate every child here in this sacred place. Here we leave all our pain. Find forgiveness and grace. Here we walk down the aisle. Dedicate every child here in this sacred place. [Music] [Music] Now that King Solomon has completed his father's vision, it is time to bring the holy vessels and the ark of the covenant into the temple. Solomon assembles the elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel in Jerusalem. The elders of Israel watch as a procession of priests carry the ark of the covenant into the temple. As it is placed upon the altar of the inner sanctuary, a great cloud appears as the glory of the Lord fills the temple. The cloud is so thick that the priests cannot perform their work. As he sees the glory of the Lord fill the temple, King Solomon knows that God is pleased. Now is the time to offer a praise and thanksgiving to God. Scripture tells us in 2 Chronicles 6 that Solomon made a brazen scaffold and set it in the midst of the court and knelt down before all the congregation. And Solomon spread forth his hands toward heaven. And he said,"Lord God of Israel, there is no God like thee, in heaven above or on earth beneath, who keepeth covenant and mercy with thy servants that walk before thee with all their heart. Therefore now, Lord God of Israel, keep with thy servant David, my father, that thou promised him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel, so that thy children take heed to their way, that they walk before me, as thou has walked before me." And now, oh God of Israel, let thy word, I pray, they be verified, which thou spakest unto thy servant David my father, that thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day, even toward the place of which thou has said, my name shall be there, that thou mayest hearken under the prayer which thy servant shall make towards this place. Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people Israel, that thou teach them the good way wherein they should walk, and give rain upon thy land, which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance, that they may fear thee all the days that they live in the land, which thou gave us unto our fathers. May all people of the earth know thy name to fear thee, that they may know that this house which I have builded, is called by thy name, O Lord God. Heavenly Father, what house will you build [Music] me? God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. [Music] Surely there is a blueprint in heaven that we might know how to have a house that is pleasing to you. I pray heavenly father that each one that saw this reenactment of what had gone on in Jerusalem, Father God, may we take heed knowing that you have a house, a temple that is not made with hands. That's the temple that you desire to dwell in. Therefore, Father, let us take heed to live a life that is pleasing to you. Grant to us revelation, Father, even as David was and Moses and different ones were given blueprints, Father, you have given us a blueprint called the message of the hour. How that we can live a life that is pleasing to you. I pray heavenly father that you will allow each one to bring their sacrifices of praise and respect and honor to you and would you consume our sacrifice even as you did David's and receive it father we ask it in the mighty and precious name of our lord and savior Jesus Christ amen [Music] man. When all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down and the glory of the Lord upon the house, they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pavement and worshiped and praised the Lord, saying, "For he is good, for his mercy endures forever. [Music] Surely the presence of the Lord is in this place. I can feel his mighty power and his grace. [Music] I can hear the brush of angels wings. I see glory on each face. Surely the presence of the Lord is in this [Music] place. In the midst of his children the Lord said he would be. It doesn't take very many It can be just two or three. And I feel that same sweet spirit that I felt off times before. Oh, surely I can say I've been with the Lord. Surely the presence of the Lord is in this place. I can feel his mighty power and his grace. I can hear the brush of angels wings. I see glory on each face. Surely the presence of the Lord is in this [Music] place. There's a holy hush around us. As God's glory fills this place, I've touched the hem of his garment and I can almost see his face and my heart is overflowing with the fullness of his joy. I know with a doubt that I've been with the Lord. Surely the presence of the Lord is in this place. I can feel his mighty power and his grace. face. I can hear the brush of angels wings. I see gloryy on each face. Surely the presence of the Lord is in this place. Surely the presence of the Lord is in this place. I can feel his mighty power and his [Music] grace. I can hear the rush of angels wings. I see gloryy on each face. Surely the presence of the Lord is in his place. Sing it with us. Surely the presence of the Lord is in this place. I can feel his mighty power and his praise. I can hear the crushing angels wings. I see glory on each face. Surely the presence of the Lord is in. I can hear the brush. I can hear the brush of angel wings. See glory on each face. Surely the presence of the Lord is in this place. Amen. Surely the presence of the Lord is in this place. Amen. Let's have the lights on. If you enjoyed the evening light fellowship Sunday school children tonight, let's have them all stand. Give them another round of applause. Children, you can sit down. It's been a lot of effort has gone into this tonight. children, you may have your seats for a moment if you want to sit down. A lot of effort has gone into this tonight and we want to thank you most of all for coming tonight and Sister Tina has a few words that she would like to share. Everything that went well has just been the Lord. If you would have seen how much handicap we had through a lot of our practices, it was like how was this going to happen? But that sermon this morning came to life all through when God inspired me to start the play. Concentrating on him, focused, just praying, asking, and he'd have things work out. And it was such a wonderful experience for me. And these children did absolutely wonderful, wonderful. And but even though I felt that the Lord was working, he gave me some God with skin on it because I needed a lot of it. And we have all those helpers if they could come out that they did helped manage the kids. They did all the parts to pull their parts, their verses. Let's get you up here because you did a lot of work. Let's get you up here. The practices, the endless practices. We all have busy lives. And so, you know, trying to fit in practices. There was Becky, what's what are you doing? We all have busy lives, but we just kind of kept saying, "What day worked?" And and we'd find another day. And so, they all helped wonderfully. And and on top of that, on the back of your um uh program where it says that every cunning man was brought for all manner of work, God did that for us today. He brought these people and that program has a list of all those others. Can all those others stand? We had slideshow people. We have sound people. We had painters. All right, if you're here, we had a whole lot of others that helped as well. I guess they're a little shy, but we had all those that did too. Yeah, if you want to you want to go home. And the second person beside the Lord of helping me out, my husband was so endlessly supporting me and I thank him so much for the practices for the work for me at the computer and sewing and painting and but it was it's so worth it to me when you see what you get with the the the enjoyment on these children and what they learn and how much they love it. Let's do it again next week. Sister Tina, hold on. We only do this every seven years. So, I thank you all so very much. And all of you parents, the sacrifices you made to come bring your kids. I mean, surprise is not very close to many of your homes, the distances that you had, the waiting periods of waiting at the church or a restaurant or a coffee shop. I so appreciate that so much. Thank you all very much. Brother Ron, did you want to come and say a few words? I'd like to have Sandy if she'd come out here right now for a moment. Wow, that was something. Let's give them a big hand again. Yeah. Wow. You really don't know how much work and effort it takes to do this, especially with the little ones and everything, but they did a tremendous job. All of them, the readers, the ones that helped build the temple and everything. I just uh I tell you what, it's inspiring. You just watch little kids, but you know that this was a real event that happened years ago and everything. And uh my my it just is uh inspiring. I want to say that. Sister Tina, Brother Mark, come up here if you would please. Uh this is on behalf of Sandy and I in the church. We'd like to go ahead and give you these flowers and a card. And that's it's definitely not enough. Go ahead and give it to him. Should get him a car. Should get him a car. or a motor home and a two week vacation anywhere in the world. You're going to need some RNR after this. Lord did it all. The Lord did it all. Yeah. But he had skin on it. And guess what? Um, brother Mark, you get your wife back now. And uh so anyway, uh on behalf of all of the work that you did and the inspiration, everything starts by a vision. And Sister Tina, really, you wrote this play. You made the scenes. You did all of that. She put all of the parts together. And the Bible says that without a vision, the people perish. But here she put together a vision of this play and the put the helpers and the different ones together. And and I just want to say on behalf of pastor of this church, what a tremendous job you did and great will be your reward. Amen. God bless you. Did I forget anything, Sandry? No. Just thank you to everybody. You there's just so many different people that are involved. So it just is such amazing how it all comes together. And so the Johnson family, they're hiding. That's the shy ones. No, they're just I so much appreciate is there is so much talent in this church. I mean, you know, I maybe I had a vision of a slideshow and I said, Matt, yes, I need help. And he just sure whipped that together. No problem. You know, and it just the talent is just and brother Ron allows that talent to be used and that I am so thankful for. Yeah. the singers, the musicians. It's amazing. Amen. And when we think of Evening Light Fellowship and you look back and you can see each one of you are an integral part. We've grown up together. You look back over the years and you see the things that God has done and the things we've come through. Each and every one of you are an integral part. If we were to take all of the photos and and really go way back all the way to Maryland and everything, my my my I just want to say on behalf of myself and my wife, I am humbled and I am extremely pleased to be represented with such a um charactered people. I feel as one of the most blessed pastors in the message and I want to say to all of you God's riches blessings be upon each one and I pray that we will this is my prayer. Lord, let me be the pastor with the largest representation of bride members to take as many home with me as I can. And I that's my desire. I don't want to leave nobody.
