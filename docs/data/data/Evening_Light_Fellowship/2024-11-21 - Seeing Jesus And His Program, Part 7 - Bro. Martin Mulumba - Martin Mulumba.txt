in this hour Lord we looking away unto you tonight we ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name amen amen may God bless you all tonight uh it is a privilege once again to be in the house of the Lord uh shall we take our Bibles in the book of 2 King chapter 4 uh we keep uh pursuing our title of uh seeing Jesus and his program this will be part seven by God's grace um 2 King chapter 4:8 probably be a lengthy reading but uh we'll go till verse 17 but I'll probably just read two three verses so you may have your seat right after and it fell on a day that Elisha passed to shenon where was a great woman and she was contrain and she constrained him to eat bread and so it was that has of as he passed by he turn he turned in heer to eat bread and she said unto her husband behold now I perceive that this is an old and holy man of God which passes by us continually let us make a little chamber I pray thee on the wall on the wall and let us set him uh set for him there a bed and a table and a stool and a candle stick and it shall be when he cometh to us that it shall turn in theater may God bless the reading of his the word you may be seated uh thank you once again brother R for the opportunity and uh thank you Church to make it uh tonight believe uh by God's grace uh this will be sing Jesus and his program El let us Ministry part four uh We Believe by God's grace we'll try to maybe close it up according to his leadership because I think uh this also will be my uh last sermon as a bachelor and uh but God grace so we'll uh we'll proceed from uh maybe next time that we meet again we'll be I'll be waving my hand a little bit more to bless the rest of the people amen um we see that um the Bible says that he fell on the day that Elisha pass to Shon where there was a great woman uh we can see that Elijah's Ministry is very uh specific we understand that uh this is times calls him Elijah Elijah we're not speaking on the natural man Elisha but we're speaking about the ministry that changes forms and does specific things and takes shapes and form as we have seen it in previous messages that the spirit of the Lord comes in form of the brothers and sisters uh but we want to look into uh this part where uh the man of God was dealing with uh uh the great woman of shanam who was a barren woman but we understand that according to the prophecy that no woman was to be uh Barren in the land but then we see uh that the woman was uh looking at uh the man of God who was passing by he she just didn't accept him or carry him over because we understand that in the hour that we living in deception is quite at a higher rate that even the very learned one and intellectual ones uh they are quite easily deceived in the last days and after they they've taken the decision to become transgender and things after a while then they realize that they've done a FAL mistake that they can't reverse it then we see that it was uh the woman of shum shun uh looked at uh the man of God uh he said like you know let me approach him let me go to that church let me listen to that sermon a little bit by God's grace and looking into the situation uh she turned to her husband uh she was under a certain leadership she was not a free woman as uh we see the feminist U system in this last hour but she was always able to report to her husband before she takes any decision she said like you know my husband with um feeling this leadership and say well I perceive that uh that this is an holy man of God as we've looked into the prophet we looked at him we just didn't accept him or even the Lord Jesus himself it said that you know you don't need to uh believe me but the works that I do testify of who I am and the works that Jesus did brought us to the great understanding of who he was from Genesis all the way to Malachi in the days that he was in the days of his flesh and um the man of God was walking by continually by God's grace and uh we uh he brought him a little bit close she brought him a little bit closer uh she started looking at him what are you preaching what are your Doctrine and stuff and when she came to the realization that hey there's a there's something different about this man then she said let us make a little chamber somewhere I pray thee on the wall and let us set for him there a bed in a household where the household was not just a place of movies and all kind of music and all things but they had a table set up for prayer for prayer meeting and to be able to listen to The Prophet but then watch then she goes into a little bit more details and start setting up the altar in the house and she said like you know let us have a table and let us have a stool and a candle stick and we understand that uh the candle stick is the mystery of the seven Church ages that uh they un she understood that this man was able to give us what we have need of because she just didn't approach the man of God with the understanding of bless me let me have a call let me have this let me have that no she first desired to know what the man had with him because uh in this hour uh we go by uh the outward appearance she's beautiful handsome he's very muscular he has all these things and he works this job and let me do a background check let me see his credit score and all these things but then the woman didn't go about that the woman understood God's program in the timeing which she was living in and then she said that and it fell on the day that he came here and he turned into the chamber he accepted the invitation because Jesus always keeps all his appointments and lay there and let and he said to Gaz his servant because when the word of God comes into your life that he also start looking at what's going on when you are interested in him he's also interested in you come draw nowhere to me and I'll draw nowhere near to you then uh the woman start looking and said yeah the prophet start looking at her said what's her problem what can we do for her she's doing all this great work what can we do for her and she said and he said unto him he said say now unto her behold thou has been carefully care careful for us with all this scare what is it what is to be done for thee wouldest thou be spoken to to the king or the captain of the host and she answered I dwell among among uh my own people and he said what then is to be done for her and gazi answered verily she had no child and her husband and her husband he's old this takes us back directly in Genesis 18 because the same scenario a barren woman in the land in the time of visitation because she understood that this is the hour of our visitation that this man of God in the land is not just a natural man just like the the rest of the people but this is a sent angel of God and this angel of God didn't just come along just uh to uh pass by and eat the bread and collect Titan offering but the man of God came with the table came with the Candlestick came with the bed because all these things place the altar right in the house and in this hour that the Church of the Living God is called also to be that Tabernacle that where all the altar the candlesticks and everything the uh Ark of the Covenant has to be laid in and she understanding it said like you know I need to bring this man by because he's not looking unto a man but she is Discerning the body of Christ understanding the ministry of the son of man in the hour of her visitation and according to the purpose of her life she knows that God's program in the Bible is Bound for her to give birth she didn't just bring a problem first to the to the men of God he say come first rebuild the altar in the house after rebuilding the altar then now we have access with boldness to the king of kings and when we get to him then is bound by his word to fulfill his word he said then what is your issue she said you know I am I live among my people I go to church we see that you pay the tights and offering and everything that's fine but then what is your issue then the prophet look say oh she doesn't have a child there's no pedigree there's no continuity of the life the man is old he doesn't have any pleasure anymore but then he said he said he said call her come here then she comes to the prayer line and when he called her she stood in the door and he said about this season according to the time of life thou shall Embrace a son Genesis 18 and when the visitation came back then it was a body made out of the Dust of the Earth but in this hour it was a man born of a woman and a man that has to cover to Veil this God because this God that was unseen unheard of this God that was walking in the middle of the Candlestick of in the uh in the midst of the candles sticks this one that was seen by John walking in the midst of it all and at the end he said I shall see my pedigree amen because the promise because God's word does not go forth it does not it doesn't go forth without fulfilling the purpose where unto it was sent and when the word went forth then it was said that you know according to the time of life and for her to be able to get to the time of life the man must be made young again there must be a body change made prepared in order for the seed to come forth in the body again and when the seed goes into the body then now the word must be brought to manifestation and as she was standing in that time of visitation very conscious of what God has Proclaim for her life and accordingly as we see we saw it in the previous services that we set under the ministry of Elijah we're not sitting there under denomination cares we're not bringing our own ideas but we are conscious that we have found those that the prophet has has spoken about Jesus came and died upon the cross but that was not enough because Jesus Paid the price after paying the price then he required reclaiming the price and by reclaiming we needed now the visitation the manifestation that nature was looking for because when he got married to the woman he had the promise that he shall see his pedigree but he found himself that he was getting old and older and nothing was happening but glory be to God there's nothing new Under the Sun that when we understand the cycle that we know that when the Sun rises it will bring forth life again but then it require first that the seed to be in the seed in the in the soil and now it said that and and and and and uh verse 16 and and he said about this season according to the time of life thou shall Embrace a son and she said name my Lord thou men of God do not lie to me she gets excited he said I've waited this all my life nobody I've went to all the churches I've seen all kind of denominations please do not lie to me all the previous one could not give me life nobody all of them they were just taking advantage of me John 4 when she was standing there at the at the well he said like you know you've had five husbands and the one that you have right now is not yours none of them could be able to take away her shame and we've walked all these seven Church ages and we've went on probbing on these things probbing on that that we we couldn't understand the deity of Jesus Christ we couldn't understand the mystery of the revealed book but then at the evening time and it fell on a day and on the day of visitation that he say like you know this is my word and this is the promise and This Promise according to the time of life it's no more just go and believe it shall happen no no no no no no it's a precise moment according to the time of life and when you understand that when is the time of life in your life then you know how to walk with Precision with boldness and you know I'm going to claim my inheritance because at at the year 50 49 we start looking when is the sun rising as soon as we start seeing that a little bit of light it doesn't matter if we see the entire Revelation but as long as we see a little bit of light We Shall Believe the whole truth because what he has started it shall surely bring it to pass because he is the author and finisher and when we believe him he said yes do not lie to me thou men of God unto the handmade and the woman conceive the Bible says and bear a son and that season that Elisha had said unto her according to the term of life and this is the time in which we are living in that the world the church we are finding that despite of all this Revelation despite of all this requirements that is set by God's word that the Church find himself a little bit struggling to be able to move forward the church finding itself trying to look like the rest of the world it's as if like no there's no more excitement in the church it's almost as if like you know going to church and being sitting in the Heavenly places in Christ Jesus is such a burden in this last hour because there's a deception out there that looks so much better than what God has promised brother bam says the spiritual Amnesia paragraph 49 they had a bed case of it after God had been good to them and brought them up from all the Heathen lands and made them a separate people separated them to himself he said he took a vine out of another country and planted it over in another country how he fixed it around and make it grow fruitful uh uh to grow fruit and be fruitful but the vine forgot where its blessings come from the church in this hour they forget who they are we forget we try like you know to compare ourselves out there and at times it's just after service a day or two and then we are back again into those things then there's an issue then there's something wrong happening but then in seeing Jesus in his program that this woman must be able to keep this thing conscious before her must be able to walk according to this because this is her motivation because this is what will keep her working in certain line in order to reach the maturity that is Promised in the word and the word here is showing the type of this woman as a tree and this tree has to be planted by the rivers of water and this rivers of water is not some man-made ideas but the message of the hour because she when she received the word of Elisha she has to start working every day with the understanding that according to the time of life I have to conceive her mind is f focus upon what the prophet said the pmos vision in John 15 Jesus said I am the vine ye are the branches he is the men Vine that which come out of the original root from the original seed that that has the life in it now the vine does not bear fruit it is the branches that do that now watch this you can take the you can take a Citrix tree such as an orange tree and and graft it into into it a a a a grapeful grape fruit limb a a lemon limb a tangelo limb and all kind of variety of things but those grafted limbs will not bear oranges why no sir the lemon limb will bear lemon and the grap grapefruit limber will be grapefruit and so on yet those limbs will be driving of the life in the tree but if that tree ever puts forth another branch of itself if ever the son of man comes down and find faith on Earth then he shall bring forth a seed after itself but then the woman under the leaders ship of Elijah elishah under the leadership of Elijah Elijah under the Le of God's leadership all together we are bound to reproduce the same life and this woman are is bound to do exactly God has promised in the word for her to fulfill pastors deacons hashers house wife everything that you can tell that we seeing the mystery of the Bible in the woman because that's what we've been showing seeing Jesus in his program that we started with Martin Luther King Jr a minister who couldn't keep God's program but was was in uh enticed by the communist Spirit but here now that we see that according to God's program God called Elijah he said anoint these three people these three people have specific things that will that will be happening in the land and we seeing the world getting excited in the world of message about Donald Trump reelection and all these things here but then there's no excitement about the brides Ministry we are more excited about what they what be happening how the tax code will be you know helping the businesses but then if it doesn't fulfill what said that is going to fulfill then you know the other Camp will return in full power and that will just rush us into God's program and if the expectation according to God's program is for him to do what he said to do to bring make America great again then God's program will fail that can only be understood so according to the prophet because in Noah's time they were given seven days to get into the ark but they never met it in they thought that Noah was crazy they thought that seventh day they always say like you know there's no more rain oh the war in Ukraine will stop and we'll have a good life and everything don't be deceived see Jesus and his program tell him to show you what is happening Donald Trump will not do anything the prophet told us there's no Abraham Lincoln there's nobody good that will put there that will bring back the country the country is far gone since uh 56 and when you reject the word you give the that you open the door for the devil to be incarnate and this is the nation that deceive all the world with all the filter of Jezebel Let It Be Joe Biden Let It Be Obama Let It Be Bush Let It Be whoever we we want to have Elon Musk or whatever you want to have back there the country is gone if God gives us seven years as he did in t Noah's time let's be assure to be inside and to be inside is to see Jesus and his program and to know exactly my position because the program is showing us that Elijah has come and anointed the people and who are you anointed by now you start bitting there looking at Donald Trump as your savior come on church you can see this without God's program because when we that's why we say like you know sit under Elijah's Ministry amen it's not just a sermon but this is a calling and alert that do not be deceived God is still walking is still moving because in the day of his flesh the Roman Empire was was leading the world as America is leading the world today they saw the manifestation on um Matthew 17 his adoption he came down we have received The Cloud of Glory today amen and then when he goes and they crucified him by the Roman system did that give them ways to become greater again no he said that you know pray that when the destruction come let it not be in Winter pray that when that that time comes you're not on the justification level sanctification level but be thou adopted you know am be thou placed in the body be thou like the woman said that I know that this is a man of God let bring in him let bring him bring him inside let's set the table and the the the the the the the tapes and everything let's be a work church and the prophet is showing us now this church here like they bringing all these ideas grap uh uh grafting it to the tree he said no no no no no but he say when I have that type of seed again if the vine because the root that's where the seed was it gave out the root and he gave the vine and if that vine is able to produce its own uh uh branches it will bring forth the same seed and that seed is what we are looking for because the seed shall come back to seed it's not like you know we we coming to church and the church is standing there and you know politics this and this is going to get better no it's not we want to go home anyways we want to go home and when we want to go home we looking at the calendar when you know the time this season the the you the cycle you know it's in 17 days it's in 15 days it's in 4 days because when the uh the bo the the the son from Chicago came to Denver he said like you know look at the time and the season when you start seeing this come and stand at the door and you shall see me coming while the rest of the sisters were looking at her like you know do you think that that really is going to happen do you think that William brandham really knows what he's talking about do you really if think like you know this is going to happen then before you know it yes and he is that's the voice of my beloved he's coming on The Chariot I can hear him coming and this coming we're not talking about him coming we talking about the departure and he is coming to take us away what is our Focus the sisters the denomination the politics no because the woman said do not lie to me I am very I'm taking you seriously I've watched you I've listened to your tapes do not lie to me I am your servant I've given the water to the camels and this message you must take me to the to my husband and if this message doesn't take us to our our master then what are we we are the most deceived people in the world and we have to be very certain of God he said that's the way the church is the vine has been split into Limbs and have been grafted in they have grafted Baptist limbs Methodist Limbs and Presbyterian Limbs and Pentecostal Limbs and those limbs are are bearing Baptist Methodist Pentecostal and Pres Arian fruits we call ourselves and message Believers fruits of our own understanding our Doctrine left and right but then if we go back to the fruit to the very seed word the spoken word we have to produce the same thing may God help me to go quickly and get to the message here denominational seeds from from which they produce the fruit but if the vine ever brings forth another branch of itself the branch will be exactly the the vine itself it will be the same kind of a of a branch that was brought forth at Pentecost it will speak in tongues prophesize and have the power and sign of the of the resurrected Jesus Christ why because it's striving on the natural resources of the vine itself like you know brother brother said this year I think this one here he was too radical he was making a joke he wasn't he didn't really understand what did watch the PN in the message first sir sit down with the prophet let me insist on that sit down with the prophet watch the P from 47 that is recorded all the way to 65 it's the same pattern amen he may express it for prayer meanings and prayer line and discernment and all that you want to call it first pool second third pool but then when start God start opening his word he's not a partial God because he's the one from Genesis to Revelation he may have given us a little bit of information in the 40s in the 50s in the 60s until we were mature enough to Bear what he was said in 60s otherwise we we'll be we'll be looking at the message like you know this is not important and before you know it you end up with a car you say like you know oh in the car the most important thing is just the wheel a comfortable seat and all this year I don't need the the the the spark plug and I don't need the the the the injector and stuff before you know it the car can move you can't get anywhere because you've believed in some of the things of the message and some other you've left them out but say you know what good is it to have such a beautiful building such a beautiful people but there's no power of the Holy Ghost in them what good is it like you know to look like Church Believers but then there's no message in US that's what he's expressing here that if we are the same the the the vine is producing the same uh H Branch again he will bring forth the very same seed because he doesn't compromise on his word he's looking at us and he wants us to have exactly the very life of his own there's no debate for those who have been to the army they can tell you that there's no debate everything has been figured out for you everything you have to say like know yes sir yes sir you just stand up and yes sir go catch your hair yes sir wake up at 5 yes sir that's what it is there's no debate there's not democracy in there and democracy has proven its limit they've went into democracy and they've done all kind of things the prophet shows us he said like you know the only thing that will work is God blessing a king upon a nation that he choses to place himself and the city the only head that will sit there is the king of the the son of David precise word we need to bring forth the word we need to bring forth the seed why you see it wasn't grafted into the vine it was born in the vine when those other es were grafted in all they could do was Bear their own fruit for they they were not born of that vine that they don't know about the that original life and original Fruit they cannot know that they were not born of it but if they had been born of it that same life that was in the original stem Jesus would come would would have come through them and manifest ed through them and the Lord is looking into that and when he's looking into that he's very conscious that this is done according to his promise Isaiah 53:10 it say yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him the seed The Original Seed he have put him to grief when th shall make his soul an offering for sin and yet he shall see his seed he shall prolong his days how does he prolong the day Jesus changing forms Jesus along the church edges because the woman was Barren there was a promise that you shall not there shall not be barren woman in the land and here he says that he has to see seed but the seed to come forth it require a land and that land is the woman and this woman now has to bring forth according to the word of elishah and Elijah is standing there he say like you know I do not call you church anymore but I call you what and the bride is just to stand there with beautiful pictures and day of the wedding thing no go home bring forth according to what the time of life she has that understanding and if this doesn't take place she has all the right to question that as Rebecca did with Isaac said like you know why why am I not uh I believe was Jacob if I'm not mistaken and Jacob will say am I God am I the one giving children that's why we go in the churches we go to fitness we want to be young but that's not the husband that will make us young we go to the doctors they do everything they can they're taking babies and destroying the lives and taking all the resources to make them young in China they stand out making F pray they transplant why there that deep calling to live forever there's that deepness that he shall see he se but they didn't come according to God's program that's the problem with the church they want to come with their own resources they say like the Bible said in that day the woman will come and say you know we'll just carry your name we'll pay our own thing we'll will dress the way we want we will do whatever we want but he say no you have to see me and my program I'll tell you the way back I'll lead you step by step you don't know you've never been this way stay behind the ark but the church doesn't want that because they were grafted in since they were grafted in that's why it's so hard for them to believe the pr Propet that's why they're finding all mistakes in the message but then if they set like Elijah set under Elijah's Ministry it will be a whole different thing the prophet is showing it to us in different shapes and form and all the examples that's why I said it's the same pattern different examples three woman Minister child of God bride of Christ Apostle all that is the same program that God is revealing himself the prophet says did did it do good by hiding all these things no but he has revealed it in what in all the types and shadows of the Bible and if you can see Jesus so in this program what are you going to do then you just grafted in then we just like you know walking around you know this Pastor said that Pastor Pastor said but the pastor is he grafted in or is he born in he shall see seed he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand and this woman and this man that has the that has the seed in him the Bible says in Psalm 128 but God's grace uh to read it a little bit it was uh such a blessing the the whole sermon was changed a few hours ago it was supposed to go into a different if into a different Channel but by God's grace and I was uh so surprised myself saying the last minute this is good that means like you know people need some other things than what uh was uh previously given because uh he walks with you every day you know he looks at you and he knows exactly what uh what is happening in in your life and by God's grace this are these are the great greatest elements that we can ever desire uh Psalm 28 blessed blessed is is everyone that fearth the Lord that WTH in his way for Thou shalt eat the labor of thine hands happy shall thou be and it shall shall be well with thee thy wife the woman thy wife shall be as a fruitful Vine by the side of thine house thy children like Olive plants around thy table he is seeing the wife a fruitful Vine the woman was Barren but she was standing in the day of visitation because the promise was given to him to see a seed he said you know behold thus shall be the man be blessed that fearth the Lord the Lord shall bless thee out of Zion and thou shall see the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life yes thou shall thou shall see thy children's children and a peace upon Israel and that is the promise and he's looking to for this full promise to be fulfilled and as he saying that God's program is lined up with this woman the promises to be fruitful and he says who is that woman who is that woman what does she do probably the next 20 minutes that will be my sermon here who can find The Virtuous Woman proverb [Music] 31 who is that woman who can find it William brandham what are you doing go out there and find me that bride go out there and find me that virtuous woman he said Brothers I have to go and when this word was given to him this responsibility Abraham said come and swear upon my tie that you shall not go to the denominations you shall not go to the daughters of of Canaan and all these things because we know who they are we know they are grafted in but where is this virtuous woman then he start giving the description he said elezar when you go out there I want you to understand that type of a woman I need to give you the description the mystery of that woman because when you go out there don't just go with the outward appearance amen because impersonation the Catholic nuns beat us by far by everything that we can see by dress code by speech and everything but says I've seen so many things that the Hindus and and and all this the Muslims are able to produce more sincerity that the children the Christianity will be and ever been able to bring forth but he's bringing out the description of this woman it say who can find a virtuous woman her price is far B rubies because her life is so precious that he gave his own life for it when you have to get you yourself some bread what is more important bread or the money you have in the bank account and now you have to compare the two that's why we call the opportunity cost what are you going to do with what you have Jesus is looking at the promise he said that you promised me that I shall see my seed you've promised me that I shall bring I shall see I am fearing of the Lord I fear the lord I shall leave I shall leave I shall my children's children but where is that virtuous woman that will take my word that will be born out of me not grafted in because when he paid the C the the pay the the price of the cross the the side was open and freed the Bride of Jesus Christ but then where is she he said the heart of a husband do safely Trust trust in her she's not always debating with him if I tell her something she's going to listen butram said that's it absolute but in this hour now you know brother Bram he made some mistakes and and he's standing he's looking it's like you know elzar pass pass pass pass pass as simple as it is it goes against all the beliefs that we have in the world today she has a say too she's not your slave you can tell her what to do but she's clean She's Fit she's well spoken she earns well she wants to bring her own Merit then we know what type of seed is that can seed bringing our own things at the altar they said no it's not about you I will do the work but she doesn't like that it's a 5050 world you know Jesus say one thing I say one thing Jesus say one thing I say one thing a 5050 world and I don't need to get into the families you can see it's the word if it's the Original Seed if she's not grafted in bringing her own ideas but if she is part of him born out of him there's no debate have you ever met your your soulmate we never debate we never argue is it because he's stupid is it because she doesn't understand anything she has all the faculties he has all the faculties but they understand their position in the body they understand God's program mtin Luther King couldn't understand that take that and dig deeper into it I can finish everything the part of her husband do safely trust in her so that he he shall have no need of spoil she will do him good and not evil some of the days of our life it's my B days I can't go to church I can't pray I don't feel like paying the tithes you know Jesus you too you have to listen to me I'm just laying God's program you know and when we see that each one of us we understand it's not it's not necessarily about like the the the the the the young lady or the older lady or I'm talking about the church and this church when God brings it into your life we are cautious to apply it in our ministry because that's where now you're going out to see God's program in your life and then when you start seeing that you start struggling with the word then you know where your prayer meeting should begin at right because the prayer it has to be precise according to the time of need because she said do not lie to me whatever you say that I will do because we are David soldiers His Wish is what our Command Imagine David with his soldiers I wish I I have some water of Bethlehem you know the spoken word The Original Seed it's like David you know those are some some oldtime things this is 2024 we need you know you need to actualize certain things you know bring in modernized things and things you can do better than me when I was anointed by by Samuel were you there when all authority was given to me on Earth and in heaven when I came and I claimed the book and I opened the seals job where were you when I was laying the foundation of the world could you tell what the first seal was and now you come and you want to tell me what to do we need to understand God program we need to see him and he's showing that he said like you know she Seth wool and fla and work of willingly this is not some pushy matters you got and you offended Brother Martin did this no no no no it's not about Brother Martin the Bible say she worketh willingly in the book of of Deuteronomy I believe it said like you know tell the children of Israel Exodus tell the children of Israel to bring the gift willingly to build the altar to build the Tabernacle God willing that's what we'll see next to build it you have to do it willingly otherwise just continue with your path by God's grace anyways he said she is like the merchant sheep she's not the merchant ship she is like the merchant sheep she bringeth her food from afar she gets in the message she digs deep into it she doesn't just wait uh Wednesday night and come and we listen for an hour sermon some of things we don't understand we don't agree with it and then we wait for the next service and no no no no no she brings it from afar she labors she works she listen to the tapes every day willingly it's a love story let me sit with you let me hear from you do not lie to me open the Revelation I need to have more information so I can see Jesus and his program because the more I hear the more I desire to know tell me more the more I am hearing the more I am conscious the more I know how to labor because if I don't know how to labor how am I going to do it if I have an uncertain sound if all these messages some pushy things you know reduce the woman and and put the women in the kitchen and and all these things here laws and regulations and we're missing God's program then what's the point of it we are not different like America you do one thing that put you in jail and if you you do uh you do good according to the law they give you a title Law Abiding Citizen no it's not about Law Abiding Citizen it's about the seed coming in and he wants that seed in because even the law abiding citizens before you know it they find some cases they gave you the key to the city of New York and then tomorrow they come and they take you the key but then when he was given the key of hell and the grave that's it you didn't catch that one did you there was a man in the land famous guy named per daddy PDD famous known of all he was given the key to the city of New York a very good represent representative everybody looked up to him but then afterward the F of stuff about him and quickly the mayor came and took back the key but with the Lord Jesus since he took that key nothing else when he took that away from the devil we can go back there we have given the freedom forever there's nothing he was tested tempted in all points yet without sin she riseth also while it is yet night and giveth meat to her household and a portion of her maidens she consider a field and buth it like in the land of Mella she bu of the land because she understands the time and the season he said like you know do not do not lay me down just in the six seals but bury me in that seventh one she buth the land with the fruit of her hands she planteth her a Vineyard she GTH her loins with the strength and the strength in her HS she perceiveth that her merchandise is good her candle go goeth not out by night she sees the time that's why in Matthew 254 but the wise took the oil in the v The Vessel with the lamps she keeping the oil because she knows that the night is drawing nigh thick Darkness upon the world sudden destruction is coming but for her to be able to navigate the world she must keep the oil she must keep the seed she might must keep that the lamp trimed at all times and the Bible say like you know she G of herself she strengthens her hand she's working willingly she said she lay verse 19 she lay her hand to to the spindle and and uh and her hands hold hold the hold the this stuff in other in um version it says she's working the wool to be able to make her garment Revelation 19:7 let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife her bride have made herself ready and to her was granted that she should she should be array in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints all a work that she was doing all strengthening her hands being conscious of sitting under Elijah's Ministry being cautious of this program knowing exactly what she's called on to if you a deacon the righteousness of the Saints it's your ministry if you're a song leader if you musician and whatever position that you're holding in the church that's where the focus is she stretch out her hand her hand to the poor yeah she reaches uh reacheth forth her hand to the needy she is not afraid of the snow for her household for all her household are cloth with Scarlet you can see all the Mysteries that is coming out of this bride's Ministry a house covered by the blood of Jesus Christ The Scarlet she make herself coverings of tapestry and clothing silk and and purple I believe uh brother um Mario spoke about the purple adoption you can see all the trajectory of the word her husband is known in the gates when he sth among the of the land he is the one who shall see his seed in Revelation 5 sitting there in the midst of the elders they said like you know I have a bride when the sons of God were sitting there and the devil came among the elders and the Lord said if you seen my servant job it's said you know you know is that's just an outward appearing you have given him this and you know good health and money and big church and all these things say know you think so I think like you know that's the seed of my seed that's the bone of my bone you want to go thirst him yeah yeah yeah yeah go ahead go go ahead go ahead before you know it the true nature came out in those time of Trials brother bam says I've seen brother brother uh Joseph in uh he said I've had friends I've had people that I could call by friends but Joseph every time even when I was wrong he was always with me he said that's when you know who really is your friend that's why we're doing the message you know yeah brother God bless you brother God bless you as long as he she's coming to church but it's when they are in the lowest point weakest Point that's why we understand God's Ministry I'm laying all these things I'm saying like you know I'm closing out because if we have to take all these things start breaking it down you can see it's a lot of material but let God give it to you to you watch the pattern watch what God is bringing out what come the work you have to do and reach out to the poor poor in spirit the younger ones in the faith teach them how to grow give them food that's what the virtuous woman was doing elazar when you go out there you said Lord to whom unto whom I shall just preach that sermon but by herself we go and dig deeper that's the one she came out she just didn't stop with the sermon at the pit but she took it she took the notes what reference is that where what what message is that she doesn't just come to church and sits there no notebook not taking note and anything you know yeah we'll see let's wait for another sermon now she's cautious of the time amen will I be able to finish probably not but but because Grace she's conscious fin L and the righteousness of the saint verse 20 say stretch of her hand to the poor she make herself covering 23 her husband is not in the gate 24 she make a fine linen and sth it and deliver it and deliver g g uh deliver goodles unto the merchants strength and honor her her clothing and she shall rejoice in time to come Revelation 1412 here is the patience of the Saints here are they that keep the Commandment of God and the faith of Jesus and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me right blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth yeah send the yeah save the spirit that they may rest from their labor and The Works do what follow them this virtuous woman she was not a lazy person read uh proverb 31 she was conscious of God's program because if we do not have God's program with us we just come to church this is just another sermon probably hard to understand this is just another thing to probably have another debate this is another thing probably like you know to just like you know shove off the shove off the shoulders but then when it's God's bride when she sees the program that he must see his children's children because the woman had the Revelation do not lie to me I'm looking for to I'm looking uh I need to bring forth that child that child must come through me I am that virtuous woman I must look into my Ministry I like you know this is born of my Ministry this one is born of my ministry that's why when William Brenham went over there his Works followed him do you know that man that woman you know I did not know know her you know yeah you brought her to Christ her I don't remember her she was in the 90s her work his Works followed him William brandham you're dying you're getting hold if there's anything that you can do for the Lord you better do it quick you better do it quick that's a virtuous woman then you start now seeing that par now throughout the message this guy was not rest two three services in one day the next day is up again but then for us to make one service it's hard in a week for us to listen to the tape along the week it's hard I'm busy I have to go to work I have to didn't God tell you ask what you will according to God's word for him to put you in a condition that will allow you to serve him in season out of season do you see that woman that virtuous woman her position her understanding under the ministry receiving the time of visitation we are called to be that woman we are that woman we are born that woman then where's the child where's the conception seeing Jesus in his program he's getting married he's getting married the head came down to do what to sit down no the promise is there Isaiah said he shall see what he se he paid the price for for he to fail with Martin Luther to miss the goal to be caught up into communism and fascism and and the nism no the program is set God's word does not return void without doing what fulfilling the purpose and are with that purpose are we the ground are we the vine are we the the Branch yes sir are we producing those fruits are we called to be the fruitful Vine are we called to to prepare the vineyard are we supposed to to to buy the land and all in heaven on Earth was what given to who to him and when we stay in the presence of the king what does the king tell us all that you require of me I will do even what half of my kingdom is that true is that is is it the same yesterday today and forever and if it's the same yesterday today and forever shall he fulfill what he said yesterday didn't we tell him that L do not lie to us is there anything impossible to God do you know what God cannot do he cannot fail that's right God cannot lie it's not in him we told him to do not lie to us we've seen you along the church ages we've built the altar we' put the bread we put the Candlestick and at the end of the ages now we end up with a Martin Luther King Jr do we see God's program I believe this series was a blessing to some of you that we're not here about like you know cutting people short and and keeping people down like you know your position is this no no no no no no it has to be revealed unto you don't bring in your own ideas don't bring in like you know I know so I have my own opinions about the message there's no opinion of yours may God keep me from TCH to bring my own opinion up up to you and if I do please let me know because I have to answer for it and if I have to answer for it I have to show you exactly where I taken it from and if it's showing if I've shown it to you from Genesis through Revelation along the time Church ages and things then God must bring that word to fulfillment because Joseph Ministry was to be a fruitful Vine that goes beyond the walls do not just limit this like you know brother martin you said you know the place of a woman is this place of a woman is a Ministry I've said it countless time read the message different women different stages justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost adoption that's the woman that's her place that's her kitchen may God bless [Applause] you amen musicians if you come amen while they're coming when you begin to see Jesus in his program the shunamite woman she discerned he was a prophet that's first thing you got to discern this message was it just a man or was it really a prophetic Ministry and when she discerned it what it did it put her into action and she provided a place see you can talk about all you but you have to provide a place you have to do something about what you've heard and when she did the prophet's message was a message of life amen it wasn't just a grafted in Vine of bringing forth Creeds dogmas nickan no but it had life she knew it she saw the program and because she discerned the ministry of Elijah she became pregnated with the seed brought forth see when she was doing what the word said do Elisha noticed what does she want does she want to go before the king she want to see the ambassadors what does she want she want a new house what does she want then he discerned and he said I know what she wants she wants seed her husband's old tell her thus sayith the Lord according to the time of life see God in his season at the appoint time God will bring his word to pass ask her what she wants she wanted seed see she doesn't want some grafted in Vite she wants thus sayith the Lord she in fact she says don't lie to me don't lie to me don't tell me I'm going to have seed don't you deceive me I put everything into this m [Music] message you know I've put everything into this message don't you lie to [Music] me she became so desperate she came to a place of desperation I don't want Creeds dogmas I want life what about you and I this message are you Discerning it are you seeing Jesus in his program or is it just making another church order and this and that we know this no when we began to see it and discern God help us to discern this message amen because it's life amen let it produce Christ in us the hope of glory this is that mystery not only understanding him but understanding yourself you're a part of that [Music] mystery that's why when he put the reflection of the word before you and you began to see and you moved and it moved that's me see that woman saw herself I'm not trying to preach another sermon I'm not I just get excited about this and my brother my sister let us not huh let's all stand together if we would [Music] hey she wants the Original Seed she became so serious she told the prophet don't you lie to me can you imagine to the man of God you know you're you're Discerning my heart but don't lie to me you know what I [Music] want all started with discernment she discerned that this man that's coming by let's provide something for him what are you doing for the message are you watering the camel what are you doing are you providing a table a candlestick somewhere in your house that that man of God could come and rest in your home help us Lord to look at these things and see God in his program amen heavenly father I thank you I thank you for Thy word oh God when we look at God in all of the story stories and the types and the Shadows father it causes us to get excited father I get excited every time I hear the word preached don't lie to me I don't want just church order I want life man

great grandfather he's watched you down Through the Ages you are not a mistake you were purposed you were predestinated you were ordained and that's why when this message came across there was something about it when he began to speak why the spoken words The Original Seed and all of a sudden he began to speak his word what was a voice of God and that voice of God speaking to you and it spoke life because Jesus said the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life this message is spirit and it's life and when you heard it it it did something to the inside and you said no man spake like that man changes you Elijah when he went by Elisha what did I do to you why are you following me [Music] that's what happened to you when this message come by huh just mantle of Elijah well what do you want I just preached a little sermon well let me go back let me you know and he took he took what he was making as his career and he offered it as a sacrifice unto God came
