maresic [Music] heart [Music] for [Music] [Music] and it's [Music] all it's all [Music] about King of [Music] we [Music] [Music] [Music] com [Music] [Music] refes amen let's bow our head heav father for again reation of your word Lord according to to the Revelation you've given for us Lord may name be glorified so thank purpose is to me the book of can see the book of that is before the book ofter Ezra and nemiah we know that God [Music] re song Resurrection know Resurrection so it says I know that so it is a and that he I shall see see for remember that how Lazarus body went into reti that he in that he knew and verse 11 but if the spirit he that can by his spirit that dwelleth in you and may the Lord had a blessing upon the reading of his word and we want to know of a certainty of what that have the same Spirit dwelling in US will be Chang the M amen with the title in your Bible of Jesus Christ event of that day the resurrection of Jesus Christ and the event on that day start in Matthew 28 in the end of the Sabbath it began to toward the first day of the week I don't know if I already preached this so my title tonight ising tonight to keep us on fire I know the cold weather is coming in but we need in the end of theath the and the first one that re the resen the church this message the the message that another denin and behold there was a great if there is an angeling time and r Hallelujah so notice the first thing that happened as part of the resurrection of Christ then the third part there was a commission prophesying is a do this and do that are to believe directly addressed to each and every one of us so three things so that the way the ear days chch re re that's why the Revelation is so sometimes God reveal later of commotion even in the disciples they don't believe the report to you look at Thomas he he refused to believe the testimony of the 10 disciples because we have also met an angels in this so that no one can get if we preach we are just a messenger so in the message look at the millions speaking that he was here can we say the of what is Happ look at the Millions on Earth so remember the you need to be thankful we included in that great Resurrection morning coming that morning seeking out his own ship he said we right now in oural we have the ear in oural bodies predestinated on are the first to be quickened when the Holy Spirit comes can we think of something to thankful thankful it is the message to poor we are are his resurrection he said right you are theive are but Satan is you are you are you are done but he is accusing you he don't recognize your and whatever accusation he in youing his word to us and the word book can read it e anointing the book of you cannot read about but in the things that the father had our mind it was a direct message no more prophecy more history no morees was revealed all things that the father had whether you believe it or not I said believe the report revealing himself that he shall take of mine I shall show it unto you in other words because I go to Father a while you shall not see me you will not see his body and again a little while Verse 18 He said I will come to you do you believe it so we are not wi we have a husband a while talking because I you shall shall know day you will know know this is the message of the you don't like it you will know you need to know this is the Revelation time couldn't be in them in the form of Jesus of Nazareth it could be in them in the he was the word first and a word really for the same Jesus is not in it restoration should be looking for God here isting because God is a word Satan will let you doubt it he trying to point you to your physical place but it doesn't reality we can what we can create we Hallelujah if if trouble if you're depr you recognize who you are if you are sick can Lord godal all man the Lord Jesus Christ everyone healing is in the Lord Jesus Christ there is there is no other name which we can be saved in the name of Jesus so don't be confused brother theal ising and me because we are holding etal life for others Live the Life of Christ they become thir and by doing so but eternal life for to love the world that he his only begotten son is not willing that anyone is in the Easter SE if we are ordained because we are speaking ho here to find you and when he find you which you are raled you know the hour you're living you know that these things are because now it is a prophecy but there is propy in the prophecy is you are the people prop there must be people we may we Cann we are anchored we are quickened the don't worry about the manifestation it willest he said you these things are to Happ toce what he talking about you the word for your day and sitting in heav Jesus what a heavenly father who would give us this things we have so many TR are but when the quicking power just keep on flying keep on flying and you will forget atere of the presence of when you are sitting you are relaxing how can you relax when there are so trouble time we are now in Heavenly places what is our purpose in this life because there is three things that happen in his Resurrection Day that is our commission not to not to be a big time inre Hallelujah in the fellowship with God through reconciliation he said and I said to friends across the world now when you go to look I will be listening to Angelic choir that's why if you cannot sing just clap your hand you not your hands just enjoy it the presence of the Lord and de one amen when I was an unbeliever my voice is always out of t when I got I don't care what my I toship him Hallelujah I'm the Maring in I don't care what they say I just love the worship as theb I one the greatest sure and one thing that's inable that's the B in Perfect Harmony out of out ofou but thou shate [Music] and may Financial relationship intimacy relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ the re in our re thou sh we can have sucess sucess to to speak the word your benit don't listen to Satan just a the more he say you are this you are that oh he always this one you think I know that I know Son of God what can you say about that you need to bring it back to you are a son of but I am Hallelujah in the book of he said and Satan also he wants to join and the Lord said Satan answer and it people with no business is going from East if you going build our character is to so ined God would come of the day came good he wants to be somebody in the church he wants to have fellowship with to become submissive to his will why the the thought of men are it come to a realization of The quickening Power Within know I know redem stand Earth thought after my skin destroyed in ration verse 1 brother this when he and he laid his right hand am the first the revelation th the Liv in Matthew 1 answer ration if you want blessing ask for revelation the kingdom of heaven and will lose people because and the preaching of the open weach and Paul repeated it verse and Reed so the key of prom Romans ort we quicking power is the key so speak of to take away the great us sh and whether we like it in the message to like he said he speak about sharing experience the of time and the of all that experiences no old men no babies young people [Music] the message so heaven we are going in is an eternal youth me which any claim of people who experience PL should be judged that is or S so let's continue on what is it the quicking power the great quickening power that's what I'm in Arizona 4 right now there's many people Ang as AED AC sitting and here they are Qui powering her ready tonight I know there are [Music] [Music] but this she just depend what going to or you have to believe that you don't so it's up to you just depend on what attitude you take whether to believe that you don't believe it it won't do you one good people and said I ever told you anything I ever beg you for youry say [Music] what brother he said so maybe I'm just ask our come the sake of Don't Look foring to You Mar the word look look at the word lordus what a blessed people are because ful what he the Lord Jesus is in another world
