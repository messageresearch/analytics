us down and our doubts and our fears and sometimes we think we don't do things the way that we should and we know we don't do things the way we should and God is there for to forgive us of our sins and our doubts and our fears and this song is just a song to remind us all of who we really are [Music] people laugh when they see my mistake and they doubt when they're gone lives inside in their

let's all stand as we prepare to change the order of the service I was thinking of that song Jesus he walks on the water speaks to the storm amen there's a truth older than the ages amen a promise of things yet to come [Music] there is a truth older than the ages there is a promise of things yet to come and there is one born for our Salvation [Music] Jesus Jesus [Music] there's a light that overwhelms the darkness there is a kingdom that forever Reigns and there is freedom from the chains that bind us Jesus [Music] Jesus who walks upon the Water who speaks to the Sea who stands in the fire beside me he Roars like a lion he believes it is the Lamb he carries my healing in his hands Jesus Jesus [Music] there is a name I call in times of trouble there is a song Comforts in the night there is a voice that comes the storm that rages Jesus [Music] on the water speaks to the Sea who says [Music] is like a lion he bled as the lamb and carries my healing in his hands oh Jesus Messiah Oh My Savior there is [Music] once again Messiah ooh Messiah My Savior there is power in your name for my wrong hand My Redeemer there is [Music] name that you walk on the water you walk on the water don't you speak to the Sea you stand in the fire beside me oh you roar s the lamb you carry my healing in your hands oh Jesus [Music] let's just bow our heads our hearts together if you have an unspecial spoken or a special unspoken request would you raise your hand right now and ask God you have not because you ask not so when you ask ask abundantly God is mindful of what you go through he is mindful of everything about you heavenly father as we raise our hands and we come to you this morning we know that you are Jehovah Jireh we have seen time and time again age after age church after church we have seen how you have watched over your little bride from her birth all the way father to her rapture so father we thank you and we love you and we ask that you will meet every need by the ministering of the word because when the word Goes Forth it delivers the people it heals the people it positions the people therefore father I pray come and speak to our hearts now I ask in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you all this morning let's just remain standing let's go directly to the word amen uh we want to thank you all thank you musicians yes I want to thank all of you for your prayers for our daughter for re Rebecca the surgery went very well the surgeons were very very optimistic of the surgeries they've done but understand doctors Doctor surgeons do their surgery but God's A Healer they can cut they can sow they can do all that thing they can give medicine but God is the Healer so we still all need God huh even after surgery even after all that stuff God is still the one who heals amen and brother Paul Maple is here where are you brother Paul yeah he and his family have moved down here raise your hand all your family there and yeah yeah they're there so we uh we welcome you they've moved down here Hallelujah his dad's down here just uh just for the until today and then he's going back but Dave God bless you it's good to have you here amen all right I want to put a disclaimer on this and I understand that when your pastor comes here to the pulpit and everything I realize that I wait before God and I seek God for our church and for our people okay I'm not responsible for what others do and how they see it or whatever so god holds me responsible to teach you truth and uh uh brother Branham said every church is Sovereign in itself he said even Branham Tabernacle you voted in Ormond Neville and said if he wants to preach Jehovah's Witness Doctrine because you voted him in he said that's the sovereignty of the local assembly now um so um even as our sisters I appreciate the song special beauty is in the eye of the beholder and I know that the beauty of a church is the character of the people amen and so we pray that our character that we have is the character of Christ let us this Simplicity of the Gospel of Jesus Christ should not be lost in rules and regulations and laws and doctrines and teachings of the church because if we're not careful that makes us religious and then we just come and we are no different than Mennonites or Amish or whatever and we go about our religious duties but the main thing is is that we have a relationship with Jesus Christ amen and we fall in love with him and you can you can uh bring your children to church and everything but they must have an experience with God themselves Jacob had Bethel experiences it never changed him he saw angels ascending a descending he said this is a special place I call it the Bethel the house of God but it was not until he got to the place called pineal where he met God face to face father I'm asking today as your servant come down speak to us speak to us face to face give us what we have need of that our lives would be greater than than what they were when we came this morning that God will draw us that much closer to him that will fall in love because it's because of love not because of law amen all right let's just pray father I ask a blessing upon Thy word now as we read it anointed by the Holy Spirit father that we can see the truth from thy mysterious word knowing it's a closed book to those without the Holy Ghost I pray o God give everyone a portion of the Holy Ghost o God that we could see into the scriptures that we just don't read laws Creeds dogmas traditions of man but father that we might see you Christ the center of every scripture in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen amen all right God bless you all second Corinthians 11 verses 1 through 4 we're continuing on now with our series here maybe another couple Services we'll see how the Lord leads amen second Corinthians chapter 11 verses 1 through 4. what to God you could bear with me a little in my folly and indeed bear with me for I am jealous over you with a Godly jealousy for I have espoused you to one husband that I'm represent to you as a chaste virgin to Christ but I fear he's got his doubts he's got his concerns but I fear less by any means the serpent as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety so your minds should be corrupted from the Simplicity that is in Christ for if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus whom we have not preached or if you receive another Spirit which you have not received or another gospel which you have not accepted you might well bear with him amen second Corinthians 1. chapter 1 verse 12. for our rejoicing is this the testimony of our conscience that in Simplicity and godly sincerity not with fleshly wisdom but by the grace of God we have had our conversation in the world and more abundantly to you were turning back to Second Corinthians chapter 11. verses 13 through 15. now he warns him I'm I'm afraid less by any means that the devil through his subtlety could come and corrupt your minds from the Simplicity that is in Christ so as you read down he then shows you some of the means that by which Satan will attempt to uh uh to get to the bride of Christ second Corinthians 11 verses 13 through 15. for such are false apostles deceitful workers transforming themselves into the Apostles of Christ notice the transformation is not God's doing they do it themselves transforming themselves into the Apostles of Christ and no Marvel for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of Light therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the Ministers of righteousness whose end shall be according to their works may God bless the reading of his word you may be seated this morning in the presence of God amen I am titling my sermon losing our Simplicity this is part three and the subject this morning is transformed ministers now last service I talked about corrupted Minds how do they do it through transformed ministers they have transformed themselves as the Apostles of Christ now the Bible says we have tried them who call themselves Apostles and are not how do you do it by the word everything every measurement every judgment everything must come to the basis of the word of God because the word of God is our absolute not my opinion not your opinion not my interpretation not your interpretation because God is his own interpreter amen so I wish to go in this direction now I'm going to give you scriptures and I'm going to give you some quotes because I believe saints of God that what you do is you substantiate everything of your doctrinal teaching to your church in scripture and then back it up with the message of the hour amen and so that's what I tried to do the reason I have you to read the quotes I put them up here is because I have seen how masterfully different ones will be acting like brother Branham said in God and simplicity and they go to acting like they're reading and if you're familiar enough with the message and you've got the message in your heart and they just keep reading and the next thing they're acting as though they're still reading the quote they're not now here is my doctrinal teaching quotes are good the tapes are better because when you go listen to the tape you hear the inflection of The Voice you catch it in its context because if there's one thing or three things that we should not do with the word of God we must not misplace it we may not must not misinterpret it or dislocate the word of God in any way amen so I believe that the prophet of God as the Holy Spirit was directing him what happens is now he's taking the surgical sword of the word and he begins to discern between the body and spirit and the spirit and soul brother Branham said no now watch this let me give you an example of that brother random said you can have the Holy Spirit 24 hours a day in your soul on its way to hell that's his doctrinal teaching your soul he said it depends on the level of the anointing because you can have the Holy Spirit on your spirit Caiaphas prophesied you can have the Holy Spirit on your spirit activating the gifts of the Spirit and you're not even born again so we're not judging it by that we judge it by the word so these are doctrinal teachings that brother brennam makes very very clear to us as he ministers you'll not get all of his doctrinal teaching on one sermon neither do you get all of the Biblical teaching in one book it is an accumulation of the whole word together brother Branham said on the testimony on the sea in 1962 I've been trying to keep the messages just as simple as possible but of course that's so no one will miss it there's great deep spiritual teachings to it but sometimes you can't do that before an audience we must keep it simple so the newborn babes will not miss it because I believe that we're too close to the end time for us to miss anything oh God help us keep this message simple amen he continues on and that's the reason I've been trying to keep the messages just as simple as possible and what I'm trying to do now maybe some of you might be wondering why I'm not calling prayer lines each night here's my purpose in doing this I want to build faith in the people in a resurrected Jesus so that you don't have to wait till some special gift passes through the neighborhood you just believe him wherever you are because he's gone it doesn't take an evangelist's hands which that's all right they Place her in faith and it continues on and so brother Brandon was trying I want you to understand that when the prophet of God comes on the scene and he's given two gifts to get the attention of the people but he said that's just the he said that's the sign that's the attraction he said but there's a voice that comes behind it Now understand that brother Branham remember that what we call Pentecost of laudiasia started in 1906. brother Brennan was born in 1909. so the Pentecostal movement had already started moving and like wildfire it began to now just spread throughout the world and so brother Branham when he comes to the crescendo of his ministry when he comes to the Apex of his ministry he's trying to even wean his own Believers at Branham Tabernacle away from former teaching he will preach sermons such as where Pentecost field and he's trying to then wean them if you please away from former teaching okay no we realize that a religious spirit upon a person watch this now a religious spirit upon a person will blind them to any truth other than what they've been taught remember when you first come to the Lord and you were trinitarian my it was so hard for you to get through your mind that God is not three Gods he's not father God Son God the Holy Spirit God but he's these three are one why because you were taught that so you look through the eyes of your understanding okay to that Doctrine and it's hard for you to overcome why because you were indoctrinated in that way now the Apostle Paul is a perfect example Saul of Tarsus who became Paul the Apostle he's a perfect example of a religious spirit Now understand a religious spirit will persecute even unto death those that disagree with his viewpoint that's what he did and he had been taught under one of the greatest theologians of that day gamalielium and he said Can keeping the law I was blameless I was a Pharisee of Pharisees and he was a religious zealot Now understand this religion without the character of Christ can persecute others who don't see it the way you do now there's many quotes and I'm not going to go into it right now but brother Brahm said how what do you do do you have people that disagree with you yeah sure all the time why even my wife and I don't agree on everything and he talks about whipped cream and all of that stuff and I'm not going to go into that but he said sure he said in fact you can come to this church disagree with me as far as East is from West but keep the right spirit the right spirit is teachable I tell you what I have in my personal experience I have met people that claim they are message Believers and they got a spirit as mean as a junkyard dog I've seen it and if you haven't just hang on you'll meet one of them one of these days and when you do don't let it offend you now uh brother Brenham said in getting in the spirit 1961 we got too many Beaver preachers today you ever heard this quote it's kind of cute he only says it one time Beaver preachers today trying to Dam up all the water and say this is ours this is just us here this belongs to us what happens to it it becomes stagnated you know stagnated water that gets these little wiggle tails in it that's what does matter with the church today little wiggle tail in here and wiggle out there and and now brother Branham him being a Woodsman he said now anyone who's a Woodsman knows you don't drink below a beaver dam hehe he said it'll make you sick excuse me now we know that this message will never denominate is that is that correct because the message is Christ you cannot denominate Christ because Christ is the word but many of those within the message have already denominated because they've made their fences they've made their divisions I am appalling and I am of Apollos and the next thing you know the Apostle Paul he said who's Paul and who's Apollos why in the world do we have to Champion well my pastor is better than your pastor my dad can beat up your dad that's nonsense God help us even if they see it differently than we do that's the sovereignty of a local assembly I do not like politicians I am not a politician I don't like it I've never fit in with certain ones because you know if you see it their way finally Pat you on the back but if you don't see it that way then you're kind of whatever you're never asked to minister that's okay I'm not looking for another place to preach now let me show you the Simplicity that the Apostle of Paul when he came on the scene remember he says I was one born out of due season he had a personal experience with God and wrote to Damascus God has to Blind him to open his eyes and then after he had this experience with God he went and he got alone with God for three years but when he comes out and he joins up and has a union with those Apostles that were before him Now understand he was born out of due season so he has to come to even Peter who's trying to make Jews out of the Gentiles and he has to rebuke him imagine that I can imagine Peter said who are you man you were dear you weren't with him I was there I was in his meetings man of all okay First Corinthians 2 verses one through eight I got to keep going because I got a lot of my uh Fork this morning First Corinthians 2 verses one through eight and I Brethren when I came to you came not with the Excellency of speech or of wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of God for I determined not to know anything among you so now he's taken all of learning all of this Gamaliel all of the theology everything he's learned I'm determined not to know anything except save Jesus Christ and him crucified saints of God the whole gospel revolves around Jesus Christ and him crucified amen and I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling and my speech my preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and of power that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God how about yet we speak wisdom among them which are perfect not yet the wisdom of this world nor the princes of this world that come to not but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery even the Hinduism which God ordained before the world unto our Glory which none of the princes of the world knew for had they known it they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory when God converted Saul and opened his eyes to the truth he condensed everything he had learned down to Jesus Christ and him crucified that's the whole theme of The Gospel that is Jesus Jesus Christ in simplicity once you find Christ and he reveals himself to you it's so simple and I believe we are losing our Simplicity that is in Christ now I just happened to see a little clip of something yesterday and it caught my attention there was a minister ministering he said I want to talk to the thief on the cross when he gets to the other side I want to talk to him and ask him what did you do to get here he said I really don't know well do you understand the doctrine of justification by faith nope never heard it preached well do you understand about the blood of Christ and the crucifixion and everything no no I I really don't know and so he asked him a couple more scriptural questions and you know how we want to know hey where what church are you from what did you do this and that he said well how did you get here well I really don't know but the man on the middle cross invited me and bit me to come that is the gospel in simplicity we try to make it so complex when God bids you to come he bids you to come and die hallelujah how do you get there I don't really know all I know is he bit me to come how many of you can say Amen to that it wasn't you it wasn't anything you did it wasn't the works you did it wasn't because of Mom and Dad it was because God called you blessed be the name of the Lord don't lose our simplicity amen spiritualism watch this now spiritualism Witchcraft and demonic powers are religious spirits they claim they are of God and speak for God Pentecost failed watch this Pentecost failed because they wanted the gifts without The Giver they wanted the sensations they wanted the speaking in tongues they wanted the gifts and they didn't care what kind of Life they live now watch this okay so that you'll understand this brother Brennan said in 1963 in oh Lord just once more did you know the Roman Catholic Church was the first original Pentecostal Church it's Taken 2 000 years to get it in the condition it's got today if this Pentecostal organization keeps on another 50 Years it'll be worse than the Catholic Church isn't that amazing he took the Catholic Church two thousand years to get where they're at and he said give this Pentecostal Church another 50 years so we're there we're past that and he says it'll be worse than the Catholic Church so you don't have to try to work something up in the church let God do it I will show you every time that God moves he does it without your help on a day of Pentecost they were sitting the only thing they did do was get in one Accord and in one mind God help us to get in one mind one Accord looking at the faults and this and that and and just get in one mind in one Accord and that one mind is in Christ now you don't have to work on emotions emotions come I'm an emotional person and when God touches me I can't help it I cry I shout I get all excited but I don't point to the emotion before the word the word comes and then the emotion amen don't get the card before the horse amen you see stimulation comes from revelation of the word not because the beat of the piano okay now again like I said it's a disclaimer most of the different ones that go to shouting and dancing usually come at the end of the service not during the word because the Beat of the Music is causing them to get excited it's not the ministering of the word they're being moved by the music and not by the word that was preached they're under the influence or the channel of music now who was the first one that brought music who was the first leader of Music in heaven Satan Lucifer and he is the maker of instruments of music so he knows how to worship so understand a lot of times what happens is you go to telling the people you've got to worship yeah but you Worship in spirit and true because there's a lot of worship that is called worship that is just emotion all right if now let me give you a personal testimony because I had a friend of mine a minister within the message his father was one of the very prominent minister of the message you would recognize his name but names are not important but he invited me he said brother Ron they're having a big Pentecostal movement in Beaumont Texas at that time I was living in Silsbee Texas he said would you like to come to with me to that movement tonight I thought well I I really you know I'm not interested really but if you want to go we'll we'll go and so uh yeah I wanted to demonstrate it anyway I'll just act like you you guys ever seen Mick Jagger and he grabs the microphone with the it's on the stand and they go to sing and I can't get no right and they go to and they got this and that well I went to this meeting and listen it was there was probably I want to estimate fifteen hundred two thousand people in the meeting and man before the service everybody hey Bob Hey Joe how you doing oh everybody talking and this and that all of a sudden um the drummer and everybody oh oh something's happening and then the guy gets up there I gotta do this this is praise God Hallelujah throws his long hair back everybody will be happy we'll be happy over there I turned to my buddy I said hey man hang on to your seat because this place is fixing to rock out everybody will be happy Hallelujah and he says time to get up it's I'm tired of dead churches I'm tired of a religion I can't feel oh and man everybody in this place went wild I thought my my everybody will be happy when we get over there you know who you who used to be really really good about getting everybody into the channel of Music Jimmy Swagger praise God little here on the keyboard oh my presence of God yeah when we get over there and the next thing you know he's talking to the people and what a golden voice if I could sing or preach like he's seen boy I'd win a lot of sauce now bro watch this what brother Branham says here in the sermon gifts 1956. that's what Abraham's seat does and if we being dead in Christ we take able on Abraham's seed and her heirs according to the promise then what kind of spirit should be in you I'm afraid friends as I talk to your pastor today churches get the pastor's spirit instead of God's spirit we don't need one another spirit there's no need of that we need God's spirit you go into a church and watch the way the passer acts watch the congregation act the same way I feel sorry for you guys because you know I'm I only get excited and run once in a while and David Cleveland intercepted me and almost tackled me when I went to running through the church you guys remember that I I do like to get excited and everything but listen you better give me something to get excited about or I'm just not just because everybody else now I was in a meeting in in Belgium one of the larger meetings I had been in a message convention and I saw I saw fanaticism that I've never seen before nor since and I saw people and everybody's standing up and while the preachers preaching men running up in front of the pulpit hallelujah praise God people getting all excited and I'm yeah and I'm trying to hear what he has to say but the screaming and the shouting was so great I couldn't really hear it and it was in English well I thought I'm not going to jump up and stand up just because everybody else is Jesus is the same yesterday today and forever amen amen I'm in nothing wrong with it but don't you know that already is that something new I and saying the things that we already know I mean I'm going amen yes sir brother I believe that I'm not making fun of that but I'm just saying the fanatical so I had and I I'm just saying this I was there there was tons of people around me and they had this expression of of Jubilee and they say so I'm in this meeting and while the preachers preaching everything that he says and I'm looking around this brother he looks down at me and he goes well he everyone's standing I'm sitting and I misinterpreted what he said shuck your shocked he's sitting here seat in your sock he wasn't he was just saying whatever Jubilation whatever he said I misunderstood it and I thought boy this guy's pretty brash just because I don't jump up and everything well I saw a fanatical element there that I had never seen before nor after now brother Brown said I'm afraid what we do is we get one another spirit okay and what we need is the holy spirit now brother Branham said in the sermon God keeps his word 1957. Now talks about Ahab his lukewarm borderline backslidden Israelite he says I'm going to go to my highlighted part that's the reason coming into a meeting talk about uh taking one another's spirit coming into a meeting we like to stay right with the word stay with the word so the spirit of the word will be on the people not the spirit of some fantastic or some minister or something that we'd have to answer for at that day of judgment I want one thing I don't try to project something of my own my Fantastics into them people but I stay with God's word that's the kind of spirit you want something that'll take the word of God and not a bunch of Fantastics a bunch of Theology of man-made stay with God's word Eternal Word now I want you to understand brother Brennan makes up his own words he's saying watch these Fantastics what does he mean fanatics I got it so there are some quotes you go to what about these Fanatics and fanaticism you won't find it but he said Fantastics and how about another one he says indocumented it's because you're undocumented what does he mean indoctrinated umpire Empire come on but I love now I'll tell you what what I love about this message is it was no it was normal Showmanship it had no Flair he didn't get up on the piano he you know what I'm saying in fact when the Holy Spirit came watch we have 1100 1200 sermons to give you examples he's here now don't nobody move right whoa wait a second that's a whole lot different than what we're transforming people into okay because we want to get you to be able to let's say have an initial evidence in this hour just exactly like they did in the day of Pentecost with a Pentecostal Church excuse me what was Pentecost error in their doctrinal teaching it wasn't the anointing it wasn't the signs it wasn't the speaking in tongues it was they made speaking in tongues the evidence you got the Holy Spirit didn't matter the life they could cut their hair paint their nails wear immoral clothes they could do all that stuff losing the Simplicity that is in Christ are you understanding that and and so brother man shows watch this anointing and they get under one another's spirit and boy I'll tell you what the internet is filled right now with what is called Pentecost Apostolic and all kinds of stuff and and let me tell you you talk about dancing shouting running speaking in tongues and did you know speaking in tongues brother Branham said is a sign of impending disaster now I will address this later but the Apostle Paul says do all speak in tongues do all prophesy do all have the gifts of healing now I'll tell you what it's amazing we talk about tongues but where is the interpretation of tongues well I I'm just speaking edification unto the Lord because there is a tongue of man and tongue of angels I'm not here to talk about that but there is so much is put on evidence well I tell you what they're they're saying uh uh uh uh that you know forbid to speak in tongues no that's not it but what we're doing is if you're not teaching what brother Branham said in its entirety what you do is you you got to picture all messed up in fact when brother Brandon put Brenham Tabernacle in order and he made the gifts according to being judged what happened well let's do it in the back room oh you got the gift of tongues you got the gift of interpretation great praise God you're an elder we're going to get you guys in the back room meet here and let's pray let's seek God so you speak in tongues and you interpret then I ask the Elder what do you think what do you think what do you think I think it's God write it down now give it to the church thus say the spirit of God that spoke to us this morning thus and thus oh ye my people if you will seek my face I will bless you all stop that's nonsense we know that you seek God God will bless you you make a move towards God God will make a move towards you we know that prophecy is what for telling what a future event now if it doesn't have a future event if it doesn't have something that the spirit of God it says don't go home by way of I-10 today because it'll be a bad accident now watch this three Elders judged it and said this is God now what if it doesn't come to pass he said you got a lion Spirit among your church and he said don't this is the message he said then those who said it was of God they need to step down and he said even the tongue's an interpreter and everything he said because you got a lion Spirit among you so what caused Junior Jackson and Don ruddle to split from Brother Brown that's his sister churches when he said Branham Tabernacle in order they split because they wanted the gifts so just so you know a little bit of the history of that okay now watch this on the invasion of of the United States 1954 let me persuade them to come to the altar well I better read because I think this is important God let me preach like I've never before let me preach you dying man as a dying man myself let me preach to the people like I've now like I have uh never have another sermon to preach let me persuade them to come to the altar with streaming faces with tears go back home and live like Christians so he's preaching the word and bring a conviction they repent and go what do they do they go back home and live in their neighborhood stop all to hear Frolic and run around jumping and carrying on acting this way and blowing up at this and going that way oh don't do that that's the devil them demon spirits come on Christians amazing you have all jumping and shouting but somebody disagree with you and you blow up something wrong huh 1950 again I said this is a disclaimer and people say well brother Ron you said this because then I stop okay 1954 again seven Church ages as long as we fuss and stew and carry on among one another we still walk as men until a man can get down at the altar and get right with God until he can Overlook little things and move on like a Christian ought can't call the kettle black right don't holler at them let's clean our steps first excuse us strangers I'm giving the church a little gospel spanking now or you say we got it and get up here and beat the piano as hard as it can go and bunch of drums and run up down the floor and go out and fuss with your neighbor have you got anything oh no no sir the only thing we got is a lukewarm as long as the music's running we're running When the Music Stops we stop God don't need that to move the church do you understand that a Revival is when God gives you Revelation and it brings a stimulation and the music is not you see we can use the channel of music that's okay I believe we help create an atmosphere but if we're not careful what happens is we will at the end of the service now it usually won't be a song of repentance search me o God and know my way today it'll not be a slow song it'll usually be something that's got a little bit of a beat I'm not against a Beat I like a beat I like something that's got a little snap to it but if we're not careful the people being moved okay because of the beat your internet is filled with this when the fire comes down the Holy Ghost Fire okay ow I am a Pentecostal I am doing what they did on the day of Acts I am a Pentecostal I have the firefighter in my bones I got five years right and the next thing everybody fire and everybody's moving to the music hey denominations are doing it man if they're not jumping and screaming and running around they haven't had a service imagine coming to brother branham's meeting and they're all one to have a runaway and brother Brian said no he's here now don't move we ought to be moving man why it's because you've been in documented okay because that's what you've been taught now I tell you we need an old-fashioned Revival like we used to have down in the country when they laid on their face all night not to carry on but real Godly sorrow not go back to the Altar and say but go out and make it right with the neighbors that they hadn't made it wrong with and get straightened up brother Ram said I believe in the holy spirit that brings a conviction that if you took a tool from your boss and you put it in your toolbox and it's not yours you're going to go back to him hey boss I'm sorry I took your tool he might fire me yeah well you stole this too that's the Holy Spirit conviction let us father live with the conviction by way of the Holy Spirit not because we're getting one another spirit okay I want to ask you if we've got 1100 1200 sermons that's the example that we have before us then it concerns me as a minister of the Gospel seeing things being transformed into something that wasn't the way it was with brother Branham now you can hate me all you want you can say I'm an old-timer and I'm an old fuddy duddy and and uh I'm legalistic no I'm just saying hey why are we losing our simplicity when brother Brandon now watch his doctrinal teaching because he comes from the scripture the Bible says in first Timothy 5 and 22 lay hands suddenly on no man neither be partakers of other men sins wow it's amazing now we're going to go into brother Brown's doctrinal teaching on the laying on of hands what does he say about it I'll give you an example now here in six-fold purpose of Gabriel's visit to Daniel I stood by the man sight of a man right over here in Port Fulton dying they called me to his bedside when I prayed with him here at the altar one night he put his arm around a woman I said take your arm from around that lady he said I'm leading her to God I said not your arm around her I don't believe in such stuff as that he got angry with me and stomped out the door I went to him a little later when he was dying he looked at me in the face and said Don't Pray For Me Brother Bill I'm lost I'm gone all I ever gained is done gone now here he was under an anointing at the altar and he's got his arm around a woman and brother REM said get your arm off her I'm leading her to cry not no no no I don't believe in such now here's his Doctrine on teaching I don't believe in such and here's another thing don't don't be so quick to lay hands on somebody if somebody comes down here to the Altar and they're crying let him cry it's good for him what happens if you break the shell of the chicken trying to break itself out you kill it look keep it simple you don't have to pray for everybody that comes forward no sometimes I'll tell you what I love it sometimes I love it that when a church service is dismissed and I've stayed in the Pew I've stayed there in my seat and I've wept before God and I had my own time with God and everybody was out of the sanctuary oh those times are so beautiful those are the times how about you home reading your Bible and you have a time where God comes down and the presence comes so sweetly and You Weep before God and you pour out your your spirit before him and you just make love to him and you just thank God or how many of you have been out in nature you weren't in a church service there was nobody there was no music but you're out there and all of a sudden you feel as God's presence you put your arms up oh God I remember I was running I used to try to run seven miles in the desert In the Heat of the day years ago young man and I will wait till the heat of the day until it's 115 degrees I have my sweatpants on and my t-shirt and I get out there and I just run across it then like this until I'm just pouring sweat and I stopped one time and I felt the presence of God and I looked around and everything every plant every all the the plants every saguaro cactus all of the out of nature around me I could see they all had their hands up and they were worshiping God did I break into a vision I don't know all I see is it seemed like all of nature around me was worshiping God and I had myself a jubilee brother Branham says of the times that he said if you ever catch me in the woods sometime and he says and I run and run around the tree any of you ever done that where you get so excited you run around a tree just praising God he said that little old chipmunk looking at me chatter chatter chatter days of Miracles are passed okay when's the last time you had a runaway and it wasn't among people you weren't getting one another Spirit you were getting the Holy Spirit and God revealing to you something amen keep it simple let the presence of God work on the hearts of the people let them be moved on by the Holy Spirit amen brother Brown said a greater than Solomon is here watch this now say for instance we got great faith and here stands a man on the platform all having a great time shouting in the glory of God around I said now maybe this man stole some money he'd lived evil maybe running around with some woman immorally he'd done a murder or something that God put this sickness on him you know God uses sickness for whips to bring us to him you ever heard that quote why are you so silent listen you notice prophetic gifts can get you in trouble certainly can what if this man's done something evil and I'm standing there great big what we call an America bulldog faith I grab a hold of him and say hallelujah hallelujah Satan turn him lose glory to God and I take that disease off him and God put it on him for a purpose I'm in trouble with God you see what I mean any of you ever heard teachings like this brother Brown said sometimes he said because you will suffer for your Disobedience and God allow us sickness he did that with Billy Paul do you remember when the age of the Lord come to Brethren him he said honey go to Billy Paul he's sick unto death runs into the hospital Billy Paul says Oh Daddy you're here pray for me he said I ain't praying for you what do you tell him say it loud enough they can hear it you do the do the prayer Billy you did the sin and you do the praying walked out Billy Paul tells the testimony he said The Darkest Day of My Life daddy refused to pray for me um sometimes saints of God it's not that somebody needs to pray for you you need to pray for yourself you need to get right with God you need to say oh God and be sincerely honest and sincere with God God allowed a sickness to bring you to him he might have broke the Good Shepherd might have broke the leg of the Lamb would a Good Shepherd do that sure he will so now brother Branham said now let's go on I'm gonna we're going into some doctrinal teaching and I've got I've got some time here but I I just want to take this slowly so you get it the sermon three Witnesses the Antichrist spirit is not communistic Spirit the Antichrist spirit is a religious spirit oh I have delivered my soul that's what God was wanting me to do right there amen he was a witness saying a religious spirit is an antichrist spirit now watch it was not the everyday common people who crucified Christ who was it that crucified Christ huh the religious people wasn't the everyday common sinner it was the religious people was it not Ishmael the Seed of Abraham that persecuted Isaac how old was Ishmael when Isaac was born 15 years old and he did make fun of Isaac I want you to understand brother Branham Abraham Branham comes to the Pentecostal woman Hagar denomination first he says I've sent five hundred thousand of my converts to the Pentecostal church if I didn't believe in going to church do you think I would be deceiving to send them to go to a church but watch this those didn't they weren't it was the right seed wrong woman because when you get the right seed in Sarah you don't have this this desire to look down and put everybody else down to make yourself look good those are drowning preachers pushing everybody else down to keep themselves up let me tell you brother Brennan this is what I love about the message it was so simple he never pushed himself up he never propagated his own gift he uh I love it in fact I love to hear his voice it's so simple now invasion of the United States for the Iran the Antichrist is very religious very religious it was a religious spirit that crucified Jesus it's always been a religious world of religious people that crucifies it's a religious people that was against the true Christ it was the religious prophets that was against Micaiah it's the religious people of the day that's against the message of God wow I wonder how many ishmaelites we have within the message I'm just asking you because if you don't see it the way that they see it they'll persecute you he said in the bride of Christ is no guile there's nothing in there bride cannot persecute right amen it's not in them they humble themselves oh God oh God don't let me look at others let me look at myself God judge me amen seal of the Antichrist 55 borderline halfway watch that religious spirit you say brother random do you mean to tell me the Antichrist spirit will be a religious spirit Jesus said it'd be so close like the real thing till it would deceive the very elect if possible Matthew 24. that throws a little different light to it doesn't it it's a religious spirit a spirit that can shout a spirit that can dance in the spirit a spirit that can cast out Devils a spirit can do all kinds of Miracles and still not be born of the spirit of God whoa and that day many will come to me and say Lord Lord have we not cast out devils in thy name in your name haven't I done Mighty works and I will confess unto them depart from me you workers of iniquity I don't even know you do you know that false prophets and false teachers rule over the People by fear teach them to to fear them you leave my church I'll tell you what you have left God and God's Gonna judge your I'll stop brother Brenham never got you to fear Him look it was not Janice and jambres that affected the children of Israel that was back in denominational Egypt it was the dathens and chorus within the message and they said Moses takes too much authority to himself are we not all children of God don't we all have the spirit of God why Moses who made you a judge over us God hiding himself in Simplicity in fact the sermon before the opening of the seals why can't people believe in the simple Simplicity of a humble bunch of people and the voice of the signs of God why can't they believe it the true word of God being made manifest they're too smart too educated to believe the simple form of the written word amen they want to put their own interpretation to it it don't mean this it don't mean that see it does mean that listen may I say this right quick now even the visions that God gives here at the place it's so misunderstood that's the reason you hear me say on the tapes say what the tapes say say what divisions say smart educational miss it the simple Visions when they're revealed in such Simplicity till it crosses over the top of the people's head listen may I share with you and understand this you all know that Sandy and I went over to Europe from 84 to 89 and our pastor Floyd Patterson who took over spoken word publication when Roy borders died my pastor sent me over to Europe to open a spoken word office first one anywhere in the united excuse me anywhere outside the United States anywhere in the world so we went over there we opened up a spoken word office a year and a half later Joseph Branham took over spoken word publication and changed the name to what voice of God so now he combined the tapes and the books together okay and um so uh I want you to understand the Viewpoint the voice of God Recordings makes on just saying listen to the tapes I I understand some of that why because they have seen every fanatical element they have seen every kind of ism they have seen every Minister get up and try to pull off a group of people whether it's Thunders or whether it's Perugia or whether it's deity or whether it's five-fold Ministry and it's all of these different isms and they're all planted on the same tree the crafted in Vines the crafted in branches of the message living off of the same message my laughs so I do I I can under understand Joseph's Viewpoint stay with those tapes why he's seen them he said brother Ron I'll share with you something he told me very personal very personal he said how would you like he said Daddy just died Mama's in the hospital Sarah's in the hospital and I'm in the home and two or three men I forget if he said if it was three but I know at least two he said they come into my home and he says and they kneel in front of me and call me Lord Joseph he said what would that do to your 10 year old mine how old are you boys you and the orange jacket how old are you 12. imagine if you were 10 years old and somebody comes and makes you Lord Joseph what would you do you go wow you would think what's wrong with these guys and see all kinds of the fanatical elements that's why I understand Brother Joseph said there's one voice ordained of God to turn your hearts back it's true I believe that but I also believe that God's got a god ordained God equipped God called man who are part of the fivefold ministry because it didn't end with the with the voice of Malachi 4 or Revelations 10 7 The Voice continues but I understand the viewpoint now let me show you what happened in the early church you all know that after Acts chapter 2 it wasn't just a a period of time until the early church the Ephesian church with the Holy Spirit in fact they start choosing men to to take positions the first time Holy Ghost men chose lots and voted for somebody he said they voted the in the wrong man what was his name Matthias did he do anything for God he said man chose Matthias and he said God chose Paul showing that even Holy Ghost filled man the first time they ever voted brother Ram said this voting in and voting out he said watch when God calls a man whether you voted for him or not God still made him a pastor he said watch Elijah whether Jezebel received him or not he was still her pastor okay now watch this in Galatians 1. I'm going to show you from the scriptures Galatians 1. I Marvel that there are that ye are so soon removed from him that is called you know the grace of Christ onto another gospel which is not another but there are some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of Christ and though we are an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than which we have preached unto you let him be accursed as we said before and I say now again If any man preach any other gospel unto you then what you've received letting be accursed now I've I've got several quotes here that I wish to kind of launch off into my next sermon remember we're talking about transformed ministers that transform themselves as Ministers of light over there in Holland if any of you speak Dutch or you're from Belgium a match when you like to light a match it's called Lucifer do you have a Lucifer strike a match why it's a bringer of light Now understand they transform themselves as apostles it wasn't God doing it they they said they're Apostles oh you're an apostle we have judged those who call themselves Apostles and are not why they get off the word okay now understand yet this is not a sermon you're gonna all jump and shout and get all excited no no no this is this is something that's going to found you why this is something that's going to put a foundation on you that when something comes by with a little fantastical our little in documention you you Hey listen I don't know about you but I'm skeptical brother REM said pastors by Nature are skeptical can't help it just my nature a little skeptical I'm a hard Sail women easy I got the best vacuum in the world man I'll tell you what let me just just come over here you know come here look at this man you need this vacuum I don't care 1200 bucks but it's the best you'll never have to buy another one in your life foreign are you kidding me hard sale I'm a hard sale are you look a woman is easy man's not brother Brown let me give you another doctrinal teaching he said you have a meeting going on and all kinds of and there's some kind of fanatical and Fantastical stuff going on phenomena and anointing is there he says watch when you've got women coming to the altar it's usually human emotion he said but when you get men he said when you get men to the altar it's because the word convicted them amen not making fun of the sisters no no no brother Brandon first sermon he ever preached right remember Dr Roy Davis Brothers I get up here and he says and I talked about Christ and he cried and they cried and we all cried and he said so Dr Davis he comes he's back in the back office how'd I do man give me an estimation the worst sermon I ever heard but they cried they cry at funerals they cry at weddings it's hard enough for me really I'm the minister I'm standing there I got my Bible and the bride comes down and she's got her veil and it's so holy and it's just and I think oh God here's Christ in the church I get emotional they cry at everything it's not the crying he says why he said just like you he he said like a lawyer that gets up there ladies and gentlemen of the jury I'm going to prove to you before this this uh uh judicial hearing is over I'm gonna prove to you that this guy is he is guilty on on like this beat on the banister and everybody whoo he said all that all that emotion he said had nothing to do with the legalism of the word anyway watch this and I'm bringing this to a close and yet I'm not closing I'm just causing you to relax you're getting a little tight 1962 testimony on the sea that's a reason I've been trying to keep the message just as simple as possible maybe some of you might be wondering why I'm not calling prayer lines each night here's my purpose in doing this I want to build faith in the people in a resurrected Jesus so you don't have to wait till some special gift passes through the neighborhood you just believe him wherever you are because he's God it doesn't take an evangelist hands which that's all right contending for the faith 1955. I have noticed so much in my meetings going around that the phenomenal phenomena of this way of the holy spirit moves and the meetings has been very strange to the American people because there's such a mix up among the American people so many different denominations so many different phases of which way they believe and they become so indocumented there's that word and documented with their belief till they hardly know which way to go if there ever was a place that really has become a modern Babylon it's America contending for the faith paragraph 12 it isn't personal contact the minister isn't to personally contact the one thing that hurts the American people and for my own Ministry they believe they must have hands laid on them or something on that manner because they've been taught that especially among Full Gospel people wow amazing nazri Pilgrim Holiness Methodist Baptist so forth believe in the anointing of the oil that's the way they've been taught in foreign countries one thing in the Supernatural the whole group believes in one Accord because they're not undocumented with different things they just see it and what's got to be Supernatural they accept it in the way it is they don't class it to nothing else what does a prophet teach for Doctrine his meetings his services were for us an example brother Brenda's Ministry like I said was coming to such a crescendo now watch this prior to this brother Brenham is trying to wean the people away from the false teachings of Pentecost 1954 earnestly contending for the faith the American people are taught different than what the overseas people are over in there we're taught you must lay hands on the sick for them to recover as long as your mind is dealing that way nothing else short of that will do it that's right it's always something that's your point of contact in the sermon the True Vine and a false Vine 1955. my Ministry the reason it isn't so effective now he's talking about his own god-given Angel Vindicated Ministry of God the reason that my Ministry Isn't So effective I suppose in America is because the American people are very anxious for you to lay hands on them why that's the way they're preached to the way they've been documented another one of them words they've been documented that's a Jewish tradition just only a tradition do you now believe Macon Georgia in 1955. that works all right especially in America has been taught most of the people laying hands on the sick that's a Jewish custom it's all right it's the scripture some places in the scripture they're commanded to lay hands on the sick they shall recover another place they must anoint them with oil and a prayer of facial save the sick another place they cast out evil spirits and you just see it all around it's according to your faith be it unto you I said the other night Jesus said come lay your hands on my girl she'll live you believe you're just what you say you are seize come lay your hands on my girl she will live but the Roman not so speak the word I'm not worthy to come around my place for you to come around my place you just speak the word my servant shall live it's according to your faith what happened musicians go ahead and come this morning please the arrow of God's Deliverance shot from a bow the reason my Ministry has never been a good success in America in America the people are taught you got to lay hands on them you got to anoint him with oil that's what they believe and there's no way ever moving that see it's already grounded into them and you can't do nothing about it now if the people have been indocumented and it's what they've been taught brother Ren said you can't move them from it but I want to ask you brother Ram said don't major on a minor he said it was a Jewish tradition lay hands so what he said say what he says on tape Jewish tradition he said but to the Gentiles speak the word Lord whatever you say you don't need to come to my house you don't need to lay hands it's whatever you say you see with us Gentiles we've been trying to be weaned away from all of this stuff that we need to lay hands I believe on laying on of hands lay hands on the sick and they shall recover but the Bible also says don't lay hands on no man suddenly the sickness that he's got did God put it on him if it did and you come there and you cast it off and guess what the spirit will go and if that person has not repented guess what he goes out gets seven others much worse and comes back into the house and the house having been swept and garnished and he said but not filled he said that I got some quotes I'm going to show you brother Ram said you try to drag somebody to the altar because the spirit of God's moving on him he said and you are doing it by you pulling them he said it'll be ten times harder next time because they just Harden their spirit okay because you're doing it through the human emotion when God begins to convict the heart you can't brother Ram said a team of horses cannot keep you in your seat there'll be something you'll just oh God I need to make it right because there's a conviction as I gave you that quote he said Lord if this is let me preach as a dying minister to a dying people let me preach as though this is my last sermon and he says and get those people that they might repent and come to the altar with their tears streaming brother Brown said you want to get healed he said make it right with God healing is the children's bread is that right he said don't come up here confess your faults before you come up make it right then you have a right to receive healing amen those are doctrinal teaching and like I said a disclaimer hey and don't nobody think I'm shooting at it no I'm taking it from the message I may brother say that because that's the way I believe no stop he said it he had a gift and he said oh my my own Ministry he said it's never really been successful here in America because they've been undocumented he said I try to turn them he said but you know what if that's what they've been taught and so I've got to to learn if that's what people have been taught I can't I can't turn them but I believe saints of God that that third pull he says you watch that third pull watch he said when the persecution comes down he said watch what you've seen temporarily come in the fullness of its power I want to ask you the third pull every one of the five indications of the third pull was it done in church where was it done it was sovereignly given could be sitting around a table and brother Brennan's talking about squirrels and Hattie Wright believes and she comes under that anointing and she says these keywords that's nothing but the truth wasn't in church wasn't while he's preaching or they're out fishing a little fishing he's out fishing catches little fish he pulls the guts out he didn't take the hook the hook was so far down deep into it he didn't take the needle nose pliers and reach in there angelically he just pulled it out little fish insights came out he said you shot your last wide little fish throws it in the water and sit there and floats all of a sudden he feels the presence of God he said there's a resurrection going to take place wow maybe I'm going to go to the hospital maybe I'll go to Louisville I'll empty the hospital's out I'll pray for all the sick and they'll come out he said no speak to the little fish now if you and I would have been there and we'd have seen that we'd have thought oh the little fishy really wasn't dead he just floated around a little bit and swallowed his guts and backed down he went God does things supernaturally and he might do something so simple that we Overlook it because man's looking for some great some big something and he said and he said as an example he said here I've got a gift I'm to preach to the people I'll get the people to believe have a prayer line have him come up here and that woman sitting there wanting to pray for that little baby and three or four times it's so great honor go pray for that baby no brother rev's gonna do it who am I finally she can't so she's she's nudged by the spirit three or four times oh God help us be sensitive to your spirit she goes do you mind if I pray for your baby I just as a mother would she just felt some She lays her hands on a baby prays for it she goes and sits back down the lady doesn't get out of the prayer line she doesn't know what's happened to her baby and she comes up there and brother round said oh there's nothing wrong with your baby your baby is
