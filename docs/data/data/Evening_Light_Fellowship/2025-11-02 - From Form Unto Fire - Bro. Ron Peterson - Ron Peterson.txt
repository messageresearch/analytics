Ruben Johnson says, "We want to thank the Lord for watching over Lucas. He had his appendix removed Thursday. So, we just pray the Lord continue to be with Lucas, grant him a complete recovery. the Lord be with him. [snorts] Sister Sister Josie is thank you for all the prayers for my brother Arthur Banks. He's a lot better from his sickness. Still in hospice, but the prayers are welcomed. He is more at peace. Pray the Lord continue to be with sister Joseph's brother Arthur and just be with him in his time of need. Brother John McCaffrey, he wants to express his sincere and humble thanks to God for giving me a new job this past week. So, just thankful for what the Lord did for brother John. He meets our needs no matter what it might be. Amen. Got a note here this morning. I'm not too sure who it's from, but it says, "Please pray for a healing touch for my mom. She's been having flu-l like symptoms. Pray the Lord gives her faith for a complete healing." So, let's pray for this one. Lord knows who it is. Brother Billy Silva woke up and not feeling well this morning. Let's remember brother Billy in prayer and brother Mario Chua is preaching in Ottawa, Canada today and then next weekend he'll be preaching in Petroleia, Canada. So let's pray for brother Mario while he's away. Brother Johnny Green, would you come this morning? Brother Johnny and take us to the Lord in prayer. Pray for our service today. Our pastor says he feels burdened and so I know if Lord's put a burden upon his heart, there's a need. So pray the Lord would just speak to each one. If you have a need this morning, just lift before the Lord as brother Johnny prays. God bless you. &gt;&gt; How many here today would say with an uplifted hand, if I had an opportunity, I got a lot of testimonies to share. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Isn't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads together. &gt;&gt; Lord, we're so grateful that you're still Jehovah Gyra. &gt;&gt; You still provide our need. You've never failed us. You never will fail us. You promise that that I'll be with you, even in you, to the end of the world. We stand here, Lord God, because of your amazing grace. We're here to say that we love you and praise you. We're here to give you glory and honor. Lord, I'm so thankful, Father, that you have given us eternal life. You've given us eternity to praise you and to worship you, Lord. And we're so thankful, dear God, this morning that we can come before you with these needs, Lord. And we know that, Father, you're mindful of every single one of them. This Arthur Banks that's in the hospice, Lord. We know that you're moving in his life. And I pray that you would continue to answer Sister Jos's prayer for him. And for those, Father God, that have come through many trials and many tests. Lord, we're here today to say thank you for once again meeting our needs. Lord, we just want to say we love you. &gt;&gt; We want to praise you, Lord. [music] We pray this morning, Lord, as our pastor comes or whoever speaks the word that Lord, you would just get us out of the way so that your word can have free course in our life. Thank you for all of our brothers and sisters who have labored so much, Lord, for Friday night's family night. And for this morning, Lord, after service, we're having a meal together, Lord. And we thank you for all of those that have put their shoulder to the wheel to see that these things happen, Lord. Bless them. Bless them mightily, Lord. And so, Father, we just look to you again and say thank you for meeting every single need in the midst of your people. We want to give you honor and glory in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Johnny. You may be seated this morning. Want to welcome each one into the house of the Lord. If you're here visiting this morning, we welcome you. Got some visitors from Canada this morning, but brother Vish and sister Cindy Heers, I hope I'm saying that correctly, but they're from Grace Message Tabernacle of Ontario, Canada. Brother John Denqua is our pastor. So, it's good to have them here this morning. Also, it's good to have brother Dennis, Sister Bonnie back with us. And if you're here visiting, we don't have your name. We just welcome you and welcome our unseen audience as well. I believe my mother might be streaming the service this morning, so I welcome her as well. And as brother Johnny mentioned, we'll be having a lunchon right after service today. And all are welcome. I think there's plenty of food. So everybody's welcome to come. We will be having a baptism right after service and that'll be in the front. And so we'll all go out after service for the baptism. And then after the baptism, we're all going to circle around this way. We're going to go through the side side gate into the back. And then there will be three lines for for serving. Pastor did say if you come in any other way, you're going to be put at the back of the line. So be sure you follow the directions and then let's since it's in honor of ministry appreciation, let's make sure that the ministry gets to go first and we'll let our seniors follow after that. And families, if you could please monitor your children, help them serve up their portions. We don't want to be wasteful, but we do have plenty of food, but we want to prudent. And then there are some coolers with a lot of drinks in there. And so just be mindful of your children that they don't start a drink and then just leave it sitting around. So just pay attention to that. But we'll announce this again at the end of service. Amen. How many are happy in the Lord this morning? Happy to be here. Amen. Just over in the glory land.

Well, believing uh isn't easy. And uh that really is like when it gets hard and believing, you really know if somebody believes or not when they go through the testing. And I just want to sing this song this morning. It's a older song. I kind of grew up on the song and uh but I heard it the other day and it really touched me. So I'm just going to sing it with you guys. It's not hard to believe when you're standing [singing and music] on the mountain top of glory. When you can hear the [music and singing] songs of angels in the breeze from heaven [singing] sends [music] you sorry. Oh, but in the [music and singing] valley once more will Jesus be Lord? Oh, that's the question. [music] believing [music] when believing isn't easy. That is [music] the testing. Oh, and I need faith for the times [music] when the sun [singing] does not shine and [music] the mountain top is just a memory. When [music] there no [singing] sign to be seen and [music] I don't feel a thing to the word of God alone [singing] I can cling and [music] I need faith for [singing] the day when [music] the troubles come my way and I just don't [music] understand what it means That's when nothing [music] else will do. I need the Lord to get me through. And believeing [music] becomes my victory. It's [music] not hard to believe when things are going [music] well and skies are sun. [music] Oh, when you can feel you're making progress, doing good and living in times [music] of plenty. Oh, but if [singing] all [music] of that should change, would you still keep [singing] the faith? Oh, that's the question. [music] Oh yeah. Believing when believing [music and singing] isn't easy. That is the testing. [music] You know this song. Just sing it with me. Oh, [singing] and I need [music] faith for the times when the sun does not shine and the mountain [singing] tops is just a memory. When there's [music] no sign to [singing] be seen and I don't feel a [music] thing to the word of God [singing] alone, I can't believe. Oh, and I [music and singing] need faith for the day when the troubles come my way and I just don't [music] understand what it means. That's when nothing [music] else will [singing] do. See the Lord to get me through. And believing [music] becomes my victory. Oh, and I need faith for the mountain [singing and music] shine. And the mountain top is just a memory. And there's no sign to [music] be seen. And I don't [singing] feel a thing to the word of God [music] alone. I can't clean. is I need faith for the day when [music] the troubles come my way. [singing] Oh, and I just don't understand what it means. When nothing else will do, I need the Lord to get me through. And believing [music] me comes my victory. Oh yes, that's when nothing else will do. I need the Lord to get me through and believe [music] [singing] becomes my victory. [applause] &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; God bless you. This song is uh entitled God Sees the Storm from the Other Side. So, same same channel. So, God must have a message today. Amen. When the storm raged about them, the disciples were afraid. For the waves were high and the ship was tossed. They could not find their [singing] way. Then they awoke the master, saying, [music] "Lord, [singing] please save us now." He rebuked the winds and the sea grew calm. And they all [singing] wondered how God sees the storm from the other side. [singing] He knows the lessons learned. [music] And just [singing] beyond the clouds, he sees clear skies. He speaks peace to the raging storm. When peace cannot be found, he already [singing] sees the rainbow. When [music] we see only [singing] clouds, like the men [singing] on the sea, I have called on God in prayer. when it seemed [singing] to me all hope was gone. And [music] in my deep despair, I remember what the [singing] Lord said when he calmed that troubled sea. And I know once [singing] more he sees my storm and peace [singing] floods over me. God [singing] sees the storm [music] from the other side. He knows the lessons learned. And just [singing] beyond the clouds, he sees clear skies. He speaks peace to the raging storm. When peace cannot be found, [singing] he already sees the rainbow. When we see only clouds, when the storms of life come crashing [singing] in and trouble me, I can feel [singing] God's arms around me. And he whispers, [singing] "Just [music] let it be." God [singing] sees the storm from the other side. He knows [singing] the lessons learned. And just beyond the clouds, [singing] he sees clear skies. He speaks [singing] peace to the raging storm. When peace cannot [music] be found, he already sees the rainbow. When we see only clouds, he speaks peace to the raging storm. When peace cannot be found, he already [singing] sees the rainbow. When [music] we see [singing] all the clouds, [applause] thank you, Sister Jill, Justin. So glad that he's mindful of each one of us. I mean, let's all stand and we prepare to change the order of the service. I was just thinking of song. I know the master of the wind. &gt;&gt; Amen. My boat of life might be going down sometimes, but he's the one that can come calm the storm. Amen. My boat of life [singing] [music] sails on a troubled sea. Ever there's [music] a [singing] wind in my sail. [music] But I have a friend who's watching over [music] me when the grace [singing] turns in to a [music] king. I know [music and singing] the master of the way. I know the [singing] maker of the rain. [music] He can conquer the [music] storm and make the sun to shine again. I know the master of the wind. Sometimes I [music and singing] soar like an eagle to the high. Upon the [music and singing] peace my soul can be found. An unexpected storm may [music and singing] drive me from the height. May bring me low but it will never [music and singing] bring me down. I [music] know the master of the way. [singing] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; I know the maker of the rain. [music] He can calm the [singing] storm and make the sun to shine again. I know the master of [music and singing] moon. One more time. I know the master of [music] the wind. &gt;&gt; I know [singing] the maker of the rain. [music] He can [singing] calm the storm to make the sun to shine again. [music and singing] I know the master of he can calm the soul. Oh, he can [music] cal [singing] your storm and make the sun to shine again. [music] I know the master [singing and music] of &gt;&gt; heavenly father truly that is our story. &gt;&gt; Yes. how that our [music] life is like a ship that is on a troubled sea. But Father, even as those that were crossing the Sea of Galilee one day and there come a great tempest and you were in the hinder part of the ship and you went to sleep and they let you go to sleep and they said, "Master, go ahead and rest yourself. We got this. We can take care of it." Father, sometimes that's how it is. We let you go to sleep and we kind of figure we can take care of ourselves and we we got it. But then we realize when the wind is t is strong and the waves are against us and it seems like our ship is going to sink, it's time to go wake up the master. Father, I &gt;&gt; ask you to come and &gt;&gt; walk these aisles today. &gt;&gt; Speak to us. Father, I have something on my heart this morning. I pray, oh God, that you would come. Let the Holy Spirit have his way in this service today and most of all, draw us closer to you. I thank you. I praise you. I ask these things for your glory in the name of Jesus Christ.

I will try to get you out in time. And but I want to be able to take my time. &gt;&gt; I've got a lot on my plate this morning. I've had the Lord to deal with me in the last day or so and had a quiet time with him yesterday morning which just was such a refresher. &gt;&gt; You need those times. You know, you can pray, read, you can sing, you can read and do all those things, but your alone time with God on a onetoone is where you gather strength. &gt;&gt; Amen.

I've experienced you in my life in the good times and in the bad. &gt;&gt; And realize, Father, that through it all, it was you that was watching over me. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I didn't keep you. You kept me. It wasn't my keeping your word. It was you keeping your covenant. &gt;&gt; For I will make a way for my children. For a place I've gone to prepare for you, that where I am, there you may be also. Father, I take comfort in those words. I pray now, Father, as I lay my hands upon your word. I ask for a great anointing. Let the author of that word that inspired the men of old to write these words, &gt;&gt; may that author come now, &gt;&gt; speak through my lips, &gt;&gt; hear through the hearer's ears. Let them hear what the spirit is saying to the church. Father, I thank you. I love you. I ask that you be with us now, Lord, in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. God bless you. Thank you, musicians, each and everyone. I enjoyed the song specials. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Both of them so very, very special to me. I appreciate it. Ezekiel chapter 20. Ezekiel chap 20 verses 47 and 48. Then we'll go to Psalms chapter 83 and then to Hebrews 12. [snorts] Ezekiel chapter 20 47 and 48. and say to the forest of the south, hear the word of the Lord. Thus sayaith the Lord God, behold, I will kindle a fire in thee, &gt;&gt; and it shall devour every green tree in thee, and every dry tree. The flaming fire shall not be quenched, and all the faces from the south to the north shall be burned therein, and all the flesh shall see that I, the Lord, have kindled it. It shall not be quenched. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Notice, I will kindle a fire &gt;&gt; in thee. [snorts] Psalms 83 verse 14. As a fire burnth the wood and as the flame setth the mountains on fire. Turn with me now to the book of Hebrews chapter 12. Hebrews 12 verse 28 and 29. And if I would, I'd like all of us to read this in unison. Those of you that have your Bible, I'd like you to read from your Bible. Those of you don't read it from the overhead. Uh so let's read this all together. Verse 28 of Hebrews 12. Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear. For our God is a consuming fire. &gt;&gt; May God bless the reading of his word. You may be speeded seated this morning in his presence. I'd like to title my sermon as an opposite of what I preached on this past Wednesday. This past Wednesday, it was more of an informative service. And I want to say it was as though I couldn't get into the channel. &gt;&gt; And I always take it unto myself. If I think, well, maybe I haven't been prayed up and not seeking you like I should. And then I also want to share that with you and say, maybe you haven't. &gt;&gt; I need your help. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; If you don't pray, God don't speak. &gt;&gt; So, I need your help. So I went from fire unto form and I was taking it from where the prophet of God and we he spoke this in uh the seven church age book and this is the quote which inspired me to take this direction. Ephesian church age, brother Brandham said that cycle of revival and death has never failed. Revival and death has never failed. All you have to do is to recall the last move of God in the spirit when men and women dressed like Christians, went to church, prayed all night, took the street corners, and weren't ashamed of the manifestation of God of the spirit. They left their old dead churches and worshiped in homes and old store buildings. They had reality. &gt;&gt; But it wasn't too long until they began to get enough money to build fine new churches. &gt;&gt; They put in a choir instead of singing unto God for themselves. &gt;&gt; They put gowns on the choir. They organized a movement and ran it by man. &gt;&gt; They soon began to read books that weren't fit to read. They let down the bars and goats came in and took over. &gt;&gt; The cry of joy was gone and the freedom of the spirit was gone. &gt;&gt; Oh, they kept on with a form, &gt;&gt; but the fire had died down &gt;&gt; and the blackness of ashes is about all that was left. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it took me as Sandy and I, my wife and I, in our morning devotions and I began to weep when I read that. I said, Sandy, it went from the reality of the spirit of God moving, &gt;&gt; from fire to a form, &gt;&gt; a religion, a &gt;&gt; a way of life, &gt;&gt; a keeping of the law, and no sincerity. in &gt;&gt; pretty soon. There are just a few ashes about all that is left. &gt;&gt; So today, I don't want to leave you on a negative note, but a positive. &gt;&gt; So I want to go from form unto fire &gt;&gt; and Today I want to speak about fire &gt;&gt; and how that God is likened unto fire. And there are many things that the Bible uses that types God. God is like a lion, king of the jungle, and when he roars, let everyone take heed. &gt;&gt; He is likened unto an eagle. that flies above the trials with the wings of faith. He is likened unto a lamb who is the supreme sacrifice of God. &gt;&gt; He is like the gentle dove who is meek and lonely. &gt;&gt; But the Bible says that he also is a consuming fire. &gt;&gt; The word fire appears 540 times within your Bible. And nearly every time that fire is mentioned, God is in it &gt;&gt; because our God &gt;&gt; is a consuming fire. Absolutely. &gt;&gt; So I want to go from form unto fire and I want to talk about the God that answers by fire. And fire represents many things within the scripture. And it represents several of these things. And I shall attempt to go through some of these to let you realize that what God has done in this hour is to not just set up church order, &gt;&gt; but to establish a relationship with you as the believer. Amen. &gt;&gt; Fire represents his presence. Fire represents his voice. Fire represents his judgment and displeasure. Fire also represents his acceptance and approval. &gt;&gt; Yes. God likens unto his spirit baptism with that of a baptism of fire. &gt;&gt; Amen. So there are properties associated with fire that God wants you to understand that you might know a little bit more of his characteristics. Whenever we go to sterilize a needle that you're going to use to perhaps puncture a blister or a wound that you have, you sterilize it with a fire. &gt;&gt; You sterilize a knife if you're going to use it. If you have nothing else, you're going to sterilize that knife with fire. You sterilize tools that's used in the medical field in an enclave which puts it under extreme heat. And there's nothing like fire and heat that kills the germs. Fire and water are the two most cleansing elements known to mankind. God lets you go and to get baptized. When you get baptized with water, it signifies the cleansing of the sacrifice before it's consumed. &gt;&gt; So there's a difference between the water baptism, okay, which is your works unto God, and the baptism of fire, which is God consuming your sacrifice and his works to you. GOD SAYING, "I ACCEPT THIS SACRIFICE." YES, &gt;&gt; SIR. &gt;&gt; SO, I ask all of you that have been baptized in water. &gt;&gt; Have you been baptized by fire? &gt;&gt; Well, I didn't know there was such a thing. Well, then how was you baptized? Well, holding your head high, I was baptized as the prophet said, unto the name of THE LORD JESUS CHRIST. BUT THAT'S unto repentance. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; For did not Jesus say or John say about Jesus THAT THERE'S ONE COMING AFTER ME &gt;&gt; WHOSE BAPTISM IS FAR GREATER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; FOR I TRULY BAPTIZE YOU UNTO REPENTANCE, &gt;&gt; but the one coming after me shall truly baptize you with the Holy Ghost in fire. The Holy Ghost is not only to consume your sacrifice, but it is to be a divine sign to you that God has accepted your sacrifice. &gt;&gt; There is something about fire that is inspiring and thoughtprovoking. We've all set around a fire. We've all gone camping and you make a nice old fire. Not some little tiny thing here that you can't really get warm by. &gt;&gt; Just let the Love All Boys put together a fire for you. And I tell you, you're going to have a fire. They they they cut them logs and Ethan Stanky carries them like that. And then he they take them, they cut them up, they shout, and we have a fire. &gt;&gt; There's nothing like a fire. You can look into it AND YOU CAN QUIT TALKING. &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T HAVE TO say nothing. Just sit there and look, &gt;&gt; crackle and pop and you see the flames and the fire. And there is something thought provoking &gt;&gt; about looking into fire. Why? BECAUSE IT'S GOT A PROPERTY of God. YOU LOOK INTO FIRE, THERE'S something that has an affinity that you can relate with. There's nothing like a good old Christian that's got a fire in the hearth. &gt;&gt; Not a forced air heater, &gt;&gt; but a real glow of the Holy Spirit on the inside. &gt;&gt; I used to heat my house in Flagstaff with nothing but wood. And we had a big old wooden fireplace. And I I tell you, I would stoke it up at night and I put different kinds of wood in there knowing that oak is going to last longer than than the pine and the aspen. I would stoke it up and then I'd damp it down and in the mornings it might be a little cool, but I would go and look and see, is there any fire left in the &gt;&gt; And then I'd open up the dampers and open up the fluid a little bit, open the door just a little bit, and all of a sudden Throw a couple logs ON THE FIRE. YOU got to refuel your fire. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All of you have got to refuel the fire of the Holy Spirit in your life. It's not just a ONE TIME BAPTISM, BUT A BAPTISM UPON BAPTISM. &gt;&gt; AMEN. It's a continual stoking the fire. WHY? BECAUSE BURN, BURN, HOLY SPIRIT. BURN in me. &gt;&gt; Set my soul on fire. &gt;&gt; The Bible says that God would rather you be hot or cold. &gt;&gt; And I've thought about I don't want to try to just have a painted fire. &gt;&gt; I don't want to talk about a fire. You can't get warm by a painted fire. So let's not use religious ways and different things to paint a picture about how God is a fire. But may there be a reality of the fire of God burning within each one of us. &gt;&gt; A fire can be dangerous &gt;&gt; if it gets out of control. If it's not handled properly, it can rage out of control and cause more destruction than good. We always tell OUR CHILDREN, DON'T YOU PLAY WITH fire because you know that if your children are just they're mesmerized by fire and matches, they might start the whole house on fire. In fact, throughout this city, every every week, the fire departments are going somewhere and putting out a fire because somebody was playing with it. &gt;&gt; God help us to never play with the fire of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Fire makes things move. &gt;&gt; Amen. You ever walk barefoot and step on a cigarette that somebody had thrown on the ground. I'll tell you, you'll Yeah, you'll move real quick. I've done it several times. Do you know it's against the law to yell fire in a crowded theater &gt;&gt; when there's a fire raging in a, let's say, a high-rise building or some big tower like the Twin Towers. See, it wasn't just the airplane crashed into the Twin Towers there that day, but it was the fire &gt;&gt; that set the place ablaze. And I don't know if any of you have seen the people jumping to their death because they'd rather jump from the fire than to be consumed by it. Fire makes things move. Now, brother Brennham uses and it's quite a a a funny little story, but brother Brennham uses the natural as a type of the spiritual and he takes in the uncertain sound. He says, "Brethren, men of God, women of God, what's the matter with us? There's something needs to move." He says, "We're turtling." When I was a little boy, you know what a turtle is? A tortoise. We have them back east. An old terrapin and we called him. And me and my brother saw one one time was a little bitty fella. And the funniest looking thing you ever seen. He was moving like that. And when we got him, he went shooked and drawed up. Just reminded me of some people &gt;&gt; preaching the gospel to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I'll watch some of your reaction. Uh here he goes getting on me again. You tuck your [laughter] head back. That's okay. But listen what he said. You go to throwing the gospel out and they say the the the days of miracles have passed. No such thing as that old turtle. You know what I said? I I think I'll make him walk. I went over and got him got me a switch and began to whip him. That didn't do no good. I just whipped him. He just smothered up. You can beat them, whip them, do anything you want to, and you won't do a bit of good. I said, I'll fix him. I took him down to the creek, and then I baptized him. [snorts] Put him under the water till bubbles all bubbled up. That's all there was to to him. Water never done it. You might as well quit your fussing. I just held him there until all the bubbles had bubble, bubble, bubble. He never want done a thing. But you know what I did? I got me a piece of paper and built me a little fire. &gt;&gt; Set the old boy on it. He walked in. &gt;&gt; That's what we need tonight. &gt;&gt; Is the baptism of the Holy Ghost in fire. &gt;&gt; Not so much church creed back in the thing back like the forefathers had it. We need another Pentecost who will line you up with the Holy Ghost. It'll send people to their knees, send people to their Bibles to search the scripture and look for them. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what we need. Not not turtle religion. &gt;&gt; We need a religion that'll make us move. &gt;&gt; Fire in the scripture is used many times. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Fire represents his presence. Yes. &gt;&gt; Mo Moses noticed the bush on fire one day &gt;&gt; and it was not consumed. It got his attraction. It got his attention and it attracted him. And the Bible says that when he stepped aside and went to see why the bush was not consumed. I want you to understand that there are attractions that God will put in your life to cause you to stop and to look. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But he wants to get your attention more than just why is the bush not being consumed. &gt;&gt; He came into the presence of God. In fact, when he did, he come close to that pillar of fire. Can you imagine? Now, here is Moses. He doesn't really know &gt;&gt; about his calling. He doesn't really know. He He just knows he's a proper child. He's been told that by his mother, kicked out by Pharaoh and on and he's on the back side of the desert. And he sees a bush that's on fire. And he comes into the presence of that fire and he the closer he gets the more he feels something supernatural until the voice speaks and said Moses Moses. Take off your shoes for the ground that thou standest on is holy ground. &gt;&gt; Now I want you to understand that picture right now. And it took a prophet of God for him to explain it to us. And he said that prophet came into the presence of God. And he says the presence of God is what changed the life of Moses. &gt;&gt; He says that he actually entered into &gt;&gt; the pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; Oh, let me tell you, &gt;&gt; I don't WANT TO JUST TALK ABOUT THIS MESSAGE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; I DON'T WANT TO JUST HAVE IT TO BE an attraction. Oh, there's something about it. But God, allow me to enter into THAT PILLAR OF FIRE. &gt;&gt; LET ME GET INTO IT. LET ME GET UNDER THE INSPIRATION. LET IT DO SOMETHING TO ME. &gt;&gt; It caused an attraction for Moses. He came into the presence of God. was never the same. &gt;&gt; Even those on the day of Pentecost and they were gathered together in an upper room. &gt;&gt; And Jesus had told the disciples to go into Jerusalem and tar there until you were endued with power from on high. And the Bible says, "And the day of Pentecost was fully come." &gt;&gt; And they were all in one mind and one accord. And there came a sound from heaven as a rushing mighty wind and cloven tongues of fire fell upon each one. &gt;&gt; Brother Brennham says, "Now you watch here, the Holy Spirit, which is the pillar of fire, broke himself up and he sat upon each one of them." I want you to understand that that's what God wants to do with each one of you is he WANTS TO SIT ON YOU. He wants to get your life on fire for him. &gt;&gt; He wants TO GET YOU INVOLVED. I DON'T WANT YOU TO JUST BE A SPECTATOR, &gt;&gt; BUT A PARTICIPATOR. &gt;&gt; I DON'T WANT YOU TO SIT IN THE BENCH. GET IN THE GAME. &gt;&gt; PRAISE THE LORD. [applause] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Bless the Lord. &gt;&gt; When they came under the influence of a fire on each one of them, &gt;&gt; they began to move. &gt;&gt; Fear left them. &gt;&gt; The door that they had locked for fear of the Jews, now they unlocked. THEY KICKED IT OPEN. &gt;&gt; THEY WENT OUT INTO THE STREETS &gt;&gt; AND THEY BEGAN TO MAGNIFY. THEY WERE NO LONGER ASHAMED. THEY WERE NO LONGER FEARFUL. THAT'S WHAT THE HOLY GHOST WILL DO FOR YOU. IT'LL PUT YOU ON FIRE. IT'LL TAKE AWAY ANY SHAME, ANY REPROACH. YOU'LL GLADLY BEAR IT. &gt;&gt; Prove me wrong. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Try it one time. [snorts] &gt;&gt; The fire that Moses saw was just one bush and on a mountain side. But that experience CAUSED HIM TO GO BACK AND GET THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL AND COME BACK TO MOUNT SI. AND THIS TIME IT WASN'T JUST A BUSH. &gt;&gt; The whole [screaming] mountain &gt;&gt; was on fire. &gt;&gt; Behold, what a great fire a flame does kindle. Moses then received a message of fire and the end time prophet received a message from the pillar of fire. One was Moses on Mount Si and here was the prophet in our day on Mount Sunset. &gt;&gt; This is a message of fire. &gt;&gt; Don't play with it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; Children of Israel saw the fire of God on Mount Si. It was moved by earthquakes and by thunderings and by voices and the top of the whole mountain was on fire. Whenever you see the pillar of fire, I want all of you to understand you will find God's voice. and you will see God's presence. &gt;&gt; Now, I want to take it from what happened back then to bring it DOWN TO TODAY BECAUSE WHAT GOOD IS A GOD OF HISTORY? &gt;&gt; But let us bring a God out of history down into a &gt;&gt; into our day. &gt;&gt; For Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. That's right. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; When Moses came down off of the mountain and from the presence of God, he walked among the people and his face did shine. It had such an effect that the people were even afraid to look upon the face of Moses &gt;&gt; because he showed with the glory of God. &gt;&gt; He had to veil himself. THEY SAID, "OH, GOD, DON'T LET MOSES SPEAK because he's such a reflection." He said, "Then I'll use his his brother Aaron to be his mouthpiece." When Moses heard the voice speak from the fire, it ignited a fire in him. &gt;&gt; It sparked something WITHIN MOSES. DO YOU KNOW WHAT spontaneous combustion is? If any of you ever took shop class, whether it's automotive or woodworking or anything like that, you have certain conditions that's called spontaneous combustion. You take an old oiled rag or something with with some flammable material and you put the rags in the corner or whatever and if the temperature becomes right, &gt;&gt; LISTEN TO ME. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; IF THE MATERIAL IS COMBUSTIBLE AND THE CONDITIONS &gt;&gt; WILL GET RIGHT, &gt;&gt; THAT CONDITION WILL CAUSE &gt;&gt; SPONTANEOUS FLAME ON. Y &gt;&gt; so it is with you. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; IF YOU ARE OF the same material that the pillar of fire is used as a combustion s &gt;&gt; that you get around it. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you &gt;&gt; you'll catch fire. &gt;&gt; Amen. Same thing happens to a person today. &gt;&gt; If you come into the presence of God, &gt;&gt; it'll change you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what I desire as a pastor to see each one of you &gt;&gt; not to experience God through knowledge, &gt;&gt; through learning, &gt;&gt; huh, through teaching of good ministries. Nothing wrong with that, &gt;&gt; but that'll just cause you to be religious, &gt;&gt; to conform, &gt;&gt; TO WEAR A DRESS WITHOUT A message &gt;&gt; that it is holiness to you. &gt;&gt; It's just a long dress. &gt;&gt; Fact, the Muslims got us beat. Y &gt;&gt; if covering completely makes you holy, why then you ought to wear a burka and just have this little thing like that and walk around. Huh? So you don't even show your shoes. &gt;&gt; So it's not the dress that makes you holy. &gt;&gt; You brethren, it is not your walk with GOD ON HOW GOOD YOU keep the commandments that makes you RIGHTEOUS BEFORE GOD. BUT IT'S WHEN GOD REVEALS TO YOU from his word &gt;&gt; AND YOU START WALKING IN THE REVELATION THAT GOD GAVE YOU, GOD SAYS THAT'S RIGHTEOUSNESS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And he receives it. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; absolutely. &gt;&gt; Fire represents his voice. God always speaks from the midst of fire. &gt;&gt; Not to give them some show or some kind of entertainment &gt;&gt; or make them get emotional jumping and shouting, though there's nothing wrong with that. In fact, Brother Bram said, "I'd rather have a little wildfire than no fire at all." &gt;&gt; He says, "Show me a church that's popping and jumping." And he says rather than one who's cold for formal and starchy and just sits there frozen to death. &gt;&gt; I think Ernie Villain Noea Villan Noeva labeled them the frozen chosen. &gt;&gt; God don't ever let us yet to become cold and formal. &gt;&gt; Having a form. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. I sat around the fire one time as a young boy and we we had the little hot dogs and we had the marshmallows and we put them in the fire with a coat hanger. You know, you've all done that. And had the coat hanger. When I got done, I had no more marshmallows or something. So, I just played around poking that thing into the fire until I got that the end of that thing red hot. &gt;&gt; Any of you ever done that? I got the thing red hot and I reached over and touched my buddy's arm just to see what it would do. He moved. All right. He's still got a scar. I I branded him. Look what you did to me years ago, man. I still got it. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, [laughter] if God ever touches you &gt;&gt; with a fire from off of the coal, YOU'LL BE BRANDED. &gt;&gt; IF HE EVER TAKES THAT FIRE FROM OFF OF THE ALTAR AND PUTS IT UPON YOU, &gt;&gt; YOU'LL NEVER BE THE SAME. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Fire represents his voice. &gt;&gt; 33 times in the Bible, it talks about the pillar of fire and it talks about the voice of God from the pillar of fire. God spoke to Moses from the midst of the fire. And Moses's mind, body, and soul was being cleansed. &gt;&gt; It was being purged by fire. Nothing more cleansing &gt;&gt; than the fire of God. &gt;&gt; It was not speaking theological seminary. &gt;&gt; It wasn't the education of man. It wasn't some ecclesiastical bylaws and things that he had learned in school and made into dogmas and traditions, &gt;&gt; but it was God speaking from the midst of the fire. &gt;&gt; I'll show you this in Deuteronomy chapter 4. Follow along with me. Deuteronomy 4 verses 11- 15. And ye came near and stood under the mountain. And the mountain burned with fire in the midst of heaven with darkness and clouds and thick darkness. And the Lord spake unto you out of the midst of the fire. You heard the voice of the words, but you saw no similitude. Only you heard a voice and declared he declared unto you his covenant. So this voice is speaking. It's got a purpose. God speaking from the midst of the fire. And you've heard it. You didn't see a similitude. LET ME TELL YOU, GOD works in supernatural realms. He real. He he he can do IT WITHOUT YOU SEEING HIM. &gt;&gt; And yet he can speak. &gt;&gt; He declared unto you the covenant which he commanded you to perform, even ten commandments. and he wrote them upon the tables of stone. And the Lord commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments &gt;&gt; that you might do them in the land whether you go over to possess it. So there's a purpose in this voice. &gt;&gt; Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves, for you saw no manner of similitude on the day that the Lord spake unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire. And the Lord thy God is a consuming fire. In fact, the word consuming fire is used three times in scripture. Two times the Old Testament, once in the New. Out of heaven, he made thee to hear his voice, that he might instruct thee. So there's a purpose for you to hear that voice. is for instruction. And he showed thee his great fire, that thou heardest his words out of the midst of the fire. God speaking to them not in an earthly voice, but a heavenly out of a out of a consuming fire. And Jeremiah saw this fire one time and it affected him. Jeremiah 20:9 Then I said, I will not mention of him, nor speak anymore of his name, but his word was in my mind &gt;&gt; as a burning fire &gt;&gt; shut up within my bones. &gt;&gt; It affected him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to ask you, has the word of God &gt;&gt; in your life affected you so much that it shut up within your bones? &gt;&gt; That you HAVE A FIRE INSIDE OF YOU. In prehistoric days, I just saw a documentary here a while ago that within every prehistoric tribe and different thing, they had a keeper of the flame. &gt;&gt; And he was an important guy because when they moved camp, you better take the fire with you. And he didn't have matches. They didn't have a simple way to start a fire. So he had to take coals and embers with him wherever he went. I think that's like each one of us. &gt;&gt; No matter where you go, &gt;&gt; you better take something with you that you can get warmed up by and start a fire. &gt;&gt; In every church, there should be a keeper of the flame. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lest the glory of God Huh? &gt;&gt; That the light of Israel should be snuffed out. &gt;&gt; The fire had started something inside of him. And the same substance that was burning within God was now that flammable mixture that was laying within Jeremiah. And he said, "I've got a fire shut up in my bone. I want all of you to know that I since a young man at 18 years of age. &gt;&gt; I've been deeply affected. &gt;&gt; It wasn't just hearing a tape, &gt;&gt; but it was hearing something beyond that voice. &gt;&gt; Amen. something that ignited inside OF ME THAT I COULD NOT QUENCH IT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; OH, I TRIED TO RUN from it. &gt;&gt; I didn't understand it, but there was something that affected me. &gt;&gt; And may I say this to all of you, it still affects me. In the sermon perseverant, brother Bram said Moses had come in the presence of God heard his voice. A miracle sign. He knowed he was a consuming fire. And here he is in the pillar of fire back in a bush. All of his education, all theology left him. And he knowed one thing. There was a God. And he had his orders. And a crooked stick was good enough. He'd been in the presence of God. Don't even make any difference how many trained men in Egypt had any of the things didn't mean a thing to Moses. He had been in the presence of God and he was persevering. He's going down to take over against shields and trained men by the tens of thousands with a crooked stick IN HIS HAND. STOP him if you can. &gt;&gt; There's nothing can stop him. &gt;&gt; He did it. He went down and took over because he [snorts] was perseverant when he absolutely knowed he would been in the presence of God. He had heard the voice OF GOD OUT OF THE presence of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not only the voice was, but it was a scriptural voice. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THERE'S ALL KINDS OF VOICES. CHECK it with the word. &gt;&gt; The voice said, "I am the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. I made a promise I would deliver these people. &gt;&gt; The time is at hand. &gt;&gt; I've heard their groanings. I I've seen their task masters burdening them. And I remember my promise. I am come down to deliver them &gt;&gt; AND I'M SENDING YOU &gt;&gt; to do it. &gt;&gt; That's good enough. He seen his glory and away he went. The fire was now ignited inside of Moses. &gt;&gt; It was burning all of the education, all of the complexes, &gt;&gt; all of the religious things that he had learned and all the ways of war and all the things he had learned in the house of Pharaoh. Now God took him because the 40 years under Pharaoh had to be unlearned in 40 years in the backside of the desert. Understand this. For every year of wrong teaching, everything that you learned as a Catholic or whatever religion that you were being raised up, it'll take that many years of correct teaching just to bring you to balance. And then you start learning because be up until then all the years that you had learned you have to unlearn. Wow. Some of you got a long ways to go. Others of you listen I I thank God I wasn't and I I say this humbly. I wished I would have had believing parents. I wished I would have had parents that were Christian but they were not. wasn't raised in church. We didn't read the Bible. I asked my father one time, "Why don't we go to church?" Ah, church. That's for losers. That's for weak people. Look at them. He said, "Do any of them look happy when they go into church?" And I have to be honest. &gt;&gt; Look at the people walking in. Most of them got their butt. Huh? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come on, man. &gt;&gt; Get happy. &gt;&gt; You're never going to WIN SOMEBODY WITH A FROWN. &gt;&gt; GET HAPPY ABOUT WHAT YOU BELIEVE. THANK GOD FOR WHAT WE'VE GOT. THIS MESSAGE IS THE GREATEST THING. &gt;&gt; DON'T BE ASHAMED OF IT. TELL SOMEBODY. YES, &gt;&gt; SIR. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; GOD SENT A PROPHET &gt;&gt; VINDICATED of God. &gt;&gt; SIGNS FOLLOWING. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Hebrews 1:7. And the angel he saith who maketh his angel spirits and his ministers a flame of fire. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As I told the visitor that Amos brought to church the other day, I said, "We're dangerous people. &gt;&gt; We start fires." Amen. &gt;&gt; You get around us, &gt;&gt; it may rub off on you because if you're combustible, &gt;&gt; there might be a spark because you know what? I believe that we ought to be on fire for God. &gt;&gt; Sometimes fires pop. Little spark, huh? Sit down next to a believer and he's just excited. Hallelujah. MAN, YOU KNOW WHAT GOD DID FOR ME THE OTHER DAY? OH, YEAH. MAN, &gt;&gt; what's the matter with you? You a fanatic or something? Yeah, I am. &gt;&gt; I don't mind admitting IT. I AM A FANATIC. I SERVE GOD IN THE WAY THAT MOST MEN CALL HERESY. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Don't get too excited. &gt;&gt; You know, settle down. &gt;&gt; Relax. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We're in church. Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; Don't get too excited. Well, I'll tell you what. If a spark fell on you right now, &gt;&gt; huh? You ever sat around a a campfire and all OF A SUDDEN POP POP LIKE THAT AND TWO or three SPARKS FALL ON SOMEBODY? YEAH. YEAH, MAN. &gt;&gt; That's hot. &gt;&gt; It'll make you move. That's true. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; The fire was purging Moses from everything that he had learned formerly. &gt;&gt; When God spoke to Saul on the road to Damascus, he saw a pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; Now remember I told you wherever you see the pillar of fire, watch for his voice. He said, "Lord, Lord, here is a Jew." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; A Pharisee of Pharisees &gt;&gt; concerning the law blameless. &gt;&gt; And he says, "Elohim, who art thou?" He said, "I'm Jesus, whom thou persecuted?" &gt;&gt; I want you to understand that all of a sudden, God had to take his eyes and blind him to open his spiritual eyes. Sometimes God has got to take you and turn you upside down &gt;&gt; from everything you knew and what you BELIEVE TO SOMETHING SO DIFFERENT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THAT ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU'RE NOT WALKING BY SIGHT ANYMORE. YOU'RE WALKING BY FAITH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND CALLING THOSE THINGS that are not as though they were. &gt;&gt; THIS IS NOT the power of positive thinking. This is power in believing the word is greater than the symptoms you're going through. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; God spoke to Paul from the midst of the fire. The voice was revealing something to Paul. All of his theology now became dunk &gt;&gt; that HE MIGHT KNOW CHRIST AND him crucified. It was a voice that spoke out of the midst of the fire. His soul caught fire that day. And guess what? He now became so zealous for God. The things that he once hated, now he loves. &gt;&gt; Fiery sermon proceeded out of his mouth and he caught places on fire everywhere he preached. GOD, GIVE US MINISTERS THAT DON'T GIVE US SOME flowery sermon about God's love and he loves everybody AND EVERYTHING. GOD, GIVE US MINISTERS THAT'LL STAND BEHIND THIS SACRED DESK THAT'LL PREACH WITH FIRE AND TREMBLING, &gt;&gt; A CLEANSING AND A PURGING FIRE. &gt;&gt; God spoke to the disciples on the day of Pentecost and fire fell on each one. When a messenger comes on the scene, his words will cause souls to catch fire everywhere he speaks. Revelations 4:E 5 says, "And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices, and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which were the seven spirits of God." SO WHEREVER YOU FIND the pillar of fire, you better be listening because there's a voice coming out of that fire. &gt;&gt; We know the Bible says in Malachi 3:6 THAT I THE LORD GOD CHANGE NOT. &gt;&gt; People change, FASHIONS CHANGE, &gt;&gt; TIMES CHANGE, GOVERNMENTS CHANGE, churches change, but God does not change. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hebrews 13:8 said Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; He doesn't change. &gt;&gt; If God is the same as he's always been, then we know he's constant. &gt;&gt; He's an absolute. &gt;&gt; What he hated back then, he'll hate now. &gt;&gt; What he loved then, he will love now. Numbers 11:es 1-3. And when the people complained and it displeased the Lord because I want to show you that the voice that speaks from the fire sometimes represents judgment and displeasure. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when the people complained and it displeased the Lord and the Lord heard it and his anger was kindled and the fire of the Lord burnt AMONG THEM AND CONSUMED THEM, they were in the uttermost parts of the camp. kind of like the uttermost people within the message &gt;&gt; that never come all the way in. &gt;&gt; They just stay on the uttermost. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; They like to sit on the back row. &gt;&gt; They want to sit near the door. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Some of you have never sat up front. &gt;&gt; Get close. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What are you afraid of? &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah. &gt;&gt; God forbid you catch on fire. &gt;&gt; Come on, BROTHER. &gt;&gt; LAY DOWN AND ROLL. &gt;&gt; YEAH. COME ON. &gt;&gt; MAN, &gt;&gt; somebody needs this this morning. A lot of times you've been under some lukewarm condition &gt;&gt; trying to get warm by painted fire &gt;&gt; and you got that plastic smile. God is so good. &gt;&gt; Don't you just love him? I'm so happy I'm here today. Let's all sing When We All Get to Heaven. Sh wind. I want something real. &gt;&gt; You know, WHEN SOMEBODY SINGS FROM THEIR HEART, DO YOU KNOW most songs &gt;&gt; that really have an effect were were birthed &gt;&gt; under A BAPTISM OF FIRE OF FIERY TRIALS. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That song that Justin sang this morning is one of my favorite songs. I want to know when believing isn't easy. &gt;&gt; WHEN THE MOUNTAIN TOPS JUST A MEMORY, &gt;&gt; it's just long ago. I I've been through the trial. &gt;&gt; Why is it I can't seem to climb above this? Oh, but the day will come you just hang on because you know what? &gt;&gt; Faith will become your victory. &gt;&gt; In fact, I was up in the Cloverdale area here just a few months ago and brother Dalton Harp who wrote that song. We were just sitting around with a bunch of couples and young kids and everything and I said, "Uh, Brother Dalton, you are here and you're one of my most favorite singers." And I said, "Would you would you sing us a song?" And he said, "You know," he said, "I made a promise to God years ago that whenever anybody asked me to sing, I would sing for his glory." He got up and he sang that song, "When believing ain't easy." and his wife was going through a trial and she was she was sick unto death. And so this song was birthed out of the trial. I'm losing my wife. She's 20 some odd years of age and I got several kids and I'm losing her. When believing isn't easy. when the mountain top and see is it's not hard to believe when skies are blue, &gt;&gt; money in the bank and &gt;&gt; your health is good and everything is going right. &gt;&gt; But what about when all of a sudden all hell breaks loose around you &gt;&gt; and you're getting tested? &gt;&gt; Do you really BELIEVE THAT? WHY? WELL, IF GOD REALLY LOVED YOU, WHY WOULD HE let you go through this? &gt;&gt; Maybe he don't love me. Maybe he hasn't heard my prayers. Oh, I I guess I guess I'm just not one of them. &gt;&gt; No. Let me tell you, God does it for a purpose. THERE'S NOTHING BUT WHAT YOU GO THROUGH, BUT GOD HAS GOT A PURPOSE IN IT. IF YOU'LL QUIT LOOKING AT THE PROBLEM AND LOOK AT THE PROMISE, &gt;&gt; I WILL BE WITH YOU. ALL THINGS WILL WORK TOGETHER FOR THE GOOD. I'M NOT SEEING THE GOOD. THAT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE PROBLEM. &gt;&gt; WHEN GOD GETS DONE WITH ME, &gt;&gt; I SHALL COME FORTH &gt;&gt; AS PURE GOLD. &gt;&gt; Tried in a refiner's fire. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. In numbers 11 verse 1-3 and the people complained, anger was kindled and fire of the Lord burnt among them and consumed them. And the people cried unto Moses. When Moses prayed unto the Lord, the fire was quenched. And he called the name of the place Taborra because the fire of the Lord burnt among them. Either get happy or get consumed because of your complaint. Leviticus 10 1-3 through 1 through 2. And Nab and Abaiu, the sons of Aaron, the high priest, the sons of Aaron, took either of them his sensor, and put fire therein, and put incense thereon, AND OFFERED STRANGE FIRE BEFORE the Lord. which he commanded them not. And there went out fire from the Lord and devoured them and they died before the Lord. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Sometimes I think these doctrines that are being conjured up among the ministry today &gt;&gt; that THEY ARE SAYING IS THE FIRE of God, &gt;&gt; I think it could be labeled strange fire &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IF THE PROPHET DIDN'T SAY IT, if he didn't point to it, IF HE DIDN'T SHOW YOU THE THE RESULTS OF A REAL REVIVAL OF GOD AND THEN YOU GOT TO WORK SOMETHING UP, I THINK YOU GOT STRANGE FIRE IN YOUR SENSOR. I heard a brother preach the other day and he said, "I'm afraid today we got all this substance abuse and we got people that got all kinds of problems and today we have addicts that just want relief from their addiction." And he SAID, "SO WE HAVE MESSAGE METHADONE. We just go ahead and have a prayer line. It don't matter the life they're living. THEY'RE NOT PREACHING AGAINST THE LIFE that they're living. You just come up here. I'll tell you what, I'll pray over that devil. I'll cast him out. Yahoo. [screaming] &gt;&gt; And so they have message methodone. Come up here and get a little fix and kind of a little hypo for the moment and for the next two weeks. Yeah. Yeah. and you become addicted on the next &gt;&gt; time for a prayer line &gt;&gt; because that's the only way they can get relief. &gt;&gt; Well, I tell you the best way to get relief is repent. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; God, help us in these meetings &gt;&gt; to tell people repent. Amen. &gt;&gt; Repent with a conviction. &gt;&gt; Repent enough to get you to &gt;&gt; give back the tools you stole from your boss five years ago. I had a surfboard given to me by a brother who stole it from the company I worked for. And it was a nice surfboard, I tell you. Had a rainbow and three moons on it. And this this this was a hot little board. I love that thing. And I kept it and I knew it was stolen. And never told the boss and I kind of put it away and said, "Well, you know what? Look, he's got lots of money. Look at that." And so anyway, I I get converted years later. And I hear brother Ram say you make right those things that and I thought throughout my whole life I thought what is there anything I've done that I take some something from somebody I didn't make it right his name was Don Hansen of Hansen Surfboards you know what I did I wrote him a letter I said hey Don I'm sorry I want you to know they had a surfboard that was stolen from your surfboard shop and was given to me. And I knew it was stolen. And because I didn't steal it, I allowed him to give it to me. I justified it. And I want you to know, Don, I am sorry. And the surfboard was sold for $75. And I'm sending you the $75. And I say, "I'm sorry. You forgive me." I thought, "Man, I'm going to get me a blistering letter and he's going to tell me you this and that and don't you ever come." No. You know what he did? He said, "Thank you." He says, "Thank you." That you had the stamina and the guts to make what? Make something right. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it is hard. &gt;&gt; Very hard. I want the Holy Ghost to move within our lives enough &gt;&gt; that'll cause you to go back to things &gt;&gt; that you justified and you've been trying to get over and you can't. You know what? Go make it right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know what he said at the end of the letter? If you ever want a job, you are more than welcome to return. God, give us &gt;&gt; real Holy Ghost conviction &gt;&gt; that when we repent, &gt;&gt; WE MAKE THINGS RIGHT. WE DON'T JUST DON'T SAY IT, &gt;&gt; but we manifest it in our lives, [snorts] &gt;&gt; Ezekiel 22 19 and 22. Therefore, thus sayith the Lord God, because you are all become dross, behold, therefore, I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem. And as they gather silver and brass and iron and lead and tin into the midst of the furnace to blow fire upon it to melt it, so I will gather you in my anger and in my fury. I will leave you there and melt you. Yay, I will gather you and blow upon you in the fire of my wrath. And ye shall be melted in the midst thereof. And as silver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so shall ye be melted in the midst thereof. And he shall know that I, the Lord God, have poured out my fury upon you. Dross. Do we have any dross? Any wasteful material in our lives that God says you don't need it? I looked up the word dross. It means a waste product of impurity formed on the surface of molten metal. The unusable portion left over when making metals. Well, what if God is purging you and he's melting you and you've got this dross in your life? God, help us get the dross out. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's nothing like the refiner's fire. There are sometimes in our lives dross that comes up that is impurities that needs to be purged. And the best thing that God can do for your life is to purge it with fire. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Proverbs 17 and3 the finding post is for silver and the furnace for gold and the Lord tryth the hearts. I want you to ask yourself right here. Judge yourself right now. Lord, do I have any draws within my life? Is there anything in my life that is holding me back? Is there any impurities? Are there any doors within my home that I've kept locked? And you're not allowed to go behind. Isaiah 48:10, "Behold, I have refined thee, but not with silver. I have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction." &gt;&gt; Do you know that some of you go through afflictions that are self imposed? &gt;&gt; You cause it yourself. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going through such a hard time. I wanted that big house. I wanted a new car. I wanted that new job. I wanted TO BE THE BOSS OF THE JOB. And next thing you know, man, I tell you what, you got a wild cat by the tail AND YOU'RE WONDERING, "HOW DO I GET RID OF THIS THING? &gt;&gt; Give me some relief because I'm going crazy." Just about the time that you get ahead of the rat race, along comes a faster rat. &gt;&gt; It's true, man. &gt;&gt; Just about the time you got things kind of controlled, here comes something bigger, faster. 1 Peter 1:7 that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth though it be tried with fire might be found in the praise and honor and glory the appearing of Jesus Christ. Watch this. Now, brother Brown said in watching his star 1959, may I say tonight that God has a sign today. &gt;&gt; It's a sign of his spirit. &gt;&gt; That where Jesus is, there's life for he is life. &gt;&gt; Where Jesus is, there's gospel life for his light. Where Jesus is, there is fire. Amen. &gt;&gt; For he is a consuming fire that burn up all your unbelief and your draws. &gt;&gt; 1 Peter 4:es 12-13. Beloved, think not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing happened to you. But rejoice in as much that you are partakers of Christ's sufferings, that when his glory shall be revealed, you may be glad also with exceeding joy. Also, fire means not only judgment and displeasure, but it also means acceptance and approval. Was it not there in first kings with Elijah on Mount Carmel? The Lord spoke through Elijah to the people, I and I only remain a prophet of the Lord. Pretty bold statement. I and I alone remain a prophet of the Lord. And there are 450 men. Let them themselves give two bullets. Let them choose one bullet. And it goes on and on. let you call on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the Lord God, and the God thatth by fire, &gt;&gt; let him be God. And the people said, it's well spoken. So there in verse 37, hear me, oh Lord. Hear me that these PEOPLE MAY KNOW THAT THOU ART THE LORD GOD, that thou has turned their heart back again. Look at it. Here's that spirit of Elijah &gt;&gt; turning hearts back again. How's he doing it? And then the fire of the Lord fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice. &gt;&gt; The wood, the stones, the dust licked up the water and the people said, "The Lord, he is God." Was it not there in Judges chapter 6 where Gideon was there before the Lord and he said in Judges 6:1 17 he said unto them if now I have found grace in thy sight then show me a sign that thou talkest with me. Show me a sign. I want to know it's you talking. Depart not then I pray thee, and till I come unto thee, and bring forth, and he goes on and on. Verse 21, the angel of the Lord put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand, touched the flesh, the unleavened cakes, and there rose a fire out of the rock, consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes. Then the angel of the Lord departed out of his sight. And when Gideon perceived that he was an angel of the Lord, Gideon said, "Alas, oh Lord God, for because I have seen an angel of the Lord face to face." I want all of you to understand, me, too, musicians, if you come because I know I'm not going to finish this. &gt;&gt; How many of you can say, "I've seen an angel of the Lord." face to face. &gt;&gt; I've heard him preach and when he preached his sermons, they were sermons of fire. &gt;&gt; They affected me. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what, if you listen to tapes and you turn it on and you just hear and don't obey, &gt;&gt; it'll do you no good. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Turning on a tape without asking God to give you wisdom and understanding is no DIFFERENT THAN A CATHOLIC burning a candle &gt;&gt; and saying a prayer. &gt;&gt; Don't let the prophet do your religion for you. &gt;&gt; Okay, prophet, preach. &gt;&gt; Preach to me now. Turn on. Press play. Go to sleep. Wait a little bit later. Okay, I'm done. I I don't I don't have any more time. Okay, turn it off. I'll wait till I have more time. Then I'll turn you back on. You see what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; God help us. And I want I want to bring this down. I want to bring this down to today [snorts] because David had an answer by fire. Solomon had an answer by fire. We see that in the scriptures. And so 1909 and April the 6, there was a pillar of fire. Listen young people, this is not a story. &gt;&gt; This happened. &gt;&gt; There was a pillar of fire that came through a window at the birth of a little boy &gt;&gt; in a little log cabin in Burksville, Kentucky. &gt;&gt; 1916, the voice speaks as a commission. Don't drink, smoke, or defile your body in any way. For when you get older, I have a work for you to do. 1933 in June, Pillar of Fire appears on the Ohio River and speaks as John the Baptist was sent to forrun his first coming. You and your [music] message is sent to forrun his second coming. May the 7th, 1946. He says, "The very day, the very hour in which Israel became a nation, God met me down there in the cave in Greensmill and sent me out with this commission." He said, "Watch and be spiritual. You'll catch this. They're the two of them are connected together." Why? Because as the Gentile dispensation is closing, there's another one opening up with the Jews. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; January 24th, 1950, the pillar of fires taken above the head of the prophet. This wasn't a message believer that took the photos. In fact, it was a professional photographer hired to take photos to go against Brother Brenham. &gt;&gt; That's correct. &gt;&gt; And all the photos, snap, fast forward, snap forward, snap, snap. All the photos. There was only one photo. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; And the whole roll of film that showed up. What was God doing? Giving a sign. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is my prophet. Hear ye him. January the 8th, 1961, the pillar of fire draws on the wall of Brandham Tabernacle. He's preaching from Revelation chapter 4, the throne of mercy and of judgment, confirming the seven church ages or the seven lamps were burning with the fire and flames of God. In December of 1962, he has a vision of seven angels, constellation, he said, coming from eternity faster than a blink of an eye. In January of 63 in Sabino Canyon, a sword appears in his hand. Then I'm reminded of Isaiah 66:es 15 and 16. And behold, the Lord will come with fire, and with his chariots, like as a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire, and by fire, and by his sword will the Lord plead with all flesh. And the slain of the Lord shall be many. The fiery sword of the spirit was now placed in the hands of the prophet. Amen. &gt;&gt; In February of 1963 in a place called Sunset Mountain. &gt;&gt; My God. My God. &gt;&gt; You understand what God was doing? &gt;&gt; 63 Sunset Mountain February. pillar of fire descends and a prophet of God is caught up into a constellation of seven mighty angels. &gt;&gt; For thus saith the Lord, GO BACK TO JEFFERSONVILLE, for there I will give to you the revelation of the seven seals, not six, &gt;&gt; seven. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. So March the 17th through the 24th, 1963, Brother Bram starts with God in simplicity in the breach. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And there he begins to open, &gt;&gt; the sealed book. &gt;&gt; God begins to now purge this message with fire. take away all his former learning, all of the things that he had learned from Clarence Larkin and dispensational truths and now God purging this message with fire. So I I had a brethren, you brethren, just keep playing. It's okay. It calms the sheep. They they know they're going to be led out here pretty soon. They know they have a meal coming. I had brother DDA call him by call me the other day. In fact, several of Tim Hoffer's family called him and called him and said, "Brother Ron, would he does he have somewhere that he's ever told about that dream of being at the wedding supper?" I said, "Yeah, I've told it several times, but I don't even remember what sermon I I relayed the dream in what sermon. Can I take a few moments and share with you a dream I had? Sandy, I was about in my late 20s. You just come to the message. I wasn't very old. Didn't know a whole lot. [snorts] Excuse me. Now, when I tell a dream, [snorts] a dream is very, very personal. Does it make me anything special? just said, "God gave me this dream." And I dreamed and we were at the wedding supper. There was a table, Brother Brennham said, miles and miles long on each side. And we were all in white robes. And we had just gotten done with the supper, and supper was was ended, and we were all fellowshipping. And guess what? We were sitting across from the people in our age and the people we knew and we're all together and we were just rejoicing. My we have made it and we are here and the wedding supper and came time for the rewards [snorts] and one by one they began to say well brother so and so will you come forward for your reward? Now there was remember now you're in you're in eternity now time means nothing however long it takes and if there's a list from A to Z it doesn't matter you're just taking the time and here from the least to the greatest they begin to call each one forward will brother John or brother so and so will they come forward and each time a name is called whether it be a brother or sister you said oh God grant to them a great reward reward. Oh, I I know them. They Lord, THEY WENT THROUGH SO MUCH. GOD, just reward them abundantly and they went forward before the Lord in the throne. He placed a crown upon their head and they went back and sat down. And I remember that one by one, it just seemed to get greater, the intensity of the reward. and those that had served God. It seemed like the rewards were getting bigger. And I remember they called my name. I went forward. I went before the the Lord and he put a crown on my head. I felt the weight of the crown. It fit perfectly. I felt the velvet on the inside where it was placed on my head and I thought it fit so perfectly. How did he know my hat size? My hat size. He's God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so they placed the crown on my head and I I was thankful and I went and I sat back down and from one by one we all went forward and we got our crowns. And then it came time for the messenger of this age. And we all thought, "Oh, oh, God. If there ever was a one that's worthy of a great crown and a great reward, it's William Brandham." And we're all thinking, "Oh." And so they called his name, William Marian Brham. We all looked around and nobody moved. He's not walking forward again. William, Mary, and Brandon. And we're all, "Oh, God, what a reward." And he wasn't going forward. AND THERE WAS THE PEOPLE ACROSS from me that were sitting, David, that were looking behind me. [snorts] And so I turned to look and there he was walking away and the white robe of his crown or [snorts] excuse me the white robe that he was wearing I could see the muscles contorting in his back. They reflected that he was weeping. I could see it. And he kept walking away. And two brothers got up and one grabbed his one arm and the other and they turned him around and he had his head down and they brought him before the Lord Jesus and he said, "I'm not worthy." Now I told Billy, Paul and Joseph this dream. Billy Paul started weeping. He said, "Ron, you saw my daddy." &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "You saw my daddy." He said, "That's the way he was." He had his head down. He said, "I'm not worthy. I'm not worthy, Lord." And a [snorts] crown was placed on his head. And immediately, he didn't let it sit there. He took it off and he placed it at his feet. You know what I thought? Why didn't I do that as though I deserve some crown? As though I did something. WHY DIDN'T I DO IT? WHY DIDN'T I HAVE THE CHARACTER to say, "Lord, it's you." &gt;&gt; And he placed the crown at his feet. And guess what we all did? We got up one by one. And we placed the crowns at his feet. And [snorts] as the crowns began to multiply around the throne, the throne had to get elevated. Why? Because it would have buried the throne. You understand? And so it it elevated until there was just thousands upon thousands of crowns. And brother Brandham said, "I'm not worthy, oh Lord, and laid his crown." We all began to think, and I thought at that time, why didn't I think of that? One day I believe that we will fulfill this vision. And probably none of us will remember that when brother Brennham lays his crown, we'll have thought, why didn't I do that? But at that time we will follow our leader and we will do as he does. &gt;&gt; We laid our crowns around his throne. His throne began to get elevated. Now when he was here, the Lord Jesus was here in the [music] flesh. He was the prince of peace. He was a man acquainted with grief and sorrow. He was meek and lowly. Not now. Not now. He was king. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was king Theophony. He was king Jesus. And he sat there as a royal a king upon his throne and it got so big until THIS THRONE GETS HIGH AND LIFTED UP. And there he was. And finally he stands up. And when he does, he looks DOWN AT ALL OF US and we're worshiping him. and the train that of his robe. He grabs it and he grabs that train and as he does he makes a big sweep like this [snorts] and when he does all of a sudden he goes into like an atomic blast. He was God. He was all omnipotent God. HE WAS ALL POWER. HE WAS ALL LIGHT. AND ALL OF US, WE LOOKED AND THE LIGHT WAS SO BRIGHT, IT DIDN'T HURT OUR EYES, but we felt his his omnipotence, his his presence. And we said, "Oh, God. [laughter] Oh, God, you're God." And then we began to sing and we begin to worship God. And I've always love to see a good singer who knows when to sing and when to start and when you know like if any of you have heard the handles Messiah and he shall reign forever and ever and ever right all of the different parts and all of and they're all doing their harmonies and I started singing now here here's something that amazed me as I was singing I knew my part I knew I didn't have to wait for Okay, give me the lead when I didn't have to wait. No, I sang it. I sang it with with with with [music] everything that was in me. I knew my part. [snorts] And the four and 20 elders fell down before his throne. And around the throne, they begin to sing and WORSHIP AND PRAISE GOD. AND I TELL YOU, ALL OF YOU THAT ARE GOING TO BE THERE, YOU KNOW YOUR PART. AND WHEN YOU SING, THERE'LL BE HARMONIES and there'll be leads AND THERE'LL BE VOICES IN THE BACKGROUND AND hallelujah and he shall reign forever and ever. Hallelujah. All that I believe that very soon we're coming to the marriage supper. &gt;&gt; This is going to come to pass very soon. Now, because brother DDA said, "Brother Ron, if if you'll tell this dream," he said, "I'd like to play it for my my church." Okay, brother DDA, I've I've done this for you and for your people and for you, too. It makes me nothing big. I'm no big guy. In fact, it's almost hard for me to tell it because every time I tell it, I get broken up because I relive it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When I woke up that morning, there was Sandy next to me. We're just 20some years old. [panting] I said, Sandy, God gave me such a dream. Then later I told brother Billy Paul, brother Joseph, Billy Paul said, "Brother Ronnie," he texted me a little bit later and he said, "Brother Ronnie, if you don't mind, I'm going to tell this dream around the world wherever I go because what you saw was the character of my daddy." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So I just told you that this morning. So I I told brother DDA if I could fit it in and I knew I wasn't going to complete the sermon. So I will continue on with the God of fire &gt;&gt; on the next service. &gt;&gt; Would that be okay? &gt;&gt; God bless you. I appreciate each and every one of you. I want you to know that this message is to consume you. &gt;&gt; It's to affect you. If it hasn't affected you, you haven't met him yet. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You've just heard about him. &gt;&gt; You've heard the stories. You've just listened to all of the testimonies. Even as brother Johnny said, how many of you here have got lots of testimonies? We all do. because it is a time of testing. &gt;&gt; You're all going through it. &gt;&gt; This is the worst of all ages. And he chose the weakest of all to stand in the worst of times. Why? Because in our weakness, he's made strong. &gt;&gt; You love him this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. 1213. I got two minutes. Let's stand together. God bless you. I love you guys. [snorts] &gt;&gt; All right. What's the name of this song? &gt;&gt; Sometimes it takes a mountain. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Your soul [music] takes the mountain. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Sometimes the troules [music] together love is [singing] so [music] much stronger. than whatever [music] troubles me. Sometimes [music] it takes a help to trust [music] you and sing the course again. Sometimes it takes the mountain. [music] Sometimes the trouble see. Sometimes it takes a desert to get a hold of me. Your love is [music and singing] so much stronger than [music] whatever troubles me. Sometimes it [music] takes a mountain [music] trust you and me. [music] How great is our God.

Amen. &gt;&gt; We serve a mighty God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Warren, would you come and close our service in a word of prayer and ask a blessing upon the food as well? So, we're going to enter the gate along the east side of the church. We will direct you to one of the four serving lines. Seniors and people with limited mobility can go straight to the front and they will be directed to the far left table. There's seating inside the gym as well as outside. So, we're going to have a baptismal right outside and then after that we can make our way to the back and directed to the survey lines for the warrant if you would. Let's bow our heads. Father, we thank you Lord for your message this morning. Truly, Father, we need the fire from your throne, Lord, that will start from our hearts. Lord Jesus, we ask you, Lord, to let this fire burn every day, Lord Jesus. We want you, Lord. We cannot live without you, Father. So, Lord Jesus, bless Brother Ron. Bless the food, Lord. And I ask you to sanctify it. And Lord, we will have a good fellowship today, Father, while we partake the food. Lord, bless your people. May your may our Lord Jesus continue to guide us and lead us in the name of Jesus [music] Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, if you want to be dismissed, we'll go outside for the baptismal and then afterwards we'll circle around to the gym. Amen. You are dismissed in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat.
