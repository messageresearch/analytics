morning amen praise the Lord Brother Robert has welcomed all of our guests and so I don't want to take up any more time on that but I enjoyed the song specials they're always very very special I feel they're fitting I believe that they set a precedent many times for the presence of God to come and move in our midst amen uh Brother Lou Oster is also not feeling well and he sent me a note and said brother Ron remember me in prayer and so Brother Lou is not here this morning so we remember him um brother Brian Naidoo has sent me a note he said he is back in South Africa now and uh safely returned there he said he so enjoyed ministering to you how many of you enjoyed him ministering amen he said brother Ron what a response he and so enjoyed that Lord willing I like to have him back I like to have him uh how many services Ezra four yeah Ezra spoke it so shall it be written so shall it be done and uh we'll look forward to that amen and um uh brother Neil is still in a situation where we need to remember him in prayer remember all always that if you have a fall if you have a car accident if you have anything that that hinders your body usually three to four days after the fact is when you feel the worst huh usually the day after I don't feel so bad I kind of hit my hip and you know I can't hardly walk but two three days later whoa why on my body I tell you and so he's had major surgery and the devil's just coming and throwing this thing out but we will possess every gate we will go through the doctors calling Miracle Man and that's what we believe he is it will be Miracle upon miracle and there's been little issues that come up so do not I don't want to say that he's out of the woods yet I don't want to I want you to press the battle and hold him up and and we'll just continue to pray that the Lord will um continue to heal his body amen yeah I was there and in the room and the family was there with me last night and he was kind of in and out on the responses and uh yeah they had taken a CAT scan and and everything because they thought maybe it's a stroke or whatever but uh long story short I said brother Neil brother Neil uh do you know who this is he opens his eyes he goes brother I go yep that's it and I said do you know where you belong tomorrow morning I said you know I'm preaching I said you need there to be open the door so you know he uh he knows um his responsibility and we love him and he's been a great servant to this body and so we discontinued to hold him up in prayer now I've had a little thought and I did not get a chance to totally uh go into this so I'm kind of just uh taking it easy this morning if it's a short sermon all of you can say amen and you go eat your lunch a little early and you'll be thankful for that yeah so anyway Deuteronomy chapter 7 Deuteronomy 7 and then Numbers Chapter 22. just uh while you're turning I remember a time that brother heino bowdenkamp and I were sent to go and take the largest meetings they had had in the East block country ever assembled and this was just about two weeks after Chernobyl blew up and we are only yes 60 miles or so away from where Chernobyl was and as you all remember it sounded like there was a green Cloud over the area and radioactivity and everybody's glowing green and uh you know just contamination and that sort of thing and and um Brother Joseph Branham brother Billy Paul Brother Floyd Patterson had sent us in a couple years before to go and set up the meeting so we gone and set up the meetings Chernobyl blows up they call me brother Ron we can't come I said well you back then we didn't have cell phones you didn't have the faxes you there was only one landline in the whole city where they were having the meetings and it worked intermittently and so they said you're going to have to go in for us and let them know uh and I immediately said okay hey brother heino and I didn't even think about it hey you guys don't want to go but you'll send me you know but listen God will send you right in the middle of a war God will send you right in the middle of a green cloud and I don't care if you're in the will of God God will keep you amen and so we went there in the long story short we preached and his first convention I'd ever preached and this place was back and after about four days I had nothing nothing I mean out of gas can't find an anointed word in the scripture I told my my translator listen heino's gonna have to take the last service I'm out of gas do you understand yes yes and as it was brother Peter snagon the pastor there he said uh we're going to have brother heino get up this morning and so Hino got up and he he spoke just 20 minutes and and then he he sat down and I thought wow praise God we're going to get in the car and we're going to leave early and we got a 12-hour drive and I'm thinking all these things well the service didn't stop right there brother schnegon got up and he said thank you for the appetizer now we're ready for the main entree and bro and I you know I don't speak Polish but I hear that Ron Peterson that really and I'm thinking no no surely and so that my translator said brother Ron they're asking you to now I said didn't you tell yeah yeah but okay here's what happened I never do this before nor since but I did Russian roulette with my Bible Lord wherever it falls open I put my finger to it I'll preach from there never had I ever preached from the book of Deuteronomy it fell in Deuteronomy chapter 7 6. through nine let's read for thou art and holy people unto the Lord thy God the Lord thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself above all the people that are upon the face of the Earth the Lord did not set his love upon you nor choose you because you were more in number than any people for you were the fewest of all people but because the Lord loved you but because the Lord loved you and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers hath the Lord brought you out with a mighty hand redeemed you out of the house of bondman and from the hand of pharaoh king of Egypt know therefore that the Lord thy God he is God the faithful God which keepeth Covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his Commandments to a thousand Generations oh that ought to put a smile on your face this morning give him praise this morning would you please come on now give him praise yeah amen amen God bless you you may be seated I'll continue reading but because it's a lengthy one I'm going to let you be seated turn with me to Numbers Chapter 22. numbers 22. verses 1 through 12. and the children of Israel set forward and pitched in the plains of Moab on this side Jordan by Jericho and balak the son of zippor saw all that Israel had done to the amorites and Moab was sore afraid of the people because they were many and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel now you all know the moabites are from uh the daughters of lot through an incestuous Union okay so they're distant relatives of Israel and Moab said unto the Elders of Midian now shall this company look up all that are round about us and as the ox licketh up the grass of the field and balak the son of zippor was King of the mobites at that time and he sent Messengers therefore unto Balaam the son of bior to pathor which is by the river of the land of the children of his people to call him saying behold there as the people come out from Egypt behold they cover the face of the Earth this guy's full of exaggerations and they abide over against me come now therefore I pray thee curse me this people for they are too Mighty for me per Adventure I shall Prevail that we may Smite them and that I may drive them out of the land for I what that he whom thou blessest is blessed in he whom thou cursest is cursed and the Elders of Moab and the Elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination look at that he's sending rewards of divination of sorcery in their hand and they came unto Balaam and spake on him the words of balak and he said unlim Lodge here this night and I will bring you word again as the Lord shall speak unto me and the princes of Moab Abode with Balaam and God came to Balaam and said what men are these with thee and Balaam said unto God balak the son of zippor the king of Moab hath sent unto me saying beholders of people come out of Egypt which covereth the face of the Earth come now curse me them per Adventure I shall be able to overcome them and drive them out and God said unto Balaam Thou shalt not go with them thou shall not curse the people oh for they are blessed amen don't you love God's word amen thou shall not go with him thou shall not curse the people for they are blessed I would like to title my sermon this morning and I'm hoping I can bring this thought together of looking at the backside of Israel and I want to take for a subject how can you curse what God has blessed now God has a love but his love is a elective love by God's foreknowledge he knew who would and who would not and God is omniscient and he is all-knowing therefore he could by foreknowledge no who would and who would not I want you to understand that it is God's elective love upon his people that set you apart it's not you it's not what you've done it's not what family you come through but it's God's elective love that's watched over you I wish you said a little bit of a precedent here as we go simonian Church age brother Ram said the cloudy skies and storms of life are no signs of God's disapproval get happy some people some of you you have all kinds of Cloudy Skies and storms of life but listen God does it for a purpose neither are bright skies in Stillwater signs of his love and approval his approval of any of us is only in the Beloved his love is elective which he had for us before the foundation of the world does he love us ah yes but how shall we know we shall know because he said so how many believe his word and if he told you he loves you believe it and manifested that he did love us for he brought us to himself and gave us of his spirit pleasing us as sons and she how shall I prove my love to him by believing what he said and by conducting myself with joy amidst the trials that he in his wisdom allows to come to pass amen now when we look at Israel coming out of Egypt and you can easily parallel God's love and Covenant with Israel with what he will also do with his bride brother Brenham so many times talks and parallels Israel and the church the 144 000 and the ten virgins he begins to show you the first Exodus and the last Exodus he begins to make these parallels so that you can see what God has done in the past he will also do in the future brother REM said the Old Testament is actually unfolded into the New Testament because you can see by the patterns in the examples because there's so many times in the New Testament it says as it was so shall it be it takes you back as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be so we understand that God keeps his word so what is it that makes Israel so special among all the people of the world isn't that an amazing thought God said look I've chosen you Israel not because you're the greatest not because of the works that you've done or the works that you will do but because I have chosen to love you I think that's something that all of us right now should accept the very fact that God loves you and that he gave himself for you just like he it wasn't you choosing him it was God choosing you but because he chose you he gave you a heart to want to follow him amen what made him so special they were chosen they are the ones that God chose they did not choose God but rather God chose them God's Love Therefore is an elective love it's God's choosing and not yours the theme of God's elective love is seen from Genesis to revelation a good example of that which I wish to highlight for a a bit during this service is the story of Jacob and Esau and when we look at the story of Jacob and Esau and with carnal thinking we look at that story and I think oh my I feel sorry for Esau Esau was a better man Esau in fact was loved by Isaac the Bible says and God love excuse me Isaac loved Esau but Rebecca love Jacob here are two Godly Parents that have children and here is a a man who serves his father he's going out he kills venison he comes back he brings it to his father and by all means of looking at it with a carnal mind Esau being the firstborn should have received the birthright but he really didn't have a desire there was something inside of him that maybe he took it for granted maybe he thought well because I am the firstborn therefore God owes it to me listen God don't owe you nothing God can change his hands God can give what you should have gotten to somebody else if you don't cherish you better cherish what God has chosen you for you better you better embrace the promises for you how dare you pass him off to another womb how dare you pass him off to another church how dare you pass them off to another bosom embrace it this morning and say I am the chosen of God brother Branham in a sermon in 1953 now listen to the title of this sermon the cruelty of sin and the penalty that it costs to rid Sin from our lives very good sermon if you want to go listen to that now for the sake of time I am going to just read the highlighted portions again I always tell you when I give you a quote it's not that I want to just take something out of context and I prefer that you go back and listen to the tape in its entirety but nevertheless Esau was the same Esau in his character was a better man than Jacob more of a gentleman he loved his father and the things he'd done but God chose Jacob somebody say Amen listen there are people a whole lot better than you don't sit there with a halo over your head thinking ah hey you know I am so predestinated I'm elected of God and everything and yeah you got problems I'll tell you what every one of you got a backside every one of you have got parts of of you and of your life that you want to keep covered and the only way you can keep it covered is stay under the blood because when you have a mediator when you have one that stands between you and the judgments of God because even as the New Testament says and some of you were fornicators some of you were adulterers some of you were backbiters but God rich in Mercy Hallelujah the follow along with this quote 1959 questions answers Esau a far better man than every way you wanted to take it than Jacob was now Esau God forgive me for this remark he was just a little sneaker that's all now if you notice him what was he a little tattletail and a big liar now if I'm saying wrong God forgive me but he did lie and a cheat there was never one like him hardly when he took them speckled sticks even put them in the water to cause those pregnated cattle and sheep over there to bring four speckled sheep and speckled cattle to get them on his own own hands how many of you remember that in the Bible what did he do he put Esau's coat on him and a piece of sheepskin everything else and went up there and impersonated Esau here he is going forth in deception before his blind Father which was a prophet that's right why he was a little shyster he really was ah now brother REM catches him and maybe I I have Honda said it that way see I I don't mean it that way I'll take that back I I don't know you know what he was you just think in your mind he was a great man of God and I don't want to say nothing bad about him God help us to have that same type attitude but fact is fact this is prior to this conversion but I'm just trying to point out little things that he did just look how sneaking he was liar sure he was he was terrible but what was he trying to do Esau cared for his father and made him Venison and Isaac loved to to eat some pottage that he had made for him from the Venison and Jacob was a shyster and a mama's boy and I have you to better understand this elective love let's go to the Bible to research what does the Bible talk about God's love and Jacob and Esau because we're using that as an example Genesis chapter 25 after the conception now here was two Godly Parents Isaac and Rebecca two Godly Parents have come together in a holy Union this was not uh Rebecca sleeping with another man getting pregnant and then coming to to Isaac but this is Isaac and Rebecca this is conception from one husband with one uh church with one bride you understand okay so now watch this I'm going to say this so that all of you understand there is a recessive gene sometimes in the lineage of Godly so as much as you want to claim every child is a child of God through holy parents it's just a matter of time the seed will manifest who's it's a okay not to take away any of you some of you say well I'm claiming my kids and everything and yeah they go they may stray but they can't stay I'm not I'm just saying you cannot change the seed now here we go Genesis 25. verses 23 through 28. and the Lord said unto her two nations are in thy womb two manner of people shall be separated from thy Bells and one people shall be stronger than the other people and the Elder Shall Serve the younger this is prophecy going for and when her days be delivered were fulfilled behold there were twins in her womb and the first came out red all over Harry Garman they called his name Esau and after that came his brother out and his hand took hold on Esau's heel and his name was called Jacob so Jacob was already fighting for the birthright he wanted to come forth but because Esau was Stronger he fought his way out and Jacob was gone I should have been there so they're they're already tangling up they're sibling rivalry and Isaac was three Square score years old when she bear them and the boys grew and Esau was a cunning Hunter a man of the field Earthly and Jacob was a plain man dwelling in tents you see the difference and Isaac loved Esau because he did eat of his venison but Rebecca loved Jacob now here is a godly man and wife that are showing favoritism to two different children oh dad loves you better well mom loves you more you ever had that in a family and boy let me tell you those kids will know how to play that on their parents or on their siblings understand something here Jacob could not help what he was because of his natural birth neither could you you can't change who you are and your nature until God gives you a nature change by a new birth Jacob his name meant supplanter Deceiver and according to Genesis 27 he stole the birthright because it was before his conversion at Pino remember he didn't get converted in Bethel he only had experiences in Bethel people have experiences in Bethel meaning House of God house of God experiences are lovely you can see Angels you can feel his presence you can come and know that my God this is an awesome Place God is here you can feel warm and fuzzy that don't change you you need an experience where you come and you meet God face to face and you come and you wrestle with him and I'll tell you what this message is worth wrestling god for you're not going to get blessed by this message by sitting back on a Pew and sitting there and just asking God bless me bless me you're going to fight for it if you don't want to fight for it it ain't yours step out of the way let somebody else have your right amen excuse me if it were not for election there's no way Jacob would have made it he was not saved by his Works he was saved by grace certainly Jacob would have been judged by God's Own law and found guilty of lying and stealing and to be no Liars and Steelers there in heaven Jacob according to God's Own law would not have made it so if we look at with carnal eyes at this story even how Rebecca in deception to her husband can you imagine sisters you ever done something that maybe you didn't tell all the truth to your hubby yeah don't don't raise your hand everybody will know but yeah you know I just don't so Rebecca she makes a deceptive plan because she wants Jacob to receive the birthright so there's something moving that's compelling her even if it's deceptive even if it's telling a lie Hey listen don't you ever judge a book by its cover everyone has a backside have you ever lied have you ever done something wrong you ever looked at something wrong you ever acted wrong you ever had somebody cut off cut you off in traffic and scream and use off-color words to you that shakes me up I have to let it go happen to me just the other day yeah hey I said Relax lady anyway just confessing our faults one to another it's good it's good I know all of you you don't have that I know all of you are really close to Perfection now but I know God is still working on me now watch this we must not look at things through carnal eyes because if we do we'll become critical and guess what there ain't nobody right but you ever seen somebody when they get that critical deal he's wrong he's wrong he got a wrong attitude that ain't good wrong attitude but me now it already shows you got a wrong attitude tell you what when you get close to God in the love of God you love everybody you're not trying to look for faults you look to the cross amen now hearing recognizing acting on the word 1960 Whenever there is a Revival it always produces twins that's a rude remark but it's true when there was a birth out from Isaac and Rebecca It produced twins when the world was created It produced twins two trees and when Cain and Abel were were born It produced two Ishmael and Isaac born one of them natural one of them of the Earth the other one Supernatural on one looked at the natural intellectual and the one walked by the spirit it's always been that way let me see this that's the way it is even with the intellectual ones who are trying to understand the word did you know that the children of this world are smarter than the children of the Kingdom of Heaven don't try to match wits with them Satan is the greatest sulfist do you know what a sophist is an arguer somebody that just likes to argue to to argue do you know anybody like that God help you if you do because you'll never win an argument with somebody who likes to argue I mean especially if they've got to get the last word anyway did you know brother Brown said it's usually the intellectual ones that are susceptible to demon spirits thank you Lord I don't have a problem in that area some of you I'm gonna I'm you thinkers you intellectual you got to try to figure it out be careful there's a demon lurking right around you trying to get into your thoughts trying to corrupt your mind trying to take you to figure this out brother Brown said listen when you got it all figured out you know one thing and that's that you're wrong so I don't need to got to figure it out all they got to do is believe it [Applause] now every time that we get an ism within the message and ism is a tangent it's a grafted in Vine it's a grafted-in branch every time we got it it's because somebody intellectual added their own opinion their own interpretation to the word of God and God is his own interpreter and so what they do is they say well uh let me give you an example I had a brother one time who he believed in return Ministry and so we sat down one time and I said please my brother I I really don't understand this concept of return Ministry what do you believe and he's he began to elaborate and he took several hours and when he got done and I said this my brother I said Thank you for taking the time to explain to me about I'll write this Trail again uh pray day and night for God to raise his Prophet um God uh watch uh I'm an early riser you know the quote brother Ram said you know I'm an early riser see see because he said he's an early riser he's going to rise up early he's going to be the first one and so therefore that means return Ministry do you see what I'm saying and so every quote that was given you have to stretch it and stretch it to the farthest of your imagination I mean brother Brahm said you know I'm an early riser because Billy Paul is lazy he likes to sleep in and I like to get up early he's not talking about Resurrection but you know all of this and so all of these quotes and I said well do you have scripture for it there's got to be scripture and really they have no scriptural foundation for the return Ministry and so what it is it's a man's intellectual carnal logical approach if the prophet didn't finish his ministry therefore he's got to come back do you see what I'm seeing and so understand that every time that you have an ism some kind of teaching within the message it's because what men try to do is put their own interpretation of the word of God and brother Brahm said God is his own interpreter leave it alone amen we know that to type with brother Branham in his ministry because in 1933 as John the Baptist was sent to forerun the first coming you and your ministry shall forerun the second coming so we have a type and Shadow perfectly of John is that right and John one day he came and saw uh the Messiah coming he was in the water and the Messiah came to him and he saw something Supernatural and he said Behold the Lamb of God which takes away he's already by Supernatural reasoning and understanding is looking at a man who's on the banks of the river in fact John said I don't need to baptize you you need to baptize me and he said John that it might be fulfilled you have needs to baptize me Hallelujah Behold the Lamb of God there he did not need to come when the resurrection of the Old Testament Saints after John was beheaded he didn't have to come up early and return back and tell the people Behold the Lamb he's already introduced the lamb keeps your types and shadows running now we're looking at God's elective love in the example of Jacob and Esau and let the scriptures now now let's go to Romans chapter 9. Romans chapter 9 for just a moment verses 11 through 16. for the children being not yet born wait a second before the child was born let me say this that before he was even conceived there was a plan in God's mind for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth it was said unto her the Elder Shall Serve the younger remember there are numbers 25 we just read that as it is written Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated what shall we say then is there unrighteousness with God forbid for he saith to Moses I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion so then it is not of him that willeth nor of him that runeth but of God that shows Mercy so it's God's elective love and predestinated plan that he had chose Jacob to be the recipient of God's love brother random uses the wording he said God knew you before the foundation of the world you were conceived in his mind he put an election and predestinated an ordained plan upon your life and there he slipped the wedding band of unmerited favor upon your finger so when you came into this world not knowing who you were why because you came down bypassing your theophany it's still in God's Eternal plan bypass the theophany but you were there in the mind of God you were there in the beginning you were there when Satan rose up and Lucifer preached his sermon and so many came onto his side but there were people that said we'll not listen we'll not bow we will keep God as our absolute and the prophet of God said it's God so loved to see those he lack seed tell Lucifer that they don't believe his plan and they took sides with God and brother Branham said there God so loved it that he took away your memory you don't remember and he gave you Amnesia listen to the sermon spiritual Amnesia and he sets you down here on Earth in Satan's Eden because the other happened in God's Eden and he says so I put him down here in Satan's Eden I erased it from their memory but he says there'll be some kind of things that will happen while they're down here that all of a sudden they'll be a little flash they'll be a little something little strike that seed and when it does the remembrance for just a moment we'll come back and you'll be jettisoned back into oh oh I just had a thought though Maya was so quickened by it let me tell you that quickening is what was quickening Enoch and he was catching Revelation upon Revelation until one time it's fled stepped into a revelation and it didn't come down Hallelujah this Revelation that is striking you now is gonna strike a place one time till this bride is going to be moved into section heavily atmosphere she will not come back to this earth you'll step right into the vision of the Rapture brother Brown said that's what the bride is waiting for for the revelation foreign you got nothing to do with this purging me in church age so Israel came up to the borders of Moab sent Messengers to the king saying we are brothers let us pass through your land if our people or animals eat or drink anything we'll gladly pay for it but King Bala got very excited the head of that Nickelodeon bunch was not about to let the church come through with its signs and wonders and divers manifestations of the Holy Ghost with their faces shining with the glory of God it's too risky he might lose some of his crowd so balak refused to let Israel pass through in fact so great was his fear of them that he went to an hireling Prophet called Balaam and asked him to mediate between him and God in petition the almighty to curse Israel and render them in potent and Balaam being eager to take part in political affairs God help us to stay out of politics within the message amen and become a great man and what's only too glad to do so but seeing that he had to he had to approach to and receive an audience from God to get the people cursed as he could not do it by himself and he went to ask God if he could have permission to go Now isn't that just like the nickel Layton's we have with us today they curse everyone that won't go their way continuing on paragraph 204. balak was very angry but there was nothing that Balaam could do about prophecy it had been spoken by the Holy Ghost so balak told Balaam to go down there into the valley look into their back parts and see if there was it possibly some way he could curse them the tactics that Billy used are the same tactics they used today big denominations look down at the little groups and anything they find amongst them to make out a candle they bring it out and shout it if the moderns live in sin no one says anything about it let me tell you let me stop there for just a moment big denominations are feel-good churches you can live any kind of life you want to live you sisters can cut your hair you can color it you can dress like Jezebel and guess what nobody condemns you no wonder people say when they oh my I left a message all them critical people around there and everybody talking about me you know why because you can get out there with those and they won't get critical at you they won't criticize you why because they're guilty too birds of a feather up flock together so now watch this but let one of the elect get into trouble and every paper blasted across the country yes Israel had her back carnal parts they had their side that wasn't praiseworthy but in spite of their imperfections by the purpose of God that works through election by grace and not by works they had the cloud by day and a pillar of Fire by night they had the smitten Rock the Brazen Serpent and the signs and wonders they were Vindicated not in themselves but in God let me stop here for just a minute let me just take away your Halo and understand that all of you have got a backside all of you have got things that are not praiseworthy all of you have got your mistakes and your failures and you know it and you don't want anybody to know what you've done wrong you don't want anybody to watch what you put on Instagram you don't want everybody to know what you watched last night what you were looking at on the internet what you were going through you don't want it put up here on the screen of your thoughts and the things that you said and the things that you have said about everybody hey some of you are liars some of you are hypocrites some of you are fornicators some of you are seducers but there is a smitten Rock there is a blood that covers you and how dare we look her self-righteous noses down that's somebody else if it weren't for the grace of God there go you which one of you are without sin which one of you can say I'm not guilty I haven't I can prove to you why even the Apostle Paul said concerning the law blameless he said a Pharisee of Pharisees and yet when God allowed him to come into the presence of almighty God and he saw the pillar of fire and he was cast to the ground he said Lord who are thou he said I'm Jesus and then Paul said oh my all of my religious teaching all of that former stuff is nothing but dung I've lost all things that I might gain Christ Paul said I was the chiefest of sinners you think he was lying you know Paul didn't expose all the things that he did wrong but him being a church age messenger and him speaking truth he said I was the chiefess of Sinner he says oh the things that I would do I do not the things that I would not do that I do oh wretched vile man that I am who shall deliver me from this body of death because in me lives no good thing except that God put it there looking at the backside of Israel looking at the backside of the Bride she has her hinder parts she has her things that she has done wrong but I want to bring you all back to understand God is not looking at faults and failures he's looking at the blood how many of you say it's blood because there's only one thing that stands between me and judgment and that's blood and every time that I do wrong and I ask God to forgive me and I put it under the blood guess what God don't even remember it's placed into the sea of God's forgetfulness but the problem is you remember you remember what you did you remember in the Satan is an accuser of the Brethren and when you forget he reminds you Romans 8 verse 33. who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justify it who is he that condemneth it is Christ that died yea rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of God who also make an intercession for us who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation sell distress persecution famine nakedness peril or sword all of these are terrible situations as it is written for thy sink we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter nay in all these sayings all these things look at that in Tribulation distress persecution famine nakedness in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for I am persuaded are you persuaded this morning then why do you doubt God's elect love when you're in distress when you're in persecution when you're in Peril when you're in nakedness when you're in the trials of this life you know what God Saul so fit and you to be worthy to be tested he had faith in you like he did job have you considered my servant job suffered so much in the flesh he said I cursed the day I was born it would have been better that I didn't come forth from the womb And yet when it was all said and done he said when God is finished with me I shall come forth a spherical and in my flesh I shall see him amen yes for I'm persuaded neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord Hallelujah I love him today now watch this in the Sumerian Church age now the Lord God Almighty says I know there he is walking in the midst of the people there he is the chief Shepherd of the flock but does he hold back persecution does he stem the tribulation no he does not he simply says I know your tribulation and I am not unmindful of your suffering what a stumbling block that is to so many people like Israel they wonder if God really loves them is God speaking to somebody here this morning I believe that sometimes distressed Peril famine issues trials sickness come through and there and it comes in and your mind becomes so trouble that you forget it does God really love me thank you how can God be just and loving if he stands by and watches his people suffer that's what it was asked in Malachi 1. verses one and three the burden of the word of the Lord to Israel by Malachi I have loved you who saith the Lord yet we say wherein has thou loved us was not Esau Jacob's brother saith the Lord yet I love Jacob and I hated Esau and laid his mountains in his Heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness you see they could not figure out God's love they thought that love meant no suffering they thought that love meant a baby with parental care but God said that his love was elective the proof of his love that no matter what happened his love was proven truly by the fact that they were chosen unto salvation because God hath chosen you to Salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth he may commit you to death as he did Paul he may commit you to suffering as he did job that is his prerogative he is sovereign but it is all with a purpose if he did not have a purpose then he would be the author of spray of frustration and not of peace his purpose is that after we have suffered a while we would be made perfect be established strengthened settled as job said he put strength in US you see he himself suffered he learned obedience by the things he suffered he was actually made perfect by the things he suffered now the Bible shows us from Genesis to Revelation all of the faults and failures mistakes lies adulteries issues of the elect is that right and thank God he does because God allows you to see that mankind has issues mankind has backsides but may we never not look at the smitten Rock may we always put our eyes to Calvary when we look at Israel in the natural why when you go through Genesis Exodus Leviticus Numbers Deuteronomy and you begin to see it it's just a matter of time and Israel makes mistake after mistake and golden calf and this and that and my oh my they just false and failures and yet he says I have loved Israel they are mine they're my elect they are my chosen I have chosen them I've put my elective love upon them the Bible says Those whom he did for no he did also predestinate because God is omniscient he's all-knowing he knows the end from the beginning he knows who will believe and who will betray him in the sermon the Seal of God 1954 I'm not condemning Catholic people I'm not condemning Protestant people for out of both and all of them comes the seed of God by election how many of you before you became a message believer were catholic raise your hand you were catholic you were raised up in the Catholic yeah raise your hand how many of you were Protestant yeah yeah how many of you were in some kind of denomination before you came to this and yet God rich in Mercy in all of them the system there is God's seed those who are ordained alive will see it and walk in it those who cannot see walk in darkness that's up to God God does it he swore and promised Abraham he would save him in his seat if you got Abraham's seed you got eternal life that's all on your heirs according to the promise and it's all by grace and by the election of God Grace and election go hand in hand with predestination both of which over emphasize may I play this side of the record for a moment any truth that is overemphasized will present a distorted picture well I'll tell you what you are so predestinated of God you are the elect you are the order hallelujah amen and fireworks and and people living in sin the doctrine of eternal security taught by denominations is wrong but there is a real Biblical truth about eternal security but let me show you what brother Brahm says in the sermon serpent seed Baptists come in baptize a couple people over here in immersing the preacher baptizes nine out of ten Smoked Cigarettes go back out stand out there play cards bunkle all night run around crooked business deals and all the women wearing shorts out there running around on streets bobbing their hair smoking talking a little stitching Soul parties telling dirty jokes you call that Christianity you think you've got eternal security you're going to hell like that you won't enjoy yourself in heaven in any manner certainly not that's not eternal security oh thank God that we had a minister come and take away the blinders of denomination off of her eyes and let us see the truth of God's word that don't mean you got eternal security don't you ever get that in your mind he talks about you Pentecostals because you jump them down spoke in tongues run around the aisle that don't mean you got eternal security your life your own life Bears out record that you're not right with God that's right you're not right that's not eternal security yet when you preach nothing but Grace you get nothing but disgrace when you preach that God is a god of love and he loves everything and everybody you're preaching a distorted gospel when you preach that there is no devil and there is no hell it's a distorted gospel election and predestination over emphasized our subject listen of over emphasizing that causes you to become lopsided in a way a man leans is the way he falls you see among the men a lot of message churches today the only way you can get people to jump and Shout is to just talk about election and predestination and being ordained and you've heard the voice of God and on and on and it becomes a little pep rally ain't that the truth yeah yeah people get excited over all kinds of things I went to a one of these I forget that these things where they would invite you and it was like Amway Amway you remember Amway and so they call um and they tell you and you can join us and it cost so much money and if you buy this product then you can get others below you and he'll make you hired and pretty soon you're going to be a Diamond Ambassador you make twenty thousand dollars a month money money money money and there was a woman come out of the back room and she had a tambourine money you know anymore when you take picture don't say cheese say money they all smile at money not at cheese it might be Limburger money what's money got to do with it let me tell you this I love this about this message brother REM said God don't want your money he wants you because when he's got you he's got your money is that right amen some of you are so tight huh some of you excuse me are so tight with the money that God gives you and you give so sparingly back you show me a man that God is blessing in many different ways I'll show you a man that pays more than he owes in ties because God says prove me well I you know I look I made fifteen hundred dollars I'm gonna pay right 150 bucks not 151 not 152 150. and that's after you have deducted well I had to buy a car I had to do this and I got this and that so it's an adjusted income yeah oh some of you are liars and thieves didn't it say it in Malachi how am I a liar and thief and you robbed me and your tithes and offerings now I'm not sitting here I'm just preaching you the whole word of God and if you can't handle that huh if that's stepping on your toes well so listen you can't say Amen say ouch it's the truth tithes is what you owe God offering is above and beyond you can't even give an offering until you've paid your ties is that right somebody say Amen somebody say go on preacher okay all right I just said it that's okay you told me to go on I will anything over emphasized huh how can you teach trigonometry to those who only know basic mathematics huh how can you teach the truth on predestination and election when they are such young believers the Bible says that strong meat belongs to those who are a full age who can understand it when you talk about election and predestination it's not for the new it's not for the young it is for the elected and those who are mature in Christ who can handle it it will not abuse it early spiritual experiences 1952 because the world makes fun of you because you've got something out there people criticize you they did the same thing about Israel didn't the false prophet Balaam thought surely that God would curse Israel because they'd done just as much as the Holiness as churches done today every unclean thing that could be done and could be done they did it every Balaam failed to see the blood on the altar he failed to see the atonement that was that was standing between Israel and here's where it is today people you were God called and chosen I am not ashamed to make myself with you I am numbered with you Hallelujah Israel and the church Balaam thought surely if Israel had done wrong they did do wrong they done everything in God's calendar wrong nearly but what Balaam thought that a holy God would surely curse of people that had done that much wrong he thought surely God will do it so when he got down there he was so much money crazy until he couldn't see what the reason that God wasn't cursing them and every time he tried to curse him he would bless him he threw out his prophecy like that and go forth and take up his mantle in his Parable instead of cursing it be a blessing fall back to them how righteous are they tense o Israel how great they was instead of cursing it was a blessing unconditional Covenant that God made with his people now stop here for a moment because this sermon title speaks volumes unconditional Covenant remember brother Graham says that God made covenants he made a covenant with Adam he broke it he made a covenant with Noah he broke it he made a covenant with different ones and down man cannot keep his Covenant with God so when he comes to Abraham he said Abraham it's not what you will do for me it's what I have done for you and unconditional now an unconditional does not mean that you go out here and you just live any kind of life you want to because you know it's unconditional no let me tell you the more that God shows you of his love and how that he gave you this Covenant the more you want to serve him he said if you love me you would if you love me you keep my commandment Peter do you love me yes Lord you know I love you Peter love us thou me yes Lord you know I know what Peter do you really love me and the Bible says and Peter being grieved in his spirit he said Lord you know I love you and he said feed my sheep he didn't say fleece my sheep he said he didn't say take advantage of my sheep he said feed my sheep that's what every Pastor is commissioned of God to do to go into that word and to find those golden nuggets and those little things huh that's so so uh illuminate you so Quicken you that when you hear it you say that's nothing but the truth and watch when you start lining up and see what I heard over the pulpit and what I have heard in my mind of what I've read in God's word and what God's Prophet have said I can say that's nothing but the truth and watch I tell you what we'll have a whole lot more of the Holy Spirit coming down and vindicating his word if you'll just line up and say that ain't nothing but the truth I may not understand it all but I believe it all somebody say that's the truth Israel in the church 1953 skipping a couple things here if you don't mind now before you became a Christian God called you before you became a Christian God called you not you calling God God called you now he called Abraham and he's the father of us all the faith now notice he said Abraham now it's election I I want to get on that election strong because it's the truth now you didn't become a Christian just coincidence because you become a Christian before you was in this world before you were born he adore he ordained you to be a Christian from the Garden of Eden from before the foundation of the world oh my God who am I this is not skim milk Saints this is for the advanced students the accelerated class second Thessalonians 2. verses 13 and 14 but we are now bound to give thanks away to God for you brethren beloved of the Lord because God hath from the beginning chosen you to Salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth where unto I called you by Our Gospel to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ you were born to receive the word of God for this hour my hands were made to help my brother my eyes were made to read God's word my feet were made to walk in his footsteps for I was born to serve the Lord oh I wish I could sing I would sing you that song I am that song I was born to receive this message no wonder when I heard the voice of Malachi 4 something inside of me said my God no man speak like this man it wasn't the voice of William Branham there was a voice Beyond the Veil there was something there was a picture within the picture one saw a man and another saw God and they were both right I ask you what did you see a reed shaking in the Wind Hallelujah first excuse me John 1 verses 12 through 13. but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of God you see he that believeth not is condemned already you see I don't believe it it's not for you it's for those who believe a couple more quotes and I'm going to close here this is a good one possessing the gates of the end they're all good they're all good it's like William William Andy says this is good stuff I believe it every time I put on a tape Sandy and I listen we go man that's good so that's espresso man that's a quad shot man [Music] yeah yeah when was the last time you had a quad shot and it just it just quickened you man hey you know you've been slumped over you've been having a hard day get a quad shot man man I'll tell you what bring it on buddy oh all right here's a quad shot now we see God cannot say anything or make any promises until unless he will fulfill it he has to do that in order to be God years later when the same people the promised people the seat of Abraham was on their journey into a Promised Land There was a gate who stood up against him and it was his own brother Moab who said you'll not cross my land I'll see to that you'll not cross my land if our cows lick any of our grass your grass or if they drink in your water we'll pay you for it he said you'll not cross the land but God's promise held true so they went got their Prophet Balaam and brought him down to curse the people and here's what he said they tried to show him the worst part of the Blessed seed but God showed him the best part of it he said ever who curses Israel shall be cursed and whoever blesses him will be blessed let me tell you how can you curse what God has blessed amen musicians if you come I'm closing passing up a cover culture the reason those that leave the message have to find fault with those that still believe in so they can release the pressure of the guilt they have from turning aside this one's a hypocrite this one said this this one why those people out there they're better Christians than these messaged Believers I beg to differ with you I'm sorry I take sides with Gods he left brother Brennan says he says I take sides with you I'm glad to be numbered among you huh because they they out there are they going to condemn anyone for cutting their hair wearing immoral dresses saying filthy things divorce and remarriage are they going to say anything about it no they just want numbers because numbers means money it's it's denominational and I defy anybody I don't care who it comes from you sit there and you wanna whether you put it down yeah I'll tell you what some of you you are hypocrites yeah some of you you are liars yeah some of you have done these things wrong but I'm not looking at your backside that's the critical way of Balaam I want to look at the better part I want to look and say oh yeah he did wrong she did wrong yes that was a hypocrite that's true but do we not all have a backside do we not all have a part we want to have it covered oh God cover me don't let people see my backside I want to be under the blood of Christ I want my Advocate I want my mediator I know all of you have your issues we all do [Music] somebody say Amen [Music] the Bible says in James 2 verses 10 and 11 whosoever shall keep the whole law and yet offend in one point he's guilty of all well I've never committed murder you ever been mad at your brother for Without a Cause foreign I've never committed adultery have you ever seen somebody enlisted [Music] I can tell you that there is not one righteous in Among Us we all have a back part but I'm not looking to that I'm looking to the smitten Rock I'm looking to Calvary I'm looking to the one who covers all my sins [Music] the Bible says that a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways I want you to all understand this and I bring this to a close and
