we're thankful for that Lord sometimes we don't Lord what you've already done and if we could just step into it as I was reading this morning and the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah and I remember brother Ron saying that means actually and the word of the Lord became Jeremiah Lord help us to become your word manifest it infl that once again you'd come down and walk the aisles and not just minister to us Lord but help us to minister one to another there are many needs here in this body Lord Lord but you have already provided and we thank you for that we thank you for those Lord that maybe this is their first time ever in this church I pray that they would leave realizing that there's something special about those people it's not this flesh Lord but it's what what's on the inside side Lord because you put a seed inside of there Lord that could be affected by your word and then if we would just put it in the right atmosphere Lord a little bit of water a little bit of sunlight that that seed would bring forth of its own kind Lord and Lord when that seed comes forth it's nothing that we can do to say look at what we are but it's something that manifest itself because you placed it there we thank you Lord we thank you for your word be with these needs Lord Lord you knew these needs before they were even pinned down you knew Lord that that that they would have need of

Mark forward just waiting on the teachers teachers okay should we do the vote then go ahead and do the vote okay all right come on up brother on oh I gotta go get you know what I'll get my microphone after this just use this one here amen God bless you all this morning I greet you in the lovely name of Jesus Christ amen um we are going to go ahead and take the vote now for different trustees and deacons that uh we had put into a position and yet we didn't vote on them because there's a trial period and just to let you know Joshua TR has been uh selected as and accepted or nomination as one of the uh trustees and so he's already in that acting position starting as of today and then we'll vote on that a little bit later but um this when you vote in a church just so you know it is for tithe paying members only if you're a visitor you don't have a right to vote brother Robert knows who pays ties and who doesn't therefore when he looks and it's going to be by majority vote in other words if it's well over 50% of the people there uh that vote for it and it's a vote of confidence now as you know you they're put into a trial period and remember that the deacons the trustees not so much but the deacons hold a very very high position they work in the spiritual matters within the church and their family that includes the wife and children okay the whole uh because how can a man watch over the of God if he can't control his own family so they're all held to a higher standard I want everyone to know who are in positions within our assembly that includes our M musicians that you're held to a higher standard okay and if you feel well I you know I just I have a hard time with that and and maybe uh you're vacillating with h some things in your life and you don't feel that you can do it it'd be better to just step down and just say hey I I can't because uh and when you are there before for the people uh the people are looking at you because you are are the standard within our assembly and uh so um let me see here so I think that's it brother Robert what we'll do uh if you would let's you can go ahead and okay so what we'll do is uh we the voot of confidence what we'll do is everybody your head we'll mention the person's name we'll vote on each individuals separately so we'll vote yay you lift your hand if there's a nay we'll put your hand but we'll kindly ask everybody everybody to keep their head down if you're a tight paying member this is your home Church the right to vote for these individuals so if you'll just bow your heads we'll mention the person's names everybody bow your heads first we're going to vote on brother Matt vaki as a trustee uh if you uh vote of confidence for him a yay if you'll lift your hands uh vote of no anyone have a no okay thank you next is uh brother Ethan Strayer he's a trustee if you vote yay for brother Ethan as a trustee please raise your hand okay thank you if you vote no please raise your hand at this moment okay thank you our first Deacon that we'll vote on is brother Pierre virist he's been serving years but we during Co we never had a chance to vote on him so today we're voting for him officially brother Pierre vquest if you would vote Yes lift your hand please thank you any knows raise your hand thank you brother Tim Hofer uh new Deacon if you vote yay please lift your hands any NOS lift your hand at

we had unanimous on everyone yes we did okay so those each of view five are officially accepted into your position by the voting of hands today so uh we welcome them to the team even though they've already the team and I think that's it we'll have Mark Come forward now for our Sunday school I'll be right and then brother Ron will be back to minister and then we'll have uh brother Neil come up but during the transition from brother Ron to brother Neil Greg's going to come up and sing the second song that uh um brother Neil has Reed question this morning amen good morning we could have all the Sunday School teachers come on up we were waiting for them to make their way in here so you're a teacher or a helper if to the front we just wanted to it's been a couple years since we've done this but we wanted to take a just a few moments know we've got a bit of a busy schedule this morning but we just wanted to introduce the teachers and the helpers to the congregation we have some new families in the assembly Sunday school is a vital part of what happens here every Sunday and I was just kind of checking on the classes this morning before the before the service you don't just show up and have somebody talking to the kids it's kind of a old machine I think we've got about 20 people that help out with Sunday school and I appre appreciate each and every one of them but uh just encourage the parents to have your children here by 9:20 the singing starts at 9:20 over in the the singing room and as well if you're a parent if you want to be sure to check the bulletin board in this hallway over here there's periodic updates from your teachers as so different things that are happening with the classrooms but we've we've got singing We the teaching of the word to the young ones we've got Vacation Bible School in the summer and there's a lot of things that happen so you just want to be sure to check that bulletin board for for updates also want to encourage the parents your children listen to Bible stories we we've got we've got some children really know their Bible stories some it's obvious they haven't heard any Bible stories but we do have the ability to listen to some really good stories online and there's some sign up information on the bulletin board so if your child hasn't taken advantage of that I would encourage you to do so and if you have any questions about what's going on in Sunday school perhaps taught please reach out and talk to the teachers or you don't feel comfortable doing that you can come and talk to me and try and take care of that just want to take a moment introduce everybody said singing starts at 9:20 and so the singing this year my daughter Lissa Zoe and sister an Lal there's Lissa right behind me they will be they'll

him to live at Birth he was brought home in a shoe box but powerful things come in little packages and he's quite a man and he was introduced to to the message in the late 60s by brother Robert beair and ever since that he came into the message our brother Bob Decker has been faithful and loyal to God and love God and uh a real witness for Jesus Christ so God bless you brother Bob we we love you buddy and may you have a blessed birthday today with your friends and family amen all right let's just remain standing 1st Samuel 8: 1-10 going to take about 10 minutes right now and just talk to you a little bit and visit with you and then we're going to have our brother Neil is going to give his testimony 1 Samuel 8: 1-10 and it came to pass when was old that he made his sons judges over Israel now the name of his first born was Joel and the name of his second abah they were judges in Bersa and his sons walked not in his ways you might have been raised up in it that don't mean you walk it so let's understand this within scriptures and his sons walked not in his ways but turned aside after lucra money and took bribes and perverted judgment then all the Elders of Israel gathered themselves together and came to Samuel unto Rama and said unto him behold Thou Art old and thy Sons walk not thy ways now make us a king to judge us like all the nations and the thing displeased Samuel and when they said give us a king to judge us and Samuel prayed un the Lord the Lord said unto Samuel hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee for they have not rejected thee but they have re me my that I should not Reign Over them according to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day wherewith forsaken me and served other gods and so do they also unto thee now therefore hearken unto their voice how be it yet protest s unto them and show them the manner of the king that shall reign over them may God bless the reading of his word you may be seated this morning in the presence of God just a small thought here uh this morning I'd like to title it when the leadership changes when leadership changes and when you look at the scripture here we know that a Prophet is one that is Anointed of God give a word to the people and he is God's voice to the people and surely God does nothing except that he reveal it to his servants the prophets so here uh Samuel's getting old he's been with the people for many years he's been through many battles and he's getting old and I'm sure he's probably getting weary and so he now he said well I'll make my sons as judges in BBA and uh so as we know the scriptures we know that God does not relay or let's say take gift of the Prophet to place it within physical lineage because callings of God are even without repentance we know that and here his boys became judges but their judgment became a skew had a problem a little bit of money a little bit of bribery huh a little bit of turn your head a little bit well that's not so important why be so hard on the people make it popular I'm going to tell you s that the Gospel of Jesus Christ in its pure form is not received by popular majority it's not it's a straight and narrow way and so we begin to see that when the the Elders of Israel began to see that the sons are not walking according Samuel has preached so they come and they come to Samuel I said Samuel your sons walk not in the message that you preached to us see it's not just being raised up around it but it's walk the message that you've heard and this is extremely important because if you don't walk in the me the message what is given for your day if we lower the standard I ask where does it stop if we change the word of God so that we can be popular the Apostle Paul says oh I would rather have friendship with God than I would to be friend with the world Amen God help us to give us Ministries that are not here to just patronize you to not just sit here and to have a pep rally and tell you how predestinated and howed of God you are and you're chosen but you're not walking in the ways of God Amen we know that our God is a god of fire and a god of wrath and a god of judgment and we must fear God because the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom amen and so when leadership changes the course of the church the ways of the people change and the next thing you know it's little by little just a little bit of this and a little bit of that and pretty soon it's just like if I'm talking to you and I'm I'm visiting with you and every little bit I move a little bit further away from the pulpit pretty soon I'm way over here how did I get over there little little by little and so it is a little leaven leavens a whole lump God help us that we don't lower the standard but we hold up the standard and we say oh God this which was given to us by the mouth of Malachi 4 in this age may we hold it may we hold ourselves accountable you husbands are accountable for your you're accountable for your wives amen and so I looked in uh the seven Church age book a quote here um where brother Brenham says now I want to say that I believe leadership but it's not the leadership of I believe in wait a second clarify that you believe in leadership but I do not believe in the leaders of men I believe in the leadership of the Holy Ghost coming through the word somebody say amen I believe also that has set men in the church who are gifted by the spirit and they will keep the church in order am times you got to spank them sometimes you got to rebuke them the Bible says that a rebuke of a friend is better than a kiss of an enemy I believe also that the church is ruled over by that God sends to take charge but that rule is by the word so that it's not the men really ruing but it's the spirit of God for the word and the spirit are one for the Bible says in Hebrews 13 and7 remember them which have the rule over you whose Faith follow who have spoken unto you the word of God considering the end of their conversation for we know that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he does not change man changes people change but the Bible says Lord God changed not what God did not like in the Old Testament he does not like in the new God help us you see if we get under the wrong kind of headship and Leadership it'll take you in a wrong direction brother renam says and United under one head 1958 he says but they had United under the wrong leadership they had United under the leadership of man and God wants to you man to unite under the leadership of himself do you see brother R says I believe in leadership but not the leadership of man I believe in God sending gifts doing it's all of God he's the orchestrator it's him he's the oneall God wants us to be one he wants to be one with us but man wants to follow man give us a leader get King let us choose a captain and return God help us yes they did it in the first Exodus let us choose a captain let's let's get somebody who's popular and and and we'll follow him and we'll go back into the things that we come out of God help us amen I don't want to be one of those that's following wrong leadership do you God help us that's why I re prayers and I too am held accountable by the people people yes amen all of you have a right if I preach something that's not according to the word you have a right to ask me then I will excommunicate you from the church and I will preach come on man you know better than that but that happens in other places no I I I say and I say this humbly and not as a joke you do have a right because I am held accountable to you for what I that's why what I in my early Ministry up until now I've always showed you what he said so that you might know it's not me just pulling something out a a thought or my own opinion but to let you know what he God bless you all this morning um we're going to have brother Greg come up here and he's going to sing a song while he comes and gets ready uh I want to say just a little bit before brother Neil comes and I believe brother Neil are going to bring the one of the chairs up here for you that's good um you know brother Neil ever since you've come here and it's quite a testimony you have about how God had you to come here but we don't need to go into that but ever since I've known you I've known you to be a upright and faithful servant and you've served me well um there was never a time I came in my office wasn't unlocked the door open the light turned on the video on him going through the he'd get here an hour hour and a early what a blessing that he has been but the Bible says Jes 1 James a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ to the 12 tribes which are scattered abroad greeting my brethren count it all Jo let me get my glasses here I'm sorry I had cataract surgy this Bible's a small print here my brethren count it all joy when you fall into diverse Temptations knowing this that the trial Faith worketh patience wow I didn't know I needed so much patience the Bible says in verse 12 and here's a clincher it is theand that endure Temptations for when he is tried wow how he shall receive the Crown of Life which the Lord had promised to them that love him and we know in Romans 8 and verse 28 that all things work together for the good didn't say they would be good but he'll use it for the good and I want to say that when you hear this testimony and family here and I want you to introduce family and I think uh nurse Natalie erz

but this is your time come on up here test the mic say hello hello test greetings can you hear me okay okay thank you this is a very special moment for me for one yes musicians God bless you I laid in the hospital spiring down quickly knew I was dying and I said Lord if you help me to live I will stand FR of the church and give a testimony stand and I'm standing there's so many things that have taken place since this happened I can testify I I'm telling you I could testify all into next month and keep you here till who knows probably next Sunday but I'm only going to keep you till Wednesday um there's there's a few things that I first would like to do and and I I wrote some notes down so I didn't wouldn't forget because I I have a tendency to forget a lot um and I want to before I get into the testimony I want to give recognition to three people right now right off and that one is the Lord that he's very first CU I told him I said Lord I will stand before the church and give thanks to you everything that you've done first and foremost and the second you know people have told me that brother Neil you're a real Soldier you're going through this and yeah I have but you know who the soldier is is my wife right Karen if you knew what she had to go through for me my life stopped her life stopped everything stopped period there was nothing I mean it even got to the point where when I was at home which I'll get into that a little bit what she had to do to take care of me I I I prayed I said Lord help me get better quick because it's a burden on her I I couldn't stand it to see it but the Lord has been gracious and he's helped me and so I want to give recognition to my wife for all that she's done it's been so much and then next brother Ron brother Ron despite the endurance that he had to take from Sister Rebecca she was sick she had cancer he was going through a lot brother Brandon brother Ron I'm sorry brother Ron was right there by my side nearly every day he'd come in and see me or he'd call and he'd check on me and see how I was doing I mean it was it was the love of a pastor that he would have for his for his for his sheep and I want to give thanks to my family and friends some of here my my brother Todd my little big brother Todd and my son Corey and daughter-in-law and Sarah and Brian which you know and Austin my nephew and I don't know if Amber is here oh there she is my daughter in the back my be Amber she's in the back with the two with the grandchildren and just the support that's come out here for me and it's it's just so amazing to to have you all here and I want to thanks I want to give a also speci to brother Chris roine um brother Brian yki you here let's see I know he's here Brian yki for all the help and work that they did on my house modifying things so I could get around in a wheelchair and it was a lot of work did a lot of work we had some good Fellowship during that time didn't and I want to give thanks to brother Ethan because he was very instrumental he helped me put this presentation together that was just absolutely amazing and I couldn't have done I thought I was pretty smart but boy when it comes to some of that stuff then I need some help and uh brother Paul love all I do want to recognize him too because while I was at home he me up you know practically get me in the car to take me to The Men's breakfast and it was just it was just such a blessing for him and you know the things he done you know I always that the Lord waited for me to give this testimony he held off on it because he knew I had a greater testimony and one day out in the parking lot brother Robert told me remember what you told me he said brother Neil the Lord is still writing your testimony and I wow I mean he doesn't know or he knows now how much that impacted me and it's true the Lord is still writing my testimony and he's writing each and every one of ours it's not just me it's you too and it's just amazing that the goodness of God and how he is towards us even in through our worst of times and the testimony is not about anything that I have done it's not like I did this it's how the Lord kept me through all this and I see they have the title of my testimony it's called the goodness of God and though God slay me yet I will trust him and I wrote down a little note here that if I knew that this testimony was to help someone somewhere anywhere I want you to know I would do it all over you I would say Lord yeah put me through that all over again because I know it's going to help this person if we don't have that kind of a heart in it we got to re re research ourselves and boy have I in a testimony have I got something I want to tell you huge impact of what happened to me in the hospital nothing happens without the Lord's knowledge of it nothing you know maybe Satan came to the Lord and said the Lord said to Satan afflict his body that don't life that's what happened and that's how we come through it and the choices we make and how we do come through it but you know before I get into this testimony I have some things I want to share share with you from my heart and one thing I learned while I was laying in the hospital and I was laying in and I was thinking I remember a statement somebody made once it said some someone period will have first place in your life always let that sink in but your identity will always be tied whatever you give your heart to and I play there helplessness can be in the hospital and I said Lord what is my heart tied to start reevaluate my life and thinking and I made a a new commitment to the Lord and realized that Lord you weren't in my life but you are now and I'm going to step every closer every day to give this to you to come closer to you and I stand here in front of the church testifying of that today now what I want go over with you is I wanted to go back into my life a little bit before I get into this testimony and tell you how I came to the Lord and what I had to endure and I was faced with two disasters in my life choices that I made on each one of those disaster exactly leads me into where I'm at right now on this behind this Pulpit standing amen EXA exactly and you'll understand once I get done with it but I was 13 years old I I left Ohio and that's a whole testimony in its own from when I was a child to the age of 13 and one day I will give that testimony perhaps to the youth that's the one to give that testimony to the youth on March 12 2023 right brother Steve March 7th I had a aort deest section I never got to give that testimony the Lord said no we're we're going to add to it I said okay and he did he added to it I was 13 years old long story short I made it to uh come into Arizona at 13 years old in Oregon I lived in Portland Oregon and I was and I'm going to say this as nice as I possibly can I was alone I lived I would find places to stay each night through my life I'm at 13 years old you don't think that gave me complexes in my life and I won't go into details in that because this not what this is about but just know that I I was hurt and then I went to Ohio I had a bad experience with my older brother Donnie and all and and I'm going to say his name he's since passed away but the things that happened there and I won't get into those on this testimony but I could not wait he said I'm going to put you on gr on bus go to your live with your dad in Arizona and and and your stepmom and my brother he was little at the time I could not wait to get to Arizona I couldn't wait I got to Arizona and when I got off the grand bus he was in the car my other little brother was in the car and my stepmom and I was so happy I finally found a place where the Lord wanted me Arizona was my home that's where I finally realized it that Arizona was my and going through high school I lived a happy life I I I never had so much fun I made new friends and it was just life was good I mean I like finally I have some settlement in my life I had a nice happy family we had a lot of together I made friends we clipped dive we do all sorts of things you know and have fun and then freshman year sophomore year junior year pay a close attention because this is all leading to the end I was on my way from a history class to a physical education class just walking casually I wasn't bothered by anything I wasn't stressed I was happy and I see group of people with a guy standing up with the Bible preaching to the students now I've heard the gospel all my life as long as I can remember I've heard the salvation of Jesus I knew but it never it never quickened me never but I was by I seen a group I seen the Bible I seen him I just went around and was going back and when I came around them I heard Jesus the Lord started knocking on my heart right then instantly instantly and it stopped me in my I've heard it thousands of times and he was he was preaching on genes in Genesis the 24th chapter in front of the students and to say is the day of salvation today is the day I don't wait till tomorrow and I'm going to fast forward just a little bit but I could not wait to get home I said Lord if I can ever get home I promise I'll give my heart to you this was in high school I got home room closed the door 6:00 in the afternoon and I started praying 1 Hour 2 Hour 3 Hour 4 hour and about the fifth hour I was frustrated and I start crying and I started pounding on the bed I said I'm not leav in this room until I hear from you that's what we need to do we need to wrestle with God persevere yes and I'm telling you I there for hours and crying and pleading God nothing happened I said I'm not leaving this room until I know I've heard from you and I'm I know I'm a Christian I'm saved and I laid down and long about midnight I just got up from my knees I went over to the bed and I just laid down I was just about ready to give up I said no I'm giving up and I put my hands behind my head in a real soft voice I said please save me that was it the spirit of the Lord dropped into that room went into my heart and I'm telling you I never felt anything like it in my life I had such peace in my heart I jumped up and I started running and and I knew visited me I there's not a devil in hell could tell me I wasn't saved there's no no one that's how you need to that's how you need to persevere beer and I took that and I jumped up I remember running down the hall it was around 12:30 and I said Lord I feel so good I said I said this is wonderful and I I come back to my room I laid down and I felt this void in my heart ever so slightly void like something was missing this is where I want you to pay attention this leads into this whole testimony I said Lord what have I left undone what what is it I don't know what it is and as I as I laid there and I had this void in my heart I prayed again I started praying again I never got an answer of what that was hang on second we're GNA okay can you hear me yeah test test okay and after I gave my heart to the Lord I just I just I let that go I said well maybe someday the Lord will answer me to what this void is in my heart but as the days went on and and I'll I will try to hurry I don't I don't want to keep you too long but this is very very very important how this leads into this I was my Bible every single day I was praying and I prayed God in heaven is my witness every day I pray for knowledge and wisdom and understanding of your word I said Lord I don't know what's right out there there's so many different religions I don't know where to go what to do I said I'm alone and the the guy that I listened to led me to the Lord took me to Lake Pleasant and baptized me in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ because that's what he believed and he explained it to me I seen it instantly and that's how I was baptized and things began to start happen heart was being conditioned and I believe it was being conditioned to receive this message I went to my neighbor remember Mr Gum he lived next door I went over to him and I told him what happened and he looked at me with that deer and the headlight stare like what are you talking about you know like I I didn't I didn't understand why he looked at me like that but he said well have you thought about what you're going to do when you get out when you get out of uh School how I had a yearo I said no I can't even think about what I'm going to do tomorrow and he said well you should probably go into Bible College and I thought about it and I go well I go I I go into Bible College and you know learn preach and that's not what the Lord had planned for me but and then I started seeing that big GP in the sky you know go preach but it was go plow it wasn't it never was go preach that wasn't my calling but I learned that I learned that later and so I I called the Bible College and I made an appointment to go see him the next week that I was going to sign up for the class as I graduated I was going to go straight into Bible and when I H up the phone from him I had my appointment conviction start setting in I couldn't understand what in the world is going on why do I feel so convicted and as got closer and closer and closer and closer to the to this time of going to Bible College the conviction got worse I thought Lord did I do something wrong or maybe it's the devil that doesn't want me to do this you know maybe that's what it is so anyway I got in the car and I drove up there for my appointment I couldn't get out of the I couldn't open the door I started crying I started weeping in the car I said I don't understand this I said I can't do it so I took that and I put it on the Shelf I said maybe it's for another day so I left it alone things like that began to happen and I could say tell you a hundred things that had happened to condition me for where I'm at today one of them one time I I worked while I was in high school I worked for a small company I was hanging lights in the back of of a delivering them of a Catholic church and I was walking similar experience you had brother Ron but I was a Christian now and I knew the Lord was dealing with my hearts carried some equipment through the sanctuary into the back Annex because of construction we couldn't drive around to the annex and I went through and I dropped off the equipment and I was coming back through and I walked to the sanctuary and like this I go wow I wondered with great ad like John I seen purple and Scarlet and gold and candles and and statues everything just everywhere I go wow look at this stained glass look at this is beautiful look at this and I just kept going walking out and I noticed on the wall like like brother Ron there was a big Virgin Mary and I walked over there and I go what is that I said there's there's a bowl under it this almost similar what brother Ron went through I walked up to the Bowl go what is that is there something in it and it was water I go that's holy water that well I didn't see any holes in it but but I I I to it and I put my finger in it and I go how do they do that and I this this God is my witness before I stand to you today I put my fingers in and and I went like this I when I did a tsunami of conviction hit me so hard it almost knocked me over and I said and I I whoa I I what did I do wrong what did I do wrong I couldn't get I couldn't get away from it man I got out of there so quick I never went back I said I never want to go in there again I don't know what this is I didn't know what it was till years years years later and so I after that many many different things start happening I went to a preacher one time the guy that led me to the Lord we went to some Revival somewhere I don't know and the prayer line at the end and when I got to the preacher he looked at me I don't even know who he was he said you carry a burden a heavy burden I said yeah you know because of my P because of my childhood and he said is it me is there there's something wrong he says is it me I said no it's not you but what he was preaching was good but it just didn't line up with what I was reading in and and I did I couldn't understand I go why Lord why is this happening to me I don't understand why this is happening me and then then one day I was on my way I was at home and this is the most I'm going to call this the most precious moment of my life today it's the most precious moment and this is what I want I was going to tell the youth and now I get to tell it to everybody and I want you to listen closely to this brother Steve you remember the story I told you I would I was sitting at home I was reading my Bible my brother calls me he had married and he had two little girls him and his wife he said can you come over and watch the girls while I go me and April his was his wife go grocery shopping I said well sure so I went over there I took my Bible and they went and I sat down the girls were sleeping and I was reading my Bible and on his wall he had a crucifix big crucifix about this big about this why and he had the Lord on it this is going to sound silly but listen the nail in the right arm came off and the nail and the legs came off and the Lord was hanging by one arm and he had it and I had seen it before and I said fix that thing don't let the Lord hang like that I know it sounds silly and he said he said we I'll get it well now I sit and read my Bible kept looking up at this and I go I go I can't I can't do this I said I can't sit there watching this thing like this but watch how the Lord was in it I go I got to fix it I got up and I took the cross Off the Wall put it down on the table and I got I started examining it and there was a brass nail in the wrist and one in the legs and I thought well if I slide it over then I can probably get another piece of wood in there I could I could put it in there and I went in and I got a butter knife out of the kitchen I laid the Lord on the cross and I lined him up just right and I put the cross in there and I and I stopped all of a sudden that butter knife turned into a big and that nail turned into a big spike and I was going and I start crying and I went like this and the tears were dripping down on the cross and I said that's right my sins put you there it was a moment that can't even explain to you but I looked down there and I was crying and sobbing and that void in my heart that I had from when I to the Lord I knew was tied to that cross now I knew I go there's something that this void is is is speak speaking out to me I took the Lord off the cross I hung an empty cross on the wall my brother came home he looks and he he goes where's Jesus he looks at the cross I go he's not on the cross anymore and he goes what's wrong with you nothing and I walked and and I left and that moment has never left me but it's it's it was the most precious moment moment that I ever had to experience and I knew was it but now now I lived a couple a few months went by and I worked at a little Phoenix a little sheet metal shop and I was in there and this is how I came to the message I read my Bible and prayed every day and I was in the sheet metal shop and we had a start his name was brother Wayne ghaw and I want to mention in his name cuz he since passed away and and open he he's looking over the banister at me right and he he he was reading the Bible and I approached him I said oh you're reading the Bible he goes yeah I said well I'm I'm a Christian too so we'd spend the afternoons and we'd have little Bible studies together then one day I walked up to any he was reading a message book it was uh testimony on the sea I go what are you reading he goes oh it's a message from brother brandom I go who's brother brandham and he told me he said well he was a prophet and he gave me scriptures and everything and and my heart was like now I had the opposite of the feeling now I had I the Lord was saying you look into this it was complete opposite I can't explain the feeling but I knew something was tugging at me for this and he told me he gave me a book William brandom a man set from God and my uh my grandson Pierce actually I see him sitting back there Pierce and he read the same book just just the other day I'm going to tell you about him the other day I finished that book he gave me a tape God explain William brandham sent Manet from God and he gave me all the scriptures so I went home I read the book probably all in one sitting I listened to the tape and my heart I was about ready to run I couldn't and I told him Wayne before I left I said if this is true I said God will show me in this Bible that what you're saying is correct I said I knew from my past experience that this he'll show me and I went home I shut myself in a room again and I'm sitting room and I'm praying I listen read that book I listen to that tape and I I said okay now it's got to be in the word I got to check it with the word I opened up my Bible I read Genesis the 24th chapter first thing I read and I go oh my it's just getting this is building up inside of me I read Amos 3:7 I read M 4 5 and 6 now I'm about ready to just you know Skyrocket and then I read Luke 17:30 and revelation 7 that was that did it for me that was it I was done and I I jumped up off the bed and I pointed my finger God is my witness and I said what I've been looking for my whole life that's it I knew it I knew beyond a shell of a doubt and when I said that it felt like a fire brand came out of the fire and went straight in my heart it was burned in me for the rest of my life I knew it and you you can't take you can't like brother Michael Patterson said right a revelation is not a revelation if you can be talked out of it that's exactly right and I went on from there and I was just I was just I was just ate up the the the messages and the tapes reading my Bible and praying and I was just I was climing it was good and I start church with him and we we were going to church and we had such a wonderful time in service and now the other part of the Void remember I still had that void in me now listen and then I'll lead into my presentation you'll understand it but I was going to church with him brother La Fontaine John La Fontaine and I told him this testimony when he was here when we were back on Maryland I remember him being here and he was preaching a three- night service in church and he preached a sermon called a love story he preached on the crucifixion and he used his son for an illustration he brought him on stage and he laid him down and he come across like the crucifixion he was coming down and I was sitting sister Sandy is and I lost it I said that's I went from there to the to to there to the I never touched the ground I don't think and I hit that Altar and I prayed and I cried for three days I stay I sobbed the whole world left there was nobody around me there was nothing at all hindering my hindering me I just cried and repented that's what was missing in my life that was the void I go I came to you I gave you my heart I I repented I asked you to come into my heart but I never really poured out my soul to the cross of Calvary I never did that day and I'm asking anybody that's young people here or somebody that you might be struggling you might have that void in your heart I don't know what's missing in your life is that what you need with God and there there's the answer right there it's not out there and walking out in the world and doing things it's it's turn the other way and come to Christ and really pour out your heart and give your heart to him that's what changed me now this next part is the part I don't like to tell but I have to because in a testimony you have to tell the bad with the good time went on I got a job at AIR research which is now Honeywell that's a whole don't don't want to go through all the name changes but I was working and while I was working something came over me and said something wrong and I was working and I remember listening I was listening to the Marin out the singers while I was at work and I stopped and I go what's wrong something's wrong and I don't know what it is and I looked over at we have these lights when the phone rings it'll pulsate if it's an outside call and if it's an inside call it'll just stay solid and I looked over and it was pulsating and I go something's wrong that's for me I know it is and then Aaron answered the phone A friend of mine Neil telephone and I just I I couldn't take it I went over to the phone and they said you got to get home real quick I can't tell you what happened I'm sorry but I was faced with a disaster in my life that just isting this is where it leads into where I'm at today I went I went home I was face with the disaster they say I had a nervous breakdown life kept slipping away and was at church I I stopped reading my Bible as much brother Steve I'm going to use your illustration I stopped reading my Bible as much then I I stopped praying as much then I start reading my Bible at all I said forget it I'm not reading anymore and I'm anymore then I stopped going to church altoe you get the illustration I was so far out I got so far away from the Lord I couldn't get back I was out in the world and I said Lord where are you it was too late it had went too far sin will take you farther than you want to go and keep you longer than you want to stay let me tell you it's true and I said Lord I don't know how to get back I'm too far gone during that time several years several several years and I I can't get into that part of it but know this it was hard the ways of it it's just hard the scripture the ways of a transgressor is hard and I suffered deeply and greatly and then I finally and I'm on a fast forward and bypass a lot of it which I will give it in a testimony someday what happened during those years just that time but I was coming back I had reached the end I said Lord I can't take anymore now I've hit rock bottom now I'm at Rock Bottom my heart to the Lord I wasn't at Rock botom but now I am and if I oh if I could tell you what happened during those times it seemed like no matter where I was wor places I could ever be the spirit of L the spirit of the Lord would come close to me and I'd feel him and I go why here Lord why here I said I I'm sitting in this bar or whatever and I said and I can feel your presence why here what's the scripture David though I make my bed in hell thou art with me thou art there and I didn't understand that till later but he was there watching over me the whole time in spite of myself Lord was there watching over me because I gave my heart to the Lord he's not going to lead me nor forsake me he's not going to do that to any of us and I finally reached it and I said you know what I'm going to get in my truck and I'm going to go as fast as I can and run it into a wall and I'm done a lot of these things nobody even knows about I'm saying it for the first time in my life and when I I got in there I was in my my truck and I bowed my head and I hadn't prayed in a long time I said Lord I'm done I'm hit rock bottom and this is how I spoke I said Lord I'm at Rock Bottom there's no other way to go and a voice spoke and said there's up brother Jesse remember you told me the other day about that voice and it said there's up and I looked at my head I go what was that I didn't know where it was coming from it was me inside but it just as plain and sweet as you heard my boy there's up and I said well and I want to read a scripture in Hebrews 11 do you have that scripture brother I I don't remember where I put it now follow along this is what came to my mind while I'm in my V man it says and others had Trials of cruel Mo and scourgings and moreover of bonds of imprisonment they were stoned they were saw a thunder they were tempted they were slain with the sword they wandered about in sheep's clo sheep sheep's goats being destitute and Afflicted tormented of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and caves of the earth and these all all and these all PA having obtained a good report through the received not the god having provided some better thing for us that without us should not be made perfect that came to my heart while I was sitting in the van that exact scripture and I said Lord I failed them I said I failed I said look what they went through I wasn't cut up and tortured and tormented and throwing on a rack of nails or whatever and cut I said I I said I'm I failed and each day I said Lord I promise and I made a promise I said I don't care how long it takes each day I'm going to take a step closer to you each day I don't care how small it is and I pretend like I'm still over there I start read my Bible and I got closer and I got closer and I got closer I got closer and then finally my wife and I we come back and we start coming to brother Ron's church and she came to brother Ron's first we C she came to brother Ron's first on a Wednesday night we had been going somewhere else bit and then we ended up coming coming back and she came sat under bronze on on Maryland and she said brother she said Neil she said we need to go go go you got to go try brother Ron he's it's it's it's it's good and and we'll see and I said well okay I came to a service and I just absolutely loved it but I said before I go to church I said I'm going to pray about it I took in my car and I went up on the rim and I parked my car out it was that night parked my car out in the rim I read in my Bible and I prayed I said Lord if brother Ron is the place you want me to go I said you just let me know and Noah voice didn't go to brother r no that didn't happen but but but I I came back and I just started attending brother Ron's this is where I want to tell what you were mentioning brother Ron and reading my Bible now I when I pray I just I give it to God and I let it go cuz I know when you pray you believe he's he's obligated to answer your prayer Bara I didn't have to out at all about it but I sat in the chair and I was reading my Bible brother Ron comes out first service and he takes his text where I was reading my Bible I thought oh praise God I'm in the channel you know second service brother Ron comes out I'm reading my Bible he comes out where does he take his text where I'm reading in my Bible and I go wow this is really I'm really in the channel third service I'm reading my Bible he comes out his text and he's reading and he opens up his bible to read other scriptures and he reads where I was reading and I go this just this is just can't happen four time I'm reading my my my my my Bible brother Ron comes out same thing now tell me that ain't that ain't the Lord he's answering my prayer cuz I went up in the woods and I asked him and he answered me fifth time I didn't read my Bible right I didn't read my Bible I read a message book I was reading brother bram's message Robert comes out and he's singing and I'm trying to read and I've got one chapter left I go I got to finish this chapter everybody's standing clapping you know and singing brother Robert's lead and I said I can't sit here like this and I closed it on the last chapter I had to read yeah you've already you know where I'm going with this one brother Ron comes out takes his text he's reading a sermon he goes now from the message and he turns it right exactly to the last chapter that I didn't finish and he finished it for me and I go okay Lord this is where I need to be and and I suffered a lot during that time coming back to the Lord and during that time you you know people know I lost my daughter I lost my granddaughter Destiny my Grand my daughter Angela and many things have happened suffered greatly but I kept pressing forward and pressing forward and pressing forward now that's where I want to stop and I want you to remember stay right there and put it on the Shelf because I'm GNA come back to it now I'm going to get into my presentation but remember I'm not done yet there so March 20 March 7 2023 I got a timeline here but I'm G I'm g g get that in just forgive me right I got to get this timeline I have written down here oh there it is it's right in front of me so March 27th March 7 2023 I'm at home getting ready for work there's the timeline I'm G leave that picture up there for a minute this is the time March 7th 2023 I was getting ready for work 20 in the morning was brushing my teeth and it felt like a sword struck me in the back I staggered to the living room where I my wife was trying to dial 911 we were have a hard time getting the connection couldn't do it I'm barely hearing things end up using my phone remember the clock is ticking 15 minutes passed before the paramedics arrived once you got a hold of them par paramedics worked on me for 15 minutes I was taken to delw our approximately 15minute Drive emergency treated my a condition like it was a heart attack big mistake right off the right off the get-go they had no idea it was an aortic dissection an angiogram was performed it was then the doctors realized there's nothing wrong with his heart it's his aorta it was dissecting flown to Boswell after about an hour of doctor's diagnosis and keep in mind this time zone this time that's ticking flown to Boswell 9:30 a.m. they I was at I was at um Boswell finally 9:30 they're prepping me for surgery so from 5:30 to 9:30 has already gone by and I'm still being prepped for surgery I should have been dead right then I was dead you only have five minutes at the most maybe an hour and I'm going to read that to you in a minute car Caren my wife she Karen met a lady in the waiting room and found her husband was scheduled to have surgery that day Dr Savage asked a husband if he could postpone his surgery to do mine that if he didn't perform the the surgery I was going to die the husband said told the doctor go save his life I was in surgery for 11 hours many complications occurred after Opera operation my kidney my livers immediate my liver immediately stopped working and was on my and was on dialysis for three months which they said I would never ever again for each day I was on dialysis the doctor said I would never get off dialysis my liver wasn't working my throat was damaged from the the tube they put down there because it was bigger than it was supposed to be and they damag my throat I had to be fed through my nose I ended up getting pneumonia and aspirating and then my hands my feet start swelling now I'm going to go over a little bit about what aortic dissection is because a lot of people don't know where is that that screen oh oh okay there it is I'm going to read it from here um so remember the time what is an aortic dissection it's a tear in the inner layer of the large vessel the aorta wrenching off the heart an aortic dissection is a medical emergency in which the inner layer of the aorta tears it's most common in men in their 60s and 70s symptoms include sudden severe chest pain and upper back pain that radi to the neck or down the back loss of consciousness and shortness of breath one of the causes is high blood pressure now I'm going to go back and if you can see this I just show this real quick but you can see the and a little tear and how it starts dissecting it bubbles out and starts dissecting further explanation the loss of blood flow caused by a leaky aorta means there's less oxygen for the vital organs like the brain and even the heart which can be deadly as many as 40% of people who suffer aortic dissection die instantly and the risk death increases 3 to% every hour the condition is left untreated Remember the Time Zone from 5:30 to even before I got into surgery the time is ticking but that's not all 5 minutes to an hour is crucial time to reach hospital and rush into surgery once the onset begins people who have an acute aortic dissection have a high death rate an average of 15 to 30% of people die after reaching the emergency room even after so now it's even getting worse so even if I make it there and get surgery I'm going to I'm you know now trash foot you've heard that term I think brother Ron has mentioned it trash foot is caused from a a section surgery so listen an acute limb aeia which is a lack of oxygen following an aortic surgery is commonly termed as trash foot a restriction in apply to any tissue muscle group or organ the body causing shortness of oxygen that is needful for cellular cellular metabolism which is to keep the tissue alive now trash foot alone the onset of that there is no cure for it the disease and the treatment mly supportive the prognosis of this condition is poor with a mortality rate of 72 to 80% so even if you've had you survive this far and you're going to get a you're going to get trash foot from the aortic having aortic dissecting your chances are you're gone from that 80% because that stuff's got to go somewhere they don't know what to do with it there's no cure for the disease and the treatment is mainly supportive the prognosis of the condition is poor the mortality rate of 72 or 80% a mortality rate refers to the percentage of people who die in a given scenario High mortality rate signifies a lot of people am I a miracle standing yes I am by me no god holds Life In His Hands he's a giver and taker of life and I was kept alive for a reason can read it I couldn't those words but but I I think I I think I I I can now so I don't have to turn around I read that that was the timeline so that's right after surgery immediately after surgery and my family they took up the whole waiting room at the hospital thank you Jesus am oh my it's just it's overwhelming when I think about it the heart of my precious wife at her eyes and seeing the pain she's going through it just broke me and that was after they took some of the stuff off of me and then the heart of my pastor brother Ron you can't see his face on there very well I don't know but I looked up at his eyes right there and he was broke weren't you brother Ron he was absolutely broke and he held my arm that's a heart of a pastor do you Michael a stepson looking over me now the Hoist Natalie where are you she remembers that I don't don't pretty much remember this whole thing but this was a little green thing I got a video I want to show you but this was a little they put you in I called it the Venus flight trap because that's what I felt like this thing encompassed you it closed you in I hated that thing and they take you from the bed over to a chair so you could sit and brother you want to play can you play that from there and there's Natalie she's helping with the Hoist no that was not fun I can tell you I hated that thing I and it just I hurt just they they would would want to come in and get me out of the bed put me in the chair I said just let me lay here and die I don't want to get in that thing Michael and Brian I don't now I'm going to tell you right here I don't remember a lot of this so um brother we get to a point if there's anything you want to say because he remembers and and can't remembers stuff but um oh you know I do want to go back you notice my fingers and my nose they're normal they're per I didn't know anything was going to happen and then this is where I I want to take my brother and sisters and they were by my side every single day I couldn't have made it without them and I had to be fed other Michael if you look at my face I you can tell I was looking up at the something I I don't but I was I was out I was way out there and then my grand Ariana and you see and I'm sorry of some of these pictures we'll get into the real graphic ones but you can see I'm pretty much normal I I don't know any things going on yet and now you can see just a little bit the transition starting to take place this brother Tim brother Ron there and if you look see my legs and my nose and my fingers are starting to turn different colors brother I don't remember that brother sorry I was I was out of it but everybody took pictures with me and and if anybody still to this day has pictures I'm still building on this I'd like to have everything I could possibly get and then the nurse is feeding I think nurse I'm not sure is there sound and by the way I hated food nothing tastes good I hated it the love is coffee I loved coffee I hated coffee everything nothing tastes good and I was I was getting thinner and thinner and I was going down and I was I was really spiring down and then just some of the visitors that came and know I kind of barely remember what here you see brother Daniel Romine is he was there you know what I was asking him there if he'd break me out of this place that that's true story brother Chris where are you he he was there to get me out of here break me out and I sat up I was waiting for him to to just just get up and get out of there but he's saying no we we can't get you out of here sorry grandson Michael which he's coming in today he wanted to be here and there's Gemma and Gano my grand me and they were couldn't understand what was going on they seen my fingers turning and and it was hard on them too to see me like that and as you can see I'm getting worse yourse is my nose is turning dark and well I I'll tell you something when I get to that part of it Corey he's here wonderful pictures of the family just being by with me it meant so much to me and all my all you brothers and sisters that were there I couldn't have made it without you Sarah and Brian feeding me Matt and Jackie there brother Wayne feeding me oh I have to stop on this one my my hands were dying they were just they hurt so bad they were just and when anybody come in I I couldn't shake I'd have to go like that and kind of give a you know a bump you know see that grin on brother Jesse's face that's a grin of guilt he's feeling bad came in and I reached my hand out and he gave me that big old manly handshake with his hand and shook my hand and I went and brother Ron let out a chuckle he started laugh and and and he I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry and and and to hear brother Ron give that little chuckle and brother Jesse laughing saying I'm sorry I wouldn't give that up for nothing I'd do that again that was worth every bit of the pain cuz cuz I had brother Ron he was he was smiling and laughing and it was just it was amazing I I wouldn't give that moment up for nothing sorry brother Jesse tell on you a little bit brother Bob brother Chris just make mental note of my hands and my nose oh and brother I call him brother Lazarus he came to the hospital and gave me a haircut so wonderful to him to do that he's listening in right now actually I called him he's thank you brother Lazarus can you hear me the group of people that came stood by me in church okay here's what the brothers did for me brother James Weeden is singing watch brother Ethan [Music] for very precious moment very precious more visitors brother Mark okay ready for this one brother Ron yeah okay they Tre no I hat his food notice my nose look at it now that's a miracle I'll tell you about that in a minute and this is Ken's support group every day you don't think God looks down out of Heaven at that she's the one that went through the really really hard time the transition now this is a graphic warning so Natalie was trying to walk me and at this point my feet were were dying pretty good and it was hard to walk that's how it started fingers are purple black now they're getting really bad possibility of losing my nose that's my nose at its worst it was gone sorry brother Chris did you sneak that in [Laughter] there sorry about that but again graphic warning these pictures are pretty bad they tried their best to take care of my every day they'd come in and dress them and and wipe them down see the progression I'm sorry but I have to show you I won't I won't dwell on it very long but that's how they got the crushing blow I went in to hyper Eric I was in there they were the doctors called me in the office afterward and said we have to you don't think that hurt knowing I could never walk again at that time that's what I thought I could never play my classical guitar again I was devastated absolutely devastated leg amputation surgery was April the 27th brother yeah let me let me share with as I was there in the hospital room the nurses came to get him to take him to amputation very somber moment and they wheel him out of the room we had prayed he's going down the room he gets about from here to the back of the church and he stops and he tells the two nurses wait a second wait brother Ron brother Ron I saides brother Neil he said next time you see me I'll be 2 feet shorter I went and the nurse next to me said is that guy for real that listen and I said wouldn't you rather have a guy have a little bit of humor about it rather than woe is me and whatever ever but anyway I thought thank you brother Ron I was W you all that two feet shorter I was I thought about suing you yeah I said but I couldn't because I didn't have a leg to stand on these are true that's what he said these are true that's what I said that was I was being Neil so finger amputation and Angela daughter was with me and she's always happy and joyful and trying to make me laugh and she did now I want to pause right here I I want to tell you something two stories after my amputation and I I'll try to hurry I'm I'm sorry um they moved me from ICU into a room and I found out that I was going to be in a split room with somebody else and I started complaining and I said no I said I don't want to be with anybody else I want to be by myself and I did I I was angry I I was getting mad I said no I don't want to be with any else and we were in the they had to they moved me in the room and next to me was an old Mexican man and Karen was standing me and I had we had the Bible laying there and you know she would read to me and then all of a sudden this man next to me starts moaning and crying and I heard his moans and cries and I said Lord forgive me I said here I'm being selfish and wanting to be by myself and not with anybody else but this man next to me I said maybe there's a reason you want me to be you know next to this other person and I repented and I said Lord forgive me I'm sorry I said wherever I go it's it's going to be your will and I'm going to see it at that so I get over there and I'm laying there and my wife's a witness I I was sitting there and he's crying and moaning the curtain draws open and that man asked me to pray for him in Spanish I didn't understand a word he said but I knew what he was asking me and I said seor you pray for you and he said yeah and he started crying and I grabbed his feeble hand you have no idea all my pain my fingers everything I was going through was gone all I could think about was man and suffering and I grabbed his hand and I started praying and I said Lord please help this old man and I and I said a prayer for him my wife and I we both prayed for him and that was the most precious moment that I had in the hospital I said forgive me I will never complain again I said because I don't know where you're leading what you're doing amen and and so I prayed for him the very next morning the curtain opens again and he asked me to pray for him again prayed for him I never seen him again I don't know what happened but I know the Lord blessed that man and I thought Lord that's what it's all about if I my own pain and what I'm going through to help somebody else and and to help and pray for somebody else that's that's that's what it's all about so the next thing that happened to me I never seen him again I was I was in my room no fingers my legs are gone and a chaplain comes walking in and I think I told this story in front of the church one time when I first came back chaplain comes walking in he's real how are you are you okay you know and I I said said I'm fine I said are you okay and he says well I I just you know I want to know if you're okay I know it's a hard time what you're going through I said said chaplain I said the Lord he just take good care of me I said he's been my everything and he this far and k k me helping me through all this all my pain everything that I'm going through and he said wow he said I need counseling from you that's exactly what he said and we talked a little bit and he and walked away I never seen him again either but I tried to be a testimony in in in in there while I was you know I said Lord help me to be a testimony to to somebody the nurses and you know every everything and every everything that happened to some of the visitors coming in the brothers John and brother Dave poock wanted to hear my testimony so bad he would tell me at breakfast all the time but I believe he's listening to me today am thanks to all the brothers seeing me that was a precious moment you can see these old bandages fingers mark my grandson a to my fingers now see that my fingers tips of my fingers are full of stitches and they had to take them out one by one after two weeks every single one of them hurt that was the worst pain I ever had to go through to lose that you can see him then finally rehab my little grandson Jensen see my nose the skin started

Ron no all you brothers and sisters family was there nobody I'm alone I'm in my room uh I remember Karen got up she went off into the other room and I want everybody to try to enter into this moment

Becky I'm going to have sister Becky um when she comes back that's fine and I asked her to come up and I want her to play a just a couple verses cuz I want you to enter into this moment with me but I laid in the bed and as I laid in the bed I looked at my hands I look I remember my garage I couldn't reach up even grab a screwdriver my legs were gone I couldn't get out of bed and just walk and I started shaking and getting overwhelm really bad and I was just crying I I said God please comfort me please come down and comfort me he always has not this time it was silent dead silent nothing from the Lord at all and I thought where are you where are you Lord and it got worse and worse and worse as the minutes went by and I screamed out my God my God why have you forsaken me I cried out I said where are you I'm in the darkest time of my life I need you he wasn't there but he was there and I remembered a testimony of a brother I can't remember somebody can remind me who lost his wife and
