take your seats amen we just want to greet you to our annual elf camp and uh it's certainly nice to see you all here this evening and for making the commitment for being dedicated and taking time off work and spending your money and and flights and different things and that you have come to uh congregate with us to hear the word of the Lord and so we just want to welcome you all to all our our visitors to our local assembly we say God richly bless you and uh my name is brother Stephen McNeely I'm the associate pastor there at elf and I work alongside brother Ron and the rest of the the brother and their church and in the ministry and um we just we have some things that we would like to bring forth to you this evening before uh we have the ministering of the word a few little announcements few rules etc etc and I know that young people are very very good at following rules aren't you extremely good and so when I give the rules when we give our expectations I know for a fact that each and every one of you are going to follow it to the T absolutely because you're young people and that's what young people do best and so we have uh we have some slides here that we would like to start this is brother Ron and sister Sandy there are Camp hosts and uh you know we just are so privileged to have them as our pastor and our pastor's wife and and the dedication and the the heart that they have for for young people a heart that they have to see young people birthed into the body of Christ and so let's just give brother Ron and sister Sandy brother Ron sister Sandy stand up so everybody can see you look there they are right there look right here yeah praise the Lord let's go to our next slide okay this year at camp we have 86 girls and 89 boys we have 18 counselors and um if you have an emergency or something like that or if you need to talk to a counselor each of you have been assigned a counselor to your dorm or to your cabin and you know it's very hard to choose and pick counselors for a camp every year you have to pick someone who has a love for God someone who holds a standard in their lives someone who's dependable and someone who's very reliable and that's that's how we have chosen the counselors this year and um and just in a few moments uh after I get through this slide here perhaps we'll have all the counselors just come up and do a walk through uh and greet you tell them tell you their name so on and so forth because a lot of times what happens is this uh you have a guy like me yeah I'm a minister and I'm associate yeah and I'm a counselor here but when everybody sees me out there I look like a camper you say well brother Stephen you can't be over 19 years old yeah 35 years old and so what happens is we get caught up with well he's just a counselor whatever so we want all you guys to know exactly who the counselors are so that whenever you go to take the golf cart and you see a counselor that's nearby you'll know not to do it There are rules for the golf carts guys we're going to get into that here in a second and I know you are all very very good very very good at following rules our camp nurse this year is Sister Anne love all sister and over here if you could stand so everybody could see you [Applause] and her assistant Bethany Lovell Bethany stand for us please [Applause] and so if you have a headache if you got something that's wrong or whatever it might be you don't need to go to your dorms you don't need to go out to your cabins to to get your stomach medicine no we have nurses that are right here in service that have everything that you have need of it'll take care of that upset stomach or whatever it might be Camp security is brother Michael and sister Monica Lovell if they could both stand there they are over here in the corner and I'm actually I'm actually going to have brother Mike you'll come here and he's gonna uh just say a few words a few words of expectations and different things of cancer brother Michael if you would like to come that's a mean looking security guard right there in our family I was Grace and that was the law but I'm I'm happy to be here and uh I don't know why but when I came in here I've been so busy since we got here just helping and doing it as soon as I walked in right there something just struck me like he's here and and you think that you know what we're just Gathering we're going to have fun we're hard but you know what he's here I'm just I know that's not what you wanted to study you were going to hear but I'm just telling you he's here and I he's right there and uh so with that said everybody that's here you've Associated your seeing yourself as a as a believer otherwise you know what you wouldn't be here so you chose to fill something out I'm a believer I'm going to go to a Believer camp I want to hear the word of God I want a fellowship this is places where you make friends for life it's different than going to Camp you know out there and somewhere else you will make friends for life and you might yeah you could you knew it I don't even have to answer that but that I'm serious that's that's what's awesome about being associated with believe as a believer so if you're here you're Associated believer and you know what Believers have higher standards they live by different different expectations it's no different than that slave that when he came over and they said there's something different about him why and he said he said because from his homeland his father was the king What About Us your father's the king not a king he's the king so with that said you know what hey let's let's let's do our part you know what you you may Camp what what it is right if it's a drag then you didn't do something right get in make friends meet people follow the rules that's that's the easiest thing you know what as security all I want to be is is seen you don't want to notice me there's a difference because if you notice me then somehow for some reason I'm around you close by and you notice and I'm there are you doing something wrong right so they say hey it's okay to be seen just don't get noticed right so that that you know what I'm very approachable you got anything we're just here to to make everything just go smooth you know and and I believe it will because you guys are believers okay God bless you [Applause] being a Believer brings a responsibility of a believer and so because we are believers we behave ourselves as Believers not as worldly people amen okay next slide okay announcement we'll have a devotional every Monday every morning at 7 00 a.m to 7 45 a.m if this is your first time at our camp uh it's always a very special special time where our pastor has a 45-minute devotional he speaks whatever God has put on his heart and it's very personal it's very nice and um it is optional but let me encourage each one of you tried to make it make it a point to go to the devotionals because it actually believe it or not it'll encourage us it'll encourage your counselor it'll encourage our pastor and so it is down there where the uh the restaurant there is where you eat uh that where we signed up and everything that's where it's going to be right there what time is it out in the morning so what time do you get up in the morning 6 58 right you're teenagers I understand okay this person this the in the white You Gotta Wear Sunscreen it is hot out and not only is it hot out and we are at on higher altitude and you will get sunburned it's just a fact of life so if you have sunscreen please wear it if you're getting burnt and you don't have sunscreen see Sister Ann or sister Bethany Lovell another thing we need to drink lots of water lots of water if you're getting thirsty you've waited too long to drink water it's just how it is so when you entered in here uh this evening to come into the church there was a a water thing out there where you could get cold Waters we just asked that whenever you you get a water bottle don't just take a little drink of it and set it down because you don't want to pick up somebody else's water bottle and you know you know what happens when you drink out of someone else's water bottle right you get goodies it happens so we don't want that to happen at camp this year so when you get a water bottle drink your water bottle and then throw it where in the trash you guys are excellent very good uh song specials there will be a sign up sheet now just so you guys know this door here is out of bounds for this Sanctuary we do not enter this door and we do not exit this door this is just a door this is our main entrance and our main exit right here as you walked in um there will be a sign up sheet there should be already there on the the exterior doors there if God has put a song on your heart and you would like to sing uh you gotta practice the song so the musicians and everybody else is all in tune and it's just it goes smoothly and it's really nice so if you would like to sing a song special whether it's yourself whether you have a group of people um there's a sign up sheet you need to sign up for a time to practice in order to sing your song you've got to practice so you've got to show up and you got to practice this song Everybody understand okay praise the Lord um rules and guidelines these are the ones that we love um do not leave to campgrounds very very simple rule do not leave the campgrounds of this facility because something is going to happen when you leave the campgrounds people think well I can just sneak out I can just do this I can just do that and nobody's going to know well guess what word spreads and when word spreads everybody finds out and you know what's going to happen when we find out Whoever has left Kemp you're going to be asked to leave the camp this is something that we are extremely Stern about and we've done it in years gone past we absolutely hate to do it because there's no need for it our desire as counselors and brother Ron's desire and everybody's desire and putting on this camp and working together and doing all these things is not just for fun and for you guys to make friendships yet that is part of it but it's for God to change lives and so the last thing that we want to do is send somebody home because of something that seems pretty silly so please don't try us it's just a fact leave the campgrounds your emergency contact will be called and you will be sent home okay does everybody understand raise your left hand okay excellent very good you're a good class okay cell phone use needs to be kept to a minimal and on silent during service who has a cell phone with them raise your hand somebody did not have their phone on silent okay why do we need to have our cell phones on silent because it disrupts the service and you guys are all saying well we don't have any cell service here anyways so it doesn't really matter well I guess that's a good thing it just played in our part uh do yourself a favor if you got an iPad or you have your phone and you like to do whatever on it you know I don't know what you're going to do with no cell service but hey uh you'll find something I suppose keep it to it keep it in your dorm keep it locked away hey we're here to make friends and relationships that are going to last amen another thing on cell phones uh people have already asked and they said uh can we have the Wi-Fi because we really need Wi-Fi because I really need to call my mom and dad and I really need to tell them that I'm okay listen your mom and dad had confidence in the ministry here that's why they let you come so they know you're okay if there's an emergency or something that happens hey come tell one of your counselors we have your emergency contact info we can give them a call everything will be okay okay okay have we got any boyfriend and girlfriends raise your hand very good very good we got a couple here okay boyfriends and girlfriends uh special friends people who are courting whatever you want to call it hey no holding hands no walking around with each other and holding hands and and all these silly things listen if that special one is that special one that's going to last forever guess what you're gonna have a long time to hold hands and so really for four days there's really no need for it okay um there is a couple of there is a couple of couples here that are engaged already if I could have them stand and we could give them a big old Round of Applause because they deserve it look it that's right yep look at that [Applause] they have attained so if you see them uh together or whatever uh you will understand why and it's because they have kind of already tied the knot but even them we put pressure on them hey be an example before the young people there's no need to be walking around and glued to the hip and holding hands and all that stuff there's a lot of time for that okay next one oh other things uh just stay out of questionable situations you know at night time and when the Sun goes down and all those different things there's really no need for boys and girls to be walking around in the dark by themselves and and around the trees and and all these different things hey hey let's just stay in a group let's just stay together let's just stay in the light because we are children of the light and let's not leave anything up to uh people's imaginations how does that sound isn't that good because people's imaginations can run really wild and come up with something like two plus two equals five when it's not true and you know it's not true but when you put yourselves in questionable situations guess what happens two plus two equals five so let's present prevent that from happening next slide golf carts yeah you guys are so good at reminding me of things excellent okay next one golf carts who here has seen the golf cart raise your hands sure you have who here thinks it's so much fun to ride a golf cart raise your hands sure it is it's a lot of fun but it's fun for the counselors only now we're going to give you guys uh a free ticket here because there's already been a golf cart that was taken possibly two golf carts that was taken and uh boys being boys you know being young and and having absolute zero wisdom that's the nice thing about uh the thing about youth is uh full of zeal and no wisdom so you get 10 guys on this golf cart guess what happens if that thing tumbles over an accident families called things happen which could be prevented if you follow the rules now you didn't know the rules to begin with so we give you a free card give you a free pass now if any of you are seen driving in the golf cart without a counselor whatever it may be guess what it's the exact same thing as leaving camp you will be sent home it's just a fact and it will happen we do not want it to happen because it would be super unnecessary but I know that you guys are you guys are a super nice crowd you're a super nice bunch of young people so I know that you're obedient to your parents and you're going to be obedient to the rules and so we're just asking hey for your own safety for our safety for everybody else's safety and the rules stay off the golf carts what happens if we need it and there's an emergency and you and somebody's clowning around in this thing and then we have to walk 15 minutes from one side of the camp to the other when we could have been there in two so there's always uh things there's a what's it called uh um an action to a reaction there's always there's always reasons so like if you do something silly and something else happens and then hey whose fault is it that we couldn't get there in time I'll let you answer that so under no circumstances and I'll say it with a smile on my face under no circumstances does the campers ride on the golf carts does everybody understand put your hands on top of your head yes praise the Lord very good do we have anything else brother Ethan golf carts and coffee yes so there's there's also coffee guess what guess who that's only for counselors sorry guys coffee is off balance for campers does everybody understand yeah you guys huh aha you see law and Grace right here the coffee in the lounge is out of bounds for account for campers counselors only even then we can't hang out we just gotta go get our coffee and get back to work because we're not here guess what we're not here to drink coffee we're not here to hang out and fellowship with each other no as counselors we are here to serve you guys yes that's right okay so we have many people that's here in our group and if you are from the United States of America how about you stand to your feet United States of America

stand to your feet that's right give them a big round of applause here they are thank you yeah we welcome you guys Welcome to our youth camp and I believe that that is everything so before uh brother

away so you can again somebody give the Lord a hand clap of praise praise the Lord hallelujah if you have your Bibles turn with me to the book of First Kings and we'll reach out we'll read uh First Kings 19. verses 9 through 13. thank you musicians God bless you praise the Lord First Kings chapter 19 very familiar portion of scripture we'll read from verse 8. and it says and he arose and did eat and drink and went in the strength of that meat 40 days and 40 nights onto Horeb the Mount of God and he came thither onto a cave and lodged there and behold the word of the Lord came to him talking on the talking about Elijah and he said unto him what doest thou hear Elijah and he said I have been very jealous for the Lord God of hosts for the children of Israel have forsaken thy Covenant thrown down thine altars and slain thy prophets with the sword and I even I only am left and they seek my life to take it away and he said go forth and stand upon the mount before the Lord and behold the Lord passed by and a great and strong wind rent the mountains and break in pieces the Rocks before the Lord but the Lord was not in the Wind and after the wind and earthquake but the Lord was not in the earthquake and after the earthquake of fire but the Lord was not in the fire and after the fire a still small voice and it was so when Elijah heard it that he wrapped his face in his mantle and went out and stood in the entering Inn of the cave notice those other things did not catch Elijah's attention but when he heard that still Small Voice it caused a reaction in his life amen and uh it says there and verse 13 and behold there came a voice unto him and said what doest thou hear Elijah amen you may be seated this evening we trust that the Lord allowed the blessing to the reading of his word I would just like to take a very very simple subject for 15 minutes this evening and I would like to title this what doest thou hear There Was Elijah was a man and there's there was not known much about the history of his life but we know one thing about Elijah and that was that he was a man of God and he was the prophet of the hour and and he held his life as a believer and he held the standard of his life as the standard that a Believer should attain to it didn't matter what Ahab and Jezebel had to say it didn't matter what the politicians of that day had to say of of how we should live our lives and what was acceptable and what was not acceptable for a person to do but he hailed to one thing and that was the word of God now we can take uh an example from Elijah and a day an hour in which so many people are are are bombarding our minds and our lives through the internet and social media and these different inlets and outlets and they're trying to influence us to live our lives in a certain way they're trying to tell us that what is acceptable and what is not acceptable they're trying to tell us in their their worldly carnal reasonings what is right and what is wrong there's one thing about the Bible and is that the Bible never changes and so we can take now the Bible as our absolute and if there's any person if there's whether it be somebody at school whether it be a politician it doesn't matter who it may be but if they're trying to preach something to us that is contrary to this scripture we don't have to accept it if they try to show us something of a way that of things that are acceptable and okay in this hour and it doesn't line up with the word of God I want to tell you that it's a lie because outside of the truth there is lies and so if they're trying to bombard us with something that's outside of the word guess what it's a lie so be encouraged just because uh uh it was just like Joshua and Caleb you remember when they went into the Promised Land do you remember how many spies there was that went into the promised land there was twelve but how many came back with a good report there was two so there was two out of 12 that stood upon the promises of God and it just goes to show us that numbers does not matter it doesn't matter if you say well everybody else believes this in such in such a way and and everybody in my school and everybody that I meet is just so contrary to what I believe well it doesn't mean that that is right and we are wrong because of numbers but it's the word of God hallelujah so here was Elijah Elijah was just a man subject to like passion such as you and I Elijah had a temper Elijah had many things that got him riled up that got him agitated that got him aggravated with life have you ever been agitated and aggravated with life ever been agitated with your parents sure probably the same time that they're being agitated with you but it's all part of the journey Elijah was on a journey and his journey was a journey that was the Bible says that the footsteps of the righteous they're ordered of the Lord so if you're a righteous person in here tonight even I will go to as far to say this if you are living unrighteously in your life at this very present time I believe that God LED you here and he brought you here for a purpose you think Well everybody's Believers and everybody says yeah yeah I wonder how many Believers there are amongst us that have never been born again that have never had a true experience with God an anchor in their lives to where they know that they know that they know that their life has been changed you say I'm a Believer but does our lives prove that we are believers so you are on a journey and God has you on a journey and God is leading you into places that you never thought you would ever go perhaps a church camp so God asked Elijah Elijah was on this journey and he and and and brother Branham said he had a mental breakdown does everybody remember brother Brown I'm saying that and the reason for that was he was just going and he was going and he was and he was preaching and and he was calling the uh he would say it's not going to rain for three and a half years and this isn't going to happen and there's so many Supernatural events that was following his life and guess what he got tired and he got weary when a man gets tired and weary it's not the time to kick him under the curb but it's a time to pray for him let me tell you if your mom or your dad or your pastor gets weary in their walk it's not a time to throw stones if the person sitting beside you is tired or weary it's not a time to throw stones it's a time to pray it's a time to encourage it's a time to lift up it's a time to say I know you're having it hard but here let me burn the burden in your life a little bit and so he he went through many mighty trials in his life and and God proved himself time and time again to Elijah but he found himself now in a cave and God said to him Elijah Elijah what are you doing here let me ask you this evening what are you doing here Elijah why are you here at this Youth Camp why are you here this evening why are you here on your journey amen now we find out that there was many things that was trying to catch the attention of the Prophet Elijah there was earthquakes and there was and there was a thunder and there was all these different things but it never fully caught the attention of the Prophet because the prophet knew that on these uh outward experiences and these outward emotions that he can't depend upon them yeah there's thundering yeah there's these different things yeah it's happening all around me but I'm still not completely captivated with it yet I hear it but it hasn't got my attention just quite yet brother Branham said in the sermon what what do a style here Elijah he said oh how America would have fallen for that he said because Americans they love noise oh they love the great conventions they love the great youth meetings they love the presence of God they love all these different emotions and things that that that comes along with a a a a a a move of God but yet he's seen those things but he wasn't captivated by it enough to go and check it out now brother Branham said America they love these things but Elijah wasn't impressed by those things what doest thou here Elijah why are you here what's your purpose for being here did you come here just to make friends did you come here because you were told to come here did you come here because it's a cool thing to do what was your reason for coming to elf camp what do us now here Elijah what's the intentions that's upon your heart what's the reasonings what's the motives what's what what is what what was it that drawed you to this camp this year because it's a thing to do too many young people are living Youth Camp to Youth Camp and they go to a youth camp and they say oh well praise the Lord I I felt the presence of God and it was so good and it was so wonderful and oh my I just can't contain it but then when they leave the camp what happens what happens when you go back to your home that's beginning to crumble and break apart as all those feel-good things and and and and that tingly presence that you felt in the crying is that going to hold you at that time what happens when you go home and you fall back into the same uh the same cycle that you were living in before you came to camp is the earthquake going to keep you is the fire going to keep you are these things going to keep you or is it is it the still understand we are descendants of Elijah we are a part of the Elijah Ministry and Elijah was teaching us that hey these sayings are okay but yet that's not what we're depending upon because the earthquakes will go it'll go somewhere else the Thunder it'll Thunder somewhere else but guess what the still small voice of God will never leave you so it's the still Small Voice was the thing that had captivated the thoughts of Elijah understand where we're running to and fro and we're and we're looking for something I want to ask you why are you here and when you come here what are you looking for what is it that you're wanting to see what is it that you're wanting to hear what is it that you're wanting to happen what does it mean when the fire of God Falls in a service does it mean that we get all excited doesn't mean that we run around and do all these different things hey if that's how God leads somebody hey that's good the only thing that you can be as honest between you and God but what happens is one person does it and everybody else starts to do it well who's the real one and who's not so what happens now is it was that still small voice that captivated Elijah why are you here and what are you wanting to see I feel like we have we have been conditioned that uh in order for a church service to be a a really good on a really Dynamic service that there's got to be a whole lot of noise brother Branham said that God is in The Quiet Things go listen to the sermon what do us thou hear Elijah he said have you ever heard the sunrise have you ever heard the grass grow have you ever heard the sunset have you ever heard these things we haven't heard at one time but yet it's so powerful it's our source of life but yet there's no noise behind it you talk about a natural thing being a type of the spiritual he says we're we're conditioned that we want them we're looking for these things but let me ask you what happens when those things don't happen in our service do you think it's not a good church service well I didn't feel anything and I didn't see anything and I came to see this and it didn't happen and I went to see that and that didn't happen and well let me just tell you yeah it was okay we've been conditioned to hear the outside noise and attractions but the voice of God is still it is small and when that voice speaks to the True believer's Heart there's an attraction to it there's something that happens it causes a reaction in your life oh my this guy whispered the whole time but yet something happened within my heart something changed I don't understand it it was a service like I've I've never been in before it seemed everybody was so quiet and there was nothing that was really happening and this guy he was just whispering but yet this still small voice of God it spoke to my heart and it changed my life the voice of God is what attracts the believer the voice of God Is What It attracts the believer that he goes out of his cave and he wonders Lord where are you why are you here and what are you Desiring to see what are you Desiring to happen what are you Desiring to take place the reason why you should be here is because you want to have an experience with God you want something to happen because no doubt there's things in your life and there's things in my life because we are human beings and we are carnal there's things that really get you down there's things that really bother you why am I like that why do I react like that why does this happen in my life why why why I just want this to be taken away from me I wonder by the preaching of the word would you accept it that it was taken away from you well I didn't feel anything I didn't see anything nothing happened but all I know is my goodness something has changed in my life now if you came here and you're looking for a girlfriend you're looking for a boyfriend you're looking for all these different things I pray as the sermons go on and and brother Burley begins to preach and the word of God and the inspiration I trust that this this that the reason why you came here if it wasn't for the word of God and having a closer relationship with God that it will change you say yeah I came for carnal reasons sure I did I came because it's cool it came for this reason but there's something that's happening on My reasonings is changing to something spiritual that my life would change and God would take me another level higher than what I was when I came here what is it that does it it's still it's quiet he's like a dove it's like a sheep quiet make sensitive you know that you don't heard you don't you don't treat sheep like you do with cattle you treat Cattle Man you get a big old stick and you just beat them all day ah get in here yeah but with a sheep you know how a sheep is rounded into his pen let's buy a sheepdog you know why sometimes God has to let Satan loosen your life because he loves you and he's trying to round you up to bring you in with the rest of the sheep to bring you into the fold because where there is numbers as a sheep that's where there's safety what do us down here Elijah why are you here what's your reasonings for yeah I know you're on a journey we're all on a journey the wonderful thing about a journey is everybody's journey is different everybody's experience on that journey is different and so it is as Sons and Daughters of God I I want you to understand that each and every one of you are are an individual and God deals with us as Gentiles as individuals and so the journey that God will take you on and the experience that God will give you will be different than the experience and the journey that he has taken somebody else so therefore you cannot live your life on somebody else's experience but it's got to be your own personal experience and whatever happens in that experience it is true to you between you and God and nobody can take it away from you that's why it's important for us as ministers not to just say well well this is what happened me and this is what happened and if you come in the same the same way that I did guess what God will do something the exact same thing for you and he'll change your life just like you did mine what's wrong with that there's nothing wrong with that but guess what now you're all going to want to act like me and trust me you don't want to act like me just ask my wife she lives with me 24 7. and so it's important for you to recognize the still small voice as there's many voices and many noises and many different things and louder you see that's trying to catch our attention social media the internet the cell phone all these different things friends at school trying to be cool trying to do this and not trying to make more money whatever you want to whatever you want to put it as Satan has got a lot of noise in your life and he's trying to catch your attention but God has also got a voice as a musician's come I'll bring this to a close God also has got a voice and that voice is still the voice is quiet that voice is Meek and that voice is lonely it is the sweetest voice that I ever did here and when he speaks it's so sweet but yet it has an authority so let me encourage you this evening as we spend our time throughout this Youth Camp and we do different activities and we do different things and and whatever it may be I want to I want to encourage you to get alone with God foreign [Music] well you're not going to hear it by a bunch of shouting you're not going to hear it by all this noise that you surround yourself with you're not going to hear it when you're playing volleyball that's for sure when we play the activities tomorrow on the field guess what chances are of you hearing the voice of God are extremely extremely Slim unless God convicts you of your carnality and playing sports because we all know that Sports brings out the best and the worst in every person [Music] it'll bring out our pride it'll bring out this it'll it'll bring out our our attitude of being a sorry loser [Music] my team didn't win yeah Sports brings it out really good how are you going to hear that still small voice first of all you're going to hear it by getting along with God you're going to hear it by getting along with God and spending five minutes in prayer because when you start with five minutes in prayer it'll turn to Six Minutes in prayer the next time and it'll go from six minutes to prayer to seven minutes of prayer to the next time and what you do when you're done praying what happens you read the word and you say father your word is your voice your word is your life your word is the things that have been written in your mind Lord this is this is God in word form so if you want to hear from God how can you hear from him read the word but it starts by getting alone with God [Music] no doubt some of you will say well none of the other boys are doing it here's what all the other boys are doing none of the other girls are doing it they'll they'll just think that I'm uh think I'm righteous and all self-righteous and all these different things who cares what other people think when you're making a step toward God that when we have our free time and the activities are over that when we go for a walk we see this person sitting under a tree spending time with God and praying for the service and we walk a little further and we say wow look at this one there's two there's three what's wrong with these kids I'll tell you what's wrong with them they're getting right with God they're sensitizing their heart because they have a desire that they want to hear this still small voice of God but you have to play your part you have to make the first step you have to be swallow your pride because the Bible says a man that does not pray he's prideful in his spirit [Music] swallow your pride I'm with God I don't care if it's only five minutes I could venture to say that it was five minutes more than the previous day that you spent with God and then before service guess what you're in here 30 minutes early not at seven o'clock when the when the musicians start not at seven o'clock when we get up here and we and we give our our daily schedule no 30 minutes early why because we're sensitizing ourselves why am I sensitizing my heart because I have a desire that I want to hear the voice of God so if You'll Play Your Part if you'll humble yourself if you'll take time out of your day God will take time to spend with you and don't come before God with some preconceived ideas no just come with god with an with an open heart and say Lord whatever happens happens whatever you do you do whatever you don't do Lord you don't do it but I'm just expecting you to do something in my life and guess what brother Branham taught us he said when you expect something from God that God will meet the expectations of your heart that's so untrusting I'm trying to encourage you I'll do it with you how many of you guys would want to do this what time is the devotion in the morning seven many of you guys would like to get up at 6 30. and we'll meet over here you see over out here where they have all this wood that they're going to burn or whatever this is for the guys girls meet with the counselor go do something else I'm gonna be there 6 30 tomorrow morning and if you want to join me in prayer ain't no Bible study ain't no reading the word ain't no teaching ain't none of this stuff brother Brandon said you do that when the pastor is there right yeah so what do we do we're gonna go we're gonna get together we're gonna pray it's for the counselors as well girls if you want to get with a counselor go meet somewhere and pray to God read your Bible your to yourself whatever but spend time with God and let's see if it makes a difference in our services let's see if it makes a difference in your spiritual life let's see if it softens your heart let's see if it softens your spirit you're saying brother Stephen uh you're really putting yourself out there because I know that God is Not mocked and I know that whatever you sow to that's what you're going to read it's a law of God just like gravity throw something up it's gonna come down you reap something to God that's what you're good you sow something to God that's what you're going to reap from God and so I know because it's a law of God I won't make you raise your hand to see if you'll join me or not but I'll be there whether I'm there with you or whether I'm there by myself I'll be there I'd be real happy if some of you would join me stand to her feet this evening let's sing this God bless you thank you for listening thank you for paying attention different kind of a service I know but I want you to realize that you can't just be carnal and expect something from God but there's something spiritual in our lives or something that we have to take a step towards God to do and when we do it God will meet us there amen let's sing This Together Jesus love you Jesus [Music] foreign [Music] yes sir [Music] to see us through somebody say praise God Hallelujah I'm glad that you're here and I believe that we're going to have a great time in the Lord and I believe you're going to learn new things and I think God is going to add to your faith virtue virtue knowledge knowledge temperance till you come to the stature of a perfect man sit down if you would for just a moment we're going to have our camp speaker he's going to introduce himself to you many of you do not know him brother Burley Williams he's a fine brother he loves God and he's got a lot of experiences he's going to be sharing experiences with you about the things what God has done in his life amen and I want to thank each and every one of you that have taken the time to come and be here with us and I'm just under great expectation that God is going to do something you can take people and you can entertain them and you can have fun and all of that and look young people like to do young people things that's great but the main thing is that God might through a couple of these services do something in your heart that'll change you forever God bless you brother Burley come here my friend [Applause] [Music] praise the Lord praise the Lord amen it certainly is good to be here we thank God for his grace and mercy how many you enjoyed the word it's very important you come to hear the still small voice of God where God can speak directly to you those things are very very important uh my name is burley Williams uh some I see some familiar faces we're from now South Carolina and uh a long way from here but we thank God for being here it's different Heat just terrible heat up here I'm like wow this is when I stepped out to church last night time I stepped out the door I said this is just insane the heat but there's a Hollow Place than this we don't want to go is that right so we're just thankful to be here and uh to share the word of God with you my myself I wish when uh I was you guys age I would have had somebody to preach to me I didn't I come straight from the streets I come into the message where the message come to me when I was 24 years old straight from the street no denomination no church life nothing and I'm so glad God called me that way because he didn't have to get the denomination out of me but he had to get sin out of me so you young people you're privileged to grow up in the message but you're more of a privilege the message coming you um I'd like to encourage you with all of the when the brother was ministering about different voices there's so many different voices today like the prophet said there are Church voices their political voices they're all kind of voices and there's nothing but a bunch of distractions but I'll say this to you uh I'm the type of person I believe in the power of the Holy Spirit I believe God is a keeper can we say Amen the Bible tells us that grieve's not the holy spirit for there until you're sealed until the day of your Redemption I'm so thankful that God did not call us to fix our problems he want to fix them God want to take care of our problems that's what gives him the glory when you know he is the one that changed you you did not change yourself um I'm just thankful to be here to share the words of life with you share the gospel with you and I always get all excited when I have an opportunity to speak to the young people because it's very important the first Exodus we see what the enemy tried to do kill the young people second Exodus the same pattern get the young people through heroin from pharaoh to Heron so we're in the Third Exodus what you think the enemy got in his mind to get the younger generation the cycle don't change the patterns don't change but I want to say something to you and uh I'm trying my best to be quick brother and sisters we wrestle not against flesh and blood but Powers Spirits principalities the devil is real he's a deceiver he comes so many different ways but I'm here to let you know also God is real Jimmy say praise the Lord I want to say something to you and and I trust that your applied to your heart how many of you ever read a story uh brother Brandon talk about a little girl lost her mind and she kept talking about I know Johnny loves me I know Johnny loves me how many of you are familiar with that story okay not many of you but if you get a chance look in the message type up I know Johnny loves me just punch it into it's going to come up in a message I think it's come follow me that's what that mess is going to come up if you get a chance listen to that and I'm just going to share something brief because that's one of the most important it's a very important lesson in that message to me in that message it was a young girl a boy had promised her to marry her and all sorts of things and then he broke it off but when he broke it off with her she actually lost her mind because it was a shock and she kept saying I know Johnny loves me I know Johnny loves me and yet he had went and married another girl and blamed his father for his decision this young girl was I can't remember how old brother Brandon said she was she had a heart problem she came to the prayer line and God touched her and and healed her heart he said but this time she got a different heart problem it's a spiritual heart problem so when he began to talk to this girl she kept saying I know Johnny loves me I know Johnny loves me and she came into the presence of the prophet he began to talk to her when he begins to talk to her a vision came and when the vision came he told that girl something that her some transaction took place with her between her and that boy and she he said she knew nobody could have known it so God showed a vision and when God showed that vision and he told that girl what they did he said he said this to her he said why are you coming out of this little world because it shook her when he made the statement he said now I got you out of that little world he said I want to punch you to Calvary what that girl had did I want you to listen to it yourself he said what that girl had did because of what that boy had done to her she created a world and she lived in it and she could say Johnny I know Johnny loves me I know Johnny loves me she created that world and then the prophet says this you and I when you were born again believer you have the power inside of you to go create a world and you can go live on him he said if it wasn't a law to stop that we would do that how many of you believe that yeah better here to tell you you have the power in you to go create another world to live on which is a good one but you also can create a wrong world and live in it you see the things that you do every day the things you partake of the music you listen to moves and things you watch it creates a world around you and you can get spirits on you and you'll start living in them here's the thing I pray to God when but a Brandon told that girl she snapped out of that little world he said now look toward Carrie it took prophetic a prophetic thing to take place to make her snap out of that world so my prayer is that God would bless this Camp so much that the anointing of the word could come if you don't got yourself trapped in some wrong worlds that when you let God just come in your heart you can snap out of those worlds and look towards Calvary because it's very easy to create them you can create a world nobody wants me what girl will ever want me what boy would ever want me you can create that world and go live in it I'm here to tell you that somebody wants you that's the Lord Jesus Christ he wants you I say and now listen to my brother pour out his heart what this Camp is is an investment how many of you ever studied the message investment investment if you in here and finances and everything you always when you invest in something you want something out of it right so this is an investment and we want something out of it what is it that we want to see you you here if you don't have an experience with God you get one before you leave but if you hear with an experience with God we hope that you can go higher in your experiences with God because we're in different levels of life here sitting here this evening but there's one God that can solve all our problems and take us to the place you want us to be if we let him I know you're tired I'm tired I'm supposed to be in the bed right now the three-hour difference but this means more to me than sleep than anything and I tell you I would listen to The Young Brother 35 years old it's a blessing to see young people that was themselves in Camp now they don't come to a place their ministers they can preach to you because I'm not getting no younger but when I could see a young man don't gotta hope to God don't got a hope to his life he can relate to you a whole lot more things than we can that really disturbs up my heart so God bless you brother but young people I'ma tell you I can share a long experiences with you and some things it just happened recently but if I get in that I wind up preaching I'm not gonna I was I'm just supposed to do an introduction but God's presence is here and I can feel the poor I really can in an atmosphere like this is actually very easy to preach but I can tell you some things that it just happened recently and I'll go over some things just be very very careful don't try to see how close you can live to the world and think you're okay I'm telling you it ain't gonna work when I come into this message at 24 years old I never had a desire how close can I be to the world and be okay my only interest was Lord what do you want me to do to stay away from the world whatever I need to stay away from I'm willing to do it so may God bless you I like the theme of the camp and I believe uh we'll have some wonderful services and pray for me and uh may God bless you I'll just leave it there brother run [Applause] praise the Lord okay so we are going to go from here and we're going to do
