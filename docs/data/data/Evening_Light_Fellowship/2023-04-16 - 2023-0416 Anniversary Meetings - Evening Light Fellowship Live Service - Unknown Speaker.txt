will move and he won't leave you short change today Amen Brother Martin amen God bless you amen it's good to be in the house of the Lord David said I was glad amen we're not in the hospital this morning we have our hands we have our feet we have our our lips our mouth we can praise him this morning amen that's a lot you know he's given us a lot this morning so I want to just greet you again in the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ and bring greetings from the Saints again in Canada as I said last night we're praying there's many praying for these meetings amen and it's good to just good to be here not necessarily here but it was good to be out there last night it's good to be seen and not heard amen but uh God has a purpose for everything amen maybe just be seated for a minute I just want to say something here just in a way of introduction you know things are God does things in unexpected ways and you know just with uh being with brother Andreas in this last month or I guess it was a little over a month now it seems like just yesterday I was in Germany but it was just this last month I was with him and we spoke for him in in his church and we had a wonderful time just a wonderful time and some really Supernatural things that were going on in the church I didn't know about and he can testify that but I was just so enjoying the messages the last two nights and and I was telling my wife last night I was saying you know I believe God has something really special for us tomorrow so so she knows she knows I'm special needs but she didn't think it would be me amen but here we are amen I want to appreciate brother Ron and and sister Sandy and the church and the deconstructees and treasures all the all the helpers and everyone that contributes here God bless you amen you make this meeting it's you that make this meeting amen Without You there'll be no one to preach to amen so you are the important one that's why God said I send you Elijah the prophet you are the more important one amen so I want to appreciate that and brother Ron I met him so many years ago the first time I met him uh I think I don't know brother on it was in the early 80s I don't know when you were uh we were having a convention in Edmonton and uh we were expecting brother Donnie Reagan and yes were you in Edmonton or you was there yeah you were there wow wow so he was there and uh brother Reagan couldn't come he was delayed did he come I don't think he didn't came yeah so you know God had a pinch hitter amen God had a pinch hitter and he knocked it out of the park it wasn't a pinch hitter we thought who is this guy who is this Ron Peterson never heard of his name before we're expecting brother Donnie Reagan and Noah yes no who's this guy so instead of pinch hitting or you know just he just hit it right out of the park and I remember what he was preaching on and and Lucifer and Satan's right-hand man and different things that were going on in the church that just settled the whole thing it for me it just settled my heart and I thought that was the connection brother that was it that was just you know you just you know I've never lifted him up on a pedestal because that's dangerous that's dangerous for the man amen we don't want to do that but something just clicked that's that's what we need God knows what we need God sets in the church Apostles prophets teachers pastors evangelists so anyway that's that was my first experience there with hearing brother Ron and you know we want to thank God for this morning just the opportunity to share the word but we were at uh we're in Tucson and we we visited the military uh veterans uh veteran in the military at the Pima Air Force range and he was 100 years old sitting there in front of his B-17 know that he flew in the second world war and I got to talk to him and listen to his stories and you know it was just wonderful and I just thanked him for his service you know and he said that his first mission he was going to fly out somewhere over Germany I don't know if it was Berlin where it was they were they were doing some bombing and he said he came down with this sickness and he got he got tested the doctor said well you got to go to the hospital you're you know you got yellow jaundice or hepatitis and he says I don't feel that so they shipped him over there sure enough yeah you got to stay here for a week anyway he was delayed he got back to the barracks he said you know what he said and he wrote up he wrote a little book on it also he said all of my crew all the mattresses were folded up and the clothes were taken away and he said you better sit down he said his captain said you better sit down and and take a drink he said because he said they all were shot down on that first mission and he said so he says you know he said sometimes it's a good thing to be in the hospital he's you know and he survived I think he survived 30 30 more missions bombing missions oh and you know the the just it was just miraculous you know I just thought that's predestination amen so all things work together for good amen so let's stand and we'll just go to the word right away I don't want to keep you long today just been so enjoying the messages amen and just really uh praying for our brother and he'll have to come back and and finish that message amen or I'll have to go to Germany and hear it amen I hope he comes here so Hebrews chapter 2 we'll we'll take a a few verses there and I want to read from Isaiah also Hebrews chapter 2 and we'll start with verse one how many love the Lord nice to see a full house amen and just the faces amen and I see these brothers here in the front row just coming back from Africa you know just seeing your faces that's what I remember about the mission field I see their faces another round they're in my and I can't get away from it I keep trying to run and then now it's somebody else's turn now it's somebody else's turn remember God has a Time amen so Hebrews chapter 2 and just before we do let's pray once more father we want to thank you for your the opportunity to read your word this morning Father we know that in Revelations chapter 5 when you came as a lamb and opened a book no man was Worthy to take the book or even look on the book but this morning Lord we're taking the book we're eating the book we're looking on it we're reading it we're understanding it Lord what a blessing it is just to read the word and understand where we're at today Father we thank you for the messages brother Andreas has labored and he roared like a lion here father oh God return his strength I pray father God just Lord we know all things work together for good father and we just commit him to you and ourselves now take the word the speaker and the hear will give you the glory in Jesus Christ's name amen amen chapter 2 of Hebrews um Paul speaking about the Angels here prior to this and uh but here he goes into chapter two he says therefore we ought to give the more Earnest heed to the things which we have heard less at any time we should let them slip I think we need to be earnest about what we've heard this weekend we did we need to be more earnest the prophet said he needed to be more sincere amen so for if the word spoken by Angels was steadfast and the prophet said there those angels are prophets not spiritual Angels flying around he said those are Prophet Messengers if the word spoken by Angels was steadfast in every transgression Disobedience received a just recompense of reward how shall we escape if we neglect so great a Salvation which at first began to be spoken of by the Lord and was confirmed by us unto us by them that heard him amen how shall we escape the prophet said God help that man that walks away from the message how shall we escape amen Isaiah chapter 6 amen we're talking about brother Andreas was talking about the number six and it just happened it falls on this this text this morning um here Isaiah you know I I'm I'm 63 brother Ron and I believe this is this is my going to be my greatest year six is the number of man and three is the number of perfection he's going to perfect that what he started in me and each one of us amen so in in chapter 6 verse 1 in the year King Uzziah died I also saw the Lord sitting on a throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple now the the prophet said his train was the angels I always thought it was just a like a bride and A Train That's what I had in my mind but the prophet sees the vision and he said it's his angels his angels following him so he said they fill the temple and it stood and above it stood the seraphims each one had six wings Twain he covered his face twenty he covered his feet and with Twain he did fly and one Cried unto another it said holy holy holy we forget that you know sometimes we forget you know I was watching you sisters yesterday walk in with your children and your dress and the way you present yourself and I just thought that's pleasing that's what the Lord wants people today they say well that doesn't matter it matters to God the way you dress the way you behave the way you present yourself God bless you sisters God bless you mothers and raising families in this message God bless you there's a blessing on you amen so the Lord so one cry to another said holy holy holy is the Lord of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory and the pulse of the door moved that the voice of him that cried and the house was filled with smoke something like the temple last night we heard about the temple fill with the glory of God then it said I woe is me for I am undone because I am a man of unclean lips and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips for mine eyes have seen the king the Lord of hosts then flew one of the seraphims unto me having a live coal in his hand which he had taken from the tongues from off the Altar and he said and he laid it upon my mouth and said Lo this has touched thy lips and iniquity is taken away and thy sin is purged amen that's what I want to be this morning amen God take a call of the word laid on my lips amen that I'd speak you what you want me to speak amen also I heard the voice of the Lord saying now who shall I sin and who will go for for us then said I hear am I send me amen is that your prayer this morning amen God bless you may be seated may the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of his word this morning as we we want to share a thought with you amen you just pray for me this morning amen I thought I was dreaming and I when I saw Ron Peterson on the phone I said I might am I just dreaming this but am I going to pinch myself here but uh I told brother Ron you know if you're if you're in Africa no matter if you're in the Congo or you're in Ghana or you're in South Africa or you're in Malawi or you're in Mozambique or you're in Kenya or you're in Sudan amen you've got to be instant in season out of season amen just at any time amen so uh like I was saying we just got back from there and I'm not going to give a mission report I'm just going to share the word but it's just hard for me to hold back on Mission reports amen it's just uh it's just been a blessing to serve the Lord on the mission field on these years and um I want to take this text this morning on the administration an influence of angels the administration and the influence of angels you know we're under an administration of angels only the bride amen that's why you're a special group of people behold I'll send you Elijah the prophet amen the the prophet messenger messenger means angel behold I'll send you an angel in this age amen and it's just a privilege to to stand like brother Ron said with men that believe this message that believe it I mean really believe it so we we uh we want to lay a little Foundation and uh to this because foundations are important um my my main feel of uh education was Power Engineering which is boilers and turbines and electrical generators and that's what turns on the lights amen and boiling that Steam and the stimulation of Revelation oh I can get all these types out of out of my job you know I just really pound it down there you know because I have experience with boilers you know and uh so anyway I just I just love to talk about that but we'll talk about a foundation this morning you know Foundation is important because I I later went into Home Inspections so I I call my business future home inspections because we got a future home aim at brother Amos that's why I want to I want to be identified with this message on everything I do to be identified with this message so you know you go to Africa it's the grace of God hair Hardware you know they name their business after grace of God Hardware well it's that's good they want to be associated amen with God so nothing wrong with that so the you know as a home inspector when you see a foundation that people ask you well look at this big crack in my Foundation or you know what what happened there is it is it the quality of the cement or the the concrete or what what happened there you know well I said their settlement and you know what's the problem is it's the base preparation it's not the it's not the concrete it's not as much cement in it or rebar but it's the base preparation that has to be right the soil conditions if the soil is wrong it's it's going to show up cracks cracks are going to show up and the building's going to sink now think of that spiritually this morning some people started out but you know what they're found they're Foundation cracks all over the floods but they're seeing their own cracks it's not it's not God's church it's not God's Building it's their their Foundation was wrong the soil is right then it'll bring forth and as brother Andreas was saying we just got a war now amen so you know it's a time in the message you know there's there's environmental change there's a climate change in the world there's these things we you know we try to deny we got to be in that word all the way now Saints like brother Andreas now is we we can't play Church amen and we want to fulfill that purpose because God has a purpose and we want our purpose to be his purpose amen so these seraphims you know that talk about the the administration of a prophet uh if the if the administration or if the word spoken by Angels was steadfast and sure a sure word of Prophecy we've had in this age amen it's more sure it's actually infallible the message is infallible like brother Andrea said now you're talking about Humanity that's not that's fallible amen the mankind is the god kind that's infallible see the the office was infallible and the problem Lord Jesus Christ the prophet said he's done he's done more in my Ministry than he did in his own so who would have the power of infallibility whoa we're following a infallible message that well this mistake and that mistake yes any man could make a mistake any man can have a flaw but we're not looking at the man you know one man said one time God never protected this amen I find I see no fault Amen in him and that's who I was looking it was never about brother Brown the brand I'm only only pointed me to Jesus Christ and revealed more of himself amen so it sounds like a missionary text but it's not it's much more than that you know because here Isaiah Isaiah here he he's he's coming to the into the presence of the Lord he's coming under the influence now of angels oh God went to God that we come under the influence of angels this morning amen and and get in and stay and and get in that presence like he was that's an awesome place amen and I remember brother bicycle telling his story when the age of the Lord came in with him and brother we're not built for that but we do have angels amen we do have positions and uh you know Isaiah here he's or yeah he's leaning the prophet said in the message influence he's leaning on the arm of Flesh he's leading on the king the king had done great things for God and the kingdom of God and and he got lifted up and you know people start lifting that up and and maybe Isaiah himself lifted him up that's the danger in this day that's a danger in the message amen lifting men up oh God the prophet never lifted himself up amen he said oh and see how small you can be that was a success because he could make himself small enough that God could use him oh my so you know Isaiah you know he saw he thought Uzziah could take the place of God a minister you know he's not your Holy Ghost amen your pastor is not your Holy Ghost that's good lots of evidence amen he and just give him wisdom but you know he's not your Holy Ghost I say I I I was under brother hillebrandt for about 35 years but uh you know I always said that he never ever gave me a revelation not once he preached the word and the Holy Spirit gave me a revelation he had a gift to put it together but it's the holy ghost that gives us revelation amen and some people you know they take on the spirit of the pastor instead of the spirit of the Holy Ghost God help us it's too late now to be following man amen you need your own Holy Ghost Amen to receive that word so you know no one your parents no one can take the place of the Holy Ghost and uh you know I'm not much for I'm not much for church spirits amen I'm not much for uh National spirits you know people try to bring their nationality or their culture into the message we've got one culture and that's the word that that dominates over all the other cultures like I said I'm not a Canadian I'm not an American I'm not an African I'm a Christian we are Christians we're all one body amen but you know you'll sometimes see that German spirits you know you'll see uh I'll mention other names besides German so we don't Point them out too much African
