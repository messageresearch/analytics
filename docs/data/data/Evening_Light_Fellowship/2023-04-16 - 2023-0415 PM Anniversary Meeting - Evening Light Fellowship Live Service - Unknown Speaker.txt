it's a blessing to be here this evening to have all of you to celebrate with us for 30 years an anniversary of God having done something here in the Maricopa Valley and everything that I uh just a little personal testimony 1987 while I was in the Black Forest the schwarzvallet in Germany it was there I went down to hear Brother Lonnie Jenkins so I could hear somebody preach in English went down there and uh I had been sent over by Brother Floyd Patterson who was our pastor at that time from Flagstaff he was also when brother Roy borders died he took over spoken word Publications and he had asked my wife and I if we would move to Germany to start the first Outreach of spoken word Publication books anywhere in the world and if we would move to Europe to do it and we said we would do that we moved there in 1984. and we packed up everything took our three kids we thought we'd homeschool them found out you cannot homeschool in Germany you had to send them to school and so all three of our kids had to learn German we didn't know nothing about German not yeah you know we didn't know any Expressions you know and so we we were there in 1984 and after about a year and a half brother Joseph Branham when he had took over uh spoken word Publications you all you the older ones the older ones you'll remember in order to get the books you had to write to spoken word Publications and there you got the books and then if you wanted tapes you had to write to Fred softman who was in Tucson at the time to get the tapes well when Brother Joseph uh took over when Brother Floyd went ahead and and gave it over to Joseph it wound up that uh we changed it from spoken republications to voice of God Recordings and Brother Joseph and brother Billy Paul came over and they inherited the work that we were already doing and Brother Joseph said would you stay on for about another six months and then I will get somebody to replace you and yes that's fine we're uh we are American and and Germany's not our home is very very hard for uh you if you're living in a foreign country and you don't speak uh the language and my wife especially going to go to the grocery store if it doesn't have a picture on the can you you can't figure out what's in it is it green beans or carrots or whatever you know and so the lord gave us Grace and we were what turned from six months was for another three and a half years so from 84 to 89 we were there in Germany and while we were over there the Lord allowed us to um to speak in many of the churches I think in the five years that we were there we missed only two Sundays in five years of not being in church somewhere we traveled an average of about five to five and a half hours One Direction every Sunday to go to church my children lived in the car with us because it's traveling every every Sunday and so it was but in part of that um brother Hermann ringen who was up in Balkan Veda up in Northern Germany between Hamburg and and Bremen they had a little Farmhouse up there and brother Andreas he gave his testimony this morning of of a little bit um of what had happened up there but long story short it wound up we were having meetings and this is about almost 38 years ago or so that the Lord allowed us to be over there when Sandy and I went over there how old was I Sandy at 32 something like that 32 years old just a young Punk it's a young kid you know but loved God and and was over there and and anyway it wound up there's been several times in my life that God has given me a vision and one of the times that God gave me a vision we were at The Farmhouse which is brother andreas's Father's Farm there in Germany and um I woke that morning I saw a vision I broke into a vision never had had one before and I saw it perfectly I saw myself preaching I saw the the way the young people were sitting and everything and I heard what sermon I was preaching now you have to understand when you young people when you heard his testimony today that's the first time I've heard it from his side I've always told it from my side and we know that God works on both ends does he not if God is dealing with one he's dealing with another it's not just a one-sided thing and so we were there broke into this Vision I told my wife about it I was excited but when I stepped into that Farmhouse that day I stepped into the vision I want you to understand when you step in and you see something and it's exactly what you saw it is empowering I can't tell you uh it's empowering and so I knew I I said God here it is this exactly uh as it was in a I went and I began preaching and now you have to understand I don't know the the young people I have no idea who sued and their lives and as The Story Goes brother Andreas raised in a Christian message believe in family but they had no church no Pastor up there and you know how it is young people they start growing up they start going wrong direction long story short here he is a young boy struggling and he needed something for God to put something in his life because he loved God he just didn't know how to serve him and he said God I need you to speak to me and he says if you'll have brother Ron to call me out now Imagine This and here I am in this vision and in this vision I can see this young man he's back and uh I I call him out I said brother stand up and say you love the Lord and the three sis four sisters that were sitting right here up in the front very close to me and they turned around to see who it was well he's probably excuse me but the worst young person in the group and these girls start snickering like boy if this pastor ever that well I wasn't a pastor then I just a preacher boy if this preacher ever made a mistake you blew it your discernment's way off man this guy ain't gonna say nothing he got up and has his testimony is it was exactly what he had prayed for and God called him out and here we are all these years later and I was so blessed this morning and if you all get an opportunity and you want to to hear the testimony of what God did on his part you go it's already archived on our our website there but um it wound up that there began a work even among the young people throughout Europe and that Revival fire has never died down and when God does something he does it well somebody give him praise tonight and so I just want to say that I am so pleased tonight to be associated with the greatest people on the face of the Earth the people that believe the message of Malachi 4. amen this you did not go looking for this message this message came looking for you brother Branham said you do not seek God God seeks you if God has ever called you if he's ever uh uh Gone looking for you let me tell you God is better than any RCMP God gets his man amen and his woman amen so we're just so very very pleased this evening to have all of you so in 1987 there in the black forest of Germany and I had spoke to brother Lonnie Jenkins I said brother Lonnie I don't know what to do I said I I am not German I don't feel to stay here this is not my country and I said God you need to do something and brother Lonnie he told me and if any of you knew him he was a very wise man he measured his words he said brother Ron I've never seen a young man like yourself into a position but what God is fixing to place him he said neutralize yourself to the will of God and he says God will place you a day or two later as I'm walking through the forest there in beaselsburg the Holy Spirit very very genuinely sincerely spoke to my heart I knew it I knew it was God and he says go to Phoenix and start a church that was 1987. I didn't get here until 92 but God knows just what he's doing he's got everything prepared amen and as we drove into the City Pioneer Road you guys North no Pioneer Road up here just north of town my son Amos and I were riding in the car together Sandy and the other two kids in the other vehicle in front of us and I said I want to pull into uh Pioneer Road there I want to stop so Amos and I got out and I went out into the desert and I said father I says I have gone I went to Silsbee Texas for you Lord I said it was for a man because he asked me to go I said then I went over to Europe because a man asked me to go and I said but father I am coming by a Divine vision and a word that you have spoke to me to come to Phoenix Arizona to start a church and there he and I knelt down do you remember that Amos I remember reaching my hand into the sand on my knees and I said father I come here now to this Maricopa Valley in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and I claim every elect seed that is in this city and I said if you have sent me here I know that what you will do you will send a people because what God will do even the book of Acts the Apostle Paul had the Holy Spirit deal with him and said go to this city I have much seed in that City you remember that and see God working on both ends and here we are 30 years later you know and I time goes by so quickly but I'm very very pleased to have our brother Andreas ring and he is a pastor there in Northern Germany and I'm very very pleased and I whatever is on his heart now I'm going to turn the service brother Mark would you uh sing us a song and uh what we'll do and then have you to come brother Andreas I I welcome you in the name of the Lord I am pleased to see the gift of God when he called you out [Music] little did you or I know that all these years later a pastoring a group of people you'd be traveling the world into many countries carrying this gospel over the heart as a burden to take it to other peoples

want to speak on a on a little subject on Dedicated To Worship and uh I again I want to speak on dedication uh which uh but the dedication to worship not only dedication for worship but dedicated to worship because we are here to worship amen that's why we are here we are here to worship amen and God wants to be worshiped amen and by the grace of the lord we want to a little bit enlarge the the subject of worship amen because I believe it's uh it's such a vital thing today you worship anyhow amen so better worship Him amen so dedicated to worship second chronicles we want to read from the 5th chapter 13 and 14. we want to read and you know it's very actually known scripture of the dedication of the temple and we just jump into the middle of the Bible and we maybe try to go a little later from before the foundation of the world from the beginning how things really developed and I tell you this is the way you are developing so we have to start just in the middle of it just to start somewhere okay second chronicles uh 5 13 and it came to pass even as the trumpeters and singers whereas one to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the lord and when they lifted up their voices with the trumpets and symbols and instruments of music and praise the Lord saying for he is God for his Mercy endures forever that then the house was filled with the cloud even the house of the Lord so that the priest could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud for the glory of the Lord had filled the house of God amen what a wonderful thing that is amen and then then watch because I think this is this is very remarkable then we want to read from chapter 6 verse 1. and because now Solomon Solomon now is starting his dedicational service amen Solomon seeing that amen and and I wonder I wonder what Solomon really has seen when he starts speaking now then said Solomon the Lord has said that he would dwell in the thick Darkness amen what a profound what an amazing statement amen seeing that now Solomon's saying the Lord is dwelling in thick Darkness he's seeing the worship amen he's seeing worship and then he's saying he's inspired to say oh the Lord is dwelling in thick Darkness that means the Lord is working in a mysterious way Hallelujah he's doing that amen he's working in a mysterious way so we it will it will guide us a little bit on our way then go to Revelations 13 verse 8. Revelations 13 verse 8 we want to read very well a well-known scripture amen Revelation 13 verse 8 and all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the book of the life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world amen what a what a statement Hallelujah let us pray dear heavenly father we are coming so rejoicing and and thankful again before your throne of grace and mercy father and we ask father may you guide and lead us this evening into into a true worship father we pray father that we can understand what you desire from us what your heart's desire is why you made us why you created us why we are here on Earth we understand we are not here on Earth for ourselves what we are here on Earth for a Divine Divine Purpose father and we ask to help us to step into our Divine Purpose we ask you father and may it be all for the honor and Glory of your name and father and just bless the church bless the pastor bless brother Ron in a mighty way father and and just help us and just let help us just to continue that work that you have placed upon our hearts father we ask it all for your honor and For Your Glory in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you you may be seated in the presence of the Lord amen so a dedicated to worship as we have as we have seen and and I want to start maybe with her with because it's it will be about worship it will be about this is really something that that dwara was pondering also about you know his anniversary coming here and and uh and and so it's it's all together it is all together about worship and to be dedicated to worship and uh as brother Brennan was using that um in in the message dedication he made that statement from there actually I I got really inspired and brother Adam is praying here he said now my sincere prayer is that every worshiper will dedicate his own Temple to worship in a temple that has been dedicated for worship that's the real dedication so he the prophet said he said so that we will dedicate his own Temple to worship in the temple that's been dedicated for worship so this judge building is dedicated for worship but you are Dedicated To Worship amen and this is how the prophet really made it made it made it I think so clear that we are here to worship then brother Adam said in the in the message a statue of a perfect man he said listen it is God condescending to his creation God wants to be worshiped the word god means object of worship and is God now trying to condition his people so that that he can get from them what he created them for Hallelujah so now God wants to get from us what he created us for and who's willing this evening to just join in amen join in that worship and that worship is more than just to say words more than just to say Amen that goes together that you know it's more than to sing but that worship finally is expression amen who's ready that can say Lord I Want To Worship and if we worship then we allow him to express himself in the way that he wants to express himself this is what God is looking for this is his desire he wants worshiper remember how we we saw yesterday the woman at the well he was telling her the father he's seeking worshiper worshiper that worship Him in spirit and in truth amen so it is the father keep that in mind it is the father that is looking for worshiper it is not the son but it is the father amen it is the father and we will see that from the beginning then brother random continued a little bit he said he said now he said God in the Bible he said he said Stephen as he said in the Bible the most high don't dwell in temples made with hands for Heaven is my throne and the Earth is my footstool and where is the place of my rest but the body has thou prepared me amen there you are listen and a body has now prepared me God dwells in this nature of men reflecting himself into that being that's perfect worship if he can reflect his being in you that's perfect worship God in us being his Tabernacle God manifesting oh brother and said wonderful thing amen so God dwells in the Statue of a man reflecting himself into that being perfect worship Hallelujah and I really because as we have read Revelation 13 verse 8. and as we see today the the world in the condition as it is in and Revelation 13 verse 8 tells us that finally all will worship amen so all will worship all will worship the enemy when will that happen is it not happening now look around go out look around what do you see so worship is more than we think it is because you understand that All Shall worship Him and do you believe today we're living in a world but the whole world is worshiping is that right you see governments are worshiping churches are worshiping amen and they are not worshiping Jesus Christ the prophet said they are worshiping the devil to make it plain but go to the churches what do you hear what do you think they sing nice songs they sing songs about Jesus Christ and yet they are worshiping Satan so I think it's really it's really good to look at this subject a Little Closer because we want to worship the right thing right amen We Want To Worship in spirit and in truth not just only in spirit but also in truth what is the truth the Vindicated word for this hour Hallelujah and if we understand that worship is more than than just making a sound amen we will see that because if the whole world is worshiping tell you go around who is worshiping Satan do you see nobody on the street praying to Satan you see nobody on the street or wherever you are just making nice words or just singing to Satan no but the Bible said All Shall worship Him and it is happening around you amen it is happening around us so the whole world is worshiping can we say Amen to that so you see worship is much more than we think I think also it maybe it's it's good to have a little bit closer look how the prophet really uh brought things and brother Branham said in the message Satan Eden the God of this world today the worshiped person of this world today is Satan and the people are ignorant of worshiping Satan but it is Satan impersonating himself as a church as a church they worship Satan thinking that they are worshiping God through the church but it's a way Satan has done it amen God of this evil age brother random said he wasn't spoke of God in the edge of Noah he said listen Satan doesn't spoke of God of any other age but this age he wasn't spoke of the god of the age of Noah he wasn't spoke of of the god of the age of Moses a god of the age of Elijah but in this evil age oh don't miss it he is the God of this evil age worshiped by millions and billions of people and they don't know it but let the scripture uncover him this morning and exceed and you will know let's see the scripture so let us see let us the scripture uncover him so that we understand that we understand that our worship is towards God and God is Desiring a worship from us we've seen so many and that worship what we see in the world is today you see the there's so many uh things or can I call it attributes or things of Satan being manifested you see all around us what evil is being manifested becoming flesh is that right amen people call it Liberty but actually they are bound they're total bounds they're tools in the hand of the enemy so the enemy can express himself through them and they're just expressing that all the dirt that is in the enemy Hallelujah that is the worship finally that is the worship that we are talking of and we are Dedicated To Worship Amen to allow God that he can express himself in us in our lives so he can live himself out that is true worship Hallelujah and this is what the father this is the desire of the father this is really what the father has for a desire is to be worshiped see and and we see as we have said it or read it also yesterday uh it was it was it was it was actually God why we started in the the Garden of Eden and we saw what God was doing in Eden it was the father it was God himself we jump now in Eden just for a short while and then maybe we go back to before the foundation of the world because there we see actually how it really started but here in Eden as God has made had made a place for worship which is called the Garden of Eden that was the place for worship and then he put things into Eden that became places to worship amen so Eden was for worship and Adam and Eve was to worship that's why God created them remember oh God help us remember how the Bible said that all things are created his own pleasure and when we have read in second chronicles that Solomon said that God dwells in darkness he understood he looked down the road I believe he could see it how in in what kind of a special way God would generate worship amen you believe that all things are created for his pleasure who created the devil who created evil all I tell you is this what Solomon have seen as he was dedicated and seeing the worship he could see my goodness the way what God was doing this is really mysterious so all things are created for his own pleasure he creates them God needs evil God needs the evil to show that he is a good god without the evil things we would not really appreciate a good God do you think God created the devil not knowing what would go on surely he knew what would go on amen he's God he knows everything he knows the end from the beginning and even he created Satan as his right hand man knowing what he would do amen knowing what he would do so that he created them allow me to say that because he needed him Hallelujah church this bad thing happening around us bad thing evil things happening with you but but hope we get it we need that God allows that so can that he can manifest through you what is all in him Hallelujah we are not at the end of the end of that God is just manifesting we're coming to the final church because the as the prophet would say all that God was is now in the in Christ and all that Christ was is now in the church all that God was was his attributes this is what God is God is his attributes and you were one of them is it right so on those attributes that God was is now in the church waiting just for the right time and circumstances to be expressed I tell you when I heard the song that then sings my soul my savior got to thee How Great Thou Art I said praise the lord we serve a mighty God Hallelujah we serve a living God amen there's a God that you cannot put into a box he can do whatever he wants he don't have to hurt my permission you don't have to ask your permission he does what he wants because he is God don't put him in a box don't box him down he's God and he wants to unveil himself so when Solomon saw that he said he what what must he have seen I don't know but I will for my I can imagine what he saw when he when he saw the dedication when he saw we know now what happened with the temple after a while that wonderful Temple that beautiful Temple that Solomon built it that wonderful Temple that the Lord filled with his Spirit after a couple of years was destroyed amen why was God allowing that he was generating worship Hallelujah the whole church there's things around us that we feel that should not happen to us we feel those things may this is it's not good it's evil yes but God allows them because he knows what's inside of you he knows what he created you for and he wants to see that through you manifest it but behind that all stands the father it is it is God allow me quickly to jump how the prophets and I'm so glad we had a prophet is that I tell you if we wouldn't had him we would be deceived totally like the first church was deceived quickly because the things come so different than we think and expect and wouldn't we have the prophet for it amen wouldn't we have the prophet for it we would be deceived we we will look at things is that that's evil that's not good yes and maybe even we would pray against it but it is God just God allowing it to prove who he is we have our category good and bad there will be good people in hell and bad people in heaven why do I say that because we have our we have our you understand that that that good young man the Rich Young Ruler he was a good guy he was a good boy from its youth but he opened his eyes in hell when he left the scene the prophet would say every flag was on you know was it was just it was just a wonderful man he was a good guy and everything that people would say about him at his funeral you know how surely he made his way to heaven I mean he was such a good boy he he just we understand that he opened his eyes in hell and we all understand remember how it was with David and Saul we don't understand that church sometimes hard to understand but you know where Saul was the prophet told him tomorrow you will be with me and he became an enemy to God so may God help us that we get out of every box that we leave every camp the prophet called us out of every camp come out of her my people come out of every camp every denominational thinking come out because you are called out to manifest God in its entirety that's why we are here for church we are not here to play church we are not here just to to warm the seeds we are not just here to pay tithes and offering that's wonderful we should do that but we are here for a Divine Purpose to reveal all that God is excuse me when I get excited because I see the father I see the Lord I see the Lord moving amongst us and you understand it is such a mystery it is it is such a thick darkness that the devil don't know it honestly if the devil would understood what he would do to Jesus he would have pluck him from the cross is it under it says sorry look how many bad things happen to Jesus how he cried at the cross how he cried my God my God why herself forsaken me and he was not playing he was not playing a game this is what he cried out this is what he felt and the devil thought the devil thought I got him but little later he understood that make a biggest mistake of my life and one day Satan will understand all the evil things he put upon you he made the biggest mistake in his life because of those situations you were able to manifest all that God is thank you amen can a mother can God you know at one time Israel was asking themselves the question you can fight it in Jeremiah you can find a Jeremiah and also the Israel were asking does God love us is God still with us and God would tell his people can a mother forget her suckling child and we understand no mother can forget his subling child unless she is completely out of her mind but God cannot be out of his mind because he is the mind so can can a mother and then the Bible said maybe a mother can forget but God said but I can never forget you you know why God cannot forget you because you are his thoughts that's why he cannot forget you because you belong to him and God just wanted to teach Israel tell Israel I can never forget you I have a plan yeah I just have a plan with you you are my chosen people not because you are the nicest you are stubborn people God said is that right not because they were the nicest people and they were there the handsome people and really now he said God said you are stubborn people but yet I have chosen you I have chosen you so has God chosen the elect the bride like he chose Israel so he chose the bride for what for expression because God said I found in you Israel equality no one else can express myself like you Hallelujah amen so let's let us be dedicated to that worship that's all about dedication like we saw yesterday you know understand why why it is why it is good to have inventory once in a while just to see what is occupying you how Satan in the beginning like we said yesterday and I think it becomes very clear who is standing behind it it was not Adam standing behind is trying to manifest himself it was the father he said to Adam you know Adam you have nothing to do with that do you know that the inheritance that we have it's not an inheritance that Jesus Christ Is inheriting Us brother Adam said Jesus never left you an inheritance he died for your inheritance he said but it is God leaving you an inheritance that's why Paul could say we are Heirs of God through Jesus Christ Hallelujah now he is again the father just just I just he couldn't get away from that it is the father I could see how brother Branham could say in Christ The Mystery of God revealed how you said you know he said why do you hang a church why do you thirst it is the father trying to reveal these things to you it is the father Church behind it it's the father behind that is God almighty Christ is the mystery of God revealed Jesus never came to reveal the son he came to reveal whom the father Hallelujah he came to reveal the father and he got so misunderstood by the people while he was unveiling the father why he was showing how great God Is So when all the religious world had him boxed and fixed here came Jesus and they cast a woman before him you understand that caught in adultery and they all knew what the box is saying they all knew what the law was telling them then they asked Jesus what do you say about this you know what he's at whom of you is without sin you throw the first stone he was expressing another side of God this was not just Jesus feeling sorry for that woman this was not human sympathy amen that was almighty God revealed because Jesus could do nothing unless the father shows him so he was The Father revealed all the fullness dwelleth in him is that right and he was just there not his own but he was just there manifesting what the father wanted he said this is my meat to do the will of God is that also our meet this evening to do the will of God to allow God to be God Hallelujah let us allow God to be God Church even in 2023 that God is still God and he can do whatever he wants it is the father behind it it is God behind the church he made it so clear
