presence that's here this morning Hallelujah Hallelujah Jesus yesterday I was meditating and um there was a thought that kept coming to mind this is where the songs are coming from it's uh it was the power of praise when um in the 2 Chronicles 20 when Jehosaphat was king of Judah and the children of Moab were coming down against them to fight they sought the Lord and were praying and then there was a prophecy that came forth and said you're not going to need to fight just stand there watch the glory of God but shortly afterwards they go out to face the enemy and they're standing in Array and they sent the Levites out to sing praise as soon as they started to sing the Lord confused the enemy and they started to fight each other and just slayed each other and it's funny after it's like that's about verse 22 if you keep reading it says they were 3 days in the spoil of the enemy 3 days the Lord wiped them out completely and then gave them extra on top of that that's the power of praise you look at Paul and Silas that's the power of praise hallelujah amen I feel like praising praising him oh I feel like praising praising him oh I feel like praising praising him oh praise him

let's just remain standing as we go to the word this morning we go to Luke 17 Matthew 18 and Luke 19 amen thank you musicians appreciate those that sang songs God richly blessed them helps set atmosphere gets things Hearts prepared amen how many believe that God's got it all in control oh amen there's nothing happening that is going on right now but what uh God knew before the foundation of the world that it would happen that's right so therefore we have confidence in him and whatever goes on that he knows the beginning from the end uh we certainly had a lovely wedding uh with brother Israel Sister Mariah and to all our visitors and family that are here today God richly bless you amen uh so uh we you've all been welcomed and I want to thank Amos he went ahead and painted parts of the church here in the last few days uh I came into my office this morning I noticed things were a little different and you know Steven McNeely comes in he says can you smell that while I've had surgery and I said no I can't smell it and well it's fresh paint oh yeah yeah okay but anyway thank you Amos I appreciate you doing that I'd like you to please send me the invoice and I'll repay you for your labor of love uh I go in Monday for eye surgery Monday eye surgery this this eye this time not this eye so by the time this one's healed up then this one gets done actually uh to be honest with you I'm I'm scheduled for a hip replacement a knee replacement come on a whole body change it's called a Rapture Hallelujah huh we can fix this old broken down vessel all you want but I need a whole new change I somebody say amen glory to God God bless you yeah yeah amen so amen Hallelujah some of us yeah our bodies have broken down a little you know it ain't the model it's the mileage and some of the mileage you know we've just wore these things out enough and uh you remember as a young man you just run and you play and you you know you can hurt and yourself fall down and you know stuff well as you get older it's a little different story um and you know I remember brother Ed Dalton Papa Ed we called him we sang that song you can run through a troop and leap over a wall he said you know brother Ron I've been there he says but in my age he says I go around the troop and I look for a a gate in a wall you know amen so that's how it is with some of us even David when he went out and was fighting with one of the the sons of Goliath there and he was going to get killed and one of his men come and saved David and everything and uh you know David said well I'm as good as I was when I was young well in your mind amen you know in your mind age is just uh in your mind until you get older and then you realize that your body just doesn't react my wife's father he was very fit man a a German wellb built he'd worked hard his whole life and one day he came and his he he wore shorts you know and he was a contractor well anyway he come and his leg was all bruised up and bloody and and you know I think he had a scab on his forehead and everything and I said what happened he said well I come up to the job site little kindy little tiny ditch he says I I I come up to the edge of it and he said well you know I'm just gonna jump and he says so I said jump and my body said no and he said I landed down there he said halfway across he realized his body said no so there are times when your body tells you no amen even though you feel like doing it but one of these days saints of God and I believe it's very soon we're going to have in a moment in the twinkling of an eye there's going to be a change Hallelujah I'm looking forward to that one I tell you am Luke 17: 29 and 30 but in the day that lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all so when God delivers one he judges another amen even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed Matthew 18:1 the Bible says for the son of man has come to save that which was lost so here's the mission of the son of man I come to save that which was lost Luke 19: 9 and 10 and Jesus said unto him this day speaking about zakus this day is salvation come to this house for so much as he also is a son of Abraham for the son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost thank you Lord may God add the bless blessing to the reading of his word you all may be seated this morning in the presence of God I am titling this this morning the revealing of the son of man part three uh and we'll do a little bit of uh Meandering around a little bit this morning I trust that uh you will kind of follow me uh because I've had so much actually this morning when I got done typing my notes I had 22 Pages 22 Pages it just keeps coming coming coming you type you you do all of this and I'm I I really go crazy with cut and paste and uh but I don't want to be labor a point I don't want to um reiterate myself too much and so therefore when I bring these quotes up before you what I'd like to do is have you to read and read and and those uh my tech team is going to have to follow with me because I want to go a little bit quickly I am not going to try to attempt to go over uh 22 pages I cut it down to 18 we'll see how far I get on 18 and uh so You' be praying for me but I want all of you to understand that there is something happening right now globally amen it is not only happening globally but it's happening personally it is happening into each of God's elect bride the Bible says to those whose names are written in the Lamb's Book of Life they shall not be deceived Hallelujah so you know that you that are the elect seed brother brandom talks about that Royal Seed of Abraham he talks about it he says now when they catch the word he said it is not them that's catching it it's not by intellect it's not because they prayed so much it's not because of the things that they did but the mere fact that they are elect seed and because they are elect seed they have an ability there is a receiver Jesus said he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit is saying to the church so all of us I want to claim each and every one of you that are here today that you too will claim the fact I am an elect seed of God therefore whatever God says in this hour I will hear whatever I hear I will practice and whatever I practice will become a manifestation than you Lord we've seen I uh just in the last couple weeks we've seen the solar eclipse we've seen the War start in Israel with on yam kapor 50 years to the date that it happened uh 50 years ago global leaders are now concerned uh major um leaders all over the world are concerned and they're saying the war is going to escalate into something greater my brother my sister let me tell you all of these are flashing red lights of the signs of his coming but he's got it all in control amen God knows just what he's doing Netanyahu said just the other day he said the Hezbollah the Hamas the Isis are the same as what it was during the time of naziism during the Holocaust Iran is now sending in troops on the northern border of Israel and hezel is is start has started attacking the nation of Israel we pray for Israel God is with Israel no matter how much they try to wipe it out God protects his people now let me just give you a warning here Sidetrack just a moment that these same atrocities these horrible things that I don't even like to mention over the pulpit but you've heard of them you've heard of the killings and the mothers and the children and all of the atrocities you say how can anyone of any conscious or any kind of a mind how could they consciously do this well it's because it's a spirit it's been turned over brother Brenham said those pre-tribulation Spirits in Hitler molini and Stalin and now here they are manifesting themselves and my brother my sister understand them same atrocities are going to be carried over after the bride is gone there's no more blood and judgment strikes the earth and the the fourth horse rider the peel horse rider begins to ride and when he does death and Hell follow him you think it's bad now you just wait then he'll kill they will kill the two witnesses Moses and Elijah they will kill the 144,000 and they will also martyr the Christians that have been left over so if you don't make a St stand now you'll make a stand then I say God let me stand now let his blood be upon me I take my side now with Jesus Christ I am not ashamed oh God let me if I need to be a reproach against this world Hallelujah I do not fit in I'm not a part of this my kingdom is another kingdom [Music] Hallelujah thank flashing red lights of the signs of his coming let me reiterate I read this last time but I want to read it again if you don't mind Luke 21: 20 through 32 and when you shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies then know that desolation thereof is nigh then let them that are in Judea flee to the mountains let them which are in the midst of the uh of it depart out let not them that are in the countries enter there into see uh uh closing borders in verse 24 and they shall fall by the edge of the sword and shall be led away captive in to All Nations and Jerusalem shall be trotten down of the Gentiles until somebody say until until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled amen let me just tell all of you and make this declaration we are fulfilling now the final moments of the Gentile dispensation and there shall be signs in the Sun and in the moon and in the stars and upon the Earth distress of nations with perplexity and the Sea and waves uh roaring men's Hearts failing them for fear and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth for the powers of Heaven shall be shaken and then you shall see the son of man coming in a cloud how many of you can say I've seen it I've seen the son of man had come they took the picture we didn't take it what was it he said the white hair of his wig there he was the Ancient of Days a son of man manifestation coming in the cloud with power and great glory and when these things begin to come come to pass then look up and lift up your heads for your Redemption draweth nigh I tell you what he's coming he's coming soon Hallelujah I believe my brother my sister we are seeing the final grains of the sands of time in that hourglass if Israel is the time peace I tell you she's ready to strike the Midnight Hour amen Hallelujah I'm not I'm not worried Why Should I Worry why should I fear my house has got to blood I'm under the token let the death angel pass they'll fall on this side and they'll fall on that side but God has got something over you he's got a token Covenant his promise shall never fail you his word will never fail you he's got you in his hand you're engraved thank you Lord hallelujah behold the Fig Tree and all the trees and now shoot forth you see and know your own selves that summer is nigh at hand showing the season amen so likewise when you see these things come to pass know that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand verily I say unto you this generation shall not pass away till all be fulfilled amen and shall I fail to announce to you perhaps some of you don't know but brother Billy Paul has passed away a few days ago a very Gallant Soldier one who the angel of the Lord had chose him and said told his father said when Billy gets converted and he gets older he'll work with you there was no other man in our generation that had seen more signs had been with him in the meetings giving out the prayer cards driving his daddy to the meetings taking him from the meetings knowing when his father had too much he'd been under the anointing too long you see it in the movie cuz I asked Billy how did you know when he'd been under the anointing too long I could see Daddy he started to stagger like a drunk man and said he'd look around and he doesn't know where he's at he'd wipe his face are you are you the Usher sir yes cuz he always had him come from the right because the angel was standing to his right and he says and when the people you've seen it in the movies when they they come into the presence of that angel they're a little bit shocked he said don't let that stop you don't be afraid that's him that's his presence and so you would see and he says we had a thing that when I felt Daddy was having too much I would come up there and he said I had a cue to put my hand on his right side and he says if Daddy was W couldn't go any further he would just fall back into my arms I would reach around and grab his Bible you see it in the movie reach around grab his Bible and look to the man like okay I'm taking him away and he said if daddyy felt he wanted to go on he'd touch Billy's right hand and let him know go let me go on my brother my sister this messenger that we have had in this our day I do not need to to try to vindicate it I don't need to try to defend it it defends itself amen God watch over his word his messenger and this message we don't need to explain it I don't need to try to to make something fit I just say what he says our brother Billy Paul recently passing away and I've had different ones call and ask me and ones say uh well what about that cuz brother brandham had told him that before you're an old man he passed away at 88 years old 88 said before you're an old man sharks will be be swimming here in this area and so I want you to understand I am not here to try to explain to try to interpret but to just say what he said if you if you research this out and you type in the word shark or sharks he only mentions Sharks two times in all his message he never says this on tape he said say what I say on tape now I was with Billy I traveled with him I asked him and because I'm from Los Angeles how many of you know I'm from Los Angeles I'm one of those Ricky those long-haired dope smoking serent hippie that brother Brenham called Ricky and in fact God stood up for me one day and told his Prophet don't you call him Ricky and ricettas cuz I got some seed out there hallah Hallelujah I was a Ricky until I got converted I was one of those little City Slickers I wasn't no country boy no I don't claim to be I was born in Los Angeles Pasadena California my it's a good place to be from amen I just say that am now let me tell you we have witnessed within our lifetime I'm talking about me we've witnessed certain stirrings among the message Believers right one that all of you will know is 1977 brother Brenham said that I predict as a private student of the word of God that I believe it will 1977 will terminate the world system and Usher in Millennium how many know he said that so there was a lot of speculation because he said it and we thought oh my 1977 it's going to be over some people went ahead and you know bought houses and trucks and different things because you know what uh 1978 we're going to be out of here so let's let's just go get something and drive something nice for a few weeks now he said I predict I do not prophesy he said I might miss it 5 years 10 years or whatever now my brother my sister that's why we do not not interpret what he said God is his own interpreter he brings his word to pass how he wants to now I want to show you a couple things and the reason I take certain things about California Los Angeles very serious is because I was there in fact brother Mike Patterson raise your hand over here brother Mike was at the meeting when brother Brenham preached choosing a bride he was there he witnessed it he was in California he had businesses his father was one part of the Full Gospel businessman that brought brother Brenham to Los Angeles the reason we moved out of California was because of the prophecy amen now let me show you a few things if you don't mind I'm going to Rabbit Trail just a little bit but stay with me I want you to see some things because I don't want you to misinterpret in 19 65 brother Brenham says in this day the scripture is fulfilled how could people ever fail to see who he was how did they ever miss it how could it be when it was so plainly made known and shed how could they ever missed seeing what a word think of it this day is the scripture fulfilled before your eyes who said it God himself who is The Interpreter of his own word this day is this scripture fulfilled the Messiah himself standing in the presence of the congregation and reading a word out of the Bible pertaining to himself and then saying this day today this scripture is fulfilled and they failed to see it what a tragedy it would be but it happened and it happened many times how could it happen of course like it did in other times by believing man's interpretation of the word that caused it those Believers in them days so-called Believers was taking the interpretation of what the priest had said about the scriptures brother Braham said don't take some man's interpretation don't take their opinion take and say what I say on the tape why because I'm ordained of God to say these things so when I talk about Los Angeles and the prophecy of Los Angeles Don Saunders you're one of them also too that come Mount of California here's the prediction about Los Angeles now I'm going to give you a prediction in 1964 December 1227 watch this who do you say this is here in Phoenix Arizona the world's just about to fall apart as I preached once somewhere about a Christmas message the world falling apart in fact brother Brenham preaches that four times but the first time he preaches the world falling apart is the the week after the opening of the seventh seal so follow it chronologically and the world again is just about to come to Pieces look at the earthquakes over here in California I predict this is 1964 he doesn't prophesy until 65 he says I predict before the coming of the Lord Jesus that God will sink that place I believe that Hollywood and Los Angeles and them filthy places over there that that God Almighty will sink them they'll go beneath the bottom of the sea sink them they'll go beneath the bottom of the sea here comes the prophecy in 1965 brother Brenham there in Los Angeles California he you you all know the service you're very much well aware of it it is an iconic message within all the messages themselves brother Brenham now prophesies oh capern said Jesus who exalted in into heaven will be brought down into hell for if the mighty Works have been done in Sodom and Gomorrah it had been standing to this day and Sodom and gomorra lays in the bottom of the Dead Sea and a Capernaum is in the bottom of the sea thou City who claims to be the City of Angels who who has exalted yourself into heaven and sent all the dirty filthy things and Fashions and things till even foreign countries come here to pick up our filth and send it away to our fine churches and Steeples and so forth the way you do remember one day you'll be laying in the bottom of the sea your great honeycomb under you right now the wrath of God is beling beneath you how much longer he will hold this Sandbar hanging out over that when that ocean out yonder a mile deep will slide in there Plumb back to the sult and sea see It'll be worse than the last days of Pompei repent Los Angeles oh and if you've ever heard that tape you hear a woo you hear a screaming in a crying repent and turn to God 196 5 brother Brandon picks this up anointed ones at the end time and Micah remember he was smitten remember Mah was smitten and that man said where did the spirit of go God go when I smote you watch what brother Bram said Mah said to him not write out to his say face but other words you're Anointed with a lion spirit I have thus sayith the Lord now he's talking about the man says I have thus sayith the Lord smacked him and said which way the spirit of God go when it left me Mah said you'll find out one of these days when California is Beneath the Sea out yonder and all these thing hey Mya never said that who said it spirit of God the same one that was in Mah when all the others are prophesying other things here M said you'll see one of these days when La sinks huh thinking man's fil 1965 now your time has come oh United States how the God would have hovered over you as a hen does its brood but you would not nations are breaking the world is falling apart, 1500 mile chunk of it 3 or 400 miles wide sink 100 maybe 40 miles down to that great fault out yonder one of these days and waves will shoot Plumb back into the state of Kentucky when that happens let me tell you be a a a major catastrophe you won't have to wait for CNN or Fox News or somebody to say oh guess what Los Angeles just sunk no you'll know it and when it does it'll shake the world so hard that everything on top of it will shake down very quickly two things I want to tell you in 1969 I was surfing the four islands of Hawaii backpacking I met a friend of mine in alamana Shopping Center High School buddy of mine he was a senior I was a junior my junior year Easter vacation we served over four islands and there I met him in the alamoana shopping center and I I saw him he's in the Sailor suit I said hey buddy man what are you doing why weren't you in school he said my junior year I quit school and I've joined the Navy and I'm on America's Most uh nuclear submarine the the newest in the American Fleet he said would you like to see it are you kidding me here I'm 18 years old 17 and wow yeah so Pearl Harbor we go to Pearl Harbor we wait for hours to get the security clearance we get to go through the summary long story short how deep can you go that's classified how how long do you stay down that's classified we ask all these classified classified he said but because you're from Monrovia California I'm from Los Angeles born and raised in that area and he says I've been on this nuclear submarine 28 miles back under under the underneath the shelf of California so I heard this in 1969 that when I heard in 1971 brother Braham said California it's it's a honeycomb I said amen why because I knew I I me your pastor was on the submarine talking to the man and him telling me that this submarine was 28 milesi and he said we could have gone further but a submarine doesn't pass or excuse me it doesn't back out when it gets too narrow What do the submarine do it doesn't have a review mirror and it backs out of that no it's got to do the forward and half thrusters and turn itself around it goes by sonar oh my my brother my sister in fact there were some that the prophet of God himself he told them brother Mike Patterson's Brother Floyd Patterson was out hunting excuse me wasn't hunting first time he met brother brandham introduced to him he said uh my name is Floyd Patterson I'm from California and brother brandham if I remember correctly he says oh I didn't know there was any men left in California brother Floyd's eyes raised up a little bit he said I tell you what the same God that told me about the seals and the same God that's revealed all these things is the same God that's telling me to tell you right now to get out of it so when we talk about Los Angeles sinking and sharks swimming there I take it very seriously amen you understand now let me just show you something brother Brenham in in the sermon the Rapture and hope you're from Kentucky has there been big waves all the way back up into Kentucky yet in the sermon of rapture Los Angeles is doomed and she's finished I don't know when I can tell I Can't Tell You Jesus said Capernaum capernum how off you that's exalted yourself rather into heaven shall be brought down into hell for the mighty works that have been done in you had been done in Sodom it has stood today and about 1550 years from there Sodom had already in the earth in the earth then Capernaum is in the water too today and that same spirit of God that said all these things and done all these things it said oh City Capernaum who called yourself by the name of angels Los Angelus how you've exalted yourself into heaven the very root and seat of Satan see you've exalted yourself preachers it's a graveyard for them good men go there and die like rats that's what he said you call yourself by the name of angels if the mighty Works have been done in some Sodom that have been done in you it had stood today but your hour has come you watch and see if it ain't I'm a false prophet so this Prophecy of the destruction of Los Angeles is not going to be some kind of little shaking it's not going to be on the city limits where just Los Angeles city limits proper are going to go down it's going to be a major catastrophe hallelujah how many how many of you believe that amen I take it very seriously amen now let me share with you personal testimony sister Rebecca Smith I talked to George Smith about this about four days ago as he he had called me concerning the passing of brother Billy I said while we were how many of you remember the Maryland church we were over on Maryland this how many years ago when they were coming to our church her and brother George for about a year and a half they came to our church she considered me and called me her pastor she called me at one time and she said brother Ron Billy's very sick if you all remember years ago he got real sick had to lose a bunch of weight the doctor said you need to you need to walk and so on and so forth but anyway she says brother Ron Billy is near unto death right now would it offend you or would you be stumbled if he were to pass away I said no Rebecca I would not she says why wouldn't you be I believe that many people in the message will be stumble if Billy Paul passes before the earthquake and I said well brother Brenham doesn't say it on tape he's talking to his son they're in a casual conversation they're walking downtown I believe it's April of 65 they're walking downtown I asked Billy Billy tell me this exactly to so I know I'm from La I want to know what was it that told you he said well we were we were downtown and we were just walking he said Billy where are you he said I'm in California he said no be more specific well I'm in downtown LA no more specific I'm in front of May Company in downtown Los Angeles Billy before you're an old man sharks will be swimming here now there's something that's being passed around and I I say this because I noticed it was put on your Elf African Believers chat site prophecy already fulfilled well I want you to be very careful I'm your pastor and would have said nothing because this isn't the first time this has been passed around but people are trying to make something fit I'm from Los Angeles and so I told her I said no Rebecca it won't bother me because you know what I said he doesn't say it on tape it's not thus sayith the Lord otherwise we'd have to say he was a false prophet because Billy Paul already P or or we can say we can go ahead and interpret well Billy's a young man now do you see how we spiritualize or even George Smith said well brother Ron you know what you know what may come is now you know what it is right now it's a motion picture academy uh place where you can go in in and see all kinds of stuff and guess what in the forier they have the great white shark from Jaws hanging above the shark is swimming in May Company in downtown all such nonsense amen don't take the supernatural out of something When God says Hey 1,400 miles a coastline are you kidding me some little shaking no this YouTube's gone around so the prophecy been fulfilled oh my how I'm from La born in Pasadena 14 miles from downtown May Company 14 miles okay any of you made ever ever looked at a map of California and seen Los Angeles or look where May company's at how many of you have ever flown into LAX LA International when you when you take off from La what do you when you take off what do you see right below you ocean what's the sea level it's it's it's right on the coast I looked at it last night Google it up yourself or ask Tim huler and he can he can look and he can get the elevation and all of that that Pilots do when they come and go from certain places it's 106 ft above sea level LAX 106 it's right on the coast it's right there take downtown LA do you know what that is the elevation above sea level it's 325 ft above sea level so now this thing is that oh hey you know what Paul Harvey said there was an earthquake and you know what water went all the way up have you ever looked at the map I want you to see that's 14 to 15 miles and LAX is right there right there Marina del re it's right there on the coast if there would have been an earthquake and a tsunami it had to been a tsunami to go into 14 to 15 miles to come to May Company with well that would have meant 200 ft of water would have LAX Marina del re do you think you'd have heard about it it had have been on the news everyone my parents lived there I never heard oh hey son guess what there was a tsunami that went downtown LA and out of all of the buildings and all of it the only one that got water in the basement was May Company let me appeal to your Common Sense come on amen if that happened there' have been hundreds of thousands of people perhaps drowned devastated by a flood okay because to have that amount of water to come in and why would it only flood the basement of M company so was it a little earthquake and it had a pipeline and it went straight over here and went to me company and so sharks were s women in the basement of May Company got to be kidding me so I appeal to your common sense because if somebody can say this day this scripture this prophecy is fulfilled I say read and what he does say you know what it's a casual conversation that he was having with Billy Paul he doesn't say thus sayth the Lord he doesn't don't try to overs spiritualize something I can walk along you can go with your son you can take your son Jonathan out and you might be talking to him hey Jonathan before I'm an old man thus and thus happened probably this and that and it's just you talking my brother my sister let us say what he says let us stay with the scripture I don't want nobody's opinion now if you want to preach that in your church and you want to tell people it's that's fine you go ahead brother Brenham said he said brandham Tabernacle you voted dman Neville in as your pastor if he wants to preach Jehovah's Witness Doctrine that's fine that's up to him but I say to to you and I'm your pastor and I am held responsible so be real careful passing around these little YouTubes and one says well now this and that and some here say there and some here say over there nonsense stop it God don't need you to try to bring something to pass God don't need you to interpret it God will interpret his word by bringing it to pass and one day 1,400 miles a close Line's going to slip off I was with Dr SC Jacob in madros India he is a doctor professor of geology he says I studied years about earthquakes and I studied geology and he says I've come here to Los Angeles and he says and I studied he said the whole thing of Los Angeles he said it's on pillars and he said the type of sand and the type of geographic geological strata he says it will slip into the ocean when it starts to break the San Andreas Fault when it breaks brother Bram said there below San Diego coming me up through uh uh uh Los Angeles going up north towards San Francisco up into the uan islands come on my brother my sister don't let somebody to try to misinterpret something to you but if you want to believe that you go ahead as far as me no I'm sorry I don't say it's been fulfilled you take it or leave it amen all right all right amen I say say What's on those tapes now let me switch gears because I'm talking about the revealing of the son of man I just had to say that because you know what Monday they ask when is Billy Paul going to be buried Monday about 10:00 in Jeffersonville it's a private ceremony it's not everybody private ceremony that's what Brother Joseph has asked so okay but now all of this stuff being passed around and you know and they made the interview of Billy Paul uh and the different things that's on this when Billy Paul was 83 that's five years ago right 82 83 five six years ago so I I just say my brother my sister I'm not picking on anybody I'm not going after anybody but if you're going to be bold enough to put it out there on the internet saying this day this scripture is fulfilled and passing it around to everybody then I have a right myself as a brother to say sorry I don't swallow it now I'm going to switch gears is that okay come on I'm going to switch gears now and actually go to my sermon this morning on the revealing of the son of man now I want all of you to understand that you and I have all been aware and made uh known a unique Ministry of a man called William brandham and brother brandham began to preach a unique Ministry and he had a unique Ministry now he was not the first one to have Divine Healing that he was preaching to the people in this age he was not go back and read the history he was not there was other Smith Wigglesworth and different ones had healing campaigns in fact Smith Wigglesworth he was so bold that if a woman had a uh a tumor on her neck perhaps a cancer he'd say come here in the name of Jesus Christ and he'd slap her as f as fast and as hard as he could and sometimes these things had fall off in fact I'll have you bear witness brother brandham said you watch Smith's Wiggles were passed away and within within 24 hours I was on the seat go look at the quote so it was not his first and second pull no he just spearheaded a Evangelistic Healing Ministry he did and he went from first pull healing to Second pull discernment now that was far above all the rest of these healers because now he's beginning to discern their hearts you in the red dress yes sister God just you know and you were talking to your husband or you were in the car and you this and I saw the doctor he's telling you you've got this and that are those things true yes yes you see what I'm saying he went far and so as Moses Moes was given two signs you'll be given two signs and so he was given a sign of healing and of discernment but he said that's an attracting pool that gets the people to understand that he's got a message coming it wasn't that wasn't the sign the Halo above his head was not the sign the cloud was not the sign the sign was the voice behind the sign the voice within a voice do you understand there was a picture within the picture and it Bears you witness every one of you it's not everyone that hears a tape understands the revealing many of them saw the ministry a great powerful man of God they saw it but they never understood the ministry behind it amen now all kinds of doctrines all kinds of isms I'm the eighth messenger I'm the Elisha I'm uh uh the minister after brother Brenham I'm the one that's coming after him I have the Joshua Ministry I'm taking the bride over I've seen them all yes sir now watch we got to stay in the middle of the road not follow this fanaticism or this lukewarm starchy God help us stay in the middle of the road anointed ones at the end time follow along the very day that the son of man is revealed Revelations 10 1-7 read it when you get home the seventh Angel's message opening up the seals what is it not the angel is the son of man but the messenger is revealing the son of man can you get it separated now that's where it seems to be so hard for you you see not the son of man himself but the seventh angel the seventh messenger is revealing to the public the son of man because it's left the shock it can't organize it it's grain itself again and in that day Janice and jambre will withstood anointed ones make Believers unbelievers the church formal and the Pentecostals stand up against the true graen and let them alone their Folly will be made manifest as there's with see you understand now you see Hallelujah my brother my sister we got to look I'm talking about there is also a change of ministry and a change of administration you see it in every age you see it in every Ministry I've told you the prophet was feeling in his Spirit there's going to be a change in fact he preaches this sermon several times called change of ministry letting us know something's happening he starts in 57 he goes on watch this and come follow me here in Tucson he says I started to turn around the Holy Spirit come upon me I asked Leo for a pen I got a piece of paper I wrote it God will never change the ministry but he will change the man with the ministry that's what's to be done you see see I can't do it in the condition I am now because something has got to happen within me that will take and that will take God to do it I want all of you to understand we can say we got faith to do this we got faith to do that but I want to talk to you about a higher faith not talking about uh just the healing of this body I'm talking about a transformation in this body I'm talking about rapturing faith I'm talking about a faith that's going to rapture you it's going to change you in a moment in a twinkling of an eye I'm not going back because I I want to ask you which is a greater healing spiritual or physical which is greater to have physical eyes open or spiritual eyes open which is greater to see a man who is dead in sin and trespasses to catch the word of God and his eyes come open and you who were dead in sin and in trespasses hath God quickened you which is greater when he becomes born again that's a far greater oh are you listening to me it's far greater than your natural birth praise the Lord everybody want to go back to these healings and stuff the healings never stopped the healings continue why these signs follow them that believe lay hands on the sick they shall recover but there's a higher there's a higher order how many of you believe that listen I'm going to preach here in the near I'm going to give you a future in my back office I wrote down I put it on my Bible in the back of the room I'm going to preach a sermon called who touched me Hallelujah was no prayer line on huh whenever you see somebody body accepting the word getting so excited the word reveal to know your position and when you know your position you stand there as a son I believe and a woman reached out touch a Hem of His Garment and she was straightway healed she had an issue I want to say there the church is full of issues but if you'll have faith to reach out you can be healed right now right where you're sitting Hallelujah I'm not looking to go backward I'm looking to go forward which is greater that you reach out and do like she did I've not seen such Faith KN in all of Israel higher Faith greater than this shall you see the ministry is going to go to a higher order there's going to be a change of administration it was with Jesus he said watch every every great ministry has three polls you know that amen watch Jesus's Ministry now as he focuses on the elect St John 15: 14- 15 ye are my friends if you do whatever I command you if on you are my friends if it's not hearing it's doing henceforth I call you not servants for the servant knoweth not what his Lord doth but I have called your friends for all things that I have heard of my father I have made known to you amen from servants under friends brother Brena said a lot of people you bring to your living room outter Court he said then there are friends that you bring to your dinner table to the kitchen he said that's closer friends hea said that there's only one that you take to the bedroom that that's the one that you have intimacy with are you understanding you see this third poll is not the first in second no those were attractions and I thank God for that thank God I got all the attention of people no man can do these things except God be with him there were so many and I ask you where are all the thousands of people that were told their names where they're from their diseases who were healed from cancers and stuff many of them just like in the Bible they went away from servants to friends change I'm going to change the ministry is going to stay the same why it's Christ it's Christ it's Christ in you fulfilling the word outside of you brother Ram said the identified Christ of all ages what is it it's Christ in you not Jesus Jesus no he said Christ he said it was Christ in David it was Christ in Jeremiah it was Christ in Moses he said it was Christ and that same Christ huh this is that that thing that's been hidden down Through the Ages huh but is now revealed unto his Saints what is it Christ in you the hope of glory don't put it off to somebody else take it to your bosom hallelujah hallelujah amen I take this word of God I take this message very serious and I say everything that he has said is for the bride I say that's mine that's my possession and I'm very zealous over it amen how about [Applause] you mama that's me did you see your refle ction in the message did you see more than a prophet oh I saw a man great man with a Ministry oh he was a good man had all kinds of signs and wonders yeah was good man yeah great and they never saw his message you know what I was never in a meeting oh I wish to God I had been I feel like it was born born out of season amen I wish I'd have been in the meeting I wish I'd have seen it I wish I'd have seen how he carried his Bible I've heard the testimonies brother Bobby you were there brother Michael you were there different ones huh who who were in brother brenham's message Services brother Paul you were there brother Jerry we've got witnesses right here what was it like tell me what was it like what kind of man was he did he have all kinds of arrogancy and Showmanship he was so humble that when he walk forward he red with humility he never made himself somebody big in fact I'll tell you that if you ever had a conversation with him you know who he made feel big you he wanted to know your Tes me he wanted to know what you've done well let me tell you I'm that seventh age messenger I've had an angel come to me and everybody don't you ever stand don't you ever come and question now he wasn't that way humble look at the ministers today I tell you what I sometimes uh am embarrassed at the arrogancy Showmanship oh my show me a little Backwoods preacher somewhere and don't nobody know his name and have the power of God with him Hallelujah who is this mezc 1965 when Abraham met him he was mzc he unfolds here what all the attributes will do in the Final End every son of Abraham listen to this every son of the faith will abs absolutely do the same thing so what you see happen to Abraham will happen to you like father like son God's going to do something in fact the same promises the same covenants that he gave unto your father Abraham he's giving it unto you but you have to claim it for the promise is unto you and

be kidding me I said son right in front of everybody AutoZone right at the cash register you got to be kidding me you you put an earring in your ear do you know what brother Brenham said that the Bible says they will take and they will take an all to the doorpost of the church and they will bore it through to show a sign you will never receive the Gospel again so if any of you are thinking about piercing your ears thank God you know what my son right there at the cash Reger sorry dead thank you Lord I was preaching over in Scotland Stephen mcne how was it Scotland or Ireland excuse me Ireland Ireland Ireland with some of the people you know here I am preaching they got dog calls they got earrings on they got you know this punk rock looking stuff so while I'm preaching and I'm told they're message Believers so what I did I thought well if you're bold enough to sit there with your dog collar on with the spikes on it I'm bold enough to tell you truth amen I said dog cers belong on dogs I began to preach against some of this stuff and the next thing you know while I was preaching earrings coming off now we can preach the law of this message so much we'll get people to conform it's not what we want we want to fall in love with God and When God Says cut your hair guess what they'll cut their hair huh and nobody going to tell me cut my hair I tell you what nobody I got I got converted I'm going to get baptized I walk by the mirror I see my long hair it wasn't real long it was just shoulder length but to me because I've had short hair all and got I still got long hair but it's much shorter I looked in the mirror and I was ashamed it says it's a shame to have long hair as a man but to a woman it's her glory that's why do you sisters let me tell you brother BR said don't you ever cut it don't you ever trim it he said God gave it to you it's a power and because of the angels He said it's an Abomination if you ever cut your hair trim it he said if you cut it off the Apostle Paul said if you're going to cut it cut it all off I looked in the mirror I saw that long hair I threw it back like I I was said I said oh God I'm sorry oh God I'm sorry and now there's a death to self you see when Christ bid you to come he bid you to come and die to follow Christ is to come and die he who seeks to save his life will lose it but he who seeks to say to to lose his life for my sake will find it amen the levitical and ironic priesthood brother brandham said ceased at Calvary he said wasn't destroyed but that Ministry now changes to a greater Ministry you understand it you understand it now there's a change of ministry and now there's going to be a change that it's going to go higher not after levitical and ironic priesthood now MDC same Ministry in a higher level are you following me Jesus Jesus said I did not come to you to destroy the law but to fulfill it Sinai has to answer to Jerusalem the law has to answer to Grace those that are bound under the law have got to be set free under the new birth James 2 and10 says whosoever shall keep the whole law and yet offend in one point he is guilty of la which one of you are perfect in keeping the law Jesus said you should not commit adultery he said I don't come to destroy I tell you if a man looks at a woman how many of you can say I'm without guilt I think every real blooded American have SE so if you've been guilty of one you're guilty of all amen that's why it's got to be by grace through faith thank you Lord amen I'm going to pass up a few things musicians if you come I'm going to close here I got to 11 I got to 11 not to 18 keep going brother thank you brother David one of these days saints of God I I feel we're going to have the presence of God so strong that you know what I can't quit
