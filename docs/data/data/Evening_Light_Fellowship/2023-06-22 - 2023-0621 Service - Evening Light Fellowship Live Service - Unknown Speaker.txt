worship you Praise You Tonight Jesus Christ's name amen amen let's open our Bibles in Isaiah chapter 40 verse 31. amen Isaiah 40 verse 31. but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount up with wings as an eagle as as eagles they shall run and not be wary and they shall walk and not feign may the Lord bless his word we can be seated that title of the message tonight is Nike and I like the last prayer of brother Amos give us victory tonight and Nike means victory amen and I will preach walk run and fly amen when I preach this in uh in Dubai the black Brothers was preaching with me also I was inspired with the with the Believers over there in Dubai and uh I'm so happy that you prayed for me wherever I go I feel the presence of the Lord last time I was with brother Justice Wallace and then last two weeks ago I was with the brother Pierre and the brother David Fritz and I Elias over there in Mexico so I will uh you know the message said they shall Mount up with wings as Eagles if you wait upon the Lord and they shall run and not be wary and they shall walk and that faint you know I was looking at the mount up with wings the the the the meaning of that is to increase gradually in size and quantity so the prophet was preaching about the seven or the 14 feet wings of an eagle and I believe the Bride of the Lord in the last days has a 14 uh fit wings to fly soar above the sky so I will uh we will talk about walking first and we know who walk with the Lord with God and he was not in Genesis chapter 5 21 [Music] Enoch walk with God 300 years and had sons and daughters so Enoch walked 365 years and he was not we know the prophet always say from from 1950s until 65 he never changed his his uh message that Enoch walked with God for 500 years amen and here in Hebrew chapter 11 verse 5 Enoch by faith Enoch was taken away so that he did not see death and was not found because God had taken him for before he was taken he had the testimony that he pleased God so every step that he took every step that he made it was pleasing to God and what was the testimony of Enoch what kind of walk he did we know the prophet said Enoch built the Pyramid and what was the pyramid it was the second Bible Enoch walk with God it's not easy to carry thousands of tons of of uh rocks to shape that uh the uh as a pyramid and the the the science cannot imitate that pyramid up to now because the the blueprint came from God Amen the prophet said here we know I I was uh when when brother um who was that uh preaching a new year um it was you brother right you were preaching Walking with God amen so uh the the prophet said here and you're here to fulfill just walk unconscious of fear so that's what he did I need the water what what unconscious of fear unconscious of criticism walk unconscious unto the world walk as you walk in Christ walk with him not paying any attention to the right or left just keep moving on so this is the prophet was taking the the scripture of Eno and he applied that to the Believers that you walk with god without looking to your right hand or to your left hand are you left the left side or right side or your left side just walk Focus to the Lord amen the prophet said walk with God if the doctor says you're going to die walk with God the doctor says you can't uh can't well walk with God just walk with God that's all for God has promised you I will never leave you nor forsake you and I'll be with you until the end of the world and he took a note by that Covenant that he gave you that he would confirm it just walk with God you he said you have your ups and downs don't worry you go to uh through the Briars or patches over the sharp rocks over blobs down over the hillside up through the mountains over the waters but walk with God yes sir there's so many Hills to climb upward see if you think about walking there was no concrete road that day God if God will lead Enoch to walk on the mountain he will go through he will go down and you will see sometimes there's a a a a deadly Beast that he will meet but God protected him because the message of the Lord in this day just walk with me amen and he was not but I will pass by to this because I have so many things to say if you will allow me maybe I will allow I will preach for two hours but because of Wednesday I will shorten this I thank you brother David amen I salute you all that sits here on the front amen now running here we are running you know the purse Prophet messenger and apostle was Paul and his message most of you are athletes here um I know brother Russell is a hockey player uh uh who else uh brother um so many athletes here uh brother Justin is a volleyball uh first class volleyball player and most of the love balls amen so so here walk run fly run and walk here is Paul was preaching I think Paul was a was an athlete when he was young because most of his preaching was was boxing running run so he was a he was an athlete so in Hebrew chapter 12 verse 1 he said wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a great a uh Cloud the witnesses so uh Paul while we're running there was an audience that giving him encouragement ran Paul run and the first one was Jesus Christ because he said here Cloud the witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the scene which dots so easily beside us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us here's the chapter two looking unto Jesus the author and the finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the Throne of God so he was leading us that if I pass this if I did this she will do it too amen he knows what he's doing you know I was searching race most of this uh uh messages I was working with this uh Greek Lexicon and race means agon so Paul was preaching run the race run with agony agon means agony it's not easy as a runner because you need to train hard to run to to win the crown amen Agony means conflict a struggle a a struggle of Faith to the race and do you experience that all the time I experience this all the time amen a Believer must endure hardship you need to exercise absolute and enduring faith in the word of God and keep your eyes on the goal in the power of the cross despite obstacle and challenges Temptation or even treat or threat of death the Believers continue to run the race sister Nancy right now is running her race and I I want to tell you Sister Nancy I am with you I will cheer you I will say run Sister Nancy amen Hallelujah the prophet said I can see one old guy packing he was making himself light because I'm packing up to go to heaven the prophet said brother I'm not packing up to go to heaven I'm unpacking to go to heaven the Rapture Cut Loose everything you need to lay aside every weight can you see the Nike clothes right now they want the lightest of the clothes they have uh uh uh clothes that if you if you're sweating you run a little bit it will dry because of that that millions of dollars that they spent how to how to perfect the clothes so for the for the runners amen in in First Corinthians chapter 9 26 therefore so run not as uncertainly so fight I not as one that beat the air so Paul was teaching us brother Paul that it's we're done of Shadow Boxing you know sometimes if you're uh Stephen McNally can can do this because uh he was a he was a kickboxer so so when I was young when I was young I like to box and I like to kick box too because that's how you you get money whether you like it or not you loose you in you get money so I was with this uh a group that we go visit uh if there's a festival in the Philippines every month we have festivals because we're Catholic country so I I was a Catholic I was a not good Catholic so so every every Festival we go to the to to join the boxing so I win I lost I'm not a good fighter so but then I learned how to how to box so you one one two and then you uh if it's if it's a kickboxing you can kick but then at the same time Paul was teaching us that it's too you're done Shadow Boxing you need to fight uh hand to hand combat and you don't need gloves you need to fight the enemy with bare hands this is what Paul wants us to do we need to fight him with bare hands and we know he was the loser he lost 10 000 6 000 years ago and he lost two thousand years ago so he was a loser and were the an overcomer so that's why Paul was encouraging us and by the way I was searching tonight that every year we add words in the dictionary 2023 300 more than 300 words they added in the dictionary if there's a words that I will say that you cannot understand that's a new word amen so here's Paul was teaching us how to not to to fight beat the air anymore we need to to face the devil but then here brother Branham he was a he was a professional boxer don't you know brother Branham was 15-0 in the Golden Gloves so 15-0 why he became a a a a good boxer because there was a trainer you need to defend to the trainer a pure not if I I trained myself when I was young that's why I always lost but here brother Branham he had a trainer you know what's the name of the trainer six seconds meet so six seconds meet he was he he he knocked out the air the the opponent for only six seconds oops one two three pass out and here's brother Branham six seconds Smith was training him and look at the how how he trained brother Branham when I first started training for boxing before I got in a professional fighting there used to be a trainer as they called him six seconds meat the first professional fight he had he whipped the man in six seconds and when he started training that man like uh when when I started training that man he liked to kill me he knocked me the he knocked me plump out of the ring and everything else and I was keeping ropes and running seven eight miles every day and taking all the training and I said six why don't you have to do me that way I said you just knocked the breath out of me oh man brother Branham is like a man I I went plump over four ropes come right out of there in the uh in among them chairs and like to broke my back on me he laughed so here's the trainer look Billy he said I don't care how physically fit you are your body has got to be able to stand up come back right quick if you take a Hard Punch said if your body is not used to coming back you're lay there and take the count he said but if your body is used to taking it and then coming back every time you hit or you hit it that shocks the blood runs it back to the heart said if you do that said then your body is used to coming back quick when you get knocked down you're on your feet again see I said that don't mean a thing when you get knocked out down or knocked down up on your feet again quick said you hate me now but you appreciate me when you get out there in the ring and that was right the prophet said the trainer don't baby you that's why the preachers sometimes preach hard here and it seems like hundreds of Believers here why why brother wrong it's keep uh preaching on me why brother Run keep keep picking on me but don't you know brother one don't know you the holy spirit is speaking God is using the lips of the preacher here sometimes you knock out but the prophet said you need to be trained hard so that once you knock down the blood will start all over again to your body go to the heart and you can stand up there was a uh I was sitting on the table of there and there's a wood said don't give up so that was good so run the prophet said here sorry run with message we find the church in anemic condition we ought to be great strong Mighty Warriors of faith that would shake a nation God give it to us we would just receive it so there's little thing upon us that holds us back from running let's lay aside all those little weights now because you're looking into the author of uh author to the author and the finisher of our faith Jesus Christ who was made man on Earth and dwelt Among Us and was made sin that through his righteousness we might be forgiven of our sins he became us sinners that we might become his righteousness so we need a pure in anemic condition right now my brothers and sisters get a a uh uh blood transfusion from uh the process of calvary the blood of Jesus Christ is still fresh and ready to transfuse to you so that you will become strong and mightier again amen running the race oh in second Corinthians 11 23 he said there they are Ministers of Christ here's here's Paul running I will I will show it to you how he run the race it's not easy to run brother Branham Brian uh when he was a boxer he run eight miles a day so Paul hero he was running are they minister of Christ I speak as full I am more in labor more abundant in Stripes above measure in prisons more frequently in debts often and the Jews five times received by 40 Stripes save one 39 5 times twice was I beaten with rods once was stoned twice I suffered shipwreck a night and day I have been in the Deep in Journey or in journeying often in Perils of waters in Perils of robbers in perils by my own countrymen in Paris by the heathens in perils in the city in perils in the wilderness in perils in the sea and in perils among false brethren in weariness and in faithfulness or faithfulness in watching often in the hunger and thirst in fasting often in cold and nakedness this is how Paul run in his day a prophet messenger and apostle amen that's why I cannot wait to to see him brother I will spend ten thousand years talking with him over there how did you overcome Paul who was with me uh you were with me over there in Mexico the the Mexican Brothers was telling us about the experience of the the testimonial brother Ron right so brother Ron had the testimony over there with the with the with uh with the brothers in Mexico and that was like 1980s and they still remember he said brother uh you you need to tell this to brother Ron this is his testimony that we still holding on he said he had a vision that that on that Vision he was in heaven and then he was he was uh so ashamed of himself because here was sitting on the long table was the prophets the apostles and the the great men that they gave their lives in the Lion's uh uh in the arena and here they were talking about their testimony and here was brother one uh uh I don't have a testimony but then there was a voice asking him what age are you came from and he said laodicean age and all of the eyes of those big men like like The Heroes of Faith was looking on him and they cannot believe that you passed the loudest in age you know you we're thinking about Paul we're thinking about the the men and women gave up their lives for the cause of Christ that they will they will rather die burn in the cross kids sometimes you know the story of polycarp he never gave up he said for 65 years God did so much to me how can I deny him and here I was the uh thinking I want to spend time with Paul and I believe the the Believers the the the Believers from the from the past epician age and the titarian age cannot wait to see you also so don't give up amen and here Paul was talking I'm done with Paul almost Paul was talking uh in second Timothy chapter four seven he said I have fought a good fight I have finished my course I have kept the faith henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge shall give me at the day at that day and that to me only but to all of them all of you that love his appearing amen and here if we go to the 10th chapter 10 or chapter 4 verse 10. it said me having love his present world and is departed unto thessalonica syrians to galatia and Titus into Dalmatia so here was Paul and Prophet The Prophet was asking himself he said how did Demas left him and and brother Abraham said Dimas was a a preacher he did not go to to uh to the club and drink beer he said he was still preaching the word but he cannot associate himself with Paul Paul because Paul was an old-time preacher but this man was going to the to the popularity side and here's Paul as I always say a prophet a messenger an apostle very popular preacher but here chapter 13 or verse 13. he said the cloak that I left I throw us which Cyprus when thou comest bring with thee and the books but especially the parchment and Paul have only one coat he was cold when he was writing to Timothy he said can you please bring me that coat that's the only one I left Brothers we are so thankful that God is bless us so much I can open my closet and I still have five coats but this is how he run the word the message in his day if you don't compromise the word brother you are unpopular the people maybe don't even know you amen but here I got where I got my my uh title in First Corinthians 15 55 this is Paul ready to offer himself he said oh death where is thy sting oh gray where is your Nike The Sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law but thanks be to God which giveth us the Nike through our Lord Jesus Christ therefore my beloved Brethren be a steadfast and movable always abounding in the work of the Lord for as much as she know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord you know what is labor the process of childbirth agony your your labor is not in being your Agony is not in vain yet so hard brothers and sisters but I believe the scripture said put God first in your life and all these things will be added unto you you put God first try him test him he will you will see the effect in your children you will see the effect even into your your friends and your neighbors you know if we put God first wherever we go brother we bring Christ I was with uh I was I my my CPR and the first aid was expired so I went to this training and the the trainer was uh asking questions and then uh uh he answered himself because no one did the answer uh his question and you know what I said I said amen wherever you go the word of God is still in your mouth amen so and then everybody was like who is that I was I was in the I was working in the home health uh in Chicago before that was 1997. and you know this uh owner of the Home Health they were not Christians but then they saw me every time I eat I pray and one day I think 2017 their granddaughter did something a disease that the doctor the saint uh the Children's Hospital cannot find the Cure cannot find what kind of disease hit this uh uh girl she was nine years old and this girl was was in coma for six months and you know what they what happened they remembered that Warren that that Warren that always pray and they called me he said Warren are you still in Arizona I said yes I still I'm still here in Arizona can you please go to the Children's Hospital and pray for my granddaughter and you know what was in mind brother Ron so I called brother I texted brother one I said brother Ron will you go with me to the hospital in Saint Luke and brother Ron was not my pastor but you know the willingness the willingness because who wants to see a miracle and we argue anointed in this day that we can bring life we can bring the word of God in this dying and the uh filthy age and brother one said I'll be there when I got there brother one was already outside the door of the hospital so when we went there we talked to the to this uh this uh uh parents and then we prayed and you know what brother on said to that lady to that girl so we put the Bible on her and brother Ron said I want you to go to church this girl was a Catholic and then the next day the the uh Grand I think the grand Aunt sent me uh a photo of the little girl who was smiling for the first time she was smiling and after two weeks she's out of the hospital and you know what she said she said I want to go to the church and the girl right now is going to this uh Palm crop I don't know where is that but Palm crop it's a non-denomination church here in Phoenix and the rest of the family are Catholic she's she's uh 14 years old now see the power of the spoken word amen I want you to go to church amen Paul he looked on that blade and said where is your victory oh death where is yours thing see how why you're so brave why he Paul was so brave to face death because he know whom he believes amen confidence we're going to to to fly high now so we are we're done with walking and running flying you know brother Branham most of his preaching and if you go to the 1960s most of the preaching uh to 65 are different you see the the elevated message you saw the the message that it's not for the denomination anymore the denomination don't want any uh uh friendship with brother Branham or or association with brother Branham so brother Branham he was studying about this loads of Encyclopedia that the the brother gave it to him and he found out he said you know Einstein group that if two forces are coming fast enough they could pass right through each other and never never bother each other two um it said uh the the um never bother each other if two cars were coming down the road and they were both going at the terrific speed faster than sound just billions of miles per second they probably pass right through each other without hurting one another at all see even this and the bottle of water if I have a perfect speed or speed I will hit these two objects and it will pass through without breaking each other that's what the message is is preaching to us that we need that at the terrific speed now he said uh by force striking striking together when you see we are such an Earthbound people they're all uh about all we think about and can think about is always time and space but when we leave this world we go into where there is no time we can think of 50 miles an hour 100 miles an hour or 2 000 miles an hour or 10 000 miles an hour that don't even start when we think of Eternity how fast Jesus after he had been glorified and received his glorified body raise up from the dead and has ascended on high to the father came back in a few seconds later and when such a terrific speed till he come right in before his disciple through a wall and never even moved the wall maybe that's a only five miles a second or five miles an hour now he said till that come right in before his disciple through a wall and never even moved the wall and yet with a body that could stand there and eat fish and bread that speed coming true see that's perfect speed that's the body that we will go through don't think about 100 miles an hour brother oh if I can drive a Tesla 60 UH 60 miles per second is it per second the prophet here in the message question and answer 1964. he said this Mortal bodies will not see death but just of a sudden there will be like a sweep go over us can I take up my sure there's there will be like a sweep go over us under chains they're turned back like Abraham was from an old man to a young man from an old woman to a young woman that's this sudden that's this Sudden Change and after a while you're traveling like a thought I want to go see my loved ones in Germany I'm in Germany it's just like a thought it's just like a speed from from eternity when Jesus came down it's just a second and he passed through the wall because of a terrific speed I cannot wait to go to that body brothers that a perfect body for us that is your gift because you're faithful that is the price of the Lord to you he will give you a gift you know when when I was young I was I was I had a classmate a rich uh a boy and this man was you know the dad was telling him if if you pass if you you pass your grade we will bring you to Manila and Manila was a very popular place but crowded and polluted I will bring you to Manila and the kid was so happy yes Dad I will pass my test and he did but to us if you pass the test you will travel like a thought I will bring you wherever you want to go I want to say I want you to see your your loved ones in the in the Germany or England they are in the Philippines or in Colombia hermana so this he said what this Sudden Change and after a while you're traveling like a thought and you can see those then who are already resurrected oh what an hour then we're gathered with them and then be caught up with them to meet the Lord in the air it's not an unnecessary brother remember this is a a flying season now this is not a one horse rider or or how do you call it one horsepower yo at the time of Enoch it's a one horse or one-man power but in the time of Paul that was an airplane age but our age is an astronaut age hallelujah it's an eagle age oh you will meet the Lord in the air it's not necessary if your uncle or bear or is buried down in Southern Kentucky if he has uh be brought up in Indiana or buried in Indiana has to be taken so Southern to be taken to Southern Kentucky no matter where he is them are dead in in the sea shall rise from the sea maybe there was a brothers and sisters from Titanic wants to go to America at that time and they were buried in the sea you know those uh there were men and women over there faithful you know brother Branham was telling a story about this woman the the the the the I think the captain was telling her to to save herself actually and she said in either way I'm a winner she said why why I'm a winner if God will save this ship I will see my daughter in New Jersey but if God will sink this ship I will go to Glory in either way I'm a winner see the positive mind of the Christian if your uncle is buried down in the or uh here in the where am I um no matter where he is then are dead in the sea shall rise from the sea those that were destroyed in the arena and ate by Alliance those who are thrown in the fiery furnace and not even the bones will be lifted or the lip or the Dust they shall still rise whether they was in Rome or in Arena at Rome or with whether they were in the Tropic Jungle of Africa or South Africa or in the pros and regions of the north they rise from the dead and be changed and be brought up and the living shall be changed in the moment in a twinkling of an eye and be caught up together what is twinkling of an eye you know the the maybe the children or brother um Stephen knows how to say um uh beautiful eyes so they will uh uh open and close their eyes but it's like a twinkling of an eye you will change to from mortality to immortality amen oh the prophet said here you know the eagle is a Heavenly bird you know if you if you the eagle will fly high above the sky and the vulture and the hawk will follow the eagle brother they cannot reach that Sky brother because the the the body will disintegrate the pressure you know the the that's the the the the Eagles can see five times better than humans they have an eye that they can see the more they fly high they can see more better and God is anointing you like an eagle my but here is the world if God is anointing you like an eagle the world right now the prophet said you take the Holy Ghost the Holy Spirit of a man and his lower than the animal he's worse than the animal that's a hard thing to say go read that uh when you go home you continue reading that was a hard saying but I was thinking of this story brother uh brother Justice about this man because of the recession here in America you know we go to the to the gas station you see Biden was I did it and it's five dollars almost five dollars and I was like ah I thank the Lord that I'm driving Toyota Corolla but here this young man lost his job and you know what happened he went to the zoo he passed by in San Diego and there was a hiring work the next day so he went there and checked if he can if he's uh he can work uh to that kind of job and they said yeah you're you're in you're hired so he said this is a very simple very simple job the gorilla died yesterday and the gorilla because most of the people likes this gorilla I want you to put the a gorilla suit and and I want you to don't do anything just lay down on the at the end of the defense and he said the the the boss said don't do anything because the you maybe you will uh get tempted by the kids and he said yeah okay 17 an hour and so he was laying there and while he was laying you know what happened there was the here was the kids cute gorilla cute gorilla and they uh throw bananas to the gorillas to the gorilla and the gorilla was uh he loved bananas so he was tempted so he took the banana and ate and then here was the girl's boys giving him bananas and then the the kids once uh the the gorilla to swing and uh said gorilla there's a a rope over there a swing Gorilla swing and he was tempted but he was so happy because he ate a lots of bananas so he was like swinging and then going back and forth but he over swung brother like and he over he went over the fence and over the fence there was a lion laying and the lion stood up because when he saw the lion he screamed [Applause] and did the lion run after him like brother you can see the fangs and the lion run to that gorilla and then when that gorilla with the lion uh ready to to to to grab him he said the lion was like ready to when he grabbed this gorilla he said stop screaming or we will lost both of us we lost our job so even the lion was human you know but but now here's the prophet when I read that story I said it's true man right now is like acting like gorilla and lions see the lowest without the Holy Spirit of a man he's lower than animal he's worse than animal that's a hard thing to say you know I I don't think I can apply to that kind of job I'd rather pass that job but Eno walk God and at the end you know here was Enoch when he was walking at the end of the road all of the sudden it was like a slow motion like a a slow motion going up and up to heaven because God provided an astronaut or a suit for Enoch what do you call that uh how do you call that that suit uh Aston spacesuit and here was Paul when he was running he got pressurized also and went to the third heaven see brothers and sisters that's how we Enoch did and Wonderland but here was the prophet in our days because of breaking preaching about the astronaut Age The Eagle age and all of the sudden he was thinking he was uh uh on his bed and he said I'm over 50 now and I don't know if I I when all of the sudden there was a voice and the voice said keep pressing on keep pressing on and uh the voice said I asked him do you want to see over there and he said I I'm so glad to to to go there and all of the sudden see the terrific speed all of the sudden he was there so you know where we were catholic when I was 20 I was a Catholic and we thought before that if you die you will fly your your ghost will come out from your body and fly and then you see your loved ones crying and you're you're smiling with them that's what the Catholic teaching but if you're no good you will go to purgatory but here the message is teaching us not to be ignorant of the things above he wants you to know where you're going now here was brother Branham all of the sudden he went to the to another dimension and then here in the sixth Dimension he saw the love his loved ones here Sharon or or Meda and Sharon and then this 90 year old woman she said all the women there they were perfect their teeth is like a pearl they were beautiful and there was no fleshly lost over there it's all perfect love Brothers I cannot wait to go there we cannot wait to go there you know sometimes if you think about that you think about pain oh maybe it's too painful but you once you have the revelation of this hour that you will just pass from death and to life my and here was brother Branham he saw millions of people and he said are they all branhams said no there are all your converts brother Branham saw me over there Brothers God brother Branham saw you over there brother Branham saw you over there all of us pressing on keep pressing the bottle we already won the battle because he won we just connected with him in Isaiah 40 but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength that's the secret just wait upon the Lord and God will renew your wings God will give you a pressurized suit that you can go above from this world you see the world sometimes why God put me here why God and you need to be thankful you're not in San Francisco you're still okay here sometimes I forgot my garage open during the night brother about this uh um countdown to uh the news from the news do you have that Washington DC this is a January 24th 2023 the scientists projected that this Doomsday Clock before when brother Branham was preaching he said three minutes before midnight but here is the scientist declaring the Doomsday Clock Was set at 90 seconds to midnight you know the prophet was was preaching about the countdown right the countdown the human countdown is 10. 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 but the Heavenly countdown is seven one two three four five six seven rupturing age the bright age and here we are this the news is confirming that we are in the last days due to the largely but not exclusively to Russia invasion to Ukraine and the increased risk of nuclear escalation the new clock time was also influenced by count uh continuing threats possessed by the climate crisis Chris's and the breakdown of global norms and institutions needed to mitigate risk associated with advancing Technologies and biological threats such as covet 19. now did you see that do you have the photo that's the that's the clock one two three four five six seven we're ready ready to take off brother the bride right now is outside of laodicea they cannot accept us but we know this because we have the prophet God cannot do anything unless he will reveal reveal his secret to his servant the prophet that's the the scary part to the to the world but it's a glorious day for the bride we can that's why we can sing from our hearts that's why we can worship God because when brother Branham was preaching this astronaut age I was thankful that he would we can see better we can see above this this uh the world message of the hour we know what we're talking about amen it's nine o'clock brother if you can't fly then run if you can't run then walk but if you cannot walk you rather crawl than staying nothing or doing nothing here we need to do something we need to spread this message amen Hallelujah before I I close this I will invite the musician there was an Olympic Games in Mexico in 1968 the marathon is the final event of the program the Olympic stadium is packed and there is excitement as the first athlete an Ethiopian Runner enters the stadium the crowd erupts as he crosses the finish line way back in the field is another Runner his name is John Stephen akuari of Tanzania he was been eclipsed by the other runners after 30 kilometers his head is troubling his muscles are aching and he fall into the ground he has serious League entries and the officials want him to retire but he refuses with his knee bondage aquari pick up himself picks himself up and hubbles the remaining 12 kilometers to the finish line and an hour after the winner has finished aquarie enters the stadium all but a few thousands of the crowds have gone home akhawari move around the track at the ah it's so hard to pronounce this pins takingly slow pace until finally he collapses over the finish line it is one of the most heroic efforts of the Olympic history afterward asked by the reporter why he had not dropped out akawari says my country did not send me to start the race they sent me to finish the record God did not Choose You to start here and not finish the race God anointed you before the foundation of the world that you are an eagle that you are an astronaut brother Paul that this message is an astronaut we can fly higher than the world we can see because of the revelation of God we can see the world is in Doomsday but how thankful we are that we are above the world we are above this filthy and uh worst generation in our age and when I was reading this I was touched by the message of this young man from Tanzania and it's true we have struggled like Paul we have struggle like Eno our days is so filthy than before you know it it the time of the the The Heroes of Faith there was women over there fed to the Lions but their challenge is you you deny Christ or you will go to the Lion's Den here in our day every day brother it's a bottle Satan is trying to tempt you Satan is trying to tell you that you're wrong you need to get out you need to backslide because you're in a wrong side that's what you hear from Satan all the time but why you are still here because God did not send you to start God sent you to finish the race God sent you to fly higher to bring to us to spread these 14 wings uh and fly above the sky brothers and sisters I want to see him so bad thank the Lord that it's only 90 seconds left if the science can tell you that Brothers science don't really know about their revelation but before the science tell you that he said watch Israel the prophet said watch Israel that is your time clock and you see right now Israel you know what Jesus Christ open up to the Twelve Disciples to his brothers he opened up to Benjamin I am your brother and I was thinking why Benjamin he been he was a prime minister since 1992. why he's still here because God I believe will open up this is me this is not the message but I believe God will open to to the Israelites to beat German say you sold me I am your brother Brothers it's not too long believe this message and leave [Music] thank the Lord that uh
