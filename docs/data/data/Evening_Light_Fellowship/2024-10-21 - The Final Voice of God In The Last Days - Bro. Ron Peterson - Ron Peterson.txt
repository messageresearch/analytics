we went from Summer to Winter immediately we just went up the hill all of a sudden in a storm up there it was snowing and in a blizzard I'm glad I Sandy said well you grab better grab a little jacket it may rain while we're up there and I I just grabbed one and it was a kind of a winter Jack I'm glad I did I'm glad I had a hood I needed the hood too yeah anyway welcome you all this morning thank you Lord uh here in the house of the Lord Brother Gary and Sister Barbara stanky God bless you it's good to have you here with us sister Carol and brother Matt Venoy too God bless them and uh sister Louisa is that your sister Tanya next to you from from volova God bless her amen amen it's a pleasure to have you both here this morning amen volova that is the little village that we went to and and preached at many many years in fact excuse me that was the first time that ever preached a convention and that was the time Brother Floyd and brother Billy Paul and Brother Joseph were supposed to go and have the so we had uh Gone years ahead to go ahead and tell them hey they're coming they're uh we're going to have a East block convention and get all the Believers from the East block countries to come and so uh when we were in Norway with brother Hino bout camp we was with Louis's father uh and we got a call and Brother Floyd Patterson called up and said U brother Ron uh we're not able to come to the meetings because uh Chernobyl blew up and uh it was you know several hundred miles away from where if you look at a map of Poland he put a finger on the top right hand corner just below the Russian border that is where volova is that and and so anyway the the word had gotten that the Green Cloud had come down over and people were turning green and radioactive and and stuff and so they called and said hey they're not able to come say so would you uh would would you and brother hno go I never even thought about it well let me turn green let me get radioactive you know but I didn't think anything about it because we didn't have no cell phones and email and all that kind of stuff uh and so we went there and um when brother Hino and I we drove his car into the village there were flags and there were uh you know welcome signs and everything and uh they were so excited to have brother Billy Paul and Brother Joseph and Brother Floyd Patterson to to come and visit them and uh so as our car drove up they were coming out of the fields and all all of the Believers because volova was is basically a a whole village of Believers prise and so anyway they were just coming down and everything well brother Hino and I got out they were shaking our hand and looking past us like we're yeah brother H was it's good to see you brother Ron's good to see you where where's brother Billy and Brother Joseph we said uh well they they they couldn't make it unfortunately and stuff so anyway I remember I thought oh my because Brother Floyd said well you'll you'll have to help preach a convention so anyway I did and brother Hino and I we did a little tag team he and I back and forth and I had preached about three or four times I preached until I had nothing to preach I only took three services and I was done my resources of knowledge and everything I'd Learned was gone my tank was empty and I told Brother H know I said brother H know uh you know uh listen you tell the translator there that I'm done I I cannot preach and uh I I said I have nothing and so yes yes so they talk back and forth and everything and so I got up there and brother Hino got up and he he spoke about 15 20 minutes and hallelujah amen and I'm looking at my watch I'm saying oh good good we're going to get in the car and we're going to get going and we have to drive to Austria tonight so go through the borders and everything I'm thinking thank you hno short service let's go you know and and and so then uh brother Peter snon he he got up and was saying I don't speak Polish but I here and uh Ron Peterson and I so basically what he said well brother hno brought the appetizer now brother Ron is going to bring the entree and I I tell him didn't didn't you tell them well anyway so what happened and this is one of the greatest lessons I've had in life um I just said father right there on the front row cuz we were on the front row I said Lord you know that I've preached everything I know and I said I have not got anything to give I said you're going to have to come on the scene and help me Lord and I did Russian roulette with my Bible and I said okay wherever it opens to I'm going to preach right from there and it opened up to Deuteronomy Deuteronomy Deuteronomy who preaches out of Deuteronomy you know and so anyway I found the scripture excuse me it says for I have chosen you my people not because you are greater in number but because of my elective love and I knew right there I had it I knew I had a channel I preached I thought uh our services were over and about an hour and a half hour and 45 minutes later uh we we got done preaching I preached on God's elective love and uh we had a tremendous service in there and then I realized I realize father there comes a time when a minister he studies he does all this stuff and you can study too much and you can try to think well this is what I think the people need to hear and sometimes God just Waits until you're done he said are you done yeah yeah don't have nothing well okay can I speak yeah yeah that'd be good that'd be very good so that's how it started so uh it's kind of nice to have someone here from volova to be with us today goes back Roots it's like at the wedding let me just relax myself a moment here this morning when you go to a wedding and you see all of your old friends you think oh my look at time has gone by so quick all of the dark hair is now turned to Silver it's turned loose and and uh different things you see all these old people and you realize wow I'm I'm one of them I'm old too you know and uh but uh you know you think about it see wedding weddings have an attraction to bring people together there's another wedding that's taking place right now Hallelujah and that's bringing us together amen I don't want to have no excuse on that day of why I wasn't ready and wasn't preparing myself and I believe saints of God that it behooves us to understand our position in the body of Christ am and what part we play here in the end time and so I'd like you'd all to stand um let's sing only believe God sent a prophet his theme song was if you get the people to believe amen oh I've had things in my mind and maybe I have a hard time understanding but I've never disbelieved since the very first time I heard that prophet's voice there was some about I [Music] believe it's never changed I still say Lord I believe I believe regardless of what's going on around us and the people here and there and some that are leaving but father I'm not looking for a way out I'm looking for a way in amen let's sing this as we honor the Lord this morning yes [Applause] [Music] all things are possible [Applause] [Music] [Applause] only [Music] be only be for All Things Are are [Music] possible Heavenly Father Lord as we hear and we sing that chorus only believe how our minds go back father to some of the first times we ever heard it had such a Melody had such a resonance that resounded within our hearts feeling a deep calling to the deep and father therefore if there's a deep calling there's a deep inside to respond father I thank you for your word I thank you for your Holy Spirit which leads us and guides us and brings us at a time in due season at an appointed time father realizing that that spiritual food that was stored up has now come to the time of being consumed consumed by the believer and that consumption of that word has gone from the tape into a living vessel praise the Lord there's a transformation taking place and the word is becoming flesh thank you father I pray that you take this word that you have put upon my heart anointed by your Holy Spirit reveal it to each and every one that we might take our position in our body and play our part I pray for your glory in Jesus Christ's name amen amen amen thank you musicians each and everyone turn with me if you would as you remain standing Into the Book of Revelation Book of Revelation the last chapter chapter 22 revelation 22 verses 16- 21 my granddaughter Kayla God bless you sis good to have you back she's been away others on vacation and hunting and even I just got a text from Stephen McNeely they they're up in the mountains but in their tent or wherever they're at on the mountains they got the little iPad out and they're streaming so we uh it'll be The Sermon on the Mount this morning for for for them so may the Lord bless them each and everyone Revelation 22: 16 through 21 I Jesus have sent mine Angel to testify unto you these things in the churches I am the root and offspring of David and the bright and morning star and the spirit and the bride say come let him that heareth say come and let him that is a thirst come and whosoever will let him take the Water of Life freely for I testify unto every man that Hearth the words of the prophecy of this book If any man shall add unto these things God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy God shall take away his part out of the book of life and out of the holy city and from the things which are written in this book and he which testifieth these things sayith surely I come quickly amen even so come Lord Jesus the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all amen amen amen Revelation 10 turning back into Revelation the 10th chapter Revelation chapter 10 very familiar portion of scripture but I wish to dissect it down just a wee bit for you this morning Revelation 10 verse 7- 11 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound brother Bram said not when he starts his ministry but when he begins to sound the Mysteries right the mystery of God should be finished a he has declared to his servants the prophets and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten and it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and Nations and tongues and Kings may God bless the reading of his word you may be seated this morning in the presence of the Lord now I want you to notice that it was after the seventh angel messenger had finished and it was after that the mystery of God had been preached that the voice spoke to John and John is the type of the Bride so I want you to catch the correlation here take and eat the revealed word for it is spiritual food in due season John became obedient and he took and he ate atat the book he didn't just collect the tapes and books but he assimilated them by consumption what good is this message laying on a shelf it must be taken and consumed because whatever you consume you become Jesus said the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life it's not to just take these tapes and books and distribute them or not not just to say I agree with it you got to take it and eat it take eat this is my body which is broken for you because thou must prophesy not the seventh angel now his ministry is over I want you to understand there's a change of administration it's not not the angel from heaven it's not the seventh angel but now the ministry is changing it's going to John John the voice that was Revelations 101 the mighty angel that voice quickened Revelations 107 and he preached the mystery of God but now John you've got to take this book you've got to take this message and like I preached this last couple Services about stepping into the vision this is not Creeds and dogmas and church order or the way to dress all those things are a part but this thing is actually a vision this is a vision from God because Prophet see they have that that Vision that comes from God and they they speak it because they're the mouthpiece of God Amen so it is a vision and when you take yourself and unite to this Vision what you're doing you're agreeing with it now watch this as it was with Mary so will it be with the bride I want you to understand that that angel was helpless to bring the promise to pass until she said with her voice be it unto me according to thy wordu I want all of you to understand this is not something that you just sit back and agree with it mentally but you in your heart say God let this prophecy let it be in my bosom let it be in my womb the womb of my mind and let it conceive and bring forth the life that it's supposed to bring forth overshadow me as you did Mary so now watch the voice of the mighty Angel transfers to the Earthly Angel the seventh angel and the voice and transfers to the voice of John it's the same God it's the same message but he's using another voice and I will would like to title my sermon this morning the final voice of God in the last days and I want to take a subject this morning of the bride's Ministry amen how many of you believe that you have been joined together with this message there's been a union an actual Union with it and therefore you've been United already with Christ thank you and so now that uniting has brought about a quickening or a transforming power to each one of you so you must Play Your Part it is not just saying verbally I agree with it but it's becoming one with it and so now we're in a time where the enemy is doing everything that he can to stop The Voice now brother Brenham said you may silence this voice one day and put it in the grave but you can never stop the message because the message is Christ amen so we're in the end time and the devil is doing all that he can to stop the final voice now like I said and I wish to substantiate this morning that the seventh angel is not the final voice right he's just a part of the formula he's part of the equation that God is using in this end time but his voice quickens another voice and your voice connected with that voice becomes the final voice amen so in the loud you see in church age brother Brenham said a momentary consideration of the church history will prove how accurate this thought is in the Dark Ages the word was almost entirely lost to the people but God sent Luther with the word and the lutherans Not Just Luther not just the messenger the lutherans spoke for God at that time but they organized and again the pure word was lost for organization tends to wordss dogma and Creeds and not simple word amen they could no longer speak for God then God sent Wesley and he was the voice with the word in his day and the people who took the Revelation from God became the living Epistles read and known of all men for their generation are you seeing this pattern and when the Methodist failed God raised up others so it has gone on on through the years until the last day there is again another people in the land who under their messenger amen you understand it who under their messenger because we realize God sent a prophet he's our messenger we're not looking for an eighth messenger we've had the seventh messenger but we're looking now for another to take that same word watch this who under their messenger will be the final voice to the final age I'm sorry to disagree with others who say to stay home and press play because they stop right there at the prophet's voice and they deny another voice that is supposed to come they deny the word of God and the word of God will be completed and I say God be it unto us according to Thy [Applause] word amen in Exodus 23: 20- 24 the prophet of God uses this scripture in 14 different sermons and he says behold I send an angel before thee to keep thee in the way and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared beware of him and obey his word excuse me his voice provoke him not for he will not pardon your transgressions for in my my name is in him but if Thou shalt indeed obey his voice and do all that I speak then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies and an adversary unto thine adversaries for my angel shall go before thee and bring thee into the amorites and the Hittites and the perizzites and the Canaanites and the hites and the jebusites and I will will cut them off Thou shalt not bow down to their gods nor serve them nor do after their works but Thou shalt utterly overthrow them and quite break down their images brother Brenham uses this sermon text for 14 different messages emphasizing that when God sends a messenger you must obey his his voice amen God has always had voed representation on Earth he's done it from the very time in the Garden of Eden God has always had a Believer somewhere that he could use as his voice and when the prophet left the scene God was already raising up another one not one as in singular but one as in body now John was commanded to take the book of redemption a and to eat it up and after he partook of the message revealed in his hour it was his turn to speak thou must prophesy unto the people it wasn't the seventh angel now prophesying it was John it was the bride brother sister we have a duty to do in this end time we are to have the word of God being consumed inside of of us and then that consuming now consumes us and it's not you it's the word in you now living out making a manifestation of Christ in this hour hallelujah thank you Lord just as John was commanded to take the book so we are commanded in this hour to get into these tapes and books that's why I tell all of you you listen to these tapes they do not replace going to Church you go to church you forsake not the assembling of the Brethren together but you at home you listen those tapes you read the books and you get into it and you consume it and you will watch that the more of the light you receive the more of the light of God comes out of you the word will be living out of you the Bible says Revelation 22:17 and and the spirit and the bride say come notice now the spirit and the bride are both now saying the same thing this is the hour and the time when we have joined our voice with the spirit and now they're saying the same thing watch this now in the true Easter seal brother Braham said if you notice as soon as the voice of Abel was silent in death God raised up Seth to take his place which was nothing but a preaster a pre- resurrection or a replacement until the resurrection came that went on for a while down through the Old Testament we find it going the prophets God kept his voice alive with the prophets they spake the word of God and they stoned them and as soon as they would Stone one and put him away God would raise up another one and they'd stol that one and put away and God had raise up another one he's always kept his witness alive down Through the Ages he's kept the voice alive before the people all the way from Eden amen I believe that just as God has kept a voice and a representation in every age and in every hour we are not to just look back to the voice of the seventh angel and say oh I wish I would have been there I wished I would have been in the meetings no we have those tapes and we can listen to it and we get into it but that voice did not stop when he went off the scene in 1965 that voice continues amen it's a transformation it is now entering now into another Administration who is it it's the bride she's coming to it Jesus said I have many things I wanted to say unto you but you could not bear them now how be it after I'm Gone the holy spirit will bring all these things to your attention and you'll begin to understand hallelujah we're we're now at the time where all of these tapes and books and this prophetic word had been preached but now we're coming to the understanding of why he preached it you see years ago in the early 70s when I first came into the message it was prophet Prophet Prophet Revelations 10 Hallelujah Prophet Prophet prophet and for years you go to a convention and everybody say well now God sent a prophet Hallelujah and we all got excited but once you've understood God sent a prophet that doesn't stimulate you anymore say what he said tell me what he said said so now we're at the time the prophet has come and gone that's right he's preached his ministry his Earthly Ministry is over yet I believe the voice is still continuing I believe the same voice of inspiration that was in William branam is now coming into the bride it's the Holy Spirit and now that Holy Spirit is taking another voice and she will be the final voice to the final age you can't make it any other way that's right brother Brenham says in the voice of God 63 you might not to get a chance tonight you might not get a chance tomorrow it's now now when you hear my voice Harden not your heart in the days of provocation now is the time this is the acceptable time that if any man will hear my voice that goes so show that his voice would still be there in the midst of all the chaos somebody say Amen to that thank you Lord he's still got a voice why his voice will remain here it is Heaven and Earth will pass away but my voice shall not pass away his word amen now Ezekiel catches this also I wish to share this with you he says in Ezekiel 43:2 and behold the glory of the god of Israel came from the way of the East and his voice was like the noise of many Waters and the Earth shined with his glory so here was the glory of God coming to Israel it was coming from the East going west because the as the sun rises in the East and sets in the west so does the glory of God's word it came in the East it's now keep going westward westward and his voice was like the noise of many Waters now John on the aisle of patmas picks this up in Revelation 1 in Revelation 1:2 I turned to see the voice that spake with me now he's hearing a voice I turned to see this voice and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot his and gird about the PS with a golden girdle his head and his hair were white like wool as white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire his feet were like fine brass as if they burned in a firness and his voice as the sound of many Waters and he had in his right hand Seven Stars and out of his mouth when a sharp two-edged sword and his countenance was as the sun shineth in it strength I want you to notice he had seven stars and in his right hand there were seven stars and this seventh angel the seventh angel messenger that we know is the Star Messenger to this age and his ministry was Vindicated there uh there in Sabino Canyon when he was there praying about a vision now I want you to understand he's had Visions about God coming to him he's seen seven Mighty Angels he's got all the he's heard an explosion he's wondering what does this mean does it mean you're taking me off the scene I if so that's fine but he's up there oh God what does this vision mean and all of a sudden he said something hit my hand what was it a sword it wasn't a king sword it was the king sword what God was doing he said this is not the end of your ministry this is the Vindication of your ministry this is the third pole the third pole is that sharp two-edged sword which divides aunder between spirit and soul it is the word that separates us from all unbelief somebody say Amen to that God is still using the voice of the ministry amen amen but not only the ministry but to who they are ministering to and when your voice blends with other voices it becomes the sound of many Waters Amen brother Brenham says what does this sound of many Waters mean in the patmas vision now I I tell you everything about this message is God revealing that Prophet through vision so here he is talking about this patas Vision that John has brother Brenham catches by the revelation of the angel coming to him and he's understanding these symbols so watch this I for the sake of time I'm just going to read the highlighted portion the sound of many Waters voice of many Waters what does Waters represent if you want to Market downturn to Revelation 17:15 see the waters which thou saw is thickness multitudes people and tongues all right he says now the voice of many Waters what is his voice it's the Judgment the voice of the ministers through the Holy Spirit that's cried out to the people in every age standing there the voice of many Waters Cried Out thickness and multitudes The Voice of those seven stars in his hand to every Church age preaching the baptism of the Holy Ghost baptism in jesus' name speaking in tongues the power of God the resurrection of Christ the second coming Divine judgment the voice of many Waters coming forth from this one that looked like the son of man many Waters you see my brother my sister it is a nickan spirit which tries to silence The Voice of the ministry today that's right it would be you see the devil would love for you to just stop at that voice of the seventh angel because then it gives you no no purpose it gives you no placy it gives you no Ministry yourself you're not being united with the vision you're just saying okay well praise the Lord God sent a prophet and he did Miracles and signs and it was so great and the Messiah sign and everything but my brother my sister the voice does not stop with Revelations 10:7 it goes on it's the voice of many Waters praise the Lord there's more people believ in this message today than when brother Brandon was here preaching it he would have died a brokenhearted Pro ET there was very few men that were catching any kind of Revelation really to substantiate that this was an end time message oh a few men they saw he he had a great gift even brother Billy Paul said brother Ron it wasn't until after Daddy went off of the scene that I realized he was the seventh angel messenger you were so close to it you're so close to him you just saw the human element oh my sometimes we get so close to one another we get so close to this message of God that it just becomes common to us my brother my sister we should realize that God has sent in this end time a message to us that we've got to not just talk about it not just read it but to get into it step into the vision become quickened that we might manif EST the voice of God In This Very hour God help us you have been quickened caus you to raise up come away from sin and death made you to sit in Heavenly places you've been called back to the restored word you've been quickened by the voice of the seven seventh angel it was God speaking it was God quickening to you it brought his excuse me preachers voices take such a beating it brought his own life out of you thank you brought you to the place of adoption it brought you back to your rightful position in Christ Jesus did not finish all his work when he was here on Earth he left a work for us to do the same works that I do shall you do also there is a successor there is someone that will carry on the ministry amen thank you paman Church age notice the harmony of the father and the son Jesus never did anything and it was first showed him by the Father John 5:19 this harmony is now to exist between the groom and his bride amen he shows her his Word of Life life she receives it she never doubts it therefore nothing can harm her not even death for if the seed be planted the water will raise it up again here is the secret of this the word is in the bride as it was in Mary the bride has the mind of Christ for she knows what he wants done with the word she performs the command of the word in his name for she has thus sayeth the Lord then the word is quickened by the spirit and it comes to pass like a seed that is planted in water it comes to full Harvest serving is purpose next paragraph those in the bride do only his will no one can make them do otherwise they have thus sayith the Lord or they keep still they know that it has to be God in them doing the works fulfilling his own word did not complete all his work while his Earthly Ministry in his Earthly Ministry so now he works in and through the bride are you catching this it didn't stop with the seventh angel messenger he says he did not complete all his Works while in his Earthly Ministry so now he works in and through the bride amen she knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must do now now do but he will now fulfill through the bride that work that he left for this specific time how many believe that we're in an appointed time right now there are times and seasons keeps repeating itself we see it we're entering now into the fall of our season we see it we see the leaves changing we see uh things happening here on the earth we know that it's the fall of the year because we see certain things in a physical manifestation around us so it is now also among the bride we're coming into the season where we must be mature bride no longer tossed about to control by every wind of Doctrine you got to know where you stand and stand on the word amen cuz the word of God is our absolute you if somebody can talk you out of what you're believing you never had Revelation to begin with because Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it amen once you know who you are and what purpose you play and what part you are to play you no one can take your place praise the Lord you have a specific place and a purpose brother Brenham now picks this up again going a little further in the P paman Church age now let us stand like Joshua and Caleb our promised land is coming in sight even as theirs did now Joshua means Jehovah Savior and he re represents the end time leader are you guys getting this he represents the end time leader that will come to the church even as Paul came to the original leader as the original Caleb represents those who stayed true with Joshua so you have the end time leader and you have a Caleb who stays true to Joshua praise the Lord remember God had started Israel as a virgin with his word but they wanted something different so did this last day church now notice how God did not move Israel or let her go into the promised land until it was his appointed time now the people might have put pressure on Joshua the leader and said the land is ours let's go take it Joshua you are all through you must have lost your commission you don't have the power you used to you used to hear from God and know the will of God God and act quickly something is wrong with you but Joshua was a god-sent prophet and he knew that the promises of God so he waited for them he waited for a clear-cut decision from God and when the time come to move God placed the full leadership in Joshua's hands because he had stayed with the word God could trust Joshua but not the others so it will repeat in the end day the same problem same pressures so we're seeing the same thing repeating but if we see those things we're also realizing there must be a successor to this end time voice there must be somebody who catches the Baton I don't know if you've ever watched the relay race and you have Runners and usually the fastest Sprinter they put at the end time they put him at the end and you have a good Sprinter there they're all good sprinters and they running and stuff and if you've ever watched him pass the Baton a lot of times the man is not standing there waiting for him to come and he hands him the Baton but as he sees the runner approaching he starts to get into stride and he realizes and he's not looking like this no he's running running and when he runs he's putting one hand back that when they get stride for stride the next day it hits his hand and you see he the Baton is now passed to the one in front of him Hallelujah when we start catching the stride of the ones that have been running with this spaton when you realize it's not a time to get all uh it's not a time to stand there and say well come on come on come on hurry up give it to me no start running start running he's going to catch up to you pass the Baton and then you run if we've ever had a time to run let's run let's run now the Baton is passed it's our job to run you if you can't preach the sermon live the sermon John 14:12 says verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do also shall he do and greater Works than these shall he do because I go to the father we see this pattern now developing John was the voice of God crying right John was the voice crying in the wilderness then come another voice the voice of Jesus Christ and after he was gone come another voice the voice of the disciples are you seeing the voice never stops he's always got a representation and just about the time when he when he may take one off the scene they either kill him destroy them Stone them do something or they die a natural death then the devil says aha I've stopped the voice oh no let me tell you you never stop this voice The Voice will continue you why if it's God's voice you can't kill God prise the Lord you can't stop his voice The Voice continues amen now I want you to notice that the prophet's Ministry when he enters into the Third PA it's not to the multitudes it Narrows down amen he changes his ministry when he does it becomes offensive except you eat of My Flesh you see you got to eat the word you got to eat that flesh word we're not feeding upon William Brandon we're feeding on the unfilling word body of Jesus Christ that's right take eat this body amen but the ministry was narrowed down actually the ministry got greater but the crowd got smaller the vision got more intense but the people became a smaller group the big revivals with all the multitudes is over first and second polls ended brother Brenham preaching he says oh look at the clock turn around and look it's 2:00 sh you the second pull is over the third pull is at hand he said you all know what the third pull is he says it's the word being revealed in its season and he says and you what you've caught temporarily now you when you begin to see The Squeeze come on let me tell you if there's ever a time of a squeeze it's now amen we're seeing it you're feeling a pressure from all around hell is emptying itself out the devil and all of his subjects and the prince of the power of the air everything is there's pressure there's pressure in your work there's pressure in politics there's pressure in economics there's pressure somebody say pressure pressure amen that's right brother RM said pressure will make you do things that you don't want to do God help us to be pressurized amen that who cares all this stuff well if if Cala gets in or if if Trump gets in let me tell you it ain't about Trump and it ain't about Kamar it's about the word of God coming to pass in the end time and whoever it is and however it comes to pass I don't care all I say is I want to be a part of the voice of God in this end time and no man can take my place no man can shut me out the Lord do you guys remember the Elijah tried to shake Elisha off you remember that remember that in second Kings chapter 2 where he came and the Lord would take Elijah up into heaven in a whirlwind and Elijah went with Elisha to gilgal and he said Elisha Terry here the Lord has sent me to bethl well guess what Elisha says say the Lord God liveth I'm not going to stay here I'm going with you prise the Lord he tells him three times T here first second third pull T here as the Lord God liveth see he says as my soul liveth I will not leave thee and then the 50 sons of the prophets come out to to uh to to meet Elisha and they stood a far off and they said don't you realize your head's being taken away from you shut your mouth don't matter sons of the prophets are you kidding me there's all kinds of voices in this end time amen you realize you got to do this you got to do that listen there's one voice there's one voice that is ordained of God to turn your hearts back that is the voice of the seventh angel but the voice does not stop there it continues it continues and guess what Elijah said what what do you want from me what have I done to you I don't know but I tell you what when I was out there plowing with the ox and you came by and put your mantle on me and everything and and just walked away and you know I had to go make a sacrifice well go on go be with your mom and dad I didn't do nothing to you yeah you did you did something I tell you what that's exactly like you and I when you came ac across this prophet's message it did something to you yeah you thought you could go and continue plowing with your oxen no you know what what have you done Elisha said I don't know what you did to me man but you did something to me what do you want what do you want from me come on he said I want a double portion of what you got oh you do do you he says well you've asked a hard thing but if you see me go and you catch the mantle if you see me go and you catch the mantle you can have what you asked for did you know it is the promise of God to get a double portion for the bride of Christ but you got to understand if you see that Prophet go and understand that he's leaving something behind that you catch it and you say where is the Lord God of Elijah we're not to just sit back and say in the day of Elijah in the Days of Elijah no this is our day I saw Elijah's day but now's my time this is my message amen gilgal actually that was the point of beginning you realize every Ministry starts somewhere gilgal was the point of beginning of Elijah's minist Min it's and actually gilgal means uh a rolling getting something moving and that first Paul first pool then went to bethl which means a house now House of God is good but that doesn't change your life God LED Jacob to bethl right he said oh this is an awesome place bethl is a type of the house of God and it's wonderful I love all of you come to church yes and you'll have Supernatural events happening to you you will feel his presence you will have visions that'll come to you that that your mind will begin to catch these things that the word of God is talking about but that doesn't change you you can have all these bethl uh experiences and go out those your and still live the life that you lived before but if you come to pineal if you come to the place where you wrestle with God face to face then your life will be changed and how will the people know that you wrestle with God he had a hip replacement you ever seen somebody walking after a hip replacement it's a little different on God help us some people are satisfied with bethl well I'll just stay here yeah so good yeah I like it just come to church put my name on the book I guess that's it don't you ever get satisfied which with church yes I want you to come because Faith cometh by hearing hearing the word of God Amen but that don't get you to cross over Elisha kept saying nothing else matters you can tell me to stay here you can tell me to T here no I'm not going to T here I'm going to keep going wherever you go I'm going to go with you that's how each one of us should be saying in our heart I'm not going to stay with the first pull I'm not going to stay with the outer Court I'm not going to go with a second pull and and the inner Court I'm going to go into that holy of holies I'm going to get where my life has changed sir second place was Jericho but that third pull was Jordan amen you see my brother my sister Elisha could not be shaken off he had in his heart he wanted nothing else it's got to be you also amen Nothing Else Matters that's right well how about a better job more money a better career bigger house a nicer car what will you take for your position to play in this end time because the devil is willing to give it to you that's right it'll take a revelation in this end time to know where you belong in the body of Christ amen it does it takes a revelation to know who your pastor is is and where you go to church and where you pay your ties and what you do otherwise you're going to be just like anyone else just uh well uh I'll I'll stay there and under that Ministry until he says something that offends me and then I'm out of here take my my my ball and go home on brother Brenham says where I think Pentecost failed Elisha as your soul liveth I'll not leave you and he went on and when he got to the school of the prophets he said I Cross Jordan he said you stay here he said as thy Soul liveth I'll not stay here I'll go with you I like that a denomination to hold on regardless of the price move on keep going on with God deeper waters deeper experiences and more love there's no limit to it it's unlimited amen hallelujah you couldn't shake Elisha off you can't shake the bride off well the prophet I'll show you he made a mistake over here and he made a mistake over there well I'll give you a quote brother Ram says I can show you by the word of God all the prophets made their [Music] mistakes he says but God makes no mistakes you know what's you know what's so amazing is when he gave Abraham a covenant and it was unconditional right it don't matter from that time on the mistakes he makes he can lie and give us a wife away and guess what the Covenant stayed right there he could lie and says that's my sister Covenant stayed right there Hallelujah do you see when when you got that unconditional Covenant like your father Abraham you might make mistakes and you will yeah every one of you put your Halo away for a moment and realize you're human beings but you have a covenant with God that when you make a mistake he's there right there you have a mediator Hallelujah I'm not looking at my mistakes I'm looking at the [Applause] promise every one of them they all made their mistakes but God makes no mistakes praise the Lord disciples stood to test see a Ministry is not formed overnight disciples are not made overnight oak trees do not grow overnight mushrooms do that's right you can go like this to a mushroom knock it over try to do that to an oak tree not everyone that starts will finish not everyone that started out of Egypt crossed over not everyone that started with Christ finished to see Pentecost not everyone that started with a healing campaign stayed around for the third pull they all began to get offended one after another until finally Doris started closing he's sitting there in Tucson months on end with no invitation and imagine after the opening of the seals and they don't want him oh look when you healed the sick when you had all kinds of signs and everything looks like you lost your ministry oh looks like you're all washed up in fact brother Brenham goes back into second pull and first pull and starts doing it and he got got himself in trouble with God said what are you trying to do he saidif you hold on to the first PLL the second can come and if you hold on to the second the third can't come he said let go of those things and let go and let God Amen see you know what the third pull is a separation pull it's an offensive pull first and second PLL did not offend anyone in fact they all said come and see a man oh come come maybe hey I I think he's going to do a miracle what we're going to pray for a miracle maybe maybe the the the dead will be raised maybe something will happen Peter invited all his friends hey come see Jesus of Nazareth you want to see a miracle hey I tell you what guys come watch this here comes Jesus prob hasn't had a bath in a couple weeks his hair is not fashioned it's not combed out real nice he may not even smell very good all of a sudden every sh sh sh the master speaketh and Peter's gone okay guys now listen listen they're going to be some kind of a miracle something just be real attentive listen to what he says he says accept you eat of My Flesh and drink of my blood you have no part Peter goes those neighbors said this as a cannibal this is offensive and one by one they began to leave they said this offends me my brother my sister oh I've been cut and cut deeply by this ministry many times but I've never been offended I've never been offended by it oh you know here I was with long hair always wanted long hair my dad made me cut it my dad was a jockey on like a cowboy and Cowboys are you know you a bunch of pervert long-haired hippies so always want to have long hair and finally I get out of the house and grow my hair long right and then I come into this message and when the first message I hear you perverted men with these long hair like a woman I wrestled with it well it's like some Believers up in Washington they had a little booth and they were passing out all the tracks and everything talking to different ones about this end time message and this long-haired guy came and they start witnessing to him he said oh I'm a Christian I'm a Christian and you know and so they start witnessing to him and they said well don't you know the Bible says it's a shame for a man to have long hair and he said yeah I'm ashamed so what else I'm ashamed so what else you want to preach to when I heard brother Brenham say those words I said oh my oh I went out surfing this is part of my my testimony went out surfing that day and I was good enough that this this was before they have these leashes they they have leashes which is a little rubber band that goes from your foot tied to the end of the surfboard so if you fall off the surfboard only goes so far comes right back to you and you paddle back out well back in those days if you lost your surfboard you had to swim all the way to shore right and and so anyway I was good enough that most of the time I didn't lose my surf for it so anyway I was paddled out and you know the Lord had been dealing with me about my long hair so I was sitting there shaking my long hair on the beach and paddle out and everything and I catch a a wave and I I come down and I'm surfing on this wave and the wave starts to wall out so I go and I kick boom I blast through the top of the wall with the my surfboard goes looks like somebody just pushed it over the wave and it frustrated so I got to swim in go get my surfboard paddle back out I'm not going to lose my surfboard again okay so it happens to me again well this time I'm on the beach I get my surfboard and I'm shaking the the salt water out of my hair and when I do my nose hits my surfboard oh oh I get a bloody nose oh oh and there there was people on in a beach and I put my hands up and I saidh why why are you doing this to me why now and I I was angry I was angry with God why now any of you ever been angry with God yeah I have so voice spoke to me he said you're going to step on a stingr wow I only knew one person in my whole life that stepped on a stingray that was Mitch bugging him and he said it was the worst experience he ever had and and and anyway so I paddle back out this ain't going to stop me I'm not going to lose my surfboard again I'm not I'm anyway take off on a wave kick out my wave the surfboard goes swims ashore so guess what I do I body surfing you know what body surfing is you catch the way you body Surf and I'm uh body surfing in and I see my surf board and it's floating in about you know a foot of water and little waves are pushing it toward Shore and uh I'm not going to stand up

Achilles tendon and that's what uh makes your foot do this well now I can't hardly walk and everything and now I make a plea with God God if you'll heal me okay huh how many of us make deals with God when we get hurt or we get in trouble amen you think you're big and bad huh why God this and that now it's like h a little kid that tells his dad no huh you ever had your little boy tell you no hey son come here no and then Daddy stands up and when Daddy stands up and the little boy go oh I'm sorry Dad not not too hard dad make a deal huh but anyway watch God allowed me to step on that Stingray

for all those years and had blood all over the right shoe where it it bled I got home and I thought okay there's one person I want want to talk to I want to talk to Mitch I want to tell him I stepped on a stingray but God healed me so we went that day excuse me for giving a personal testimony here but ahead Mitch he was working as a tennis pro at the Country Club he was teaching tennis giving tennis lessons so we went to go pick up Mitch at the Country Club and got him in the car and hi Mitch how you doing hi Ron hey what's going on you know and uh I said uh I stepped on a stingray he turns and looks at me you you stepped on the when did you step on the Stinger I said just a couple hours ago you never stepped on no s I did I said God heal me he's like wow Ron I've known you since I'm 9 years old you step on a sting right yeah I said God heal me wow I said M um I believe I found a prophet in this end time I want you come hear a I want you to come hear a tap he said Hey Ron the Bible says there'll be many false prophets and anointed ones at the end I said yeah Mitch I said you've been a Christian longer than me and you know your Bible will you come and just listen to a tape will you just come listen to a tape and tell tell me where he's wrong okay cuz you're my buddy I'll I'll do that I'll come so we brought Mitch to little and understand when we came into the message we didn't have no preachers wound up the testimony is we wound up a brother got it at a at a little flea market you know and he gets converted and he starts getting others converted so we're just listening to these tapes and I remember them putting on a tape and I'm praying I'm saying oh God lord I know that predestination is an election from God and those that have the testimony of Jesus Christ have the spirit of Prophecy and I said would you open his eyes to this and we put the tape on and I'm just praying for Mitch that's all when we got done with the tape I looked over at HIM Tears was coming down his face and he said brother Ron I know he's a prophet amen he says I can tell by the voice praise the Lord little did we know and I just saw Mitch up at the up at the wedding Mitch is 72 I'm 71 we're still serving the lord we still going on Mitch's mother came to my mother and said what did your boys do to brainwash my son I said well I don't think it was my sons that brainwashed your son but I don't know even what my children my boys are believing that I know this I don't think they brainwashed your son to believe what he believes now let me ask you a question do you believe that the Bride of Jesus Christ will have a Ministry before the Rapture so let me show you this quote here questions answers 19 63 would the bride of Christ have a Ministry before the Rapture sure what's going on right now see the bride of Christ certainly it's the message of the hour do do you realize the message of the hour is the ministry of the Bride amen it's a message of th see the bride of Christ sure she can consists of Apostles prophets teachers evangelists and pastors is that right that's the bride of Christ sure she's got a Ministry great ministry it's the ministry of the hour it'll be so humble amen musicians have you come I'm bringing this to a close it'll be a great ministry amen but it'll be humble so if we stop with the voice of the seventh angel and that's his ministry then the devil has got us to where we don't go into our position right do you see that amen I never asked God to make me a minister never asked God to make me a pastor I know this that ever since that I came into this message and my eyes came open open to it I love it I do and yeah I took my kids Amos is not here and my daughter Rebecca is here right now and Amos is down in Mexico and Matt he's not here I wanted my kids to see it so bad I made him tow the line yeah you're not going to do that while you're in my house as for me in my house will serve the Lord so I drug them to church I drug them to conventions they all had a drug problem because they got drug here and there I say that as a joke but apple don't fall far from the [Music] tree sometimes we as parents want our kids to see it so badly while you're in my house you will do what I do and you will go where I go and when you get old enough then you can go do your thing but while you're here in this house did I become a little too legalistic yes I did because I thought that my Revelation would be good enough for them also it's not no they need their own Revelation and when they catch it guess what you don't have to tell them what to do he tells them what to do praise God in 2 Timothy 2:2 it says and the things that thou has heard of me among many witnesses the same commit thou to Faithful Men Who Shall be able to teach others also brother ran picks this up in saman church age in every age we have exactly the same [Music] pattern that is why the light comes through some god-given messenger in a certain area and then from that messenger there spreads the light through the ministry of others who have been Faithfully taught the light comes to others who's been Faithfully taught amen but of course all those who go out don't always learn how necessary to speak only what the messenger has spoken then he talks about Paul in 1 Corinthians 14 how important it is at the bottom of that paragraph to hear the voice of God by way of The Messengers and then say what has been given them to say to the churches it's essential that every Minister be Faithfully taught first in every career in every occupation you have an apprenticeship you don't want to be a carpenter four years apprenticeship you want to be a journeyman electrician four years apprentic ship you anything you got an apprenticeship you got to know what to do on the job you got to be Faithfully taught CU you don't come to the top pay scale and go out here and start wiring things up you don't even know does the red go with the black and the white where does it go where and all of a sudden you're wiring everything up wrong and all of a sudden you turn the switch on and you're blowing circuits [Music] that's why it's so very important the scripture says to be Faithfully taught amen than teach [Music] others brother Brandon was not looking for larger crowds he was looking for men that would be Faithfully taught third poll is a separating poll too much of the time we lean back on first and second poll because you know what there's no offense to either one of those do you know that the only miracle that Jesus Christ did when he entered into the third pole of his own Ministry he reveals the word it becomes offense but the only physical thing that he does in a resurrected Ministry was open eyes the two on the road to emus [Music] God is a separator not a mixer amen is that right God's a separator in the leading of the spirit brother Ram said you select the young fellow who's just out of school who's smart and witty a social mixer God don't want a mixer he wants a separator God wants something and you choose him because a lot of times he's very smooth he's kind like see God don't choose men like that you're a separated people by the Holy Ghost see the world wants today the world is wanting today is mixers they want somebody who will walk around and fellowship with the world and fellowship with the people and get a lot of members and have a social organization but when the Holy Ghost said separate me Paul God is a separator not a mixer amen Feast of trumpets 64 God is a separator not a mixer the church wants a good mixer today let them wear bathing suits shorts everything else and get out and carry on like that separate [Music] me we're not here to get you all excited sometimes we're here to just point you back to what he said oh I I like getting excited and jumping and shouting but that don't finish the work finishing the work is catching the Revelation and going on huh cuz sometimes it's going to be rough in St John 6 verse 28 they they said unto him what shall we do that we might work the works of God Jesus answered and said to them this is the work of God that you believe on him that he has sined you're not required to manufacture yourself understand this if you're sheep you don't manufacture wool that's you bear [Music] wool this last quote let me give it to you you must be born again you don't have to tell sheep you got a manufacturer that's what's the matter with the Pentecostal people today that's what's the matter with christiandom trying to manufacture something a sheep isn't asked to manufacture wool he Bears wool Bears the fruits of the spirit don't say glory to God I have to get black in the face I have to do this I have to have sensation I have to dance in the spirit and I got it no uh-uh just get born again it'll actually take place itself you don't have to say shall I study all night shall I do this shall I do that shall I join this shall I make this Creed shall I do these penances no nope just die that's all be born again and come it comes from the inside takes care of the out see amen you don't have to manufacture [Music] now just live the [Music] life we don't have to manufacture something just be real amen you know people can tell when you're really sincere or not you ever have you know everybody comes up hey man how you doing hey bud what's going on yeah man everything you know a lot of times they don't care what how you're [Music] doing will you ever have somebody come up to you and say hey you doing okay and they kind of discern a little something you go oh oh [Music] h no I'm not doing too good huh you feel it I had a sister years ago she had never called me before she never called me she called me she said brother Ron I I just felt to call you okay she goes are you doing doing okay woo she goes hello hello like like no one's here hello I said yeah are you doing okay I was going through a very hard time you know sometimes when you're going through a hard time you put that face on people hey how you doing I'm good good everything's okay by his grace you know but man there are times when you are up against the ropes and man you've been getting beat and you're going to church because it's what you do that's what we do on Sunday we go to church I'm going through the motions sometimes Fighters when they fight when they get when they get hit and their Bell is wrong man they come against the ropes and they cover up they cover up and the other guy's trying to knock him out and they cover up cover up and he waits until he gets his wind [Music] again well there's a lot of times in our lives saints of God when things are going to happen happen all around you things will start falling apart all around you people will say things people will do things and some of those that claim to be the Bride of Jesus Christ right the message Believers will say things and do things and and just absolutely tear you up amen and you'll go man really really you're supposed to have the love of God you're supposed to be real Believers and you're judging everybody and so critical and if well if that's the way all these Believers are going to be then I don't want [Music] it yeah it's real easy to get that [Music] way I probably would have cut quit long time ago but I'm not tied to people I'm tied to him am oh yeah I've I've gone through my trials I've gone through those things but I know through it all I've learned to trust him Hallelujah prise keep going keep walking yes sir keep walking if if you've ever been disappointed in people have let you down the devil's just trying to shake you off a little bit where are you going to go is there somebody better is there a message better somewhere and let me tell you no you know what don't keep your eyes on one another Look to Him and when we have our eyes on him you know what everybody else looks a whole lot better learn to forgive say good things about one another huh father forgive me my trespasses as I forgive those who trespass against me that's hard we're supposed to have perfect love we're supposed to have the token we're supposed to have perfect love a lot of times we can't get along with one another Lord you know what I need I need another dose of your [Music] love because when I fall and I make a mistake I can I confess it to you and you wrap your arms of love around me and you encourage me and I you tell me to get up and get going but if others do that you know we want to look down no no no no for there by the grace of God go I amen people go away they do things wrong and then they come [Music] back do we ever let them come back and become one among us as though they never sinned before or do they always have a stigma about him well that's the prodigal he spent his life in riotous living and he went out that's why you young people when you struggle and you're having a hard time I want you to know I'm not going to look at your my nose down at [Music] you I want to put a hand out and say come on hey come on the Bible says lift up the hands of those that are weak among you right how many times have you failed how many times have you made your mistakes yeah many and love covers a multitude thank you Lord let this bride to Christ now let them have a double portion of your love and of your grace in our lives and quit looking down and arguing and fussing and fighting I'm done with it I'm done with it I don't want to fight no more on them I don't know about you but I'm I'm not one of
