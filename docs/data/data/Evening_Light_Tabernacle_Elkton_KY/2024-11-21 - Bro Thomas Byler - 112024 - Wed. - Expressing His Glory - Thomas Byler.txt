amen we just continue on series amen and see what the Lord will have and I uh amen I'll share with you here in a minute just where we want to go with the help of the Lord let's bow our head talk to the author first precious Lord and Savior we come before you thankful Lord to be gathered again in your name a little bit better Lord Jesus knowing god that there's a pandemic on most Lord of sickness going around all over the United States Lord and enough seems to spread fast and just a lot of people get it but father we ask God for those that are not feeling well Brother David and Joel just different ones that have caught this thing Lord and not feeling well we ask God that you just bless them where they are and help them to have a speedy recovery Lord Jesus and protect us keep us guarded and around Lord with your us Lord Jesus we ask God that you just lead us and guide now father as we try to surrender to you that you just uses father to speak to your people Lord the words of Life father Lord we just are such an honored and privileged people to be able to uh speak your word father to open the Bible and to know that the the one that wrote it is not dead but he is alive and always will be and so tonight we ask God that you give us in Inspiration give us strength in Jesus name amen and amen turn your books to the Book of Revelations right quick amen trying not to keep you much over an hour amen I was sitting back there thinking well now look all the stuff you got amen you might have to decide how far you want to go and and what you want to do but anyway so we'll just try to follow the leading of the spirit that be okay amen um once again we want to look amen and uh basically in the attributes of God Amen uh and we mentioned about his glory remember I said the one thing is one thing about God is is his glory is that right and so that's basically what we want to dwell on with the help of the Lord tonight talk calling it Expressions expressions of his glory amen Revelations 4 Revelations 4 and verse 7 and the first Beast was like a lion and the second Beast the face of a man and the force Beast a flying eagle and now if your message believer we all are well acquainted of what that is isn't that right those are the four powers the four powers amen that God used since the time uh that he the Earth come back in the form of the Holy Ghost in his church there was going to be four anointings right four anointings down Through the Ages that people are going to be Anointed with amen and of course we know the calf amen the face of a uh being Wesley and the fourth of course being a flying eagle amen putting us into the eagle age you and I are anointed under that eagle age I mean it's glad for that amen we could just stop right there and preach the rest of the night amen being able to see further than any other bird any other bird can see can see M when we think about it I think brother Brad talked about how you can see three miles maybe and see a rabbit or something you know way out there you know and you and I amen we've got Eagle Vision we can see Plum Plum back before world was ever created I'm here to tell you one thing right now the Amish never taught me that God wasn't God one time you just didn't learn that from the Amish that God wasn't even God one time you know he was all by himself you know that God means an object of worship and there was nothing to and so if there's nothing worshiping him he's not God so am mean he has to make something to worship him and make him a God Amen and so amen all the way there ain't that right and not only there but helps us to see all the way into the future way to the Millennium the new heavens and the new Earth the new city coming down amen it's all the way up there flying eagle age how many is's glad to be living in amen flying eagle all right well does not Chase too many rabbits amen and the four beasts had each of them six wings about them and they were full of eyes within and the they rest not they nor saying holy holy holy Lord God Almighty which was which is and which is to come and when those beasts give glory and honor and thanks to him that sat upon the throne who liveth forever and ever amen now let's stop there for a minute let me talk to us a little more now what we're going to do tonight what we're doing like what I really like about this thought in the area that we've been dwelling in is the reaction of all four of those Powers the reaction of all of the Christians and what they're going to say they get over there ain't that right what they're going to express when they find over there when we finally get over there amen this is what's going to happen it must be a very important thing and to me that's why every word that is spoken here is very important amen very important why don't my glasses want to work right all right four and 20 Elders fall down before him that sat upon the thr that liveth forever and ever and cast their crowns Before the Throne saying Thou Art Worthy amen that th Art Worthy Thou Art Worthy thou worthy oh it just fits on the mouth it it just fits right good to be able to say Thou Art Worthy Lord am mean because you was made to say that not only over there but in this life John Michael God bless you good to see you amen receive glory and honor and power for thou Hast created all things and for thy pleasure they are and were created thank you Jesus amen may God add His blessings to the reading of the words you can be seated brother Brandon and preaching the seals preached the fifth chapter of Revelations we're going to go into this just a little bit because we're going to take our time we got all winner to go through this series all right but in the fifth chapter brother Brandon used the fifth talking about there was an angel amen proclaiming with a V loud voice who's worthy to open the book loose the seals and all of that and then at the end of that whole thing we're not going to get and preach that maybe sometime but we'll go to jump down to verse 12 because brother bam talked about how that John the Revelator must have seen his name on the book is that right and when he saw his name on the book he began to Rejoice he began to praise God and amen and and and I don't care what you think but brother bam said that everything under the Earth and on the earth anywhere else heard him saying it they heard John screaming and holler and having him a good Jubilee fit a't that right so this scriptures applies of course brother Braham said it's being a type of the church right John was now in verse uh you know uh there was 10,000s times 10,000s saying with a loud Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing amen every creature which was in heaven and on Earth and under the Earth such as are in the sea all that are in them heard I saying blessing and honor and H Power Glory unto him that Seth on the throne and to the lamb forever and all the beasts said amen a amen and the 4 and 20 Elders fell down and worshiped him that liveth forever and ever amen worshiped him 4 and 12 El 4 and 20 Elders Amen brother abandon myi I believe he described that as Patriarchs and the 12 disciples amen 12 disciples and the 12 Patriarchs of the Old Testament amen all right so now we look there and we find once again that The Cry Of The People The Cry of the people is to give God glory right now in chapter 4: 11 he says Thou Art Worthy oh Lord to receive glory and honor and power amen GL and honor and Power in verse 125 says Thou Art Worthy that was that was Worthy is the Lamb to receive uh that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing said it a little bit and we may get into that hopefully we'll get into that the power part the riches part the wisdom part the strength all of those things things but we want to start with the help of the Lord amen and we want to go to 1 Chronicles let's go jump back to 1 Chronicles 1 Chronicles and chapter 16 there was another one uh in the scriptures that almost almost copied that one and I didn't want to read both of them I think this will be I think that was in Isaiah somewhere but this will be sufficient to make our Point 1st chronicles 16 and verse 24 says declare his glory among the Heathen His Marvelous Works among all nations is the Lord and greatly to be praised amen now how many knows he's worthy of praise that's right he also is to be feared Above All Gods wow so there's other gods how many knows there's plent world there's lots of gods amen I think brother bam says man us we America's the bnch biggest bunch of idol worshippers there is the Americans and what is that anything that you put in front of God or before God is an idol amen my all right now notice above all for the people are Idols but the Lord made the heavens that's right Glory and Honor are in his presence strength and gladness are in his place give unto the Lord ye kindreds and people of the people give unto the Lord glory and strength amen praise the Lord give unto the Lord the glory the glory due unto his name maybe we'll sing that at the end of the chice down at the cross where my savior died amen there where from sin of cleansing of sin I cried there to my heart was the blood applied glory to his name amen glory to his name amen all right give unto the Lord glory to his name bring and offering amen the offering of our the sacrifice of our lips given praise to his name I don't know how people can be quiet amen all right now that's right offering come before him Worship the Lord in the beauty of Holiness fear before him all the Earth the world also shall be as a stable and it shall not be moved praise the Lord over in Psalm 72:18 says blessed be the Lord God the god of Israel who only doeth wonderous things how many know that God is really the only well we we love great stuff we love when people do outstanding things we love to be able to say wow did you that when God is really the one WTH things and we'll talk about that we could go till 5:00 tomorrow morning 6:00 amen we could go till the sunrises tomorrow morning just talking about The Wonder of things that God has done and how many knows faith comes by hearing amen I was talking to a couple couple of I don't I don't know if they're Christians or not but they came with Colton and they came up visited with us today and before leaving and we got on the subject of God and I says you know it's even hard to believe there is a God what that's right I says can you comprehend a god a being that never had a start at one time there was nothing and he never did have a beginning try to comprehend that with you Lama they like it's easier to believe that we come from a tadpole than to believe that there's such a being but you got faith and you can't know by the things that are created I says but we know that he is because the son just don't make a revolution every every day unless there's a Supreme Being making it turn around all the stars and all the moon and everything that happens then I said the prophet of God God worked through him you know to raise debt and do great Miracles and signs and wonders discern the thoughts of the hearts just like he did with the woman well I got the witnessing to anyway I about got preaching but anyway he's a God of Wonders that's great thing he does wonderous things and it's all an expression of his glory because when we think about the glory of God most of the time we think he comes in the Splendor of his glory amen we've got an ivory an ivory Throne up there with angels all around a bright light coming all the hosts of heaven and everything and that's his glory but let's look at his glory in a little different view this morning this evening we that be all right different amen all right that's right blessed this he doeth wonderous things and blessed be his glorious name I like to talk about oh glorious I like to talk about something that's glorious amen blessed be his glorious name forever and let the whole earth be filled with his glory amen and amen place it talks about even the heavens declare his glory the Earth is full of his glory everywhere you look the glory of almighty god brother bam was so inspired by this that he preached on Amen a talked about the revolution of the Sun and how it goes around the moon and he be talk about creation and the miraculous things that it's a paradox how this can be how the trees can know how to go down and not die every year it's a paradox if you just look around you'll see God everywhere if you got a lot of him on the inside I'll tell you what you'll see him everywhere every oh my the very that we're standing on Amen it was a paradox amen this body that he made it's a paradox am mean it's part of the expression of almighty God it's part of his wonders his glory amen there's a lot of Glory seekers in the world is that right lot of Glory seekers in the world that's why we yeah that's why we allow them Bulls to jump all over the top of with their hoofs and man they could just hit your neck anytime break it and die amen people will go W next to death and and just play around with death image just to get a little yeah thank y'all thank y'all that's nice wasn't it ain't that cool a that right brother Tommy that's right am man all of those what is these X Games and all of this other stuff and or do a double flip and everything else you know and come down and see if they can land am mean just to get off the bike and go yeah yeah and everybody goes yeah amen but y'all want to tell you something I you know it was God that give the body in the it's God that giv us breath in the first place amen we give so much glory to all kinds of things amen it's time to give God glory he made it all in the first place he created everything that was made and people are so quiet come to church some and sometimes you start talking about God and people want to just kind of shut down on you huh people get quiet you're ashamed maybe this talk god when that's all you never want to be ashamed of God he made you he made everything he's all around he's awesome never be Ash about God oh that's right think about it is full of his glory amen I think it's in Romans in Romans it talks about people came be in their imaginations because when they knew God they didn't worship as God isn't that right came vain in their imaginations and their foolish heart was darkened God gave them over to vile affections and everything else and he talks about he talks about you know and they worship the creation more than the C Creator amen one place bible talks about you know the thing that is made amen the things are made to maybe there's a beautiful house that somebody makes somebody makes a oh that's a beautiful house amen but what about the guy that built it but the house is oh it's awesome but the Bible says the one that made it ought to get more credit than what is made and that's the way it is with God Amen people want to have fun with this and that and the other and they give you more credit than they mount the one that made it amen it's time to give God the glory that's du to his name oh I will give him glory I will give him praise I will Shine the Light deep into the night I will give him glory I will give him my strength I will give him honor amen God inhabits the praise of his people right there says a son honor the far father a servant honth the the but he says where's my honor amen amen all right the whole earth is full of his glory we ought to stand in awe want to look how we ought to when God begin to begin to express who he really is because this is about who God is is that right and as you get to know a person and the way they act and the way they do you find out whether they're a good person huh that person's really nice really kind really loving really helpful that is their Glory that's the beauty of them but if it's ugly hello then it's terrible it's good thing but as we get to know God we know how good he really is how great he really is how much of his glory that's expressed to us amen praise the Lord when we look at him we realize how great is our God how many knows we God incomprehensible to the human mind so don't try just believe him just believe him serve him with everything you got amen later on perhaps if we get to it and that Hebrews 1 talks about that he was the expressed image of his glory expressed image of his G person I believe it was all right praise the Lord so God does wonders does his wonders amen he proves himself by doing glorious works amen I'm going to take read this scripture to kind of pick something up in John 2 verse 11 after he turned the water into wine this beginning of miracles did Jesus in canaa Galilee and manifested forth his glory amen begin to manifest forth his glory and his disciples believed him so has he begin to do Miracles that right he's the god of Mir why do we think we still say well we worship to God that created everything because we realize that God made something out of nothing he just spoke the word and there it was woo Glory aome he ain't got to do no flip for me all he got to do what he did a me for me to give him a little praise hang the son out there amen one of first things he did Amen to get rid of some of that Darkness was the hang of son out there amen with I don't know how many I wanted to look up how how hot that sun is I guarantee you it's billions of feet it's way up there burning for 6,000 years and still not burn out what in the world did he make the Sun out of woo I can't help but believe it's some of that same fire amen that he took the darkness out of my heart with that he took Darkness out of he took us out of darkness and translated us into His Marvelous Light whoa I don't know how he does it but he did it woo GL what a marvelous thing what a display of his glory amen this his glory that's right we look down through the old T bit is that right just look down through the Old Testament a little bit and what God did he talks about even when he spoke from that mountain his glory was there is that right he spoke to Moses his veil was had to be his face had to be veiled and Paul talked about the glory that it was what a glory it was amen the bringing of the law he says how much more the New Testament exceeds in glory and that see it's so much in glory amen that that did amen but anytime Humanity does something great everybody says we're always looking for something something super duper amen something super always going Beyond what's already been done looking for the super duper well you don't have to look if you want really something super D pick up your Bible one time want something super rer right here it is this is really super amen the fact that you are is super super amen God bringing you into the world is super every birth is super it's Miracle amen Miracles everywhere amen I'll just bring up a couple when you think about it in our the world that we're living in I'm not bring in you know David but I want to bring you in thinking about all the things that man glorifies that right man glorifies Praises brings an honor to brings glory to amen we think about singers people who have been gifted to sing is that right all of them they've been gifted to sing and people worship them make an idol out of them even Elvis like brother brah said God gave him that gift to have that gift they should use it for God to bring honor and glory to him but they use it for their selfish reasons and for Devil's reason and people make an idol out of them amen who was it that gave them a voice in the first place it was God he ought to be getting the glory he ought got to be getting to praise how many believe that we got our athletes and people amen like uh like football players and mind when somebody amen can uh what was it called a kickoff right take the kickoff amen and then they all everybody got him right and if he can manage to wiggle through every last one of them and get to the end zone well everybody get up out of their seat and by many he conquered them all wo they crazy but they forget to worship the one that gave him the leg place the one that give him the strength to run in the first place he ought to give more praise he ought to give more honor and Glory than what them guys do that's why football game basketball game I don't care amen if you get more excited about those things that you do God there's something wrong with you that right we get excited oh my when I get a big old 16o Buck down wo Glory I finally got but if I get more excited about that then I do God there's something wrong with why because God is worthy of the glory the Bible says give honor give glory to to his name let do him how many believe he is do some Glory people [Applause] amen praise the Lord God loves to he likes to show his strength brother Bram said he made it sound God loves to show you his muscles he loves to show you his power he loves to show you his power amen what do you in the world and that's so sometimes we don't like it but sometimes for God to really show his power he's got to get place to where he can show his power I'll tell you right now as long as we can get over something we'll get over something if Thomas B can get around something he'll get around something if I can get under it I under it but God makes it come up the Red Seas like he did with Israel you can't get over can't get can't get around it but the B says stand still and see the glory of the salvation of God and see God take you through amen that's right aren't you glad for that my and after he had tested Israel what did he do the unthinkable the unimaginable the miraculous the glory of God Moses took that Rod a that right and he struck that red seeing it parted I don't know I don't know if they had for two weeks for that to dry up brother Tommy to go back and read if it was the same day same time but I'm here to tell you that those that mud that deep dried up dried up and I can't help but believe if God can bring the hard he can dry that up pretty quick don't you that's right he can up and they all crossed over looking at the glory of God look at out the glory and the power cuz his power is his glory walking through there God made a way for them and Pharaoh he says you know what they did it I think I can do it too hey God made a way for them maybe he made a way for me too boy was he dumb I mean not so smart no that was made for the children of Israel to get away from you you should have stay out of there you should have said hey no way I'm going down in there I'm going to the house I'm going back and sitting on my throne and I'm going tell all the egypti hey I got defeated all right yeah there's there God opened up the Red Sea there was walls up there everything day all was coming all the way across that's good enough for me but no not that guy no not him no he had to go in after him right oh my folks I'm here to tell you don't never worry about it God's going to take care of you if he's got to twist people's mind he'll twist people's mind he'll do he he he can do all that he put it in the heart of pharaoh he hardened his heart made it his you know stubborn else amen many different times praise the Lord the armies remember sometimes the whole Army the armies they would fight each other oh let's just talk about his glory for a minute shall we can you imagine brother Tommy why in the world would they kill each other why would they kill each other you wouldn't just intentionally go up there somebody dressed in your own robes and your own garments and armor and say Hey you know I'm just going to kill you but let's presume just a little bit maybe they look like the enemy God made their eyes see the enemy say hey that look like one of them guys po huh that's just the way God works but killed all of them I killed every last one of them anden when the Israelites come they were all dead through all that lying on the ground God help that to happen to some of our enemies today Lord let them fight and let them all be laying dead on the ground amen Devils that want to seal your joy that want to seal your happiness amen may God kill let them kill each other amen cuz he did it and he can do it again we serve that kind of God praise be to God Amen this stuff wants to hold on that's all right you want you're getting out of here it's going by the wayside you're going sooner or later cuz got got my God on your hands amen praise the Lord so I love that don't you think about that Israel put you between a rock and a hard place amen well might as well go down this Rabbit Hole I really like it God to see your reaction to see how you react amen those Israelites they weren't built of the right stuff they weren't built right the Bible says they did not have faith they had the word but didn't have faith mixed with the word and it didn't any good you can have the Bible but if you ain't got faith to believe that Bible there's something wrong but abrah said it's for a Believer it's like a Christian you know amen that 300 weather B Magnum am that right somebody bought him out a 270 or something it was supposed to be a weather and it didn't have the thickness of the seal some of them guys weren't too smart back then to drill to do that is that out of gun and so forth but he says man it blown up in his face and like you know if that gun would have been a a 300 wey Magnum to begin with if it went through the molding pot and if it had been molded and shaped in held the pressure amen and that is with the believer When Trials one come go when God want to display his glory amen you'll be able to the [Applause] pressure you and I are built for trials you and I are built for the trials that God allows to come our way we're built for it but you got to have a new birth you got to have a real genuine New Birth somebody smacks you on the face we'll find out whether you got the new birth or not somebody does you wrong one time see how much long you hold a gr Grudge see how long you take to get back at him amen see if you can handle the pressure amen how do you know you're built how are you built I want you to understand something in order to be a harsh have harsh genetics if you are a pig you got Pig genetics and if you're a Believer you've got God's genetics you're are very the core of your being is God's genetics to believe things that are impossible [Applause] it ain't you it's what's in you it's God in you Paul said it's not me that liveth it's Christ in me that lives aren't you thankful that but GL you were built to withstand this Le OS see a lukewarm age that's right all of us that are Christians you were made and you were built for it and if you're not huh that's right there's a lot of things that happen to people and when it they leave God they quit they're done they walk away they're not built for that kind of pressure amen but believes you got to be built by New Birth experience and then God takes care of it the rest of it oh you might squirm you might come right down to the point of saying well if that's how God's going to be huh like brother Bram it got down there remember brother Bram said every Christian go through that at one time in your life you come to that place to come right down there to where perhaps you would give up if you could amen but if that's on the inside the lord gave the Lord taken away brother B said blessed be the name job had to build he built is that right took all his kids took all his children it's a hard thing is that a very hard thing all his wealth and that thing and that his own health and he worshiped the Lord the Lord taking blessed be the name of the Lord amen that's right no matter what come his way he praised the Lord anyway because he was made in the right way and God wasn't ignorant when he allow when he challenged the devil because the devil came to the house of God going up and the Earth ain't that right and he said have you considered my servant job have you seen that guy he's the best there ain't none of them ain't nobody in the land like him right bragged him up yeah long as you're doing him good and blessing him and everything's going good yeah he'll serve you but you let me take and some of those things and his wealth and his possessions and see if he don't H curse you right God says okay go ahead you can do what you want just don't take his life my was job in for a shock I imagine he had a weak weakness about the day he heard about all of his children getting killed all of his sheep stolen all of his camel taken a bunch of thieves everywhere it rains it pours amen everything could go wrong did go wrong he praised the lord gave the Lord taken away and again they meet again have we considered yeah skin for skin and so forth you know but let me touch his body kersia he was so miserable I can't imagine what he had he wished he could die cursed today he was born and everything else oh all kinds of he was miserable brother Troy he was miserable with that tck tick disease I imagine when we get over and ask job how he was very very very very miserable he was so miserable he made his wife miserable and his wife was miserable tired of being miserable probably and said my honey why don't you just go ahead and curse get huh why don't you curse God and die the devil speaking out of her her mouth that time wasn't it oh you speak like a foolish ver not woman you're not you're not a foolish woman you're my wife and I love you but you talk kind of like one right now Lord shall I take good at God's hands and not evil huh will I take good and not evil no whatever God puts on that's fine amen why because God's business Lord takes care of you praise the Lord amen aren't you God glad for God's goodness I am very thankful for God's goodness for his grace amen all right let's go into the New Testament and look at uh look at the expressed image of the glory of God Amen I've got a few things try to come to if I can I believe it's in Hebrews let's go to Hebrews Hebrews through yeah Hebrew 1 1 God who in Su drry times and diverse manner spake in times past the fathers by the prophets has in these last days spoken unto us by his son he ha appointed heir of All Things by whom also we he made the worlds folks everywhere you go I always like it when God always talks to as he talks to us and lets us know hey I'm the one that made everything I'm the one that made the worlds amen now notice who being the brightness of his glory how many believe that Jesus was the brightness of the glory wow we always imagine him coming off the throne and he'll come one day in all of his Splendor in all of his glory with all the hosts of heaven and that'll be his glory but this is the expressed brightness of God's glory when you looked at Jesus Christ amen and the expressed image of his person amen he was the expressed image of almighty God Amen that's right and upholding All Things by the word of his when he had by himself purged our sins sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high so we see here first of all when God when when Jesus began to do his ministry get into his ministry one of to thrat things amen he did was turn to Wine said go get a bunch of pots they were having a wedding amen and he didn't have any wine they drank wine in weddings back then amen and they had it didn't have any and and they were drinking wine I guess and then after they filled those pots and they begin to drink from that they said hey this is the old one this is the good stuff why you save the good stuff for lastes usually you give them the bad stuff at the end but he begin to express manifest his glory his power oh my how many knows when the woman at the well when he we came to her amen and begin to tell her the thoughts and intents of the why my she seen the display of the glory of almighty God this is the very Messiah she ran into the City and said isn't this the Messiah amen praise the Lord when the woman tou of His Garment and she was made whole Legion was in the graveyard ain't that right there and his family gone and his wife gone and children when Jesus come along restored him back to his right mind how manyan those was the glory of almighty God woo my on and on when he walked on the water my Peter was amazing they thought he was a Spirit oh my you know there here we are out here and there's rough ocean rough sea and here comes the spirit walking on the water it's I he said if that be you let me the glory for him to be able to walk on water another time when they were almost about to sink in the ship ain't that right oh my out there in the middle almost going down and they said car down not that we perish and he said oh ye of little Faith stand up and said peace be still how many believes they seen the glory of almighty God Amen that's a whole lot better than a motorcycle doing flip that or the other W let him try to walk on water amen let him try to calm the ocean no but he gets very little praise he gets very little honor for Amen to God and then again the real glory of God it's when Martha and Mary called to him about larus being sick and he kept going stayed away because he had know to follow the leading of God ain't that right or the Father the spirit that was in him amen come back four days late he didn't raise him out of the casket brother he didn't you know he was ready in the Tomb that he was already paed my g roll away the do one man walked in two men walked out is that right praise be to God and everybody wo why that should send everybody amen say and that is absolutely got to be God all the Pharisees everybody to believe when they seen the glory of God you should have believed but inste they wanted to call him be why do you think hell's going to be so hot why do you think judgment's going to be so bad because God fills the Earth with his glory shines his glory upon the people and they still don't believe it was glorious Calvary was glorious with the spit hanging on his face it was glorious the stripes on his back was glorious you because by those stripes everyone that ever needs a healing can be healed that's Glory he was unleashing the power of God to all of humanity and when he said it was finished and when when he get the ghost and when he died it was glorious because he paid the price for you and I that whoo should not perish it was glorious when he went to hell so you wouldn't have to go he paid for your sin so you wouldn't have to pay for your sin it was glorious the most glorious was through Jesus Christ in Calvary the pope calls it a complete failure hey Pope you call it a complete failure you're going to stand before him one of these days and you'll be thrown in the Lake of Fire amen that's right blasphemy blasphemy is what this preacher says it is when it was complete success not failure there was no failure in any part of the Cross why why not how do you know about about I'll tell you Mr Pope and all of your millions of Catholic followers I'll tell you why it was a success because he died and he went to hell and he took the keys from the devil death and hell and he rose like he said he was done and he's alive forever more and he proved that he was alive that was Glory glorious Resurrection he ascended on high and pour out into you and I the baptism of the Holy Ghost poured out into you and me of himself amen that was glorious the most glorious thing that was ever done amen glorious the resurrection then they've got the audacity to say it was a failure it would have been a failure you're right Mr Pope it would have been a if he wouldn't arose cuz he said he was gonna failure but he rose now you're oh so wrong so Hellbound wrong is that right that's right amen I don't look like I'm mad sometime but I mean it I'm very zealous for the Lord don't say bad things about my Lord and Calvary don't blaspheme because the Bible says he Blas against His holy name against the Saints he's a blasphemer you think the Muslims what they say about what he says about if he says it was a failure they like it they say I want to go with this guy I can go with this Christian he think that was a failure and he accepts me and my God the way I am he thinks we can all get to heaven in our own way boy are yall wrong boy are you in for a real Dark World a real shock of a tribulation period it Bible says there's one way no man come to the father but father you don't got to heaven but through Jesus Christ no other religion Pope don't say that all of you people that have your own way to heaven God's We're All God's Children not everybody on the earth is God's child Bible says there's children of the wicked one amen I don't know maybe he'll hear it I don't know don't really care which I hope he does all right we'll let that go glorious wasn't it praise the Lord went to hell death and he conquered every enemy he conquered every disease he conquered every child he he conquered every every demon that there was and ascended on high and it's sitting at the right hand of God being interess Upon Our confessions that's glorious a glorious Victory people will shout at ball games and this game and that game and pull their hats down over themselves and my amen when there's somebody that has had a we myself and my grandchildren when they have a home run and they makeing this that of the other yeah yeah yeah that's a l that's I'm like yeah yeah yeah yeah we get mad at the umpires if they call it wrong I don't I try to hold my peace come on now they're just having fun yes honey okay but isn't it true when it comes to something like that we get excited a little we come to churches I'm going believe everybody ought to have a church home everybody ought to go to church everybody ought to give God honor and Glory I want to give honor and glory to God for the way I do the way I dress the way I act the way I think everything about us we want it to glorify [Applause] God that I every action speak everything we do glorify God I'm noted in my own Glory we don't seek our own Glory any Minister that does Amen he's on his way out he gets all the glory what was the other line I get all benefit all the glory what was it I get the grace he gets the glory that's about right he gives me Grace Glory Hallelujah he gave the glory amen praise be to God I know there was another line like that amen his glory is on display not just out here in the creation but it is I me knows every time you see that sunrise it's like well praise be to God the word of his power is making that thing come up slow it's going it's the word of his power that's making it move Lord tap me into that power how many with me Lord let me be a part of that power not external amen but every move I met every step I take Let It Be powered by almighty God every word that I say let the power of God move [Applause] me Let Me Shine for his glory do you know you're a part of the glory god I'm G read our last part of the message tonight go to Ephesians if you will Ephesians 1 actually I have another another thought on that line I might be able to get to it if I hurry y'all catch that you know what I said about that all right Ephesians one and we'll begin with verse n having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he has purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are in the earth even in him I believe brother bam talked about that in the fullness of time God is going to call all his children home I believe that's what he interpreted that scripture as being in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counil of his own will here we go that we should be to the praise of his glory amen so when God come when he saves you when he does a work of Grace amen it is a praise His glory you are part of the praise of his glory amen hallelujah his children that are saved we to the praise of of his glory all right we're going to stop on that let's go on more one more that I thought I didn't realize I had I want to go to Revelations Revelations 18 and also Isaiah 60 Isaiah 60 let's read Isaiah 60 first Isaiah 60 if I'm not wrong brother bran preached this in the rising of the sun Isaiah 60 verse one arise and shine for thy light is come and the glory of the is upon thee amen for behold Darkness shall cover the Earth and grow Darkness the people but the Lord shall arise unto thee and His glory shall be seen upon thee how many believes we had a rising of the Sun in our generation and when that sun rose amen when that sun rose arise morning Stars butam said Rise and Shine for the light has come why there'll be a day that's neither dark nor light but it'll be dismal but in evening time it shall be light through the prophet of Malachi 4 God was going to bring light again not only light oh my but it be like man it be like being out in the woods brother Tommy and freeezing to death almost amen and then all of you're just waiting for you're waiting for that sun to come up you're waiting for the darkness to go away and all of a sudden that sun begins to rise amen and the glory and the beauty of daylight the glory of that sun coming up and warming you up oh my that would just be a wonderful thing with the Dark Ages it was dark and gloomy H his manite am me Baptist Pentecost we didn't know what was right but out of that Gloom Rod the light Rose the light Rose they were still in darkness I'm in I'm telling you right now if you don't speak in tongues then you ain't got it if you speak in tongues then that's the evidence that you got it Amen brother I've seen this man over here he spoke in tongues he prophesied but was wrong marriage he was absolute fake he was a teror he said but he was still Darkness he was still not right but when he comes amen he begins to thoughts and intents of the heart amen with thus sayeth the Lord amen then you don't have to wonderer anymore God's very lifeless manifested to us amen now reev Gans 18 1 and after these things I saw an angel come down from heaven having great power and the Earth was lightened with his glory he believes it was it happened and he cried with a loud voice Babylon the greatest Fallen is fallen and has become the habitation of devils and the hold of every F Spirit and the of every unclean and hateful bird amen the Nations have drunken verse four it says and I heard another voice from Heaven saying come out my people that you be not partakers of her sins that you receive not of her plagues why I am against Oran organized religion 1962 11111 God sent he says a mighty Angel after that mystery was made known a messenger now watch and he reads the scriptures same as we did amen babylon's Fallen so forth the whole earth is lightened with his glory look immediately after her mystery was made known of who that hor is who she was what she was who her daughters were the mystery had been made known then God sent an angel a messenger to what to call out come out the message of the hour amen the message of the hour how manyan know the message of the hour to Whole Earth with the glory of God the whole earth was lightened with the glory of God the denomination saw it and rejected it the Hindu the Muslim 30,000 raw heathens isn't that right just as it was on Mount carel and he challenged all of those bail worshippers and let your God bring the bring your offering bring your sacrifice and if God consumes it then you're right remember that and they got up there and they cut themselves and they were call their God a bunch of hours Elijah says what's the matter he's on a little vacation is he on a vacation is your god on vacation you know I'd have to go back and listen listen to it brother Tommy I don't know that
