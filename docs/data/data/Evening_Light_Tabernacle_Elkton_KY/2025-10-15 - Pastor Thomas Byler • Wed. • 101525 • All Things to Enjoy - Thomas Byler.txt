[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Let's stand and sing that tonight. Oh, kings and kingdoms will all pass away. Oh, there's something [Music] about that name. Let's sing it again if we could tonight. Oh, Jesus. Jesus. Jesus, there's something [Music] about that name. Oh, and master, savior. Oh Jesus, like the fragrance [Music] after the rain. [Music] Oh Jesus, Jesus, Jesus. [Music] Let all heaven and earth proclaim. [Music] All kings and kingdoms will all pass away. But there's something about that neck. Could we sing it one more time tonight? Oh Jesus, Jesus. Jesus.
