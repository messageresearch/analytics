========================================

Peter said again in chapter 4, 1 Peter 4 and verse 11 or 12, beloved, I think it not strange concerning the fiery trial, WHICH IS TO TRY you as though some strange thing happened to you. In other words, MY WHY DOES THIS GOT TO happen today? Why did this happen? Huh? This is weird. Is this stren? No, it's not. No, God is testing you. It's more precious. Your tests and trials of your faith are more precious than gold. How many believes that? Because Paul said, "I reckon that the sufferings of this world are not to be compared with the glory that is revealed that will be revealed from heaven." Amen. That's right. But rejoice in so much as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings, that when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad with exceeding joy. Hallelujah. See, be sober. Be vigilant. For your adversary endeavor, as a roaring lion, walketh about seeking whom devour he may devour, who resists steadfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world. But the GOD OF ALL GRACE WHO HAS CALLED US by his eternal glory by Jesus Christ after you have WENT ON A FLOWERY BED OF EASE for a while. That don't sound right, does it? Everything has been going good for you. No. After you have suffered a while, make you perfect, establish, strengthen, AND SETTLE YOU. BROTHER BAM SAID THAT EVEN JESUS WAS MADE PERFECT BY SUFFERINGS.
