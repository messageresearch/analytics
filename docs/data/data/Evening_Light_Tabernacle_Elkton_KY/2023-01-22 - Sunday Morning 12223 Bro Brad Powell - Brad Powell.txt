========================================

kind of beat us down and push us down and hold us down and God just wants us to be encouraged in the word so about my thought this morning would be uh the thought would be we must overcome and conquer we must overcome and Conquer and I was found this was I was studying and it was talking about in ancient Rome you know they have you had tens of thousands of people would Gather in the coliseums and they would Gather in these coliseums to watch the Christians they gathered in the coliseums to watch the Christians be torn apart to be ripped to shreds amongst lions and bears and tigers and Gladiators and tens of thousands of people would gather to watch this this spectacle and Paul Rader you've heard the prophet talk about Paul Raider he wrote the song only believe and he was a friend with the prophet and Prophet knew him and and brother Brown said he said under his ministry some as he was a as it was he was younger I think but he knew him he was an acquaintance but Paul Rader was there and he was commenting on his visit to the Coliseum and listen to what he said he said I stood uncovered to the heavens above where he sits for whom they glad and I asked myself would I could I die for him tonight to get this gospel to the ends of the Earth he said I prayed fervently in that Roman arena for the spirit of a martyr and for the working of the holy spirit in my heart as it worked in Paul's heart when they brought him in on his handcuffed away to Rome he said those early Christians lived on a threshold of Heaven he said within a heartbeat of home no possessions to hold them back wow can you imagine being in that atmosphere I've never been to the Coliseum if any of you have if you have I'm sure it was an amazing feeling I've been to uh the uh where the Oklahoma City bombing took place actually me and brother Byler went there and visited together we went on a trip out west one time and the feeling is so it's just a burden it's heavy and that was at the Oklahoma City bombing and and completely different situation but I can't imagine being in that Roman Coliseum and standing there and thinking the very thoughts that he thought so when we talk about Christianity when we talk about Christ when we talk about the word of God it's not a game it's serious business these people there's been thousands upon thousands have died for the sake of Christianity for the sake of Jesus Christ for the call of the gospel for the word of God thousands upon thousands upon thousands have died and I think about that I think man what are we fighting why can't we overcome why can't we conquer it's not a game I was privileged to speak at the school at Carson school last week and spoke to about probably 250 kids 300 kids I don't know and I began to lean back and I went back on kind of what brother Bauer was preaching on the Sunday before talking about Joshua and the possessing the gates of the enemy and and I took it on down that road I said this I don't come here to entertain you because Carson and Weston had told me many times people come to speak to the kids they they try to make a light they try to make games they try to get make friends with the kids it's I'm not there to make friends I'm here to preach the word and it was amazing the attention that the kids gave me and afterwards one of the young men come up to me and he said I just want to say thank you for saying you was not here to entertain us so kids want Christ people won't cry people want the word and it's up to the preachers it's up to us to live possible to preach the gospel to take the word into the god into the world so that it goes to the ends of the world and we leave this place so turn with me as we as we read Saint John chapter 14. the words of Our Lord speaking here these are the words in red right let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in Me In My Father's House through many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare come again amen and receive unto you myself that where I am there ye may be also and with whether I go ye know and the way you know and Thomas said unto him Lord we know not whether thou goest and how can we know the way and Jesus then replies back what I think is the greatest directions and guidance that has ever been given in the history of time he says I am the way I am the truth and I am the life and no man cometh unto the father but by me if if he had known me you should have known my father also and from henceforth ye know him and have seen him and Philip said unto him Lord show us the father and it sufficeth us now can you imagine here this next verse Jesus has to be getting a little frustrated he's getting a little bit concerned a little bit frustrated with where the worth of his disciples are standing in his presence and he says have I been with you so long a time with you that yet that yet has thou not known May Philip he that have sent me has seen the father and how saith thou then show us the father believe us that I am in the father and the father in me and the words I speak unto you I speak not of myself but of the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works brothers and sisters we've got to get to that place that we we're living in that very sentence right there I speak not of myself but I speak of the father that dwelleth in me for he's the one doing the works it's not anything we do it's not you but it's him in you doing the works believe me that I am in the father and the father and me or else believe for the very work sake verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do there it is think about this there it is there's what we are looking for Greater Works than these shall he do who's he talking to who's absolutely brojo he's talking to us he's talking to Believers you'll be the ones that do the Greater Works fruit because I go unto my father and whatsoever you shall ask him my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son if ye shall ask anything in my name I will do it may the Lord add his blessed sister to read the word you can be seated listen to what the prophet says he says today we're living how means alive today we're living He says we're living He says why do we worry why do we worry why do you wonder why do you wait speak and go forward he said your will to heal today how many times have we said that how many times as we as Believers looked at that and said oh Lord if it be their your will heal me today he says no no sure it's your will he said thus saith the Lord it's his will and he don't save us saith the Lord as the word the Lord is speaking he said it is his will you say can I receive the Holy Ghost today is the days of Miracles past certainly the days of Miracles is here and you know what he said in the next sentence whether the next word was forever [Applause] the days of Miracles wasn't just for the past perhaps the days of Miracles wasn't for the 1960s it wasn't for the 19 early 1900s on Azusa Street it was for today it's here forever but tongues today he said the Bible says so he says that these signs shall follow them the belief does it mean uh does it mean that men can interpret the message he the message talking about the interpret patience he says the Bible says To Us by this day and the words that he spoke there are the words for the Bride of Jesus Christ to get her ready to take a rapture these words are important he says we're living thus saith the Lord it's his will forever the days of miracle forever the Bible said so it settles it we could go home right now and know we've heard a great service we can go home right now and know that the Lord has spoken to us he said thus saith the Lord speak don't cry speak and go forward God don't want a bunch of cry babies that's the next sentence God don't want a bunch of crying babies he wants men with backbone he wants men women and children with backbone he wants you not to have wishbones he said wishbones and we don't need wishbones I wish I had this I wish I could do this how many of us sitting here this morning could honestly say that you I wish her before sure you have oh I I wish wish I could get to feeling better I wish I could get to feeling better I wish I could overcome this issue I wish I could overcome this problem I wish I could overcome this sin in my life I will wish I wish I wish I wish my finances were better that'll be a whole lot more Amen in right now I wish I wish I was a better better husband I wish I was a better father I wish I had a better marriage I wish I had I wish I wish I wish he says we don't need people that want to wish he said we need backbones men and women that'll stand in the breach what is that breach a breach is a gap and so he's looking for men God is looking for men and women that will stand in the gap between the obstacles of this world and the mediator Jesus Christ and stand there and say I'm just waiting to to overcome this obstacle standing in the breach he said we need people that will claim the victory that will claim and be called out in the midst of Darkness that no matter what anybody else says they're going to speak and go forward okay he says we need people we need people that believe the message [Applause] I said we need people that will believe the message I'm afraid there's a lot of people around the message that thank you we need people that believe the message we need people that know that God is here we need people that know that God is going to vindicate his message that God is here and that if the same God that was back there and Yonder on Galilee he said it's the same God that was there in the days of Moses and he can't fail why are we afraid if we ask of God or if we do something in the name of the Lord why are we afraid that we're going to fail are you are you deaf afraid of what God can accomplish are we that afraid that we look back and say oh I'm not going to wish for this I'm going to pray for it I hope it comes true I hope God don't let me down I hope God don't fail us here no we can't have that kind of attitude we have to believe it and we have to know that the Holy Spirit holy that's scriptural I'm not I'm preaching a problem 30 message this morning I'm just telling you what your god-given rights are this is the message this is the word this is scriptural let me talk about Moses for just a few minutes because you know one time there was a guy by the name of Moses back there on the back side of the desert and he's back down there on the back side of the day desert and about eight years old and got on the back side of the desert running from God backslid on God send back their herding sheep doing his thing married an Ethiopian woman got him a couple of kids here about 80 years old one morning he comes walking along and he's hobbling along there and talking to the wife and trying to go about the day's business and then all of a sudden the Lord shows up in a burning bush and we wonder if God will fail us God shows up in a burning bush and begins to speak and he says now look Moses I'm gonna send you down to Egypt I'm going to send you down to Egypt for what what are you sending me back down there for I don't you know I left there for a reason yeah but I'm gonna send you down there for for my reason I'm gonna send you down there to the greatest the most powerful the largest most mechanized Army that the world has ever seen the most powerfulest army in the world and I'm gonna send you down there I'm just to take it over hmm well well Lord I can't go I can't have nothing to do with this I left that place I'm murdered a man they'll have my head I can't go down there well what am I going to go down there with Lord don't you know you've already told me they're the largest the greatest the most trained soldiers that there are in the world how am I going to go down there he says Moses one you got in your hand a stick and we worry about God failing us what do you got in your hand Moses Moses said a stick just a stick Lord and he said he showed it to the Lord said here's a stick and he said yes in the hands of Moses it was when God takes a hold of your life things change it's no longer just a stick it's the holy ghost moving in your life and beating your obstacles down it's just a stick No Moses I'll go he says I'll go and the next morning he said the little old man 80 years old little old man going down there got him a little donkey and Whiskers hanging out here his wife's on the back of the donkey with a youngin on each hip going down to take over Egypt and he said the people in the town in the city said hey Moses where are you going it looks like you're traveling and Moses said glory to God I'm going to Egypt to take it over you're gonna do what are you crazy that's ridiculous and he said yeah he said they got a million trained men but God says it don't make any difference a million trained men and God says it don't make any difference how are you gonna fight them guys Moses he said well the Lord told me to take this stick the Lord told me to take this stick to go down there and take over so that's exactly what I'm going to do he says why it seemed ridiculous but he did it Hallelujah he said he did it he said God takes ridiculousness to prove his powers he says God takes things that which is not and brings us to which is not is is he said say how is he going to do this how is he going to do this how is God going to go down there and use Moses with a stick in his hand and take over a million men and overthrow an entire Army a fleet of Chariots and Spears and swords and shields and arrows oh he did it foreign he said Moses said it ain't none of your business to question this but it's our business to obey it so anytime God tells us to do something through the word and God is speaking to us it's not for you to question well Lord I don't think this is going to work out the way you think it is Lord I don't think my kids are going to come the way you you you're probably right it's none of your business it's your business to obey God and do what God tells you to do go take over the army take over Egypt take over the Throne of pharaoh don't let Pharaoh push you around anymore Jesus says if I don't do the works of my father then Believe Me Not but if I do the works of my father then you believe me on me the works I do shall he do also Father and the prophet said now King James has the word greater there he said but if you take the original it doesn't say greater he says how can anything be greater than what it's already been done there's nothing greater than a miracle there's nothing greater than raising the dead there's nothing greater than people converted to Christ there's nothing greater than salvation there's nothing greater than blind eyes open death ears lame walking there's nothing greater than that he said but he said right there he stopped nature he healed the sick he raises that he cleansed the leopard he's done everything but more of it you'll do who's he speaking to right here we have to put ourselves in the scripture put ourself in the word and when God said the Greater Works is you will do it he's talking to you and I in our day in our age it'll be more it should be it should be let me say it that way it should be more people healed today than ever was in Jesus ministry it should be more people healed today more people converted to the gospel than ever was in the day of Pentecost the zuza street meetings in the 60s or 70s it ought to be more people why because greater is the worst that you'll do more greater means more he said just one word Lord just one word from you and and it'll mean more than all the preachers in the world could speak just one word go forward you see many times brothers or sisters I think we take our troubles and we let our troubles overtake our hearts we let our troubles overtake our hearts we magnify our troubles and we we give our troubles great esteem we esteem our troubles so great that the healing powers of Jesus in our lives become kind of non-existent we magnify problems we magnify ailments we magnify our shortcomings and then what happens when we magnify those things the negatives our passion disappears our deal for the Lord disappears uh our strength that God has given us it disappears you see how important it is we don't lift those things up in other words what happens when we begin to talk and brag and and lift up the ailments and the problems we we lose our stick we dropped our stick we no longer have the stick to go down and take Pharaoh's Army because we've laid it aside and said they're too big they're too great they're too large they're too overwhelming for me to go over God but you know that's not God's desire in our lives God does not desire he does not want us to be defeated God does not raise children to be defeated to be beat down no he says you're more than able that's the words he speaks to his children you are more than able you're more than a conqueror you can overcome because I have already overcome the world these are the words that the Lord threw out there to us so brothers and sisters I chop your stick and go forward keep your composure when problems arise keep your composure and keep the stick in hand I'm talking about just life situations I'm not I'm not talking about just going out here Old Town I'm talking about in your home I took mine in your job we had an issue the other day she says uh my Ring's falling off I got her a ring when Weston was born and uh got three little sets in it and it's kind of special to us you know women you like your rings they have special occasions you like those things she said my ring keeps falling off so I'm gonna go put on my wedding set she hadn't worn it in a long time she wears it up this finger it's kind of a dual purpose and so I said okay so she goes back to go get the ring hey Brad what my Ring's not in there anybody else and I'm thinking why in the world didn't she put that where all the other stuff is here we've moved over two years ago boxes of stuff still still have scattered who knows where did we take this box with our wedding ring to the Interfaith is somebody really happy this morning they got a reward at the Interfaith laughs and I'm sitting there and I'm thinking don't don't don't don't just just stay calm it's just misplaced and God knows where it's at we may have boxes everywhere and I said where is it at where do you think you put it well you know that little box that that used to be in here used to be there she said oh I stuck it in there I said why why didn't you put it in the jewelry box with the others I don't know I just always stuck it in that one okay so I just go back and sit down I just kind of said Lord you know where this is at I'm not even gonna get worked up about it it'll turn up if it's today tomorrow five years ten years from now it's here somewhere and you know where it's at and someone said there's a box in there in your closet it's got some coins in it and the box is in there I didn't say nothing to her she's going about her business I know she was a little bit discouraged because she knew I was having to take deep breaths and I go in there I lift open the lid on the box there's the Box she described I opened the lid on that box there it sat right in the middle God is aware of our battles God is aware of what we have need of it's keeping your composure and on in the situation through God I could have got mad I could have kicked I could have stomped and snorted and made her feel like a like a hill but I just said God you're in control so I just went in there and I washed it up and I polished it up and I took it there I said I'd do better next time where did you find that it was in the box you said and another box and another box Jesus tell his disciples let not your heart s be troubled in our scripture reading let not your hearts be troubled let me tell you these disciples had a reason to have troubled hearts they had a reason to have troubled hearts because Jesus just told him one of you sat in here is a traitor one of you sat in here is a Trader and every one of you is going to deny me foreign these men have followed Jesus for the last so many months their livelihoods their businesses jobs careers and they said Jesus we're going to follow you we're going to do everything you tell us to do we're your disciples we're your followers and now he's leaving and we're going to deny and one of us is going to kill him so they had reason to be troubled look someone says let not your hearts be troubled let not your hearts be troubled so he can tell them that how much more does Jesus want us living today to look at us in the eyes and say let not your hearts be troubled you don't have nothing to worry about let not your hearts be troubled Brothers and Sisters Jesus didn't tell me I was a traitor Jesus didn't tell me that I was going to deny him Jesus didn't tell me but I was going to be the one to kill him Jesus didn't tell me all this Jesus said I will never leave you he's talking to you and I I will never leave you I will never forsake you greater is he that is in me and it is in you that is in the world he said that's me I'm going to come I'm going to dwell in you so we have no reason for our hearts to be troubled Greater Works shall you do and Thomas looks at him and says Lord we don't know where you're going how will we find the way we don't know where you're going how in the world are we going to know where to go when you leave here are you going to the next town are you going to the next city are you going across the ocean where are you going Lord we don't know where you're going can you imagine Jesus as he talks to him with sympathy now and Jesus is talking with sympathy and their weakness and teaching them they're asking questions that a little child in our homes would be asking his father but the understanding of Jesus his ministry the life he lived than what his own disciples who walked with him day by day knew do you realize that and many times we look back and we want to reflect on their lives we want to look back at what they did what about you and I it's Greater Works in you and Jesus looks at him he says I am the way I'm the truth I am the life he says and he's going to begin to show him he's showing them away and he's teaching them and Jesus right there and he's looking at him and he said why are you questioning where I'm going you know if Jesus hadn't have done that if Jesus hadn't went that route if he hadn't said I'm the way the truth and the life do you know we would have been left powerless if he hadn't took that trip we would make no power we would have no Authority we would have no weapons against Satan whatsoever we would be living every single day of our life defeated defeated defeated you couldn't win it would be impossible but he says I am the way I am the truth I am the life so if you're sitting here somebody's sitting here and you're wandering about and I don't know wandering around and we didn't know which direction to go and we were a bunch of Renegades out there finally somebody's looked at us and we said hey he's the way I've got to convert I gotta turn my life I gotta change either way I'm living because he's the only way and so you're sitting there and you're confused and you don't know what to think he's the truth we we've all been in those situations where we think man what is up and down I don't know you hadn't because I know you're human and I know you've questioned things you've questioned things in this book and you've questioned things in message books yep don't lie to me because I know you have but he is the truth somewhere down the line we had to look and say hey there's nothing no better than this Jesus is the truth the word of God is the truth and so when you're sitting there and you're feeling Dead about yourself you know if you ever had that feeling and I think young people feel it more than older people and it shouldn't be that way but young people in their teens especially they go through times in their lives and they go through times when they when nobody likes them everybody picks on them they got pimples yep you was there and you feel like I'm so dead inside where are you gonna go I am the life look at this and Jesus is telling them I'm the way I'm the truth I'm the life and it becomes it becomes real that This Is The Life situation that he is willing to die for the disciples he's willing to die for those that are to come he's willing to die for you and I and the age we're living in and Proverbs 18 24 says one who is on unreliable friends soon comes to a ruin but he says there is a friend who sticks closer than friends closer than a brother Jesus Christ will never leave you he'll never forsake you he'll be right there when all things come when push comes to shove he's right there and there's nobody like him but Jesus and Jesus made this remarkable statement claiming that he was the only way to God I'm the only way to heaven and brothers and sisters we have to find a friend in Jesus just beginning if you if you just questioning your walk with the Lord if you've been walking for 40 60 years it doesn't matter you have to have a friend in Jesus why why do we need that friend because he's more he's more than what a brother could ever be foreign you know I'll find out I find out when I think about this when nobody's around when I'm all by myself he's there have you ever thought about that I've been walking out and doing things and I look up I say Lord have mercy you've been with me all along there's a song I Like It says I'm walking in his Shadows and he's walking by my side he's there when I'm feeling alone I don't have to call the counselor when I'm depressed when I've got anxiety when there's fears in my life when I've got to make decisions I don't have to call the banker I don't have to call the counselor I don't have to call somebody and get advice he's right there that's who I go to when when I have problems I begin to talk to Jesus I don't have to look up somebody he's right there he's closer than a brother foreign and here is Jesus we keep him there Our Lives will be so much better you know when I was speaking to those kids at the school the other day at HCA I was going over the the Joshua and and possessions and the footsteps and to your goals and your Ambitions and your career and you're fixing to get married and you're going to be able to pick up pick a spouse and I said you know Paul says suppress on press on but the thing that I tried to instill in their mind is you're going to want all those things but the number one thing is to keep God first keep God as your number one priority I said if you go to picking out a guy make sure it's okay with God make sure he matches up to God's approval if you're getting ready to take on a new job make sure it's matching God's approval if you're getting ready to think about moving to a new job to ask is there a church to go to because if you're going to a place where there's no church and you think you're going to work and everything's going to be good you're badly mistaken because we are made to Fellowship we draw strengths and fellowship keeping God first and here's Jesus I want you to recognize this here he's sitting talking to them one on one he's telling them what's about to happen he's telling the disciples what's going on what's going to happen in their lives where he's going he's trying to explain himself he didn't pull them aside and say let's have he didn't pull him aside say hey before we talk about this before we get all spiritual we need to go to the temple where we're where we're surrounded by the temple of God he didn't do that that's why you don't you just have to talk to God and he was making it evident that I'm going to be right here through thick and thin I don't need all the rituals I don't need all the the the the the the the church buildings I don't need Grandeur but what I need I just need you to communicate with me talk with me one on one and I'm right here and that's what God wants from us and we have to do the very same same thing we have to set aside our own mind set aside our own wants our own desires our own things our own so that we can receive the fullness of the Holy Spirit to overcome our fears to overcome our doubts to overcome sicknesses in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he's the one true God the way the truth and the life we see that consistent theme All Through the Bible even think in the beginning of the Ten Commandments it says I'm the Lord your God who brought you the land of Egypt and out of the house of bondage and you shall have no other gods before me I am when they said who who should I tell them send me God you tell them I am sent you I am that I am that's who I am Jesus is talking to his disciples on the night of his departure and let me tell you they were afraid they were afraid they were full of fear and they were afraid because Jesus is leaving them that's the number one reason he's leaving and they begin to get afraid and maybe in their minds they're thinking oh my goodness we've been fired what will we do now what kind of works are we going to do we've traveled with him everywhere we've seen all these Miracles and wonders and now we're being fired because he's leaving he's pushing us to the side they didn't get fired God wasn't firing him God's not going to fire you he was giving a promotion he was promoting them to a place that they would be the ones to do the works that they would be the ones to be promoted into a place that they were the ones doing the praying they were the ones doing the the Divine works of God it was evident in their lives he says the works that I do you will do so Jesus is expecting them now to carry on the very works that he done no longer visible in Jesus's life but in their own life it has to be evident in our lives brother Jeff you're alive sister Alicia you're alive just retirement you're alive has to be evident in our lives and when we begin to look at this and we begin to see that the promise that seems impossible How can I ever do that is how can these Greater Works ever take place do you realize the first sermon that Peter preached more people was converted than all of Jesus's Ministry the very first day on the day of Pentecost more people was converted on that day than all of Jesus's Ministry combined there is a greater work say God wants us to have that Greater Works and he's telling us about these Greater Works and the Fulfillment of these works because I go to my Father and Jesus begins to explain this when he ascended what descended the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit living in us turn with me you've taken notes turn with me into the Book of John right where we was at I'm going to give you five scriptures I wasn't going to do this but I just couldn't get away from it I'm gonna give you five scriptures that you can pin down when you're having a bad day you say these are my five scriptures when I'm having a bad day that tells me who I am John Chapter 14 verse 16. say Amen when you get there 14 and 16. later in glasses somewhere 14 and 16. and I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may in the Greek it's called called apparently toast paracletose it means the one called alongside to help I'm walking in his Shadows he's walking by my side he's the one that's called he's the app but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatever I have said on to you 15 chapter 15 verse 7. if you abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask whatever you will and it shall be done unto you that's pretty good confidence those are those are red letter words herein is my father glorify that ye bear much fruit so that you may be my disciples as the father has to love me so I so I love you continue in my love you love one another as I have loved you as I have loved you evening like Tabernacle put your name there that I have loved you greater love hath no man than this that he lay down his life for his friends and last one the fifth one 15. 26 and 27. but when the comforter has come whom I will send unto you from the father even the spirit of Truth which proceedeth from the father he shall testify of me and ye also shall bear witness because ye have been with me from the beginning this is something God did in you from the very beginning from the foundation of the world he had you on his mind whatever you ask in my name that will I do um whatever you ask in his name that will I do now it's going to have to have a little explaining here so bear with me we're getting close to winding up in my name is not a magic potion you could say Jesus name all you want you say Well it speaks of an endorsement like a like a bank check and it does the prophet says you got to check sign your name he said if you need healing sign it's already been signed Jesus Christ sign it accept it you need healing accept it you need Deliverance accept it you need salvation accept it but there are some limitations to that you say I've never heard that one well let me tell you you know my son Wesson's sitting here he's in four hours away living he don't have a lot of money he don't mind me tell you that he's broke so his mother and I can't send him all four hours away with nothing to buy food or Necessities with so we go and we get a debit card its own Brad and Joyce Powell's account it's my money it's his mother's money it's it's our savings our living when we work we put it in our account but he's got a card that says Weston Powell and it's tied to that account but you know what I did I trust him I love him with all my heart but I told the bank I said he needs a hundred dollar limit there's limitations he needs a hundred dollar limit so he knows he can't spend but a hundred dollars at a time his never abused it I'm using that as an illustrator Quest that must be in accordance with the character of the name on the account did you hear what I said he knows he better not go swipe that card on anything he that he could spend it on if his dad daddy wouldn't bite or if his mama wouldn't buy it we know what goes in and out of the camp B-Dubs everybody knows what that is right you got to be cool it's B-Dubs it's not Buffalo Wild Wings it's B-Dubs laughs B-Dubs McDonald's it's okay if he needs to eat he needs to eat if he needs clothes he needs clothes if he needs gas he needs gas but the limitations have to line up with my life and that's the way God is we can't just take out a check and say Lord this guy done me wrong in business I hope his business Burns to the ground in Jesus name and you may have thought that but I hope you didn't say that because there's a limitations there's parameters there you can't go out there and you can't be having things for your personal Ambitions Lord here's my check I want a million dollars because I need a boat and I need a I need a an apartment and I need a I need a motorcycle I need a four-wheeler in Jesus name JC it don't work that way anything in his name name it says that you have the same mind as him you're in one Accord you're together with him and you say Lord I'm not feeling good Lord my child is suffering my child is sick my child has fever and I ask in the name of Jesus Christ that he be delivered and he signs the check yes sir Jesus Christ is done deposit that in your account you say I want to overcome the sin of my life I'm tired of being bound down by Satan and the demons and the Demonic forces of depression and fear and anxiety I think sign the name that's what he's talking about Jesus answers the those requests I'm gonna have to skip some he says it here today the same yesterday today and forever we've heard that our lives where do we stand with that you know a couple messages ago brother Byler asked us he said are you the Royal Seed of Abraham did you remember him saying that but he did he was preaching he come about to this spot right here he said you're the Royal Seed of Abraham what is that Royal Seed of Abraham the Royal Seed of Abraham says that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever it's the Royal Seed of Abraham that said he's here and he's going to perform just like he did for the Seed of Abraham to the people that's been called out of Babylon it's for the people's been called I saw them for the people that's been called out of the world it's for those people that are separated and he promises to do exactly the same thing that he did to that Royal Seed of Abraham of Jesus Christ after 2000 years more than two thousand years he said he stands here in the midst of us the mighty conqueror stands here in the midst of us as the mighty conqueror he says the word of God who can discern the thoughts of the hearts and the intents what is it it's the Seed of Abraham shall possess the gates of his enemy that Royal seat the word of God I've got about two more patches on that but I'm gonna skip it and we're going to move on talk about Samson here for a minute I want to get to these two characters Samson is sitting here and the prophet said one day the Philistines come up all about him and he said Samson is out here and and he he knows one thing it's not Marksmanship it's not how to handle a sword it's not how to defend with a shield it's not how to shoot a bow Samson knows one thing I am the anointed of God with under a Nazarite battle he said he was never trained as a warrior Noble Warfare about him at all and he said here he is today and a thousand Philistines come around about him and he's looking up there and he's wondering what am I going to do and he says the spirit of God come upon him and reminded him you are a Nazarite he said grab something so he reaches down and picks up the Jawbone of an ass one man annihilates a thousand Warriors he begins to swing that Jawbone back and forth and back and forth and back and forth why could he do that because the spirit of God come upon him and that's what makes the difference Moses had a stick Samson had a Jawbone a thousand men and he said there was a little shamgar this is the greatest story I feel like one of the greatest in the Bible shamgar just a little old rundown farmer famished from the year before because the Philistines had come and taken everything from me how many of us have ever let the devil take a year from us what year I've done nothing but fail after fail after fail I've let the Philistines come and take my corn I let them take my grain I let them take my eggs I've let them take my meat my family's gonna starve to death because I'm not I'm not the head of my house yeah you fall into those roots and here's shamgar is he's sitting there and he's thinking I don't know what I'm gonna do if they come back but right now honey right now honey we've got food we've worked all Year my dear and the problem said his little wife's in there fresh skin and bones and the children's Skin and Bones and he said we've got food we've got grain we've got corn we've got everything we need to get us through the next year and they're excited we're going to make it and the prophet says shamgar looked out the window and he said he could see those Philistines coming and he said not today and what I'm gonna do what will I do how will I take them on I don't know how to fight and the prophet said if I had a sword if I had a shield I could take them on and a lot of times we think oh if I was a preacher if I was a deacon I could take on all these Devils let me tell you we fight the same way you do one word at a time get thee behind me Satan and here shamgar is they said he looked around what can I do and he said he picked up an ox go from God that we no longer have to let the Philistines Rob us of our grain he said I'm a I'm an Israelite we could say we're born again believers that same Covenant that applies to us as it did them brother Brown said a lot of times people say the odds are against me on Divine healing gods are against us on old-time salvation he says what difference does that make their circumstances spirit of God cut the world away he looked out there Sam guard his righteous Indonesian rose up back and forth he wasn't a warrior he wasn't a preacher here he wasn't this that the other just like you are today you know brother Byler preached the message I'm quizzing y'all a lot today aren't I he preached a message a couple Services ago and he talked about lying vanities you remember that lying back was hurting so bad and had been hurting for about two weeks that I couldn't hardly get out of the bed I take a step and just cringe and I said I told Joe I was here a while back I said I I'd go anywhere in the world if somebody could just help my bike I said I go to a massage therapist I'd go to a chiropractor I'd go to a sports therapist I go whoever whoever could help my back why did I not think of the one who could help my back brother Butler begins to preach and he says all these symptoms that we have are lying vanities and I thought you know what that's exactly what this back problem is it's a line vanity it's a symptom and something that I've got in my head and I think that I can't overcome this I heard I heard I heard and I can't overcome it lion vanities so I began to I thought Lord I'm not going to accept this anymore listen here Satan this you're lying to me my God Is A Healer I don't need you to put me on my back and you will put me on my back no more because I have a family to support I have work to do I have churches I need to go to I've got places to be places to go people to see word to spread and I just said this is no more and I woke up the next morning and said ah and this goes on for a few days now I'm not gonna I'm not gonna lie to you and tell you it was a it's a miracle I'm not gonna lie to you and say it was instantaneous that I said Lord Heal Me and it was gone that's not the way it worked but I began to look at it I thought there's a root call somewhere to this problem Satan you're the root cause you're the one causing me all this torment and I began to do a few stretches a few exercises Lord Heal Me in Jesus name I need the Deliverance I need I need you to touch my body you're saying well he didn't come up to get prayer God didn't tell me to you he told sister Hannah that day she came up for prayer now she's well and I sat there and I thought am I supposed to go to the altar Lord but I began to talk to the Lord and little by little day by day I'm feeling pretty good praise the Lord God still answers our prayers he cares about those things and God cares and and he wants to he wants to be your friend he wants to be all those things and why how can he do that John 16 and closing John 16 33 says these things I have spoken unto you that ye might have peace peace that means the devil can't control us if you're not at peace the devil is doing something in your life if your life is is in a confused State of Mind Satan's controlling something he's turning some knobs and pushing some buttons somewhere but we don't have to have that it says you may have peace in the world you shall have tribulation yep yep it's not always going to be good he says but be of good cheer for I have overcome the world the Santa Fe sometimes we just have to put things in action we have to put things in action and I saw a little a little clip a little thing on the internet and it was a former Navy SEAL and I really don't know how you address that some of you that was in the military can tell me later I don't think your former I think you're always a Navy SEAL you're always a special forces you're always a ranger you're always a soldier I guess I should say an inactive Navy SEAL he was telling a story and he said he was telling a story he said listen I was a my job as a Navy SEAL I was a breacher not a preacher a breacher with a B and he said it was my job to go in before my team and my job was to go in before the rest of the people and I go in there and I would see what kind of laws what kind of obstacles whatever the Fortress was that was keeping us out that we couldn't go around we couldn't go over and we couldn't go under and my job was to reach it I'm going through it and he said I would look and I would see how to be how to build a bomb that would destroy this wall and he said so I would go back and I would build the bomb just exactly like it needed to be and he said I will take that bomb and he said I would take it and stick that C4 right up there that's right Dana C4 brother Brian C4 he said I would stick it right on that wall and he said I'd look around he said oh I can see behind me with green eyes his brothers were behind him waiting waiting in the dark and he said all I could see behind me was was green eyes and he said they were waiting to hear me say three words and on those three words all chaos was fixing to break loose and he said those three words he said I still say them every day of my life every morning they are execute execute execute hell you see we have obstacles in our lives we have walls that's been built up in our lives and it's up to you and I to execute execute execute on a day-to-day basis because if you don't execute what God what you should be doing for God if you don't execute your prayer life if you don't execute in your in your and your sincerity before God if you don't execute and praying before God and getting before God and in a sincere way there's going to be walls and if you don't execute that prayer life in that life before God those walls will be your marriage your marriage won't be what it should be you won't be the father you should be you won't be the mother you should be you won't be the student you should be you won't be the young person you should be so think about that next time when you get up in the morning and you think what am I going to do today how am I going to tackle this day next execute be more than Overcomer more than a conqueror when that wall is in front of you and you can't go around you can't go over it you can't go under execute and breach right through it you love the Lord this morning praise the Lord brother Brown says God will pour out more spirit and more power upon his church and upon his people everywhere that our faith may be lifted up above all the defects of life that we may be able to be more than Overcomers and conquerors through him that loved us and gave us his life amen let's turn if

Ox ghost couldn't stand up to a sword or a shield stick it couldn't fight off Amelia [Music] shamgar didn't step out there thinking he was going to conquer an army foreign as we Face the trials and the hustle bustle of tomorrow the challenges and the trials and temptations that come our way Lord we pray that you'll allow us to see ourselves in the word delete allow us to see ourselves in the scripture as Moses as a Samson as a sham guard and step out there in faith and say we're consecrated by the word of Jesus Christ you said you'd never leave us to forsake us you'd be with us even in us to the end of the world Lord let us stand on that word and let us stand on the thoughts that you're closer than a brother you're a friend that that will not leave us you'll not forsake us and let us
