10 000 years we'll get to sit under evergreen and tree and say hey that's so tell me your story you know so let me tell you something very few to god we get to jump up and run around the trail of it and see i've got something to tell you it's all about jesus amen what he done for me amen said that's what we want to hear tonight god bless each and every one of you i can't think of any announcements and so we'll just have brother uh sean come amen and come and uh give him give us his story amen have you got a scripture that you're gonna read i'm gonna read a scripture before we do that okay amen and then uh we'll just hand the micro microphone around and if once he's done you know and if it don't go past 12 well then you know it'd be all right amen turn your bibles if you will to luke the 12th chapter luke 12. amen so brother sean is going to make his confession and and testimony of what christ has done for him in front of everyone i truly believe this will be recorded in heaven amen and so we know that all of our lives are recorded in that right so in 12 chapter 12 of luke verse 8 it says and i say unto you whosoever shall confess me before men him will i confess him will the son of man also confess before the angels of god but he that denied me before men shall be denied before the angels of god amen so how many knows it's a real privilege to stand for jesus amen and testify of him amen brother sean god bless everybody um i know i talk a lot and y'all all know all about me so uh i'll just go past that part um i'm gonna start back uh talk to brother tommy i've been talking about the bothering brother david and even brother joe i believe i mentioned to him before i wanted to testify i felt like you know um it would be kind of a release for me because a lot of things you hold in um a lot i mean you talk to your family and you talk to people here and there and uh but i feel like uh speaking to you guys might really just be therapeutic and you know i guess you could say um so i'll start back um when i was about six years old um the first thing i witnessed from christ i used to have really bad earaches when i was a young kid um i mean i don't remember when they started but i do remember when they stopped um um but i had hearaches almost all the time and they were tormenting type of earaches and um i had stayed home from church one night my dad when at the time my dad was going to a pentecostal church um but he had come home and saw me writhing on the floor uh he called brother tatum i still remember his name the pastor of the church um to come over and pray for me and um and brother tatum came over and um i'm laying on the floor still crying and screaming and they get on their knees and they start they lay their hands on them and they start praying and and this to me it means like you know the faith of a child you know that's and some of you preached the other day about having a simple simple faith that's a simple thing we make it much more difficult than it really is and i just wanted to speak about this this part i'm sorry i can be talkative i'll try my best not to be but um so like i said my dad and brother tatum they got one knee on the floor with me and they started to um pray and in my mind um i know they're talking to jesus you know i i mean i remember i mean this is like probably the most vivid child memory childhood memory i have but i knew only thing i really knew and understood is they were talking to jesus and i knew everything was going to be all right and um i after just maybe a few minutes of prayer all of a sudden the pain just went away and i set up and i looked at my dad and i said who did that he said who did what son i said who pulled that out of my ear and from that day to now i've never had a problem with any of my ears and i praise god for that because that was just the first thing that made me see what god's capable of doing and that's you know i want to get back to that kind of faith and i'm sure i can speak for everybody here when saying that we need to make faith a whole lot less complicated um and uh it really shouldn't be but we let so many things in the world get in the way of our thoughts and uh you get confused and you you know you feel things and it makes you second guess but we need to get back to that simple faith where it's just as simple as taking god in this word that's that you know because that's what it's intended to be if y'all don't mind i'll i gotta i mean i could go on but uh another time my daddy he found a message church um probably maybe two years later roughly and uh it was bible tabernacle and um some of y'all may know albert greene remember albert greene around charlotte statesville north carolina area but um we were having church one night i think it was a wednesday night it was a really bad storm and they put on a projector to watch uh the deep on the deep cough into the deep and um we were just all sitting there i think i'm at this time i might have been eight or nine years old and um we were watching the deep policies i hadn't got very far into it a massive lightning bolt struck outside the church and knocked all the power out all around the neighborhood you can see it was just pure blackness and uh this is just something i witnessed supernatural with god i wanted to share with you all and um so we're sitting there in the darkness for a minute the projector obviously stops there's nothing on and um a light comes into the room a ball of light not like a reflection of like a you know a car going by but a ball of light came around started circling the church then it went to that projector and when it went to that projector that projector came on and started playing the deep cloth into the deep right there with no other power on anywhere in the neighborhood and i'm telling you god is real i mean he will show himself in so many different ways you can physically see him and i thought i feel i was fortunate enough to physically see the spirit of god that night coming there in that little ball of light just so we could watch that message at night it was and it um i don't know if i'm going too long on a personal level i want to thank god for um uh well all that it's personal but um i went through a lot of things um especially coming out of the military i had started drinking um while i was in the military and when i found out i was being medically retired i'm you know had nothing better to do and i got depressed and i started you know they sent me to my medical appointments to get you know evaluated and all my medical appointments were in the morning and i'd go home and just i'd go and that my appointment i go home and i just started drinking all day all day and it was nothing for me to put down 30 or more beers in a day and um it just got worse worse and to the point where i wanted to stop so bad but every time i tried i started going into detox you know my whole body would cramp up my muscles would cramp up and um and my heart would uh at some points got up to 189 190 beats a minute and i could have been going on the cardiac arrest and i felt like well if i could just taper off this alcohol you know if i could just taper off and i tried that but no it wasn't working and i just and and the only thing that i felt like was saving me from dying was to keep drinking it got to that point that's and that's what the devil does to you know you and he can get you to the point where it's fatal i mean and that's where i was at that point in my life and um i was i caused all kinds of problems for my family i was mean um i mean worst human being you could probably possibly imagine at that time in my life and um but i finally um called i forgot the name of the place in hawkinsville kentucky and said you know i know god's gonna take this from me but he also gave us help to get rid of these things so um i went and checked myself and i told him i want to be here for just three days just to let me you know help me through the detox thing and i'm never going to drink again and i knew in my mind if i could just get past that i would never drink again because i knew god was going to deliver me from it because in my mind i was already done drinking it was a matter of getting anyway i'm long-winded y'all so i went and after uh six days instead of three they decided to keep me three extra days i came home and i went years and years and years without drinking any more alcohol again and god delivered me from that and you're talking about a peace of mind something such a huge thing came off my shoulders but then i backslid but all that you know and i was drinking and this is recent and um not i mean fairly recent i started not as bad as not as heavily as i was before but i was drinking again and in my mind i'm like what am i doing am i really going to go down this road again and i ca and i kept doing them i kept doing it and i was even while i was drinking i would talk to god and say god i don't want this you've already delivered me from this um why am i letting this back into my life and then i was in a very very dark place not you know not long ago i would text brother byler and brother david and probably be incoherent because and i was embarrassed um i was trying to reach out but i was in such a dark place i didn't know how to talk i didn't know how to explain myself and um and it went through that and i was so depressed and you think you your thoughts come to your mind about ending your life and you know not being you know good for your family what's the use of you being around type of thing but i never but in my mind i never forgot that god already delivered me i just had to you know anyway um and then one night i had a really bad one day i had a really bad day and a really bad night and i mean i was just yelling to the top of my lungs just like i'm embarrassed about it i was yelling at my family i was whoever was around saying mean things was like god i can't be like this it's not who i am you know it's not what i'm supposed to be and the next morning i woke up and i and this was probably about three months ago and i woke up and all of a sudden i felt like that darkness had lifted out of my mind and i saw light again it just felt so good to finally got i knew that god had already delivered me it was just me you know i backslid into it i just kept on hanging on i'm already delivered i'm already delivered i'm already delivered and it left me again god took it away from me again and um i have i mean i could testify all day about things god's done for me but i just i just wanted to let everybody know there a little bit of background story about me you know the way of a transgressor is hard and i'm living proof of that i mean if you choose to i know i'm one of god's i know i am but if you choose to go against his word and turn her back on him because they didn't turn his back on me i turned my back on him and um if you choose that road and you're one of his you're going to feel it and i'm telling you what my mom was going through turmoil my body was going through turmoil and i'm still not where i need to be but i know that i've come a long way and i know i'm gonna like i remember one time brother bob looked straight at me during the service and he said you know god hasn't won didn't begin to work and knew that he i can't my mind's blank and i'm nervous so i can't think of the scripture but if he begins a good work in you he'll complete it i remember you you looked directly at me and said that and i was like it just gave me so much encouragement you know i was like yeah i know i mean you know we all have our faults we all we all we all have our failures and i want to share y'all share with you all mine and just um let y'all know a little bit about me um but um there's a lot of things i can stand up here and testify about things i've witnessed in the message and and maybe another time i'll be able to do that but i could keep talking all night so i'll just go ahead and just stop there and just praise god and thank him for everything he's done in my life protecting me healing me i mean there's just so many it's an endless list of things that god has gotten me through and i really appreciate him for it [Applause] amen thank you bye sean that was good amen god can deliver can he amen i'm so thankful for it praise be to god keep molding us and shaping this into his image amen amen who else wants to give a testimony this evening all right come on brother glenn all right lord amen god bless you thanks for your service uh now that sean has brought it all up and cleared his conscience i want you guys to know the more it worked in the mysterious way because the devil was in sean and it backfired because he brought me who started sinning about 50 years ago into the church two years ago and believe it or not i quit smoking i don't drink i used to vape i don't fade i only got one little sin that i'm trying to get rid of and i'll get rid of it if i don't my wife's gonna kill me but other than that but i i want you to know sean i thank him every day for showing me that god is still here and that was one terrible night when all things went wrong and he was in one of his bad bed spaces and he he was talking crazy and you know you were and so he was going to walk home about five miles away or more and go home and shoot itself he said and i said well no you're not because i'm gonna tell you being the center that i was the lord punished me i had a 14 year old son that took his own life with a gun so that's on me never will i let that happen to anyone else and so that uh my our friend uh leo who served with sean in afghanistan uh we got in the truck and we took off and we got down and here here the police are and shawn's being being an idiot so we decided we better get involved and when we told the officer that we were both uh retired service men and sean was also retired he was just a little crazy right now instead of putting him in jail they took him and got him a little help and from that point on the lord has blessed all of us his family my family they have a beautiful granddaughter they have a wonderful son and a wonderful daughter and so i just can't thank the lord enough and i hope everyone realizes that he is still here and he works [Applause] amen praise god for his mercy amen all right who wants to go next amen you had all week to pray about it brother tommy come on up here he's wanting everybody to get fired up is that all right i think everybody half the church is yesterday right or the other day come on folks let's go i like that kind of guy better timing god bless you still always get nervous when i get up here i thought i started out thinking uh i've been wanting to say this for a while because uh tammy always messes with me about like if i build anything she wants the second one you know and i just thought that you know sometimes i want to just tell y'all i'm sorry and you know it's like bless y'all's heart for y'all have to hear my first testimony because it was like an hour and a half you know then you live and learn and i remember my second one you know i got down to about 45 minutes and uh it's a little bit a little bit it's growing and progressing you know yeah and i just thought i was like man i put you all through it on that first testimony but uh i said uh uh i got my big checkup coming up next monday you know i'm coming up to go up to see if uh you know what the the aorta terror looks like and everything you know i'm just praying for a complete victory over this thing so you know because i got people all around me that you know you can see the unbelief in their eyes and when we talk they're like well i can't wait to see what you know happens up there you know i'm like well honestly i don't really care anymore what happens you know at the end of the day i got to put my faith and trust in the lord you know brother brown said too he said uh you got your healing as long as you as long as you keep believing for your healing so you know if i just keep taking god at his word he says by my stripes you're healed i'm the lord that god that healeth thee so i don't have nothing to worry about even if it does come back show a terror or something i'm just gonna keep on believing you know that i'm talking to the great physician you know it got me to thinking you know if i listen to the doctors and the devils i'd be shriveled up laying uh laying on the bed or in the hospital better on the couch in a dark place crying about it you know it was like they come it was like they come and just strip me in my life but you know jesus came on scene and restored my life you know gave me something shout out about you know i said i was on the way the other day i had to go down i had a little cousin of mine like 26 years old he'd get to worry he was bad doing heroin and meth and stuff and kind of got off that and you know just gave him real bad uh alcoholic and everything and somehow another he fell hit his head and killed him you know what at odds you know i'm saying you know we never know in our life you know and all what god's brought me through in my life you know i should have been dead a million times over you know but you know and i i ended up my brother they ended up letting him release come down from prison i end up taking him back to louisville but it was kind of a weird experience on the way home the lord just started dealing with me man and it was just overwhelming experience i had with the lord that night but it was like i could see you know where i would have been dead or in prison if it wasn't for the grace of god you know that was me and i just began you know crying in the lord you know because it was just like man that was me and i don't even remember hearing this and brother joe said it the other night i don't even remember hearing the song i guess it's a song but i was like you know i was just crying man i'm crying out to god and i'm just like you know uh i want to cry out to you i don't want to rock crying out for me i want to cry out to the rock you know i just thought that was awesome hearing you say it you know i even heard it and i think it is a song but you know but and then the other day i had heard this song and shared it and said uh you gotta fall to fly and it wound up going on and it was it was going on in the song it was talking about a mother eagle pushing the little eaglets out as the eaglets are falling towards the rocks you know they're falling down and that little the mama eagle swoop up and put them on their wings you know and uh i had a little bible study going for these guys we're doing up here every monday and uh as we was getting in there the topic was on abraham and and having to sacrifice isaac and they start talking this and that and he was like something came to me and got a little revelation there you know the natural forerunning the spiritual i sing that song again and it was just making me think i say you know it was like god built abraham up to be able to have the faith about to know that even if he didn't he would be able to raise him up you know god gave him to me but raise him up but he lifted his faith and that made me think about you know us trusting in our wings that god's done gave us as we start swooping down he trains us and gets us to where we can trust in what he's done gave us praise god you know and uh i just thought that was awesome because that was just you know that little bit of inspiration just get you fired up you know think about the lord you know but it got me just thinking more of that victory and that trust in the lord it's awesome just being the bride of christ you know we all have these signs and wonders and things all around us we're so blessed to see you know uh brother branham and his ministry and see it and believe it you know i should just give us more all something to shout about his mercy and grace we found favor with the lord you know it's just it's i was thinking i'm like let's just all start shouting let's just i'll start pulling on the lord more that's why i was trying to serve the group up let's just pass the mic just praise god lift him up you know and uh i'm like this message you know of jesus christ it's like a pearl of great price it's awesome you know to be a part of it truly we're blessed chosen people you know it's given us something to shout about and you know as i'm sharing with family and friends you know and exercising them faith muscles like i said as we're sharing and digging in the word and we find our indifferences you know with different people and things you know it's like uh we was talking to a nightmare in a buddy of mine you know and it's just like you know as you start saying that you know we're just a continuation of the book of acts you know we should be seeing these signs these wonders of gifts of healing deliverance salvation all these things we should see here being baptized with a field full of the holy ghost you know just like they had in the first church we should have it now we should be able to lift them up you know and uh but more i dig in there the more more faith that god gives me you know it's like the message of the hour it's just got us more personal more in a deeper relationship you know what the lord this bride does you know he's restoring the power in the church and you know to help us soar higher you know and by the grace of god it's just a testimony in itself to even see it you know because you start witnessing it to anybody and talking with people i just heard i just heard a minister say brother branham said that uh the three or the three things i remember two of them the three things he's gonna bring in the armageddon he said the trinity rock and roll music he was typing rock and roll music with worldliness and worldliness he said now that was 1965. you can look now it's all into all the stuff you know with you know social media all these things you know i mean everything's fine as long as you can control it but you know what i'm saying and and i have buddies and stuff that you know want to art theologian basically and that was a bible front and back and they argued at their blood in the face and looked right over in the name of jesus christ you know but anyway i got off on a little tangent third uh i think i might have skipped over something i might get lucky but uh anyway i know that we're all in different spots in life you know and you know and as i'm growing i want to share my experience strength and hope as i'm growing and progressing you know i learn we learn from our mistakes that's what i was talking about you know she always said she like to have number two of what i feel because you know i'll get better at what i'm doing same thing we should be progressing in the spirit you know and uh you know i like to share as i'm learning seeing what was changing in my life you know uh before i was living you know just a halfway i mean that's why you look look what kind of fellowship did i have i didn't have no fellowship in the church i wasn't fellowshipping with god really you know i have a haphazardly stagnant complacent relationship with the lord you know i was basically i look back almost like a man running from the lord you start thinking on them things you know i just i caught myself looking at that stuff and i see the things that i started changing you know i walk in the spirit as he's in the spirit and i took the old bad habits and started you know just even just being complacent you know like i said it ain't like i'm out here doing drugs and stuff but just being anyway but it's like the more you feed on that spirit that spirit the more i'm feeding on that stuff reading feeding and doing these things and the more we praise god that's why i said you know and he inhabits the praise of his people it just gets me fired up talking about him sometimes you know i'll get it going you know and uh it's not like i had a boy either it's not like i'm sitting here trying to add a boy i'm just telling you what i'm learning from what i'm doing and it's working just blessed to be the god blessed be the name of the lord dig in there on him you know uh and he's the one changing my life it's him doing the work you know and don't believe me believe it works you know the lord i i just want my life to inspire others and and to become their fellowship become deeper in the lord and and deeper walk in the spirit as he's in the spirit just get into the spirit you get once you start getting into it like i was sharing with somebody some basic things the other day like you know because when i started saying you know it's about a personal relationship well then when you step back and think they're cause they're just like yeah so when you start thinking about somebody i don't really know a whole lot about a personal relationship so i started thinking i'm like well you know take a take a 30 day challenge i was trying to write them something out you know because i'm just praying god you can do the work and this time if we can just kind of give them something and the crazy thing was i wrote this little thing out a little and the next day a sermon popped up on my youtube channel exactly everything i wrote it was so crazy that's for the natural forerunner spiritual i believe that's just the holy ghost being right in the line showing you right on track but i just tell them you know simple things you know i said i said try to pray like david did morning noon and night something stupid simple to remember try to turn all your radio music stations to some something christian got to go to a church wednesday morning and sunday morning if you can somewhere just go find you a youtube channel when you're washing your car listen to a sermon i say you know you start doing that you're feeding that spiritual man he's going to get stronger your personal relationship with the lord is going to grow greater and you know it's just something simple like that i don't know i'm preaching to the choir here but i'm saying but that's what we're doing and that's what i was doing and that's what i've been doing and and seeing results just like jim if we're gonna share you know tips and tricks in the gym that's what was working for me but anyway uh you know i started seeing too in my life you know i come to a spot you know if our hearts condemn us not then we can have confidence in god we can come boldly before the throne of grace you know believe in all things are possible and uh and then you come into a piece of understanding that enjoy unspeakable full of glory blessed be the name of the lord [Applause] that's some good advice give the pray more in the morning think about the lord more feed on the spiritual things and it meant less of the things of the world praise the lord i mean i know sister tammy's seen the lord working in tommy she's probably having she probably have a testimony amen but anyway she could tell you some stories no doubt but praise god i'm just glad to see them amen together amen because i'll tell you what through all of those storms i mean it's pretty rough but the lord jesus is uh you know when he comes he comes he changes things don't he amen praise the lord all right anybody else amen all right brother joshua come on up here praise the lord amen it's a testimony of him being with us here isn't he yeah i'll give him a hand so josh [Applause] i thought song leading was tough um i wasn't planning to give a testimony i was driving in the truck today and thought about you know i really don't give the lord enough glory for what he's done in my life and um so i just thought if there was a few excrements i'd get up here and just thank him for what he's done for me um just some of the stuff he's brought me through and where he's brought me to and um i grew up in washington state and um and i was never very smart academically growing up preferred to goof off and kind of just waste my time and stuff and um skip forward to high school i failed out of high school i didn't graduate and that really got me depressed i was really down about it i was working at dairy queen when i was almost 20 years old still just felt like i was doing nothing with nothing with my life and um and i just i grew up in church i was raised in a message family and all my siblings were serving the lord and i just felt this pressure i had to do that too but i could never bring myself into section to do that and i always sat back quietly in church and just viewed everything that was wrong and spotted every hypocrite that i could and was like that's the reason why i'll never do that because that's like that and that was kind of my thing to sit in the balcony and then when everyone asked me you know what are you going to give your heart to the lord say well i don't want to be like this brother because he does listen this and this and so i would use it as an excuse to keep living the way i was and um and so i was just i was on a really bad really bad trip down and and um when i was about 19 i started getting heavy into drinking and um i found it kind of helped me cope with um the way i was feeling depression but of course you know the next day you wake up and you feel ten times worse it doesn't help anything and so with that and feeling like my life was going nowhere i was really depressed and really low and but there's one thing that always stuck in my heart and and i would hear the minister saying the only thing that would catch my attention in church and they'd say what's the desire of your heart when you sift through everything else what's the root desire in your heart and i'll sit there and think if i could be one way out of anything i don't care about a fantastic career or going big places wherever if i could just have one wish granted it would be to be a true real believer in my heart but i felt like there was never ever a place i could get there and i was so bound down and i was just depressed all the time and even when i quit dairy queen and got a better job and and started doing better and stuff and bought a car and all this stuff i still there was still that hole in my heart and i know i've sit there and think you know you're never going to get married you don't graduate high school like you don't anything off for anybody and that depressed me too and um i never thought there would be a solution to that and um then when i was 22 years old uh we had our church camp at bible way and um the ron spencer came and preached and if there i told the lord two things in my life and the lord has a sense of humor i said i'll never give my life to the lord at a church camp because it's a bunch of hype and a bunch of emotion and i would never find a girl at church camp because that was just where people find each other and i ended up giving my life to the lord church camp and meeting melea at church camp so [Applause] so [Applause] when i was 22 it's 2017 and um brother ron spencer was the speaker and i for about the last three four years i didn't like going to camp i was like i'm an adult and i have a job and you don't need to tell me go to bed and take my phone and all that stuff and but then 22 was the cutoff year and i was like you know i'll go one last time like all my buddies were going i was like you know one last time hang out with everybody and then who knows what life has and brother ron um brother wrong came i was preaching and uh it was a saturday night service and i talked to my friend before and i was my best friend ellie and i said hey you know they're gonna have the prayer line that night i was like i'm not sitting in that tent for three hours let's go to the cabin like when they start singing at the end so he's like all right so we're going to sneak up the back hill and go to the cabin and uh and so he my friend ellie left and then i came after him and when i got up near the hill i realized i forgot my flashlight and uh so i turned around and uh i hadn't heard a word from that service i hadn't paid attention to any of it and um i went back to get my flashlight and then i just began sitting in the back and for some reason i just sat down and i had my flash on my hands and i was ready to go no one was gonna stop me i just sat down and i was thinking um like what am i doing like and i was thinking i could see the spirit of the lord moving i could feel it and i was like i can't do this again i'd had so many camp experiences i was like i can't survive another one thinking that i'm meeting the lord and then just falling on my face a few months later i was so done with it it happened so many times and um and so i i began sitting there and i was just pondering it and then i felt someone put their hand on my shoulder and it was my cousin jonathan and he just sat down next to me we were nine days apart and he just started talking to me and he was like you know like you're at a crossroads here and what are you gonna do about it and i was like yes i've heard this 50 times and 49 of them were from you but this time it was just different and uh and so he gave me his little spiel i kind of was like yes yes okay so he went away and i was sitting there and then i was like man i don't want to get on my like i don't want to pray i don't want to do nothing so i left the service and there's a big field outside and i was just pacing back and forth in the field i finally just something witnessed to my heart and was like why don't you try talking to god like he's one of your buddies why don't you just talk to him like he's one of your friends don't approach him with a bunch of these and thousands you know king james version language just talk to him like you would talk to anybody else so so i was just walking that field looking like a crazy person just talking to myself you know and i was just telling the lord i said lord i don't even know if i'm going to try tonight but if i'm going to try this is the last time that i'm ever trying because i'm not going through that again and i was just walking in the field in the field i looked in and i saw the prayer line was coming to a close and i was still out in the field and something just witnessed my heart was like go through the prayer line i was like i can't build the prayer line if i go through it everyone's gonna think i had a big experience and got saved and started saying congratulations and i just don't want that and uh so i was just going out and i just kept on the lord you know like a friend and that was the first time i felt him like a friend when i started talking to him like a friend and i just and he just started witnessing my heart and just building up my courage and i knew i had to go through that line and um i went through so i went through the line and i was sitting there and i was still trying to keep my composure you know stand up i was the last i was the second the last person to come into the line and i know still trying to keep my composure and still putting on my tough guy act and standing there with my lit bit standing there you know all tough and the closer i got to the front i was like i could feel myself getting weaker and starting to crumble and crumble and finally by the time i got to the front of the line brother ron asked me i think it was rather wrong it was a little foggy and he's like you know he's like what's your desire like what's your desires what are you asking in my heart for all those years my i knew my desire was just to be a real christian and i tried to answer i said be real good then i was already born like a baby and oh from there it was kind of a blur and i just remember being pushed through hands pushing me and my head my shoulders and everywhere and it wasn't even that part but it just i came out of there and i tumbled down the stairs and i had clean eggs and i was blubbering and i just hit the floor just face down on the floor and i just began praying to god and just asking him to meet me and just come and fill my life and um and i i i remember specifically i really i want him to deliver me from drinking so bad and i wanted him to help my depression and i remember from that night i got up and there was not another desire from that night when i came up off that floor i'm at home i never ever had desire for another sip and i i went home i remember and went to my closet and pulled out like two hundred dollars worth of liquor and put it in my gym bag with my clothes and told my parents i was going to the gym and then going down the road throwing them out throwing them out the window cleaning out the house and it felt so liberal it wasn't no part of me was sad to do that and that was the part i was amazed about no part of me was sad to get rid of that stuff and um i remember sitting there and you know the lord has a sense of humor i would there i had uh i bought tickets for a metallica concert three days after after the camp was scheduled and before i went to camp i was like i don't want to go to campus i'll bet something will happen and i'll miss that concert and sure enough i gave my heart to the lord and i was like man it was on the wednesday after camp and for and camp ended on a sunday so monday i was just tortured i was like i know i can't go i know i won't enjoy it like i used to but i have to go and i was sitting there and i was going to i went to my friend's office and and i was like talking to him trying to make every excuse i'm like you know it's not even about you know they're just great musicians i just enjoy music and just trying to make every excuse he's like bro he's like you know you would not enjoy that i don't know if i paid like 250 dollars for that ticket and he's like so i just prayed i was like lord i was like i feel like you've delivered me but now i feel like you want me to overcome this delivery of some things i feel like you want me to overcome this and i was just praying and finally i texted the group and i was like i'm not going and i started freaking out and i was like if anyone knows someone that wants my ticket tell them to give whatever i ended up selling it for like 50 bucks and so that was that more sting but i guess i was paying for myself but i remember that it was a wednesday night and uh there was no service that night after the camp and uh it was a wednesday night i remember sitting in my car and just bawling and crying i was so tore up and i was like what am i even doing like what happened this weekend i i was still in a daze that seemed like i said what happened to me this week and i was crying i'm bawling and mad and punching my steering wheel and everything else and then finally i just went home and went to bed and i remember like two hours before i was like i could still make it to seattle you know it was just dumb and i went to bed wednesday night and i prayed that the lord helped me i remember thursday night thursday morning i woke up and i've never ever felt peace like that in my life it was just like it was all behind me and the lord just brought peace into my life and i couldn't believe the feeling i felt like i was literally walking on air it felt like i was just floating above the ground and i just began to praise and worship the lord so that was kind of my testimony to where i got saved and now here we are today and somehow i wound up in kentucky and uh and with a great pastor and great church and great friends and just i was just thinking today about all the lord has given me you know he's going to be wonderful in-laws and great family more than i could all the things i just never thought that i would that would depress me or torment me at night you'll never have this you'll never have that you'll never everything that i thought i could never have the lord just poured into my life tenfold and i just don't thank i'm enough for it for my wife for a home for just a great job everything and i'm just i was just really thankful today to the lord just wanted to share that [Applause] he comes and changes you amen i don't care where you are field car or wherever amen that's awesome praise be to god thank you brother joshua amen all right anybody else want to give a testimony all right my granddaughter wants to give a testimony all right this is going to be good god for two wonderful grandchildren amen praise the lord all right hi it's great to be here tonight um so this happened this was very recent this happened in north carolina the first night the devil started tormenting me with fear we prayed in a group and we kept praying every night and i haven't been tormented by the devil since i want to thank the lord that he has delivered me from fear [Applause] fear's a terrible thing isn't it amen praise the lord [Music] amen amen praise i thank the lord amen this week's kind of been different for me amen um just not been feeling the best that's just not feeling real good and um i had an abscess that didn't bother me i guess for 40 years and here in the last week it has re-festered so to speak and gotten a great big ball and real miserable and um i don't know what the word i used but just real miserable it makes you real miserable and so i went on the fourth of july monday to the now to the quick care i just couldn't stand it anymore you know anyway after trying to realize that's not gonna work anyway uh uh why but anyway so i just just gotta go to the doctor miserable gun up to the clinic and it's closed you know so there you go anyway monday morning not monday morning but tuesday morning woke up didn't sleep hardly all night just real miserable you know every every hour up and waiting for waiting to go to the doctor and laying on the couch there praying lord jesus you're a very present help in time trouble lord jesus and i could really use some help right now lord if you would just come and give me some comfort amen just help me you know because i had all kinds of thoughts of going to the doctor and they're not going to help you because you didn't have no coverage shots and they're going to try to give you covert shots and then you're going to have to go out there and do it as yourself because you ain't got no hospital help you know and so all kinds of thoughts you know and so but don't have really don't have a doctor hardly you know i've had went to the quick care i guess up there in elk and several times when i had that asthma problem back in the day but other than that have had very thankfully very little heaven to have doctors in my life or medicine so i'm thankful for that but i didn't have a doctor to go to but anyway and i just prayed while i was praying there and amen in an office prayer you know it wasn't so long it actually come come open and release pressure amen and so i was very thankful for that and i said thank you jesus amen i know you do come on the scene i know you do care after all those days of of stress and so i haven't had to go yet and so hopefully i won't have to but and then it was just different things different things that that was the first blessing i think it was and there was something else that i had desired and that i wanted and didn't know for sure how i would go about it and i went and and talked to the people about it and it all worked out that i got what i wanted amen so that was blessing number two and i was starting to rack them up and that day on that where's two then it rained i just look there there's a third blessing right there and you know i was just counting my blessings amen and i just realized that god is real good he's real personal and he cares about you on a daily basis amen and so every day i watch for his blessings don't you because i know that when you're following in the path of the lord he watches out for you and he blesses you i know the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the lord amen and when a man is following the lord in the way that he is supposed to whatsoever he doeth shall prosper amen how many believes that so we all know young people that we all know that following the devil and the world and all that it's it's a curse it's damnation and it's death amen the only channel the only direction that you want to go is in the lord jesus christ and if he gives you like brother josh said that desire check that desire that's where it's all at amen preachers can't give it to you revivals can't give it to you you can't give it to yourself god has to put that down there blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled but i just thank the lord for being a personal god who cares about you in every little detail amen amen praise be to god all right anybody else want to give a i like that if anybody has a little testimony like that something that the lord has done for you maybe in the last few days or just something little all right we got brother troy and brother david brother troy come on up if you want and then we'll have good brother david to give a testimony because i believe we ought to have things like that amen different little things that god does for us praise the lord brother troy appreciate you brother amen that was good testimonies that's encouraging to hear those testimonies and uh tommy done texting me and said get some he was basically you know trying to encourage me to get up here it's hard to get up here anytime but uh and i was trying to think back of different things because every all those testimonies are really wonderful testimonies but i thought you know a lot of times especially me i don't thank him for the little things enough just just to have good health a good healthy family a job and most of all salvation and to to get to have a good church family a good church to go to a good pastor and then uh you know where i don't know where i would be without the message of the hour what god did in this age but uh those are all things i'm very very thankful for and then when brother tom was given this his testimony there and then this little thing popped in my head because i'm a little forgetful sometimes but i just thought of this how thomas saying that he helps us in so many things and he does so many times to go along in the day and you know the lord does little blessings for you that you i just have to stop and and thank him for well this was one and it's one of those unexpected ones this was when we were in florida and uh we were in the ocean and i was with zoe and paul there and the waves were coming in and we were having a good time and uh the waves uh i was about wave level and it hit me right in the face and knocked my glasses off and i never realized it uh for just maybe a couple seconds there and zoe and paul said you're glad dad your glasses are gone well i had this experience years ago in canada when i went on a trip there and and i lost my glasses in the lake and i was without glasses for uh well at least a week i think so i started screaming and yelling at my kids there well look for those glasses and so they start to look for him and and i start feeling for him because you can't see nothing it's it's got to be above waist level probably you can't see nothing and then i said i'll get a little uh yelling sometimes at my kids so i said i said i start don't look for him i said feel for him start feeling for him and so i was feeling for him diving down feeling for him and then it wasn't maybe uh maybe two minutes later paul kicked him with his foot and so the lord gave me my glasses back robin had lost her sunglasses maybe the day before and they never came back and then on the on the shore there you could see where a bunch of sunglasses done washed up on the shore from long time ago so it was a little thing but it's throughout the week and month and the different days that god blesses me so much with those little things that just wouldn't i don't believe happened you know without god doing those things for us so it was just extra blessing and and i'm just thankful to be able to to say something good about my lord up here so appreciate it [Applause] amen i believe in seeing god in the little things praise be to god amen anybody got any more little things you want to testify about oh yeah no better david come on all right at all blessings [Applause] i'm videos he says [Laughter] yeah that's right amen [Applause] i mean i do believe that we're blessed with a good church family don't you amen we're brothers we're sisters i like that don't you amen we pray for another i believe that we need to pray for one another care for each other amen praise be to god thank you brother david i appreciate that amen david's been a real blessing here he really has i'm very glad to see him prosper him amen spiritually and everything amen and see sisters janet doing better sure is make sure she's glad that she's doing much better pray that she'll just keep on doing more amen so god bless you anyone else yes it's your hope now you don't have a voice like david someone bring the mic okay we want to hear it mine's just real simple but i wanted to thank the lord for um lining me up a job uh this past week i went to arizona and i went to a couple shops and the lady wanted to hire me on the spot so hopefully everything will be lined up for me to start work when i move like the week after so i was just really thankful for that it was a weight off my mind and just wanted to praise the lord and also a litter of my puppies was attacked by another female and none of them were killed but some of them were hurt so i would like to ask for prayer that all them would be fully recovered that always tears you up don't and i'll tell you what dog gets hurt he tears you up here well actually i'm helping zoe with a little testimony uh i'll let her read we have the quote uh screenshot here it's just real short but i had a little situation in the middle of the night where you know listening to a message and you have something on your heart and like the lord will just have brother brandon say it like so directly to you that you know it was for you and so we had a little situation with her when a couple weeks ago she had woke she kind of started getting a little sick and then she woke up in the morning before everyone i was already awake and she just felt so terrible i could tell in her face she did not feel good so she sat down beside me and laid her head down on me and covered up with a blanket and i was already listening to a message and brother brandon started praying and then she was going to read you the little part that he prayed and she looked at me and said mom brother ram just prayed for me you want to read it i see two little afflicted children sitting here tonight little boy and a little girl sitting in wheelchairs another little girl laying across her mother's lap with a blanket over and she said that was for her and you know i don't know why the lord sent that to her just to encourage her but we were so thankful so amen hearing that at that time that's enough to get your faith to jump up and reach out that way he really does amen praise the lord amen anybody held any anybody else have any little experiences they'd like to share amen all right sister bae so the other day i was praying and i always have felt sort of envious towards adam and eve because they had every evening in the cool of the evening god would come and talk to them personally and i thought you know that they had something we don't have they lived in a perfect place everything was so wonderful and they fellowship with god every evening and then it came to me that the fellowship we have with god is a lot better than what they had because he's our savior he's our healer he encourages us he lifts us out of depression i just got so happy i started acting really crazy [Applause] amen that's quite that's a good revelation right there i mean adam and eve never were lost never were redeemed never were delivered they didn't know any of those things so you're right amen the lord was telling you hey amen praise the lord that's good amen praise the lord i like that anyone else all right okay first of all my husband said i'll kill him i'll kill him with prayer kill him i'm very thankful that i had parents that were christians i can still remember the time and i every time i wake up in the morning my mother would be sitting there with the bible reading the bible and my dad would be the same way every evening because he worked all day so when he came home they we table which a lot of people don't do that anymore we'd sit at the table and we pray and we talk about our day what was going on and sometimes thank god for the things that we've done and that has happened to us um i stayed in in the church for many many years i stay i am christian i believed in god but um and i stayed that way until i was about 45 years old and for some reason i decided that i wanted to do other things i walked away from god i did not do the things i should do i didn't pray anymore i didn't read the bible anymore i've read the bible twice through i read it i didn't study it and that's what i found it was a difference in that and i have rededicated my life to the lord and i am so thankful that we have found this message church that actually preaches what god tells us to that we need to do sometimes i think brother brad and brother byler have uh cameras in my house because a lot of times they they preach on things that i really need to hear and then people are afraid that and i've i've i've heard people say well i don't want to go to church because they're telling me things that i don't want to hear well that's what we need to hear is the thing so that god can tell us what we need to change in our life so we can become better christians and be the bride that he wants us to be so i'm thankful for my parents giving me that opportunity to know either while i was away from the lord god still had it hitting in my heart and i knew something was there and i kept saying i need to go back to church i need to go back to church i need to go back to church and i found all kinds of reasons not to and i'm so thankful that there was a couple who was willing to invite us to this message church and i am so thankful and thank all of you for being friends to me and i praise god every day for his mercy thank you sister sheriff amen praise the lord amen amen god bless you we sure love our each and every one of you very much look forward to spending eternity with you amen and completing this journey how many knows we've got a journey to complete amen we've got to keep our guards up and stay on our knees stay sharp so to speak the devil is as a roaring lying devouring everyone he can amen so keep feeding amen the holy spirit word of god amen amen anyone else before i go back up anyone else has something burning on their heart they'd like to share about the lord amen brother brad just uh just real quick um you know i just want to say thank everyone for their testimonies i've been trying to think this week what what testimony i would give and nothing really is just really so much burning on my heart to give anything but i just want to say thankful for one thing i could say is god's patience and long-suffering because without god's patience and long suffering just listening to the testimonies tonight where would any of us be um you know we're i'm so thankful for the message of the hour but when you listen to the testimonies tonight it's about god's saving grace and no matter which rock you crawled out from under which gutter you dug yourself out of or god pulled you out of it was god's grace and we all like you said we all have a story and you know if if the bible were still being written and in pen and and paper today our names would be there and they would say this is the life of thomas this is a life of brad this is the life of john this is the life of you know and it would just keep going and and but thankful for for the little things that god does one of the little things just a quick testimony you're talking about little things god does you know we raise flowers and everybody knows there's a major drought i would say going around and we put lots of gallons of water on our flowers and keep them going and that's great but there's just something about when when the rain falls on them they do so much better and you know we were been praying for rain and praying for rain and i was down there watering one afternoon and all of a sudden just out of nowhere the cloud comes over and it just rains on our place and i see the sun the band of sun all the way around the outside of our property and it's raining just on our place and uh you know and then i called my dad and i said hey it's raining out here and he said that's what i prayed for this morning and i said well praise the lord we he answered our prayers you know he answered your prayers so uh just the little things that god does you know i don't ever want to take those little things for granted and i'm just thankful for all that he does in each of our lives and uh just i love the patience uh to be able to watch people grow i think many times as as christians especially if you've been uh you know in you know in the messenger and your your christian walk is maybe a little bit further down the road than others we're quick to judge and quick to point but it's patience and that's god's patience it's got us all where we're at no matter what walk we're in so thankful for god's patience thank you brother brad amen yeah he did cut us off a long time ago right maybe first time we backed it that's it or second or third but god is long suffering and god's people should be too amen praise the lord anyone else anyone else have a testimony they want to give before i turn it back over to the song leader she did i didn't even see it she really did right i got a check watch um so on sunday we had our granddaughter so on sunday we had our granddaughter and i was trying to listen to the church so hard i was trying to listen to but she was just all over and this sharp pain just started hurting so much in my back and you were praying at the end and we took communion and that pain just left me and i told them so i did give praise to god earlier but yeah i just feel like i should say it even i do not like talking in church i just praise god for killing me amen i'll tell you what every time the lord does something like that i always like to look up at the skies and say lord i know that was you thank you thank you jesus i know that's you you know amen isn't it wonderful to live like that and just to know that god walks with you on a daily basis amen no matter what your circumstances or how little your desire is it doesn't matter he dares he cares about the fall of a sparrow the number he kills counts the number of your hair amen your daily food everything about your daily life he cares about amen and we appreciate jesus tonight for fellowshipping with us and walking with us let's
