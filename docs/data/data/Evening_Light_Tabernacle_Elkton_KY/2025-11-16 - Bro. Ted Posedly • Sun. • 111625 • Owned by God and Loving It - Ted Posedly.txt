Amen. &gt;&gt; I appreciate that. And so I'm happy to be here with my dear friend, Brother Thomas and Sister Donna, and the and the family, Brother Caleb. And I'm the blessed one, the first one to ever sleep in that new house over there. I'm telling you, I've been sleeping good there. I may just hang around I may just I may just claim it, but you know, if you got brothers and sisters everywhere you go, I've been in a lot of places where they just give me their house or something, stay in there, and you know, it's given only for a temporary time. You know, you can't stay there forever. So, anyway, but it's going home time, people. Amen. This bride has to make herself ready. And we know that's just by accepting what he wants to do in us &gt;&gt; because we can't do it oursself. &gt;&gt; That's why he he didn't leave us alone. Amen. &gt;&gt; And thank God he doesn't leave us alone. Right. &gt;&gt; I'm glad he bothers me when I'm when I'm not where I should be. Aren't you? &gt;&gt; Amen, saints. Well, I won't hold you standing too long. And uh but I just like to greet you from our church back home and brother George our acting pastor and sister Brandy. And I think we needed Southern in our church. And God sent brother George. We were praying three full years that God would send us a a younger pastor and that the old the old man could kind of, you know, be put out to pasture. And so I'm not pastor now, I'm pasturing. And uh but since then, I've been able to travel a little and I'm glad I'm here. And uh I've got a little rusty in preaching, but you'll never lose your calling. &gt;&gt; Gifts and callings are without repentance. So, it's good to see you all and I won't hold you any longer, but brother George did want me to tell you hello and uh pray for them. I think he's we've got brother Ben Puit preaching over there for us today. So, uh, and sister MNA sends her love to all you sisters and and, uh, even Joel said, "Tell those people hi from me." You wouldn't know him now, of course. 44 years old, the little guy. Well, I tell you what, and he he's uh you know, he that teenage thing, you know, when kids get teenage and they know everything, &gt;&gt; they're supposed to go away after a few years, but sometimes it endures longer, you know, and so uh but anyway, he's the son of God, but I know it and my wife knows it, but he hasn't caught that yet, but it'll catch on. You know, you can't force things to happen. &gt;&gt; And that's what's been tried with him and different ones tried it and stuff. And you know, when you see it done wrong, all you can do to correct that is just do the right thing. Don't tell anybody, you know, where they hurt somebody or something. That's between them and God. But there's been a lot of hurts in in this in this family of God and people have been hurt. And I want to thank God for some of you all who just recently God brought you through a lot of trauma and sorrow that you've gone through and and you've uh got your got your uh directions right now and got your eyes set upon the cross and upon the Lord Jesus Christ. So you know it's never too late to start. Amen. Long as we're in this earth. The last one hasn't come in yet and the door's not closed. Amen. So we want to thank God for that. Aren't you grateful? Amen. So, let's open in um uh the scripture I want to read here and I'm going to tell you why I'm preaching this today. I did want to say to you singers, my goodness. Uh if if you do have a traveling ministry, uh come out west. Uh didn't brother Bannam hear a voice similar to that one time, go out west. And I'm saying come out west. So uh but you know if you don't well we can we can travel like a almost like a thought by on the internet. So if you you stream your services here brother Thomas. So we're going to we're going to plug in hear those again. Those were beautiful. Really good singing. Amen. Well, I'm waiting for my antique tablet here to come up here. And um I want to read Revelations chapter 8 verse one. And you know uh I preach the message. I preach the message of the hour. And know brother Thomas preaches the message of the hour. I'm not ashamed of it. I believe this is God's program today. And uh so you know I'm going to read Revelations 8:1 because I mean what better scripture uh is the message of the hour. Uh and I want you to see it here. So let's look at it in Revelation chapter 8 uh verse one. You know like people will say well what is the message? Well you know what is brother Bram's message it's you could say Hebrews 138. You could say so many things. You know, it' be late in the evening time. And by the way, didn't you all used to have a a church sign up on the a highway out there? &gt;&gt; Oh, it got blown away. Well, good thing I did. Glad the the denominations didn't chop it down or something. You know, you got to be careful. You know, it could it could have been some other message church, too. It could have chopped it down. Tell me, &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, it it it's sickening whether it's out there or whether it's in here. Amen. That denominational spirit, brother. God has a bride and there's not one going to be missing. And there's not one extra going to be there. Amen. And we can't put him in. We can't take them out. And we might as well start loving each other. Amen. Cuz there might be people that differ from us. Amen. But God loves us anyway. God loved you when you were real different. &gt;&gt; You differed with him a whole lot. Aren't you glad? &gt;&gt; Let's give the Lord a big hand for that. Now it's time to preach. But we got to read the scripture. Revelations chapter 8 and verse one. And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of a half hour. Let's bow our heads. Heavenly Father, humbly bow before you. We want to thank you for your love, your mercy, your grace, your kindness to us. And we know that God is always hidden and revealed in simplicity. And oh Lord, how we have complicated this verse of scripture. And I just ask that you help us to come a little more simple today and help us to understand this is the whole plan of redemption being fulfilled in our a hour. And I'm just asking you, Lord God, that you would speak to every heart and touch someone today who really needs it deep down inside going through some hard dark times and uh help them Lord and we commit everyone to you, Father, for the and in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray. Amen. You may take your seat. God bless you. Good to be part of you, one of you. on this is my home church today and uh since I've been here really &gt;&gt; and I respect your pastor and I told him today I'm sitting in the house you know and he he sends me a text you can come over to the house and have coffee with us and uh cuz because my my new house brother Caleb's new house thank you brother Caleb uh thank you uh also brother Micah for that and sister uh Grace for that supper the other night and uh so I'm going have to preach short because they changed my flight. I got to be out of here like 2:00. So, uh, you know, I was kind of I wasn't planning to preach until 2:00. You You get that? Do you believe that? So, you never plan it, but but if you all get to pulling, you never know what's going to happen, right? Uh, it's good to have the to know that the Holy Spirit's here. We can we can sense him, you know, with that deep awesome sense from the heart. But sometimes you can just literally feel him in you. And so we it feels good. We're going to feel good one day all the time. Huh, brother John? &gt;&gt; All the time in that presence is the fullness of joy. Amen. So, uh, we appreciate the goodness of the Lord for that. So, we uh won't hold you too long, but I want to get right to this thought. It's uh I'll I'll tell you what the I'll tell you what my my uh title is and then I'll tell you how this came to me. I like this because every time I say it that something happens to me. It It's owned by God and loving it. That's my title. &gt;&gt; Now, you never heard me preach this before because I never preached it here before. Uh but if you did hear me preach it before, then you must have your theophony must have been over there listening at me. Uh but I preached it only twice and I just this every time I get into this, something good happens to me. So I uh well something's good has already happened even before this morning over here this time. But I won't tell you those stories. Those are some hunting stories. But I wasn't even hunting on one of them. It was just standing there. And there and that my meat my meat buck, which doesn't have no antlers, stepped out there and said, "I want to go home with you there." So I got her waiting to go in my suitcase right now. That isn't honey. But I feel like I done a little something anyway, you know. But that's a gift, friends. That's a gift. Everything that we have is a gift from God to us. &gt;&gt; We didn't deserve any of it. It's all grace. Amen. &gt;&gt; But owned by God and loving it. So here I was one day I was over in Africa few couple years ago. And I was so sick and I had to preach about five meetings and I've come to the end of a couple weeks and I had some more sermons to preach and you know preachers get sick and they just don't want to go to church sometimes. And I uh well, no, I didn't get any amens for any of y'all, but see, I haven't got quite like you yet. So, uh but uh we're just human being, you know. Brother Brandham even had those times. You know, Elijah, all the prophets had those times where they just didn't want to get up and go, you know. So, somebody came and they knocked at my door at the little hotel I was staying in and said, "Brother Ted, Brother Ted, Brother Ted, Brother Ted." And I slowly got up and I went to the door and he says, "Uh, how you doing today?" And I was going to say, "You know, what would you say?" Uh, very well, but uh this and this and this or whatever else was taking me over at the time. uh feeling sorry for myself, feeling like I was homesick, you know, burning up with homesickness and wanted to go home and um uh in a strange land and just the different feelings you get. But &gt;&gt; but sometimes, you know, you speak your own deliverance out of your own mouth. And he said, "How you how you doing, brother Ted?" He was expecting something great. I says, "I AM OWNED BY GOD AND I'M LOVING IT. And he he jumped back. He said, "I am too." And there in the hallway, I go I went out the door and in the hallway we were dancing AROUND SAYING, "WE OWNED BY GOD AND LOVING IT." And up up and down the corridor, the hotel doors were open and people were poking out like this. What? &gt;&gt; And I immediately whatever was going on in my body was gone. And I was I was back I was I was back on top and uh so I want to talk about that, you know, being owned by God and loving it, &gt;&gt; you know, and it it it it goes against a lot of people's mentality because they don't want to be owned by anything or anybody. &gt;&gt; Uh but you married people know that that changes, right? &gt;&gt; Uh you own each other. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why you make those vows, you know, for better or worse, good times, bad times, &gt;&gt; sickness and in health, you own it. Amen. So, we get a little we get a little more you when you get married and have children, the same thing. It it it be it becomes that you learn a little bit little bit more about ownership. And then when you get your house, you know, and you get things paid for and stuff and you own a a car. I don't know anybody uh around here can afford one of them new Chevy trucks, but I guess everybody would like to own one. But most people, they just don't own it, but the bank owns it. So they they're sharing ownership. And then I watched another brother. He's coming driving this nice car. And I said, "Brother, did you own that?" He said, "Yeah, yeah, I'm leasing it." I said, "Well, so it's yours." He said, "Yeah, but I can only put so many miles. I can only do this and that and that and that." Oh, too many restrictions. I said, I like that ownership where it's just, you know, uh no qualifications, you know, other than that, he can he can do whatever you want with it. Amen. &gt;&gt; And like people people today, you know, they treat their life like they own it. But if you own it, you you'd you'd be a little bit more mindful of what you do with it, wouldn't you? &gt;&gt; You know, it's like people that rent all their life. They they trash up the place. It doesn't matter cuz somebody else owns it. You But if you own it yourself, there's a lot of difference, right, Brother Joe? You you own your own place. This this is a this is a real commitment. Amen. To maintenance and taking care of it and worrying over it. And you know, we could be out of our house in five minutes if we if we didn't uh pay our taxes. Uh it take a little longer than 5 minutes, but I mean the works would start pretty soon. &gt;&gt; And after a while, you'd find out the new owners are at the door knocking on the door cuz it went up for auction. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, you know, there's things that go with ownership. There's of course the pride of ownership and there's the there's the the the good feeling of God blessed me with something, but on the other hand, there's a great responsibility that goes with it. Isn't it true? But you know he's talking about the message is the message is that we belong to God. &gt;&gt; And how dare anyone or anything or any feeling OR ANY EMOTION OR ANY LIE OF the devil stand between me and my owner. But you know uh with people today they don't want to be oh no no no we and that's why there's you know crowning there we don't want no kings around our country so we can't have a dictator in the white house and what have they what they have the last eight four years uh they're being told what to do now up in New York City they want socialism and I've been in communist countries I've been in communist Russia Bellarus her brother and sister been in in those places where they Everybody gets equal. EVERYBODY GETS what they need. Yeah. But their idea of what you need and your idea of what you need ain't the same. &gt;&gt; They keep you on a much lower level than where they live guaranteed. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And a lot of times preachers want to keep the people down below them. They they got the higher revelation. Don't you challenge me, &gt;&gt; brother. I like a preacher that likes to be challenged. I like a preacher that likes to have people ask him questions. &gt;&gt; Is this all right? &gt;&gt; I don't want Don't pull me too hard. I'll get off my subject. I actually got another sermon to preach too today. So, I'm probably going to work it in because uh Sister Donna, she inspired me last night. Was it last night when we had supper? It was Friday night. and uh over there at Micah's and uh Sister Grace and and it was good and everything. Sister Donna, we hadn't seen her, you know, for three years and we hadn't seen Brother Thomas. Oh, and by the way, brother, you your pastor gave me a compliment. I'm trying to remember exactly how he said it. Was it you look the same as you did three years ago? &gt;&gt; Was that what he said exactly? And I don't know why my ears were hearing uh you're not much different than you were three years ago, but that it's that difference that I'm thinking about. But you know, when a when a when when an older fella tells me that, which is a youngster, uh I you always tell him, "It's your eyes, brother. It's your eyes because the reality is we do change. &gt;&gt; Amen. But uh I told brother David I said I I hit my peak and I'm turning back and going younger now. Hallelujah. Well, you know, one of these days that's going to happen like that. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we're so we're in the message of the hour, which is the coming of the Lord. This message is the coming of the Lord. So, we're looking for the bodily coming. Of course, we know that there's a physical body that's sitting upon the throne. We're paid the price for us and we will see him and we will be able like uh Thomas, you know, to put the our hand in there and that's why he said, "Lord, uh you gave your blood and your life for us. Amen. You redeemed us. Amen. But when we get to Revelations the 8th uh chapter and the opening of the seventh seal, uh I'm not going to make this complicated or deep. Now uh I I could and that's been a problem because we make it so complicated, but the simplicity of it is it's all about him taking what he owns &gt;&gt; back to himself. And that's redemption. The whole Bible is about redemption. It's all everything all the types and shadows and everything in the Old Testament and everything the priest did and everything the Jews did and everything that Christ did on Calvary and everything that the seven church age messengers did and everything that our prophet did. Amen. And everything the preachers are doing today is all about redeeming. Now redemption means you can't buy something. You can't redeem something that you do not own. You cannot redeem something that you do not own. You must own it and then you can redeem it. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So that's the hard thing to convince people that God owns them. Because a lot of times people today, ah American people now, you don't own me. I can get out of here anytime I want. I can do anything I want. Amen. They think they own you. They think they own the road. I've got people Oh my God. By the grace of God, we've survived. We are if you're alive today, say I'm alive today. &gt;&gt; And you're only alive today because somebody thought they owned the road and God came on the scene and and kept them from knock knocking you right in the head with their car and killing you because it's just every day. Every day coming up from Nashville the other day. You know, this is not the same place it used to be. People, &gt;&gt; I'm driving out of Nashville. Lord, praise the Lord. I'm I'm uh uh uh I'm 12:00 heading or 11:30 or 12:00 heading out of Nashville. Said I'm going to be up on the farm. I'm going to say hello and thing by 1 1:30 like that. and I'm going to get down in those woods &gt;&gt; and I'm going to hunt. And uh next thing you know, look up ahead and there's a 20 mile uh slow down on I24 un knowing it that people two two people three different groups of two vehicles six of six vehicles thought they owned that spot and the other one thought they owned that spot and there was a fatality. It was horrible. I hope you don't know anybody that was in those fatalities, but uh I drove over the spot coming up and it I don't know. It just makes you think, wow, right here today some soul um &gt;&gt; went to meet their maker. &gt;&gt; And that's a serious thing cuz if they weren't ready, &gt;&gt; they're in trouble. &gt;&gt; The trouble only begins That's right. &gt;&gt; Not going to get out of trouble just by dying. &gt;&gt; But if we die in Christ, we have to do that right now. &gt;&gt; Then we are alive. Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. I laid my foundations on that and I want to I want to move forward here about this ownership. And I'm going to read this in souls souls in prison if you don't mind. The seventh seal, brother Bam said this is in seventh in the souls in prison. Um the seventh seal brings him back to earth. So you know we have a lot of preaching. Well he's all he's here kind of there is no physical coming. He's here kind of invisible you know living in us all the things and we preach it too. But you got to you got to you got to stop and think that being owned by him, he can do something different than what we think. &gt;&gt; He's the owner. &gt;&gt; He has the right. He's entitled. I'm not entitled to question him. I'm obligated to submit to him &gt;&gt; if he owns me. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Sad, I don't want that kind of life. It's too straight. It's Yeah. But you know what? He owns you. And even if you rebel, he owns that, too. &gt;&gt; He owns you while you're rebelling. How many ever rebelled on the Lord for Okay, let's say God bless you. Let's say let's say for a day or two. &gt;&gt; Well, okay. Let's say for two weeks, &gt;&gt; you rebelled on God. How about two years? Any hands? Oh my God, I'm among friends. Thank the Lord. Amen. There's hope for me. Amen. You know, when you rebel on something, it might be just some little thing. It just shows that you don't want to be owned, but yet he's your owner anyway. &gt;&gt; And he owned us even when we didn't want to. He owned our negative influ ideas. He he owned our rebellion. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; He if I get started there, I won't finish what I want to say. So, uh, let me get the get the preliminaries and then we'll Amen. And, uh, we appreciate the Lord. So, Brother Bam said here, I'm reading the quote now. So he said the lamb come and took the book out of the right hand of him. Now do we believe that happened with brother Bam and the opening of the seventh seal happened in that in that little room there. And brother B said when this end time seal opens it'll be a total secret to the entire world. So you he's looking for something you know but something happened. He took ownership of your life again. Amen. I believe that. &gt;&gt; So it it was fast forward years from 1963 for me it was it was 197 uh4 when that what happened in 1963 or in that ministry? What happened during that time with the seventh seal brought him down to earth? He he took the book and he opened it up. Amen. He he passed it on to the prophet. Do you agree with me on that? He he took the book and opened it and he handed it to his seventh angel on the earth. And the seventh angel declared unto us. &gt;&gt; You are owned by God and you better be loving it. &gt;&gt; Don't try to fight it because you you're owned by God. You you just you you just get deeper and deeper into it, don't you? &gt;&gt; Some of you are shaking. I know you've been there. I've been there, too. And we're we're uh we're we're hard-headed and sometimes hard-hearted. But God owns that, too. &gt;&gt; He knows everything about us. He knows my downsitting, mopperizing. He knows, you know, when I go to bed, when I get up. He knows my habits. He knows everything about me. And he owns it all. &gt;&gt; That's what I want to talk about today. The owner has come back. And I am owned by God. And I am loving every minute of it. Amen. &gt;&gt; But you know, you meet people and you try to tell them, "Oh, that's too strict to life. I wouldn't want go God or nobody. Nobody's going to tell me what to do." Well, somebody is already whether you know it or not. &gt;&gt; And it could be it could be the devil. &gt;&gt; It could be the devil. And a lot of times people, you know, they're the devil lets them get by with stuff and do stuff that makes them feel good and this and they get them addicted on that one. They get addicted on that one. They get addicted on that one. The next thing THEY'RE PULLING A GUN AND shooting themselves. It's because they don't want to be owned by anybody. I WANT TO BE OWNED BY GOD AND I WANT TO LOVE every minute of it while I'm in this earth and for eternity. I'll never lose my dignity for him. I'll never lose my respect for him. I love him in every decision he ever made. &gt;&gt; But I haven't always been that way. But he owned me when I didn't think this way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I still am not fully submissive, but I want to be. And God looks at our heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So I have a sister, sister. When sister Donna said it's already done with about her healing, I got a sermon on that. I won't preach that today, but I'll I'll preach it tonight in my dreams. It's already done. &gt;&gt; When God said something, it's done right there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You might not see it happening, but it's done already. It's already been done. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many can say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. Just like sitting at the breakfast table at the last yesterday and brother John who's the connoisseur of biscuits. &gt;&gt; He's the one that says when those biscuits are done. It used to be your mama cuz she'd be up and around. Now she's sitting a little bit more. But uh go check those biscuits. See if they're done. And I was thinking they better be. I'm starving. That was just I didn't go there just to eat. I wanted to see you all. The eating was extra &gt;&gt; perks. But the then it was great. But just watching that, I thought, there it is. When he said they weren't done, they weren't done. And when he said they were done, I'm good with that. Let's go. But it's it's when he says, not when you think. It's how he said it, &gt;&gt; not how you imagine. &gt;&gt; And I'm I'm here to tell you, I've done a lot of imagination on promises, tried to tried to tweak them and make them work for me in the way I thought was the best way. &gt;&gt; But the owner said no. You know, Brother Benham said, if you how do you know you really love God, right? He said when he you pray and ask him for something. I'm just paraphrasing but I was finding you the quote. &gt;&gt; But he says when you ask him for something and he says no and he says you he says his nos are as good as his yeses. He said be that shows that you really love him in the right way. Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz you know that if he if he holds something back from you, he's got a reason for that. He wants to wants to get you ready to appreciate what he wants to do for you. Can you say amen? Amen. &gt;&gt; So you're either being blessed or you're being prepared for a blessing. Amen. &gt;&gt; IT'S HAPPENING ALREADY. AMEN. You're e the healing is already done. Amen. And so we thank the Lord for that. So rapturing faith was laying in the messages. Brother Ben said absolute. He said she's laying in the messages. That that faith for the rapture is laying in the messages. You know, now there's there's a little thing moving and I want to hit this right off right off the bat because I got to get it off my chest. that preachers are raising up today the five-fold ministries taking the prophet's place and they say we don't need to uh hear tapes in church and we don't need to do that because you can't pull on a tape and I've heard them say that time and again you can't pull on a tape you you can't pull on a tape you got to have a live ministry rather I got a live ministry of my owner inside of my soul what can get better than that my owner lives inside OF MY SOUL ALIVE IN ME JESUS ISN'T DEAD. He's alive in me. &gt;&gt; I am the bride's revival. &gt;&gt; You are the bride's revival. &gt;&gt; If he if he's alive, even if he owns you, he's going to do with you what he wants to do. &gt;&gt; And and you know, I've got quotes to read, but it might take too long. &gt;&gt; Read it. Okay, I'll get to it in a minute, but we want to we want to read continue this quote here in in Souls in Prison. The seventh seal brings him back to earth. The lamb come and took the book. How many knows what's in that book? You &gt;&gt; as an attribute of God are in that book. That book was God's thoughts put on paper and you are God's thoughts. How many believe that you are the thoughts of God? That's why you have eternal life because you didn't have a beginning and you can't have an end, but you were once a thought in God's mind and now you're here in flesh and you're still owned by God and he's not going to abandon us. Amen. &gt;&gt; How many have proved that to be true in your life? &gt;&gt; How many have a testimony of that? &gt;&gt; I was thinking what a testimony it is and I was reading what brother Brandon said. A testimony is God living in you, living out his life and not yours. Amen. How many got one of those? Amen. Blessed be the name of the Lord. But see, if you're owned by God, you're happy. You You're loving every minute of it. If you're really own like people say, "Oh, I you know," but what's the problem is a lot of people that maybe are a little bit more careful about how they live and walk and talk and everything because they don't want to offend the Lord and stuff, but they wear these big deep long frowns on their face all the time. I mean, a lot of people would like to see if you're really loving it. Let me see that you're loving it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't look Don't look so miserable all the time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Chad, I don't have any of those days like that where I'm looking miserable." Oh, yeah. God knows you do. And I know you do because I'm one of you all. &gt;&gt; And the best of us amongst us has those bad days. Brother Random had bad days. Do you know that Jesus had more bad days than good days? In fact, his whole life ministry was living for others. And that's eternal life. He wasn't trying to get something out of it. &gt;&gt; He never he never got a dime for his wages. Never had a house. Never place to lay his head. But he was he was buying you. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; He come down here to purchase you. &gt;&gt; He was getting that title clear. Amen. Because where you had t your title was all messed up. Anybody here had title fraud on anything equipment or a home or something farm, man. It's real. It's happening all over the place. And uh so you got to keep keep kind of keep your eyes on that title being clear. And that's the whole message, the clearing of the abstract title deed to the bride of Christ. &gt;&gt; If you're owned by him, what do you own him? You own him and everything that he is and all that he DID FOR YOU, YOU OWN IT. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; It's like a wife and a husband. But that wife, she can't boss her husband around, but she owns him anyway. She knows how to get to him. And there you say, "Brother Ted, now are you telling secrets on Sister M?" No. No. I'm just kind of I you know, I go around kind of watching how people get along. And I I'm saying All right. Yeah. Who's the big boss here? You're both owners. You're co-owners of each other. Amen. And children, we don't own them. God owns them. &gt;&gt; God owns the cattle on a thousand hills. He's the owner of everything. Can you say amen? And so I just want to I want to drive that home. And then I want to read in the breach where brother Bam said Ephesians 4:30 and he said, "Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby you are sealed until the day of your redemption." Hold that word redemption. Brother Bannon said, "See, until the day that the book of redemption has been revealed." What day is that? That's this message. That's this day. &gt;&gt; Amen. When that book was open, that seventh seal was open. and that mysteries of God are opened up to the bride and the and the mysteries are not deep theology. It's life coming out. It's opened up and life comes out. Amen. The book opens up and you come out. The the message I was telling somebody the other day and this brother I never met him before in my life. He was from down around Dyresburg, Tennessee where brother George comes from and this brother Texas is his name. and and I was talking to him and he said he said, 'Boy, since I heard brother Bham preach, he said, "It's like the Bible is a whole new book to me." That's exactly what Brother Bham said, "It's a whole new book to me, too." Amen. And he said, because he said he's opened up the mystery, he said he's he's like he's preaching things that I always knew that I knew, but I didn't know them. And when he puts it into word form, Amen. That's why that God the thought had to become a word. He had to put himself in a form where he could speak to that seed that's inside of you. Amen. Because why? Because that seed only recognizes word. &gt;&gt; The seed is the word. It's the word seed. How many say amen? Inside of you. It won't recognize any other headship but the word, the pure word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why when somebody's, you know, watering it down or changing it, adding to, taking away, you catch that. &gt;&gt; You can't eat that. Amen. Amen. Because your owner won't let you. Aren't you glad? &gt;&gt; Your owner knows where you're supposed to feed. Aren't you glad? How many believe this is your home church and this is where God sent you? You the owner sent you. It was just wasn't your church. Oh, yeah, it was. I like those people. I got friends there and everything. And I got a girl that I got my eyes on over there. Or I got, you know, whatever. Found my wife here. I know this is my church. Amen. Or Brother Thomas is just such a fun guy. YOU JUST GOT TO LOVE HIM. Just he's just funny. He's uh I I guess you are sometimes happy. He's energetic. So you want to feed on him. You can't feed on brother Thomas. You can't feed on somebody else's revival. I mean you you can but brother SAID YOU ARE NOT FEEDING on a man. &gt;&gt; WE ARE NOT FEEDING ON A MAN. And you know he was preaching to his own church there knowing once the untimely said you're not feeding on a man. But they were. THEY WERE FEEDING ON THE MAN. THEN GOD TOOK THE MAN AWAY. Then they had to look into the message. Now, we got to see that what we're feeding on is THE OPEN UP THE BOOK and the owner had came back already to take ownership. Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't want to be free. &gt;&gt; I want to be owned. I want to be told. People say, "No, I don't want to be told." You know, but if that still small voice is talking to you, you better listen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I want that still small voice. Don't you? &gt;&gt; I want to be told. &gt;&gt; And but people today, they they're rebellious. I'm going to be told by anybody, but then you you make yourself some Tik Tok hero or some internet influencer and you do everything they say. It's amazing how people could listen like up in New York City, how the people could listen to communism. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; How could they listen to communism and if you just knew your history or if you've ever been behind the iron curtain, found out how people were living. It is not like he's portraying it. &gt;&gt; IT'S IT'S A OWNERSHIP OF THE RICH, the powerful. And if you don't like it, they'll eliminate you. Brother, I don't want to I don't want to live like that. &gt;&gt; I want freedom to be owned by God and loving every minute of it. &gt;&gt; I have my freedom. &gt;&gt; I'm Every time I say it, I start feeling good again. I'm owned by God and I'm loving it. No matter what's happening to me today, I'm owned by God and I'm loving it because the owner came back to get me. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Are you going to forget the title of this sermon? I might say it 50 more times just to make sure if I have enough time. So, Brother Bam says here, okay, whereby you are sealed until the day of your redemption. I don't want to make anybody embarrassed, but if you have the Holy Ghost and you'd like to raise your hand and say, "I know I got the Holy Ghost." I'd like to see that, too. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; Well, there's something about it. It just it uh you can't really put it into words how you know it, but you just know that you know. &gt;&gt; And so uh brother Bam said, "Hold that word now, redemption." And then he explains what that word day of redemption is in uh the breach. He said, "Until the day that the book of redemption has been revealed and the redeemer came to claim his possession, nothing can take that possession until that time. &gt;&gt; So nothing could nothing could hold you like he can hold you." Because when he comes and takes possession, he's the owner. After all, the owner's here. Everybody has to bow to the owner. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Now, they might want to brand you as insane, but that's okay. I'm owned by God. That's what That's what I believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because I think they're insane because they don't want to take direction from the most lovely person they could ever meet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The most beautiful, lovely, caring, holy, precious compassionate &gt;&gt; owner you ever had. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Absolutely. So then he says, "Don't grieve the Holy Spirit. Don't do things or he says say and do things that pleases God for the book is now sealed and you are sealed with the book. So what happened? He opened it up declared that the owner is here and then seals it back inside of you my brother INSIDE OF YOU MY SISTER. HE SEALS HIMSELF INSIDE of there. And everywhere YOU GO, HE'S THERE GOING THERE WITH YOU. WHATEVER YOU'RE GOING THROUGH, HE'S GOING THROUGH that with you. Not only in Jesus, but Jesus in you. He is going through it with you. He owns you. He bought you. Whatever maintenance is needed, he's responsible. Take care of it. Can you say amen? Amen. &gt;&gt; Wherever you go, even if it's not exactly to the right place he wants you to go, he's in there guiding, steering. He'll cut you off here. He'll cut you off there. He'll get you where he wants you to be. Guaranteed. Because he's never going to lose you. You might lose the feeling, but he he's not going to lose you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You might be hitting the head so many times with stuff going on in your life that you can't even think straight. But he's still he's still good to communicate with you. &gt;&gt; He'll get through with you. Other people wouldn't have the time a day for you because you're just out way out there somewhere. But he cares. Amen. &gt;&gt; And because he owns you. He can't get rid of you. You're his. &gt;&gt; Now, see, it's hard for us to comprehend because there's a lot of stuff we've owned in our life that we wish we didn't ever own and we wanted to get rid of it. But you're owned by God and he's loving every minute of it. &gt;&gt; And you're owned by God and you're loving every minute of it. &gt;&gt; And there we get to the very theme of Brother Bam's message. Love. Redeeming love. The love OF GOD. GREATER FAR than tongue or pan could ever tell. Some of these beautiful singers who could sing it every Sunday morning for 40 more years, you could never begin TO SAY. HOW DEEP IS that love of God? It's all a love story. &gt;&gt; And so the believer, we understand when you when you love the Lord Jesus Christ and you believe his Bible, his word, the message is a love letter to you, you can look through the lines and you can see that love coming through there. Amen. You can see that what he really means in there. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; And that's why I think ministers sometime are trying to get delve into those realms between the lines and they forget we got to preach exactly what the line said because he didn't make a mistake. He said it just the way it's supposed to be said. So I really I really rejoiced at that thought that the brother text said from Dyresburg. He said, he said, uh, yeah. He said, when I hear brother Brandham, he said SOMETHING IN MY SOUL JUMPS OUT. HE SAID, I've known the Bible all my life as a Baptist something like that. Nothing against them. I got great friends that are, you know, all different denominations. But, you know, once something happens to where THE REDEMPTION STORY IS SETTLED for you. Amen. WHERE THE REDEEMER HIMSELF COMES. And you know what the word redemption means? It's a Hebrew word goel, which is a goel is a is it is a is a is a slave buyer who comes and you're up for sale to every kind of buyer. Whoever has that highest dollar going to buy you and take you over. And you know, Lucifer's got a lot of money, got a lot of power, religious knowledge, theology, and and persu beauty and all these promises that he makes and and so forth. and he's out there buying up some slaves. Amen. But you're that one that can't be bought. Amen. You're that one that's not for sale. &gt;&gt; You know the story about the African slave. He said, "I this guy came came to buy some slaves and they were having to whip them to get out there and STAND THERE. STAND STRAIGHT AND TALL. Show how strong you are. I want to get high dollar." And they're whipping them and whipping them. There was another one just standing there straight and tall without a whip. You know the story. And the and the buyer was looking around. He said, "I want to buy that one. That's my first one I want to buy right there." And this owner, he all the rest of them, he didn't he he didn't care whether he owned them or not. He just wanted something out of them. But this one, he wasn't going to sell. And he says, "Uh, that brings up a little funny thing in my family. I was, you know, I was stuff I don't get too attached to stuff." Now, I guess I have enough Kuckian in me that I do to some stuff. But, uh, my wife said, "You sold that?" I said, "Yeah, I just owned it for a while. I didn't need anymore. I just sold it. Did you get what you paid for? You can make an ink?" No. I was selling things so fast one time and I'm into that again right now. You know, it's this getting old thing, you and she said, "You you you going to sell everything? You going to sell me?" Nope. You ain't for sale cuz you're my life, honey. How could I sell my life out? And Christ is our life. and he has appeared in this hour &gt;&gt; and we're appearing with him as being owned by God. &gt;&gt; But let's show people that we love it. It's not a boredom. &gt;&gt; This is this is the greatest thrill of my life. The greatest joy I could ever have is serving the Lord. &gt;&gt; Even it's hard life. You're not going to be loved. I mean, they're not, you know, they're not rounding us up and throw us into jail yet. But devil's after us night and day. But I'll just stand up and say if he says, "Won't you want to come with me a while?" I say, "I am owned by God." What was I going to say then? &gt;&gt; And loving it. You're preaching my sermon now, folks. You know, we're supposed to A lot of people say, "Oh, you're preaching trying TO BE LIKE BROTHER BEN." EXACTLY. THE LIFE THAT WAS IN HIM WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE BELIEVER. THE SAME JESUS THAT WASN'T BROTHER BRANDON. WE'RE NOT FEEDING ON A MAN. WE'RE FEEDING ON THE BODY WORD OF THE SON OF MAN. JESUS CHRIST ALIVE TODAY. Who is by the way our owner, &gt;&gt; our original owner. He owned us from the beginning. &gt;&gt; He He owns us for eternity. There'll never be a a slave market for us again. Amen. because we're free. &gt;&gt; To be owned, &gt;&gt; we're free &gt;&gt; to be led by him. Amen. &gt;&gt; And loving every minute of it. &gt;&gt; And I know I know we all have testimonies of something we would have done if he had led us. But now we we didn't and we lived a little longer and we look back and say, "Man, if I would have done that, you remember brother Brandon told the story about he was going to go to Canada because he couldn't handle all the friction in the church, all the in insanity around the tabernacle, all the all the antichrist spirits that raised up right under Brandon." You say, "Oh, brother B." Some people say, "Oh, Brother Brand, I Brother Joseph would just take over the whole thing." That would, Brother, you got to have the inddwelling owner inside of you or you're going to wander. I don't care what church you go to or what pastor you have. &gt;&gt; We didn't fall in love with our preachers. We fell We didn't fall in love with Brother Brandon. Rebecca didn't fall in love with Eleazar. She was waiting for her Isaac friend. The Isaac alone. Amen. The Christ alone is my true owner. He's the one that died on that cross for me to buy me back, to redeem me. He's the one that opened that seventh seal in this hour. AND IT'S NOT ALL revealed where we can explain it. But it's in our heart saying we're owned by God and everything's going to WORK OUT. &gt;&gt; IT'S ALREADY DONE. IT'S ALREADY FINISHED. AMEN. How many love the Lord? You say, "Brother, can we apply that to your to the length of your sermon?" &gt;&gt; You don't have to say it. Somebody thought that right there. I'm not reading your mind, &gt;&gt; but I have trained you to expect me to preach long, and I'm not going to do it today, &gt;&gt; but I'm just hoping that you've grown to understand that long doesn't mean what you used to think it was. So on the other hand, I said I I'm not going to make it complicated because that's what ministers do with this seventh seal. They get so deep. Do you get it? They're all nodding. You better not drink. But if you don't have it revealed to you to where you can tell somebody else what &gt;&gt; That's right. in a simple way. &gt;&gt; You're not you're not going to be a soul winner &gt;&gt; because you got to reach out to them with where they live stuff. So I like the concept of everybody's rebelling against ownership or being told but rather every country I've been in I've been in a lot of countries all over the world 80ome countries spent time there lived with the people and stuff they all fight the same battle. It's either the police or it's the governor or it's this president or it's something else or the mayor or somebody's telling them what to do and they don't like it. But when they own you and that's the thing about it. See, the world can own our body or think they do, but they can't own our soul. &gt;&gt; They don't own your free moral agency. Amen. You have the right to choose. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Now, you might have to give your life. &gt;&gt; Have you thought about that? &gt;&gt; You think it could be possible that we're at that insane age where people are so insane they'd rather shoot you than have you living right as a neighbor? &gt;&gt; I think we're living in that time, don't you? &gt;&gt; And that's a persecution for the happy people. I think it's jealousy. They're jealous of why are we so happy? What would you answer if they ask you why are you so happy? &gt;&gt; Amen. That's good. Or I would say, I'm owned by God and loving it. That's what I would say. Every time I say that, I feel happier. I'm still sick, but I feel better. &gt;&gt; I'm still getting old, but I'm owned by God and I'm loving it. This is great. &gt;&gt; I'd rather be a Christian, an oldtime Christian, than anything I know. Amen. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. Finishing this quote, brother Benham says, "The book is sealed now and you are sealed." So, Brother Bon's ministry was to reveal us in the book and show us that we're sealed with the book. Nothing can tamper with you because it's in his hand now. &gt;&gt; You are back in the hand of God. How many believe that? Brother Brandham said, "He saved me when I was nothing." He said, "I'm still nothing, but I'm in his hand now." Brother Brandham said that. I love that. I'M STILL NOTHING, BUT I'm in his hand, and I'm loving it. Amen. And then, Brother Brandham says, "The Holy Spirit itself is the seal." And a he said, paragraph 70 of the breach, a seal signifies a finished work. Yeah. &gt;&gt; If you die right now, where would you go? &gt;&gt; You got to go to heaven. You got to go to glory. Why? Because you're you're owned by God. God God isn't going to send any of his children away. God's going to watch over you. How many How many believe that? &gt;&gt; We could start a testimony meeting. We'd be here for three hours and I'd miss my plane and my wife would cry. So, we're not going to do that. But we could. &gt;&gt; Yeah. of all the times that he proved to us that to be owned is the best life. &gt;&gt; That's where you're really free because he's not going to he's not going to tell you something that's going to hurt you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Whereas you can't trust all those other voices, right? &gt;&gt; The seal signifies a finished work. So lot that's a big question. Do I have the Holy Ghost? Well, are you owned by God and loving it? It' be a good question to ask, you know, a measuring stick or you just wish it wasn't so strict. Wish it wasn't so deep where you could understand it more. I I think that's been our thing as ministers. It this is so deep that we try to make it so complicated. When brother Bon said God's always hidden and revealed in simplicity &gt;&gt; and so a seal signifies a finished work and when the seventh seal is broken the mystery of God that's sealed in these mysterious seals is finished until that day that that seal is broken. Then it's revealed what's on the inside of it. &gt;&gt; What is on the inside of it? was been revealed and now it's on the inside of you. The life of God, eternal life is sealed inside of you. How many can say amen to that? &gt;&gt; And then he said, listen, I love this part. You're going to love it, too. &gt;&gt; And if you if if you don't say anything about it, that's okay. I know you love it anyway. The seal signifies ownership. The seal has a mark on it. It shows a ownership when you are bought by the blood of Jesus Christ. Anybody say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he said SEALED BY THE HOLY GHOST. ANYBODY ELSE SAY AMEN. &gt;&gt; You no longer BELONG TO THE WORLD or anything pertaining to the world. You are owned by God. Hallelujah. Praise the name of the Lord. That's thus sayeth the Lord from the mouth of a prophet that I'm owned by God. I'm going to add to that and I'm loving every minute of it. &gt;&gt; And another thing is a seal is a security. It means you are secure. It means you don't now you don't don't believe in eternal security. I don't know but brother but a seal signifies security to the destination. And woe be unto the guy THAT WOULD TRY. I'm going to get back in my place here. Woe be ah I lost my place. Wo okay here. Woe be unto the guy that WOULD THAT WOULD TRY TO BREAK that seal. &gt;&gt; There's not GOING TO BE NO TITLE TAMPERING ON this one. the the the the original owner COME BACK AND CLEARED OFF THE TITLE AND EVERYBODY THAT HAD A MARK ON ME, MY SINFUL NATURAL BIRTH, my sinful life, excuse me, my own stupidity, my own wrong choices, every devil that had an influence on me has lost a hold on me. Amen. And brother B said, "Cuz when you're sealed in, &gt;&gt; he's sealed out." &gt;&gt; Why'd you come tempting? He wants to look in that. He can't figure this thing out cuz he knew the old you, but he doesn't know this new you. I'm a brand new man. I'm a new creation. I'm a brand new man. &gt;&gt; And the devil can't figure that out because he doesn't know what CREATION IS. HE'S NOT A CREATOR. He's a perverter. AMEN. BUT GOD'S THE CREATOR. &gt;&gt; And when God created himself, you were part of him. &gt;&gt; You are the be Jesus was the beginning of the creation of God. And brother man said, "We the church, we are the continuation of the creation of God." What is that? God creating himself a part of his own creation. Amen. I'm a part of his creation. AND GOD CREATED IT AND he owns it. Amen. Therefore, he owns my life. &gt;&gt; And he and he and he owns my free will too in this sense. He won't override my free will if I decide to go rogue. And by the way, I'm I don't I don't like these types, but I was down there picking up my rental car. There was a choice between a Chevy and now I'm coming up to Kentucky, you know, Chevy, mini SUV like thing. And I said, I don't have that good experience with Chevrolet. But but um there was a Nissan and I looked at Oh, that's a neat looking cart and it's a Rogue. I saw God have mercy. Preacher driving a Rogue. Does anybody have a Rogue? I guess it's not it's not bad. It's not bad anymore, but a rogue used to be just couldn't you couldn't train them. They couldn't learn nothing. They wouldn't obey, you know. Go go go go go back to Britain in the old English. A rogue is about the worst thing you could call somebody. You hardheaded numb skull or whatever we would say today. Rogue, you just can't. Come on. You won't take correction. You won't take Seems like we got some of those around the churches today, you know. Oh, I'm in the message. BUT THEY WON'T TAKE ADVICE. you know, it's not only like the preacher's going to beat you over the head, you know, if you don't do it, but he's he's he's just so uh concerned that you take his advice that he gets a little harsh on on you sometime. But that, you know, that's the love of God. &gt;&gt; Brother Bam said it was the love of God when God had to take his daughter and his wife away. &gt;&gt; He said he didn't understand it. Most of his life, a good part of his life, he didn't understand. Did he say that, brother Joe? He said, "I didn't understand it." He said, "Because God promised in his Bible said he would make all things work together for the good." And he said, "I just I thinking on that and I said, Lord, I wonder how many times brother Brandham said, Lord," in his private chambers, I just can't understand how that right there could be working together for my good. But then he said after a while I looked back at it and he said he said my life is like the rose like Jesus himself. God wanted to get the sweet perfume out of my life. So he had to crush the rose. So he took my little Sharon Rose and he took my my hope and and he said because you know here's how he said it and we got to be careful when we say that we we don't say it with some kind of disrespect towards brother Brandham because we respect him with deepest of respect because he was a kinsman for us. He was our kinsman. He went through everything like we go through. And he said, she said, he had to crush me. He said, to get the perfume out of my life, he said, because there was too much Brandham in me. &gt;&gt; And then he added, there's too much of you in you. So you know when you talk about ownership that somebody else is responsible I would love to get to the place that everything I Jesus did always only those things that please the father. He said I but that come with a price of ownership. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He was owned by the word &gt;&gt; even even as natural uh human man he wanted to get out of the crucifixion. That's right. &gt;&gt; He knew what was coming just a few hours down. And even in his prayer, I mean, look, we are we are so privileged that we can break into this private prayer closet of our Lord Jesus Christ himself. &gt;&gt; Uh most of us, we wouldn't want anybody knowing what we're praying and how we're praying in there. You know, how we're pouring our hearts out to God. But we we can see right into God's own heart right there in Jesus right there in the garden. And there he said, "Father, my hour has come." But said, "If it's possible, let this cup pass from me. Nevertheless, I'm owned by God. And I'm loving it. &gt;&gt; Loving it doesn't mean it feels good. Loving it doesn't mean it's really great like you're going to want to, you know, you're going to win everybody by, you know, how much you suffered isn't going to win anybody. But it's just your personal conviction that there's nothing better than being owned by God because because he's the only one who knows how to make the end come out good for us. &gt;&gt; He knows how to watch over. He will never forget you. He will never leave you. He'll never forsake you. He's alert and watchful over his word. I had the scriptures, but the time is running. Is that clock accurate? Okay, I'm closing now. I got to close her down. Anyway, you'll get part two, three, four, and five next time. When you're sealed in, you're owned by God. And brother P, there's a lot of borderline believers. They just don't go that far. Oh, so I thought the borderline believers were in them denominations. Well, if you're not owned by God, you're a denomination. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because you're telling God what to do instead God telling what you what to do. &gt;&gt; See, Brother Ted, don't be so bossy. I just got to say the truth. &gt;&gt; But I say it in love. But I say it also realizing that if you don't accept it today, there will come a time because you are a seed of God. You will submit to God's leadership in your life. &gt;&gt; It's like there's young men in here got a call on their life to preach. You're going to submit to I may not right now today. I've seen it on a lot of brothers. I tell them they're always, "Oh, no, no, no, no, brother. Don't do that. Don't do that." Next thing I know, they're out preaching somewhere. I said, "You see something there and you just try to help it along, but you can't help somebody along. It's the Holy Spirit alone. It's between you and since he owns you, he don't permit NO ONE ELSE TO TOUCH YOU. NO PREACHER, NO NO ANTICHRIST, NO DEVIL, NO SICKNESS, NO SIN, NO NOTHING HAS A RIGHT TO put their finger on you. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; You said, "Well, the devil put that on me and he never got pay for it." He didn't pay for it yet. He's going to pay and it's all storing up and it's going to be double. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It's all storing up. Amen. Like my dad said when I I was naughty and he come home and he said, "How was Teddy today?" And Teddy, all the kids were good, Joe, but Teddy. And uh he said, "Where's he at?" So he taking his belt off and he hit him. He said, "What?" All right. I guess they use it for razor st. He used it on me. And u Teddy, where he at? Dad wants to see you. Amen. And I'd go under my favorite hiding place where he never found me. He said, "Teddy, I know you're in there. And if you come out now, I'll go easy on you. But if you stay in there for a half hour or more, you're going to get it double. You know, the old devil thinks he's getting away with it, friends. He He does some mean business against us, trying to discourage us, trying to say, "Yeah, it's God just bossing you around." Because that's his attitude. That's what he come to Eve with. He said, "Has the Lord said you you you can be happy except you can't do that." Well, wouldn't that make you happy if you could just do ANYTHING YOU WANTED? THINK about it. You know, BECAUSE THE DEVIL HIMSELF GOT A HE GOT A PROBLEM WITH WITH BEING OWNED BECAUSE WHY? HE DON'T HE DON'T HAVE AN OWNER. AMEN. But you have an owner. How many believe you have an owner? &gt;&gt; An owner. Stuff I own. You know, I want to take care of if you own too much that you can't take care of it. That's why they changed the Old Testament polygamy in the just just one because you get all these, you can't take care of them all. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You're going to spend money on people to take care of them and stuff, but they need more than your money. &gt;&gt; That's why men, we make the big problem getting so busy making money, thinking that's what they want, and they just want you just sit here by me. Yeah, but I'm making you. I'm going to get you that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. She says, "Just please." But she, you know, she don't want to hurt your feelings. So don't say nothing. But you got to be perceptive. You got to have discernment. How many believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many have stayed married 10 years, 15 years, 20 years, &gt;&gt; 5 years, three years? You got to be perceptive of what is entailed with owning someone. You don't boss them around. You gently lead them. Some of our sisters aren't so gentle. &gt;&gt; That's right. Some are too gentle. You got to find the right balance cuz you own each other. You got to speak up sometime. And man, if you won't let your wife talk to you on that subject, you better pray through because the Holy Spirit's going to tell you, "Didn't I give you a help fit for you?" Well, what in the world are you doing not letting her help you? &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Then I can say, "I'm owned by God and I'm loving it. It all got better." You can make things better by understanding that you're owned. It's not this church don't own you. Brother Thomas, do you own these people? &gt;&gt; Do I own you? &gt;&gt; In a way, I do because we're all part of the economy of God. We see it in that way as brothers and sisters. But you are you are you are owned by God. &gt;&gt; God tells you something different when he's telling me. You're still my brother. You're still my sister. And that's the way people have got so denominational around this message that it's really sickening, I think. &gt;&gt; And I got on that about ministers thinking that the five-fold ministry being the final voice. Now, Brother Brham didn't say that, but he said she, the bride, &gt;&gt; is the final voice. So now they're saying the the five-fold ministry in the last days is the final voice and you can't pull from a tape. Remember I said that a while ago. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I wanted to say this because &gt;&gt; well that's funny. Uh we pulled from the Bible all of our life. &gt;&gt; It's no it's no living person. It's just a book. But we have the revelation it is a living person &gt;&gt; because that message on the tape is alive. And another thing I tell the ministers is this. &gt;&gt; They can't pull from a tape. What about you, preacher? &gt;&gt; Where'd you get those quotes? Oh, you say, "Oh, we're becoming rebellious. We can't be like that. We got to show respect." Friends, the best respect you can show is if it's your opportunity to help somebody get straight, help them. &gt;&gt; But do it with love. Don't don't don't talk behind their back. Go to them. This is where we should be man enough, woman enough now to not gossip on pe preachers or people or churches, but we should go to them directly and say something in my heart just doesn't go along with that, brother. So I called the brother. He preached in my church. You'll never know who it was. And they said, "The old sacrifice can't purify you to go in a rapture." And he was referring to the tapes. And so you got to have it fresh from the mouth of preachers. Brother, I'll tell you, every false cult that ever started started exactly that same way. The the not the nickel spirit came in there and they set themselves up like kings. And then they feel like, "Well, now that you're in my church, if you got a revelation, you can never leave this church until I say you can." &gt;&gt; When you get that kind of stuff coming across, IT SHOWS they're not owned by God yet. &gt;&gt; Cuz if they're owned by God, they're big enough to let you go. They're big enough to say, "LORD, MAKE THEM HAPPY." AMEN. &gt;&gt; Brother Bam said, "When you love a woman, really love a woman, and you you dreamed that you married and you were happy ever after and everything, and then she comes to you and says, "Well, I really love so and so more than I love you." And brother Mann said, "If you really love her, right, Christ revealed in his own word, you can read it for yourself." And he said, "You really love her right, you'll say, honey, because I do love you and I'm not permitted to love you as a husband. that kind of love. But I love you as a sister. I want you to be happy. You go marry that man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's exactly what he said. &gt;&gt; God loves us enough that he's going to put us with the people he wants us to be with. He's going to guide us. He's going to take care of us. And and we're owned by God. So, I'm I'm even off my notes, but you know, he owns my my ideas. He owns my thoughts, my figuring out, my analytical. I'm not too analytical, but I do it enough. Analyze things. And he owns that. My processing, my processor. He owns my processor. My brain, &gt;&gt; my thinking, my feelings, my emotions, &gt;&gt; and something y'all probably don't have over here, my moods. He owns my moods and he loves it &gt;&gt; because he can work with that. If he can just make me see something, he can change my mood. How many believe that God can change your mood? &gt;&gt; He can change your day. He can change your problem. He can change your situation. Amen. You said, "Whoa, whoa, whoa. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're way on down the ROAD THERE SOMEWHERE." NO, SIR. HE CAN DO IT RIGHT NOW. GOD OWNS you right now. This a good way to close a sermon. Bring it down to right now. Right now. That disease you have, you God owns that disease, THAT SICKNESS, THAT HANGUP YOU GOT, GOD owns that right now. He bought you in all of your problems, ALL YOUR BREAKDOWNS, ALL YOUR SITUATIONS. HE BOUGHT YOU. He owns you. And he's never going to sell you. Amen. Can you say amen? You're owned by God &gt;&gt; and that'll drive the people of the world crazy. Said, "How can you be happy being owned when you're not free?" I said, "Because this is my free choice. I made the free choice to say yes to him and I meant it." And that's a big problem with our young people because they'll say yes and then they'll go back on it and they'll say yes and they'll go back on it. When you cut ties with Satan and the world, you got to cut them clean. &gt;&gt; You got to cut it clean, friends. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Clean cut decision for God. That's why I'd rather instead of working up a service and trying to get them down at the altar, Brother Ben said, "Let the Holy Spirit deal with them right there. Let them let them go all a while. Give them some groom to do what they have to do. God can speak to them anywhere. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Many of us were a prodigal son oursel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thought we just, you know, take the goodies, take the money and run and got down there, nearly died. And Amazing Grace, he was still there calling say, "Why don't you go home? &gt;&gt; Why don't you go home? Did you hear those dinner bells? Did you hear that mama's voice? You know, the sound of papa, the owner." That's what this message is to me. It's not it's not God sent a prophet or brother Ben was a great prophet and we need to start admiring him more and and then we got to carry that on down to his son and we got to carry that same admiration on down to the ministers. It's not about that. There's no big eyes's and little U's here, brother. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Ministers are actually servants of God. &gt;&gt; That's right. to serve you. &gt;&gt; The owner says, "Go and help them." And you go, &gt;&gt; "Yes." &gt;&gt; And I'm loving I'm owned by God and I'm loving every minute of it. &gt;&gt; It's been the greatest privilege of my life to be here with you today, one of them, and to be able to share with you that that uh quit fighting that, you know, it's just got to be that way. You were owned by God and uh no use in running anymore. We got to get to that place to walk off the earth like Enoch. I'm going to tell you, it's going to take more &gt;&gt; than just knowledge of the quotes. &gt;&gt; You know what Enoch's testimony was? Why he went in the rapture? &gt;&gt; He had this testimony before he went in his rapture, right? &gt;&gt; What was his testimony? He pleased God. &gt;&gt; Three words. He pleased God. &gt;&gt; I know. We can learn all the deep things and we can we can, you know, get all puffed up like, "Wow, I've got more revelation." I've been in the message longer. Remember the old days? Some of you remember the old days when the message first came around. Some people that were with brother Brad. Were you with brother Brad? Yeah, I was with brother Brad. And how long you been in the message was another big question. How long you been in the message? When I first got saved, I was so fired up. And people say, "Woo!" And I was into those tapes and books for two or three years. They said, "How long you been in the message?" I said, "Oh, I've been in the message for three months and seven days." And uh and uh 14 hours, so many many minutes. I've really been in this message a long time. Then after I was in the message message 45 years, I finally dawned on me that was the wrong answer. And so they say, "How long you been in the message, brother Ted?" Like, "How long?" Oh, tell me how how much you know how long you been in the me. Sorry to disappoint you. I just now coming in. I'm just now coming in. Or should I say it's dropping from here to here right now. It been I've been carrying it around up here in my in my in my ego. &gt;&gt; You know, we're either an eagle or an ego. Yeah. Lots of eagle eagles. Egos around. But there should be more eagles. Amen. Yeah. Carrying around my ego. Like, well, I know this and that. And I I'll be honest with you. I know a lot of people that were close to brother and brother Green and I just dozens of brothers became my dearest lovely like fathers in the gospel to me. And I God privileged me with that. And I used to kind of spout that around, you know, like, yeah. Yeah. Now I realize it means nothing. The whole purpose of God is have I recognized that my owner has come and took a hold of me &gt;&gt; and let him seal me in with him. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's all boils down to the token. greatest highlight min message of his entire ministry &gt;&gt; that opening of that seventh seal released the token &gt;&gt; which is perfect love to come on your life and you ain't going to wander no more because you're owned the owner got a leash on you. Aren't you glad? &gt;&gt; I I go walk down the street sometime around our place and we got people walking around with their doggies on a leash. Well, I had a bunch I had a bunch of dogs that didn't it wasn't on a leash and I lost them all. Coyotes got one. Somebody else I think my I had a real good-looking dog and it just got jumped in somebody's car, I guess, out on the highway. And I said, you know, I thought I owned those dogs, but they didn't. They weren't loving it, I guess. So, they took off. So I said, "Well, it's leash time." And then you see people today walking their in these neighborhoods around here. They're building all these little communities and they're walking their dog on a leash and leash. What is that dog just as happy as a lark? He's owned, but he's loving every minute of it cuz he's safe. He's secure. Amen. He knows he got a warm place to lay down at night and he got food waiting for him and water and everything you could ever really want. Amen. He's happy. Amen. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Let's bow our heads. I've had a good time. Thanks for pulling and helping me preach. Now, may the Lord bless you with our heads bowed. Somebody that not quite enjoying your freedom so much and you'd like to be a little more owned by God. You'd like to know that the owner is near all the time. I'd like to know that. Wouldn't you? I wouldn't want just anybody come working on me. I would like to know that the owner is doing it because he cares for me. Nobody else cares for me like the owner. Cuz he owns me after all. He bought me. I'm his. He can't get rid of me. He can't lose me. He can't not love me. But he has to be hard sometimes. But it's his love. And and I'm loving it too because in the end I've lived long enough to know that you come through things and then you look back and say, "Praise God, that's the best thing that could ever could have happened. Lord, you never make mistakes." Anybody here at that point right now kind of just wondering just should I should I you should you should just give in to that ownership because somebody else will get you if you don't get that seal. Somebody else will get you. And I guess you know I just have to be a good faithful minister and tell you it's not going to be fun when the when the enemy gets you. It's not going to be fun. You're not going to be happy. But if you're owned by God and loving it, you're going to be happy. Maybe there'll be a hand that raise. Say, "Brother Ted, something you said got me got next to me. And I want you to pray for me. Would there be a hand? God bless you." And somebody else, "God bless you." And we bless you, sister and brother. And God bless you, sister. And sister here. God bless you, brother. God bless you. God bless you in the back, brother. On the God bless you, sister right there. God be with you. Amen. and brother in the back there. God bless you. Young another sister raised her hand here. So let's pray. Heavenly Father something when I say that it's a testimony that I give that breaks me out of my my feelings, my mood or my being down or sad or I don't know why, but it just when I say it, it that's it shocks me. It shocks me back to reality that I'm glad I'm owned. I'm happy that I have a a caring a caring heavenly father that owns me. And you put your seal and your mark on my life. And I'm glad to be representing you, Lord, by that seal because it shows coming and going. And and there was hear some that even now with all the great preaching and all the great services that they've they've all had in this church that even now they this thought has kind of awakened something on the inside of their heart deep down on the inside. And it's only the voice of the owner that can do that. No other voice can make them do that Lord. And so since you've spoken to them, maybe you use something I said, but it wasn't me. It was you inspiring me. Then Lord, I'm giving them over into your hands. And I'm asking you, Lord, to show them what what benefits are in store for them. What blessings are in store for them if they would just be happy being owned by God? Because that's cold hard facts is that's the way it is. But there's a warmth to it. There's a a depth of love that's there that they could find nowhere else. There's a comfort that they could never find anywhere else. Believe we believe Lord that we don't want them to try it anymore. Let them quit trying to find it some other way and bring them to your way, Lord, today. and we could all find strength in some similar testimony as mine was. I'm owned by God and loving and it it just does something to me. It shocks me to realize I got no complaints. God is good all the time. And I just ask you to bless them today, each one of them, and go home with them. I could can't go there with them to talk or fellowship. I'd love to, but you be there and watch over them, Lord. Lord, we commit them to you. But everybody else that's sick, Lord, let it be something that was started today that's going to be finished by and by because you're the owner and you know exactly when to come on the scene. So we commit them to you, Lord. Bless this church, Brother Thomas, and all the lovely saints here. Father, thank you for giving me the privilege of being back in my beloved home ground here in Kentucky. just three years we lived here, but I've never been the same all my life since those three years here around these people. And I love them so much. And I'm glad there's an open door for us. And I pray you'd show them that they're welcome to come our way also anytime. And we we pray for them and we ask them to pray for us. And we commit them to you, Lord, now in Jesus name for the glory of God. Everybody said &gt;&gt; amen. I love him. I love him.

We're going to stop with this, but a song I know sister Becky and brother Steve and a lot of older ones remember this song. And how many's ever heard that song? It took a miracle before. Do you remember that, Sister Becky? And I love the the ver the chorus. It says uh it says it took a miracle to put the stars in place. It took a miracle to hang the world in space. But when he saved my soul, he cleansed and he made me whole. It took a miracle of love and grace. Aren't you thankful for that this morning? Amen. We're not going to sing it because I'm way rusty on that. Brother Ted said he was rusty on preaching. Well, I'm rusty really bad on this song. But God bless you. Remember the service Wednesday night 7:00. Come expecting from the Lord. And let's sing this little song. Wonderful, wonderful Jesus is to me. As we go this morning, has it been wonderful to you this morning? Well, wonderful. God bless you. Wonderful Jesus is to me. He's my counselor, prince of peace. Mighty God is he. For he is saving me, keeping me
