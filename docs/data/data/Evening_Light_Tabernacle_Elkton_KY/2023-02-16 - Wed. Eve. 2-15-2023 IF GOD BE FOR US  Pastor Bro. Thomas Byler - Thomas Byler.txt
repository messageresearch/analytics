think about that the other day in the battle that and it's sometimes I think I've just got used to it and I begin to claim my healing I tell the devil I said this is a lion vanity and one of these days I'm not taking anymore because I believe that God's going to heal me and ever since and my Sugar's been up if I thought your devil you're just defeated and you're not smart enough to realize that

lord Jesus we come before you tonight thank the Lord to be able to assemble ourselves together Lord One More Time Lord on this side of Eternity Lord magnify you to lift you up Lord to praise you and to worship you in spirit and in truth Lord father tonight we ask God that you just take my heart and my mind and every thought Lord take it into captivity Lord and let it be Lord surrender to you that you might speak the words of life to us tonight Lord and that which you've laid upon my heart to speak tonight we ask God that you just Lord help us and to be able the Lord just deliver it in the way that you want to deliver Lord father bless the ears of the people the hunger of the people Lord Feed Us Lord from your precious word Lord you know our needs Lord Jesus and we're just so grateful of God that you know exactly what each one has need of Lord Jesus and just how to supply that neat night father we commit this service to you now in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen if you will turn your Bibles to the Book of Romans amen we'll just get into the word tonight amen do you want to remember sister Marjorie like Brother David said she does have a heavy load right now with whether parish is at the place that he is amen and and just uh and amen and the things she has to do is just heavy on a person so amen our heart goes with her and trust that God will just bless her in a rich way to bring her comfort and peace during that this time amen amen Romans 8. amen this is a very popular chapter I guess and then certainly one of the uh some scriptures that I'll read is one of the first ones I guess as a Christian as a young Christian that I learned a lot of them by heart amen and they certainly suck out to me and so we want to just take Romans 8 and do a little study from verse 28 down to verse 39 tonight amen amen verse 28 for we know that all things work together for good to them to love God to them who are called according to his purpose for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son so called and whom he let me all for us who can be against us see that we will go try to get all the way through amen amen and we'll just pick those up as we go so so tonight I have some questions amen I want to ask some questions amen and I will get you to answer them as we go if that's okay amen amen the first question amen of course it's going to be my title and that is God before us amen first of all let's go back a little bit and realize who this is coming from right and that's the Apostle Paul amen amen and there's something that uh Paul amen having war chains a lot of times in his life been in prison a large portion of his life having experienced of course things that we won't mention all tonight but you know he talked about Thrice was I beaten with Roz once left for dead twice was I Shipwrecked and all these perilous time perilous from the countrymen you know perils from here and perils from there y'all remember him talking about he had perils everywhere Paul had a lot of trouble and I think one of the things that Jesus told him when uh you know he said you know this you know I'm going to show you the things that you're going to suffer from my namesake you know and that's kind of I don't know how Paul was introduced to being the minister and that he was given and the things we experienced and so this thought came to my heart you know uh I guess yesterday all had sat there if God before us no doubt I've ministered on it before but I'd like to again if I could amen if God before us amen you know uh now notice the first question that he mentions is what shall we say then um thanks amen amen and the answer is right if God before us who can be against us so say that with me if God before us who can be against us that's the first answer to the first question what I would say to these things Paul says this is what we're gonna say now notice he just got finished saying some things right and uh to these things let's talk about these things for just a couple minutes before we go further first of all he said in verse together for good to them that love God to them who are called according to his purpose amen amen so I wrote down here you know kind of the opposite side we know that all things work together for good to them that love God is that right now we could re-read it and say that we know that hardly anything works out for the good for them that don't love God isn't that right so rewriting it we'd say that you know nothing is going to work out good for them that don't love God and to them who are not called according to his purpose are not in the purpose of God for those that are not in the purpose of God it certainly doesn't work how well we'll get into it and Layman and how that and if I believe it's just a chapter or so later uh let me see no it's not even a chapter or later yeah it is in chapter later not a page later but just across the page because uh God's talked about how that you know how that he wouldn't have Mercy John he would have mercy amen and how that he would uh let me see I didn't intend to put this in here but I will verse 22 he says what if God willing to show his wrath in chapter 9 verse 23 I see it amen willing to show his wrath and to make his power known oh and do it with long with much long-suffering vessels of Wrath fitted for to destruction so that he might make known The Riches of his glory on the vessels of Mercy we she had a far prepared unto Glory look at how God makes his Wrath known isn't that right Amen on perhaps we would say on the vessels it says uh vessels of rat fitted for Destruction in other words those that are not in the will of God not in the purpose of God not in um what did I call it the plan of God plan his plan is his will and that's one thing that everyone so we want to look at that what if God is for it my mama for a Christian I would just think I think about you know in other another thing that we could call about if God beat not for be with us amen if God be for us or if God be with us who can be against us amen so we see nothing works good for those that don't love God or or people even that claim the love of God but don't really love God amen all that one scripture back and and mentioned it later on so now we now let's go verse to 29 let's take verse 29 for whom notice Paul said for whom he did also did predestinate to be conformed that he might be the firstborn among many bread and I won't expound on that very much but I do want to go to the next one he says now notice the foreknowledge of God is doing 29 and then he talks about moreover in whom he did predestiness so-called and whom he called them and he also Justified and whom he justified and he also glorified so there is a four stage work that God does on the belief if you'll notice here it's about what God did isn't that right it's about what God predestinated says you know you are already fine so he's already done it but Brandon explains it that you have a glorified you drop dead before this says service ends there's a party waiting for you a glory he's done all of that isn't that right things if God be far too can be against this Hallelujah now I know let's go on down to we chopped we covered 31 let's go to 32. he that spared not his own son but amen and put him on Calvary maybe amen if he took his own son put him on the what bigger thing can you do what bigger thing could God do for us then they give his only begotten son whosoever shot me even him should not perish so everything's I look at this now that I wouldn't give you all these other things if he didn't share that he gave you that surely he'll give you everything else amen how many believe that freely give us all things and I thought about that how did God give us all things and I remember the scripture you may not mean those rich people need to keep the minds right don't get all puffed up that's right that high-minded nor trust and uncertain right cheers I want you to understand where I come from people believe in you having it hard they don't want you to have no air conditioner they don't want you to have it's going to be rough tough and everything else but the Bible says in God give us richly all things Trend y'all how many believes that's the way God looks my you know aren't you glad to have a serve a God Like That so we see here that God gave us all things freely to enjoy I'll tell you what I like it you know because I don't just look at that as worldly possessions but how many knows did God give you the Holy Ghost folks if you don't enjoy church huh if you don't enjoy the presence of God I found my daily pieces I don't know about you but I enjoyed that's what I every day I think about God what is surprises even Peter and them amen they want to do they didn't want Jesus to leave but if Jesus said man if I don't know the comforter will come I have got to go to the Comfort aren't you glad the comforter came aren't you glad you can have comfort this evening he's really giving you comfort and peace oh my when you think about all that God has given you remember the Little Flower brother man talked about amen and the rich man or the poor man wanted to be rich or whatever he wished he would have diamonds and that flower took him into that in the mountain and gave him diamonds and pearls and everything only one condition you gotta take me with you wherever you go and in the end he left the flower in the mountain he had a little bit of gems and so forth going to destroy them but the mount closed up because he says you're forgetting the most important thing that is me how many shots the way it is in this world people have forgotten the most important thing and that is the Holy Ghost that's Jesus Christ every good thing every good gift comes from above every good thing that you enjoy is comes from almighty God Amen in the most things that you came money can't buy Joy money can't buy peace money can't buy love Monica patience thank you oh aren't you glad that he's giving us freely all things Amen to enjoy these things if he's staring at his own son won't he give you what you ask for sure amen I've been wanting to preach or demonstrate on preaching a negative message just give a little illustration you know people that believe there's such a thing as the Holy Ghost I know Holy Ghost the people thought always happy you got a smile on their face and act like they're happy I don't think they're really happy huh these people think that they can live Victorious and all these other things and you know that the the Miracles are for today they're not for today that was only for the apostles and so forth can you imagine preaching a negative people think that they get healed nah that's just their body healing them or whatever I wanted to preach some other time but I thought about man you know because let me just sum it up a little bit because there that you can easily you could easily be consumed by these things it could easily come into your mind but that's not what the gospel is the Holy Ghost is always positive it's never negative the word of God is not negative it's always positive the Bible says the promises of God are yea you know yes not no the positive amen praise the Lord I believe that's what Paul was realizing here you know man who can be against us we need to enjoy it Lord amen now notice he says and who shall lead anything to the charge of garlic it is God that just ified Hallelujah let me know first thing people want to do amenities to look at you your fals yeah I'll look at you let me ask you something you realize that person that's accusing you of this do you think that person will have any part and ever justifying you no you justify you amen that's why you want to pray for people not be so critical oh look look at you look at him look at him and one finger going up one finger going that way and three of them coming right back up makes fail five faults and failures you need Mercy you need Grace amen don't be be careful about how you charge God's leg hey man who is he that condemneth huh who is he that condemnity it is Christ that died yea rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of God who maketh intercession for us how many knows that's that intercessor the button around him he called that it's like a it's like a lawyer it's like an attorney somebody to intercedes for you you shall surely die Thou shalt not kill thy shall not commit it all to thy shall not do any new any of those thank you that's what the law says that's what the judge says all right but the very law the very law Giver the judge became what he become our attorney how many police he's our attorney now most of the time when you get in trouble and you do something wrong you want to go and you want to ask somebody that has used the lawyer before and say I want to give me a good lawyer how many no you want a good lawyer huh what a good lawyer and I thought I'd probably come up he says well let me see if I want to take you Gates huh I'll see if I want to take your case he takes your case he says no I'm gonna represent just be quiet anything you say they'll use against you I'm gonna do your talking for you let me know what's in there you're not my Lord all right I got the right to remain silent because anything I say can will be used against me if I want a good lawyer how many please Christ is the best lawyer in the world he's a attorney even oh boy you see that's good amen you've got the best attorney in the world when you've got Jesus Christ on York thanks and oh Mom I'll tell you what but you gotta commit your case to Christ you gotta commit it won't read the whole quote but remember I was just reading it and I got it here but he says I went into a little store a man in one of the sisters were in there and she says he was six years old and I promise you I have learned my heart twice the 12 years old and I studied and I realized hey I commit my take care I sure can but she was young and she was worry-free and that's what was preaching on let off the pressure you don't have to have all this pressure you don't have to be under all this stress when you commit your case to God just sit back and watch him work yes I mean it how many plan for that mediator when you fall short when you do is that something oh my not attorney s to mind he can turn the minds of anybody did with pharaoh we will talk about Pharaoh for you at our example here for tonight a little bit of how God takes your case amen when we think about oh okay think about this make US enter to if God before us who can be against us and I thought the on the opposite side of that let's look at the other side of that the other side of that if God's nice God huh because somebody knows many many are in many many cases God is not for you folks you're on the wrong side if God ain't for you you're in a heap of trouble how does it say he says who can be against us I wrote in there or thought who can help you who's going to help you if God is against you I'll tell you what there is nobody there when Nathan and Cora in that right when Cora rose up and said what he said and the Earth swallowed him up there was no Wing man there was no helicopters there was nobody coming and swooped in and saved him God is against you but you are in a heap of trouble you're out of the will of God you are in a heap of trouble AMU how many knows God is either with you or he's against you you either Fork so what people do it to the sons of God they don't you better watch we better watch how we treat each other what we say about each other and if we're against each other somebody's in their own it's not a God I'm both besides it's God on one side and the devil on the other scripture because in that day remember on that day he'll say you know as you have gone on to the least of these God's here either for God or you're against God and as you amen are with God's people or against God's people is how you are with God amen again again let's go a little bit longer it's a rough road to be against God you know Saul I mean no Saul before he was Paul he was against God he thought he was for God and he was exuberant and he was very very zealous in what he was doing but the more people that he put in jail the more he hurt than in his other City there's all kinds of boys he was probably overwhelmed with this job what am I going to do the more I rest the more the more pop up isn't that right and that's what that's the answer in the morning never come against the more rose up you couldn't stop it because you can't stop God's program you can't stop God's will you can even kill him but one thing's for sure you won't you will conquer him you could feed him the Lions you can burn them at the stake and you can do all kinds of things you can kill their body but you can't never separate them amen you can't stop the will of God amen because listen to this this very very simple thing well brother do you believe this well brother be careful how you answer he's wanting you to agree with him to be in agreement with how can to walk together unless they agree he's happy now what do you think they killed all those millions of Christians just kiss the cross huh which was idolatry and you they knew it because they were worshiping the cross they would just renounce this or this out of the other amen all the devil wants to do is greed that's why Pentecostals methodists wesleyans and all of these they don't have to change their religion did you hear an agreement with them because Paul said what agreement does bail happen Christ and so stories of what Pricks are and what all this out of the other are and I don't know but I'm just going to tonight interpret it in my own way of thinking you it's all right because a prick or or take a needle and prick you right something that's kind of really hurt it's not gonna be comfortable whatever you're kicking against if it's bunch of Swords it's gonna be terrible can you man I wouldn't kick burn wines would you you wouldn't kick more than once you'd stick yourself up into them big old Thorns I hate going through a Wilson and rubbing against these thorn trees because they are brutal and it wasn't he a who had a crown of thorns stuck him down down in his head and everything it was horrible all right Paul found that it was hard it was hard for him to go in the way that he was going why because he was fighting against God he was not for God God was not for him but against him he was against God until God turned him around amen first how about the Pharisees let's talk about them a little bit how many they were always against Jesus always try to catch him in his words tried to put that woman right out there in front of him and this is what the Lord says but yeah just the right answer always and every time they ask him about marriage divorce about and I just read this the other day I was reading and look where Jesus was being crucified they were saying to follow they believe it was that he's saying that we should not a tribute to Caesar what he said he says whose description is it Caesar he doesn't give unto Caesar to things but yet they they said they don't want to pay talk to me all right like a devil I was like they actually came right out there and just straight out lied but isn't that like amen but anyway so think about that the fair peace finally they finally got him killed is that right it finally killed Jesus they thought well maybe it was done right it was fun yeah he put it in who you know what we better secure that two million raise in three days and all these other stuff and if he raises up man it's gonna it's your country go and say look he went to talk about you know about the bodies being stolen away let's to say even after the tomb was oh even after it was opened they went in and said let's get in the green and it's to this day that somebody stole his body away but this stop God no they couldn't stop God everything they did failed just like pharaoh everything he did failed I want to tell you something you fight against God everything you try to do will fail and amen Pharisee they getting they couldn't uh they couldn't stop it could they no and that is Pharaoh we're going to go back into it pharaoh and he was wrote about when he got to talk about this foreknowledge and the vessels of Wrath and what God does and he does what he wants to do in the up here above uh verse 14 knows that that's the truth Cosmo shows Mercy on who we will and whom he hardeneth he will so what shall we say then is there unrighteousness with God God forbid for he saith to Moses I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy and I will have passion on whom I would have compassion so then it is not him that willeth nor him that run us but it's God that showeth Mercy for the scriptures have unto Pharaoh even for this same purpose have I raised thee up that I might show my power in thee and that my name might be declared throughout all the Earth so even in the New Testament Pharaoh is given as an example that God does what he wants amen thinking about pharaoh and how hard he was kicking against the pricks and I was listening I think I had had a playing out in the barn or somewhere out there and I had it playing Amen in Exodus in somebody was really asking to be forgiven one more time and so forth and I thought it was Fair oh sure and I went back and looked it was him the scripture saith where we just read about the scripture sayeth for in this the have I raised thee up that I might show my power in the exposes in the morning instead of him Dustin Lord God of the Hebrews let my people go that they may serve me for I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart he says and upon thy servants that there is none tight knee in all the Earth for now I stretch out my hand that I'm a smite thee and thy people with pestilence and thou shalt be cut off from the earth and in very deep for this cause have I raised thee up for that mind name maybe the declared throughout all the Earth amen wow and he talks about how it he uh sinned hail and killed all their cattle except for Goshen hello in verse 26 into anybody listens anybody that let me go back a little bit verse 20. houses and he that regarded not the word of the Lord left his servants and his cattle in the field so whoever regarded the word went and got that cuddle in their servant sin so they wouldn't get killed later on it says you know that it happened and everybody that didn't regard it they all got killed by the hail and fire Amigo with fire but in verse 20 says but in only in the land of Goshen where the children of Israel were was there no hell the wicked he don't that punished his people would and called for the Lord is and I and the people are coming out of Pharaoh's mouth repentance isn't that right entreat the Lord for it is enough that there'd be no more Mighty thunderings in hell and I will let you go and you shall stay you know longer I remember at the beginning of it before Moses ever did anything many times different times through it he says no I'm going to harden Pharaoh's heart and then that'll let you go and many times he said that in different times he said and then right now read he says Moses went out stopped it all down in verse uh 35 and the Heart Pharaoh was hardened neither would he let the children of Israel go as the Lord had spoken by Moses I can just imagine that pharaoh was frustrated with himself huh dude what is wrong with me I say that because another time and a couple of times like that he he said go when God hardened his heart he went all the hardship was over but I mean if you want to be on God's side not the devil's side amen because God does what he wants you know oh my listen to this I'm going to say something that comes to mind didn't have it wrote down but if you won't believe the truth God will give you over to a reprobate mind and you'll believe you're right and you'll go straight to Hell believe in your right efficiently leave a lie and be damned by the Bible God help Lord help me don't ever let me get in that way but if you turn down truth that's what will happen the Pentecostal world is seeing the truth and they turned it down rejected it and it's sad folks we're talking about millions of people amen so we see here that God does what he wants Sony amen and he owned down until the last one we know the last one was when all the firstborn got to all the firstborn they all got ready to leave even that was last time he finally said let him go and they went well I Repent it wasn't the last time that he hardened his heart that's right I mean come out of town somebody still I just can't let him damn hell man you had to tell him something something wrong with him because after all the places please to fly I it's a lighter the the hail that burned everything the locusts eat everything up that wanted to turn the blood Can't Let It Go ma God kept him in the scriptures I want you to know I am God I do what I want amen but nonetheless on the other flip of the coin remember Prophet God taught us that when you're in the line of duty when you're in the there's nothing that can stand in your way he told Joshua and Joshua when our first chapter is I was with Moses so will I be with you go and possess the land no man shall be able to stand before you I mean he's glad that that's not nothing of your God's child amen and your God is with you get cannot overcome you it'll never conquer you oh I stand as a witness to that no weapon formed against thee shall stand try everything the devil will try everything but if God is with you don't fear of death I will fear no evil no evil for that with faith amen as I walk every day I tell you the greatest treasure the greatest pleasure I have is to know that he is with me he walks with me he talks with me we still walk with them to talk with him with him Health in your heart peace with me you ain't excited about that I'll hit you a little bit give you pleasure huh because that gives me pleasure you know he is with me no you shouldn't drink return to the devil you'll just be more miserable I like that when I got to thinking about these things I thought wow what what great things what great things that God has for us to know you've got before you commit your case of God I didn't even get to the good part you ready for the good part here it comes not only is he your attorney but he's already the man and that is paid your penalty that if you accept him as your attorney he's not all the Earth anybody's also the one that is already you think you penalty because I paid for it and he has accepted what I have done he has accepted me as his attorney and I'm pleading his case the price is already paid there's not no ground condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus well not after the flesh but after the spirit that is the only attorney he's also the sacrifice he's already went to the cross for it he already paid for the bad deed that you really did do all you got to do is confess your faults confess your sins how many is late that's all you got to do is confess confession is so powerful because when you confess it he says he is faithful to forgive you any of your sins to take your case praise be to God amen all right questions let's go to the questions here we only got 15 minutes yet let's go to questions I want to ask you something all right question number

cuckoo Love is Blind they don't see all the wrong and false and everything else they go mine David amen oh my sorry I'm just a little blind myself because I'm all up in love I don't see any fault in

that and this out of the other no no not interested offer brother Brown airplane plane rides and this that or the other just compromise on the godhead a lot of baptism circumced a little bit he says what about principle ities what about powers what about things present what about things to come what about Heights preacher lion or die here no nothing shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord I wrote down on the bottom of that I actually wrote in my Bible because if God is for it against us because it's God in you David said do I walk through before thou art with me Jesus said in the New Testament in the 15th chapter of John he says if ye abide and ask what you will and it should that make you omnipotent why how many is all power in there no done unto you when he is in you omnipotence is in you you don't have to fear anything nothing is greater than the love of God and God being with you David didn't have any problem with the bear the lion or Goliath or the 10 or 50 000 Philistines how many of those Goliath was scary perhaps since 50 000 are coming at you David 50 000 if your army loses guess whose head's going to be on the stake how many Saul's Ed ended up on a stake but they were coming after him so he had to have a whole lot more faith than just the Goliath or the bear he had against the whole armies but he said he could he would fear no evil for thou art with how many because you don't have to fear anything not even death if he is with you nice for you nothing can be a gift don't you see how that should just do something for us if you do not know that he's for you he's proven to you that he's been with you time I'm in time and time again don't doubt him amen I believe he's with you even in us to the end I'll never leave you nor forsake you I will be with you and if you notice how Jesus says if you abide in me and he has two parts because there's a lot of people that says well I mean Christ but then you don't do what Jesus says he said and my words abide in you if you love me keep my Commandments right people don't want to do what he says but they want to be don't don't he's done broke it right there huh you don't have to do it the thing if you abide in me in my word I'll be done amen God bless you let's stand tonight I realize tonight as Believers I'm looking at people that are omnipotent by the grace of God amen amen you have all powerfulness right on the inside of you God is for you nothing can stand against you every pain we get in our side everything that happened amen tinkling in my hand have to get
