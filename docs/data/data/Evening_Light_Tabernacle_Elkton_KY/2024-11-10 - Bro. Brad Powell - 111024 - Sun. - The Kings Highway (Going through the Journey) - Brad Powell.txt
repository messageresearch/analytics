have a few out traveling Amen Brother John sister Alicia amen and uh brother Tommy I believe it is and them so we pray God would give them traveling mercies all right I'll read verse one I waited patiently for the Lord and He inclined unto me and heard My Cry and he hath put a new song in my mouth even praise unto our God many shall see it and fear and trust and shall trust in the Lord my my many oh Lord my God are thy wonderful Works which thou has done and thy thoughts which are to us words they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee if I would declare and speak of them they are more than can be numbered then said I lo I come in the volume of the book it is written of me I have preached righteousness in the great congregation lo I have not refrained my lips oh Lord thou knowest withhold not thou thy Tender Mercies from me oh Lord let thy loving kindness and thy truth continually preserve me be pleased oh Lord and Deliver Me Oh Lord make haste to help me let them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say unto me aha aha but I am poor and needy yet the Lord thinketh upon me thou art my help and my deliverer make no tering oh my God Lord give him a hand say thank you Lord Jesus for your wonderful promise amen morning brothers and sisters I was uh one of those uh scriptures that are stuck out to me excuse me brother we read in that Psalm the seventh one it said then said I lo I come in the volume of the book is written of me and I was just thinking everything that all the promises we have everything that we encounter our life is written in the promises of God and in the word word of God this morning this has been I don't know how little bit difficult of a week you know we all as men and as women you know we start as children and then you know as your life it's like a needle it goes from it you know it's opposite though you start full and you wind up empty at the end as you go on to your Eternal reward and you know I me and uh Ecclesiastes three were fussing W with each other you know in my life I've done I've had two separate careers years I you know I spent all those years on active duty and I had to go off active duty and I was just not trying to be funny I had to turn that service truck in and that was a hard that was just as hard to do for me as uh leaving active duty because you know when you do something so long you get kind of hooked to it you know what I mean but but I was thinking about Ecclesiastes 3 you know there's a time and season for everything and I was thinking more of the young men and young women here if if God is opening a door for you and closing another one don't be afraid to walk in it however he's leading you in the word of God or whatever he's wanting you to do don't be afraid of closing a door and opening another one in your I know in my own life there's times that I've missed opportunities because I was afraid to close one door and open another door but if you would turn with me to um I'm not going to read the third chapter of Ecclesiastes but I was just thinking um if you would turn with me to I'm trying to figure out where to go this morning turn with me to First Corinthians in the second chapter and also was thinking after Wednesday night we all know that God is more than able to meet the need you just have to have the faith and Faith only comes by what does it say in Roman Romans 10:1 17 Faith only comes by hearing of the word of God plain and simple if you're putting your trust in anything other than the word of God there you know I I think of people that have that have no word or have no presence of God and how how do you have faith the believe or anything without the word of God and without the presence of Jesus Christ but I'll uh this second chapter here this morning I'll read read a few verses here and I Brethren when I came to you came not with the Excellency of speech or wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of God so Paul's U Paul's identifying something here he didn't come with his own ideas or his own ways or he came with God's ways God's ideas for I determined not to know anything among you say Jesus Christ and him crucified and I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling so he's he's letting people know even though he's God's man for the day he's still a man he still has has emotions goes on to say and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom but in the demonstration of the spirit and of power and this really important that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of man but in the power of God and it goes on to say here in the sixth verse how bet we speak wisdom among them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of this world nor the princes of this world that come to not but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery even in the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world unto our glory and he goes on to say here which none of the princes of the world knew for they have known they would not have sacrificed the Lord Of Glory but is it written I ha not seen and these are the scriptures these are the promises that we hold on to this morning eyes have not seen and ear have not heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which God had prepared for them they love them so no matter what our situations this morning what do you have to be afraid of not to say that your enemy isn't trying to make you put circumstances on you to make you worry make you fear but really what do you have to worry about this morning if you've got the presence of Jesus Christ in your heart that's the real important thing this morning it's not a it's not a hopeful type of Salvation it's a Salvation where God has come deep in your heart and he's reconciled with you through the word of God your relationship with him if you have that this morning you no matter what happens you have nothing to fear and I'll just keep reading and I've lost my place seen or heard neither have they entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that love him but God hath revealed them unto us by the spirit for the spirit searches all things yay the Deep things of God and I apologize I'm going to wind up reading this whole chapter and he goes on to say so that's the spirit of God searching those things out in our hearts and lives for what man knoweth the things of a for what man knoweth the things of man say the spirit of man which is in him so he's basically we know the things in the natural life because we're in the Natural Life basically even so the things of God knoweth no man but the spirit of God so without God's presence in your heart and life you're not going to know the things you need to know now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god and we might know the things which are freely given to us of God for which things also we speak not in Words which man's Wisdom teacheth but with the Holy Ghost teaches comparing spiritual things things with spiritual and that's a real brother brandom taught about this a lot everything you do in life has to come through the word of God and he goes on but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God for they are foolishness not to him neither can he know them because they are not they are spiritually discerned but he that is spiritual judges all things yet he himself is judged of no man for who we have known the mind of the Lord that that he may instruct I didn't read that for who hath known the mind of the Lord that that he may instruct him but we have the mind of Christ and that's where we're all at this morning I was I know I say this a lot but simply if without the presence of Jesus Christ in your heart and life you're not going to have the right mind to deal with that insane world that's out there this morning I it's so insane and so crazy out there I wouldn't even want to talk about it but it it is actually insane this morning and I was um you know I have an office full of things but I was thinking of what I was reading this quote here this morning and this is uh it comes out of the devotional in January 21st I might just finish with that this morning um trying to figure a good place to start here he brother brandom's talking here this is the last two paragraphs out of this quote it says when I first come among you your groups 10 years ago if you look it looked like a church but today it looks like the world and that this is several years ago so what when we think of our own lives what is it like today you know what you see in people's lives it's the truth something happened somewhere you got to wearing better clothes you got to making a little more money not that doing those things is bad you just made a sap out of you that's all no that's the truth that's right you're trying to act like the rest of the world today is a compromising time now when I think of this I think about the late 1950s and 1960s and you think of the technology that we have today that so easily can get you off the beaten path that's true you paint your steps red watch see if your neighbor don't paint his his steps readed sure if you wear a little round hat to church up with a little feather up in it watch all the women go to church with the little round hat and the feather up in it you know that's just how people are what I don't man or woman they like to copy each other that he I'm just paraphrasing here and all all of them want to look like one another and stopping at this per here you know it's human nature to want to be in the group but the thing you have to be concerned about with human nature about being in the group it's the group that you choose to be in that you have to watch if you're in a group that's leading you away from what you know is right then that's not the group you need to be in and my mind goes back to the first Psalm I mean you know that you wouldn't sit in the counsil of the ungodly or sit in the way of Sinners but it goes on it's a it's a matching time you know that's true it's a matching time amen now I'm going to tell you my brother I don't care whether you excuse me here but I don't care whether my shoes match my trousers or my trousers match my coat so basically it doesn't care what you look like what you sound like what state you are what whether you're in poverty or you're a billionaire it doesn't make a difference or trousers match you co I want my experience and you all know what he's about to to match God's Bible that's the matching time and it's always you know it's always been a matching time in the 1950s and in 2024 it's still a matching time if you want to if you want to match something match your experience that's why I read Paul that chapter in Corinthians match your experience against Paul amen that's what we need today it's a matching time with Paul's faith in the Bible that's our example right A M real matching time don't try try to match with your neighbor match some of the Saints of the Bible if you're a saint but when I read that I think in my own life you know there are plenty of good examp brother brandom's a good example most of all Jesus is a good example you got to be careful of the people you choose for example and a real Christian no matter who you choose to mimic or I'm not saying you should mimic the most important if you wind up following other men if they fall you're going to fall with them so the most important thing in life is that your example needs to be Jesus Christ in the word of God so no matter who you you know we all have people we respect but if they fall you're not going to be shaking because your trust and your foundation is not in men it's in the word of God and your own personal experience with the word of God and I'll finish what he had to say that's what we need today matching time with Paul's faith in the Bible that's our example right real matching time don't try to match with your neighbor match some saying of the Bible it's your Saint act like a saint walk like a saint dress like a saint man that's where the world is lacking right there talk like a saint pray like a saint believe like a saint dress like a saint be a be like a saint live a saint die like a saint go to heaven like a saint amen and that and I was just thinking all of us have a choice this morning I was going to read this one thing but I I don't want the stuff to fall down I was just thinking this morning as we whether we're young or old tall or small it don't make a difference we all have a choice this morning in this late hour that we live in who are we going to serve this morning who's going to be our post what is our post going to be tied to what is our God going to be this morning is it going to be the word of God and the message of the hour or are we going to be running after things that really don't matter this morning and you know after the prayer meeting on Wednesday I'm not going to read it but what brother brandom had to say in that healing thoughts book that first paragraph I know I read this a lot but it comes out of Ephesians the 4th chapter and I'm not going to re read that whole fourth chapter but any promise of God is yours this morning if you you have enough Faith to reach out for it and remember the one most important thing brother brandham talked about in that quote is no matter what is going on in your life however what how great decision or how always he always said to have a Gentle Spirit a loving Spirit a spirit's willing to reach out to people no matter what their circumstances that's the kind of spirit that God has for us that's what we should have for our brothers and sisters brother David amen let's stand if we could this morning appreciated that this morning and I I was he read that uh quote of brother brandom's uh about your socks or your trousers matching and as I was getting ready this morning I picked up a pair of socks and I said that ain't going to work work and I began to think of that quote this morning and then I thought Lord just let my experience what you are this morning amen let's sing that little course oh say but I'm glad I'm glad Jesus has come and my Cups have full no my cup's overrun this morning how me's glad your Cup's overrun this morning and know say but I'm glad I'm

but you know what Wednesday night I was never so proud to be part of a family of God as I was Wednesday night I was and I thought you know the devil come in and he thought he's going to Black our eyes but you know we stomped his head in Wednesday night and you know what we're not done stomping and we've got a ton of prayer requests this morning a lot of prayer requests we have a lot of needs and

they're going to have to make a decision today on what they're going to do with Mark he's just a little bit older than me and and I just thought wow you know he didn't even wake up but he served the Lord the best he knew how he's a a Christian and I thought Lord and they believe in miracles we believe in miracles but you know I thought Lord our lives are in control we don't know when we go to sleep that we're ever going to wake up again because when it's our time to go home we'll go home but you know what if it's not he'll prove once again that he's a miracle working God and you know I was

the King of Kings and the Lord of lords God's certainly good to us thank you musicians and for your your songs and for the everything that's been said this morning so far and it uh it just seems like it's just all falling falling in place and when I feel scattered and in shambles it's it's just all falling in place so uh that just shows you we we're not in control so uh I do want to take a little thought this morning and just kind of continue with some faith building and and look at some some things in the word here and if you want to be turning into your Bibles you can turn into Genesis 22 and it's kind of a gloomy day outside but the Sun's shining inside he's shining in my heart I'm thankful for that this morning I want you to listen to what brother brandham says here and he's reciting scripture and he's preaching and you'll know the the the service here but he says now I want you to remember thy seed shall possess the gates of his enemies yeah the seed shall possess he says now he's he's talking now of Abraham's seed and how do we become Abraham's seed and he says by being dead in Christ that's all you got to do by being dead in Christ he says in Galatians 3 when we're dead in Christ we become Abraham's seed see we're dead to the things of this world and begin a new creature in Christ then the holy spirit that was in Christ is in us and that's what makes us Abraham's seed and that's what gives us you know what it gives us Abraham's Faith by being dead in Christ that makes you Abraham's seed and by being Abraham's seed that gives you Abraham's Faith so people say oh I I wouldn't believe in Divine Healing he said I was talking to a minister the other day and nothing against the man he's got a right to his own ideas he's an American same as we are but he said brother brandom I don't care if you could produce 10,000 Miracles I still do not believe in healing listen what brother brandham said certainly not it wasn't for unbelievers it wasn't for unbelievers it was just for those who believe he says that's right it's not for the unbelievers it was only meant for believers and that's all the holy spirit is to them that believe Divine Healing is for those who believe not unbelievers it's Believers amen Genesis chapter 22 read this scripture here and it came to pass after these things that God did tempt Abraham and said unto him Abraham and he said behold here I am and he said take now thy son thine only son Isaac whom thou lovest and get thee into the land of Mori and offer him there for burnt offering unto one of the mountains which I will tell of thee so now right here I want you to notice here is where Abraham's Journey Begins follow God or follow my feelings do I follow God or I follow the way I feel do I follow what what the word says or do I follow what Satan says and Abraham rose up early in the morning and saddled his ass and took two young men with him and Isaac his son and clav the wood for the burnt offering and Rose up and went into the place of which God had told them now watch and then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes so here's a time frame on the third day now think about this on the third day this is a Time Abraham has now been watching for three days he's been dwelling he's been having times to to hear doubt he's been having time to have unbelief and fear are you with me for three days he sees the mountain a far off and he says it looks he lifts up his eyes and he sees the place that's AAR off for three days he's looking knowing what's about to happen are you with me but he says unto his young men I want you to abide here with the ass and I and the lad will go up yonder and worship worship God has asked him to sacrifice his one and only son and he's going up to a mountain that he's been dwelling on this this very situation for three days and he says I'm going to go up there and worship and we can't worship if we stump our big toe and he said and I and will come again to you and Abraham took the word the wood of the burnt offering and laid it upon Isaac his son and he took the fire and his hand and a knife and they went both of them together and Isaac spake unto Abraham his father this must have been the most hurtful hurtful words as he's dwelling on these thoughts that's going through his head and I and Isaac says to his father my father here I am my son he says behold the fire and the wood but where is the Lamb for the burnt offering you better be able to think quick right then Papa you better know where you stand right there that's right and Abraham looks at him and says my son God will provide himself a lamb he didn't say he's going to provide it for me but he's going to provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering so they both went to them went with them together and they came to the place which God had told him of and Abraham built an altar and laid wood in order and bound Isaac That's what Satan tries to do to us so many times oh you you think you're in the word of God I'll bind you you think the word of God's more powerful than me I'll bind you that's right you think you think you think you know more than I do and you and you you can stand upon the promises of God I'll bind you and now Isaac is bound his son and he laid on the altar upon the wood now Abraham stretched forth his hand took the knife to slay his son to slay you talk about obedience Amen to slay his son and the angel of the Lord called out from heaven and said Abraham Abraham he said here I am and he said lay not thy hand upon the lad neither do anything unto him for now I know that thou fearest God seeing that thou Hast not withheld thy son thy only son from me and Abraham lift up his eyes and looked can you imagine as he hears that voice and he bows down and think oh thank the Lord thank you Lord thank you Lord God and then as he raises up and looks into there's a ram caught in a Thicket and all along in his mind through all the doubts through all the unbelief through all the criticism criticism are you with me no doubt those guys that went with him thought man this man is crazy that's right but through all the doubt in the criticism and the unbelief now he sits there and he lived upon that word where it said God will provide himself a sacrifice and here's the ram called in the thicket and Abraham said the place now be called Jehovah Gyra as it is said to this day in the Mount of the Lord it shall be seen and the angel of the Lord C called unto Abraham Out of Heaven the second time and said by myself I have sworn sayeth the Lord for because thou H has done this thing and has not withheld thy son thy only son you see how he keeps stressing how important this was to Abraham in that I Will Bless in blessing I Will Bless thee in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sand upon the seashore and thy seed shall possess the gates of his enemies let's just bow our heads Heavenly Father we come before you this morning Lord thankful Lord for your anointing thankful for the songs that's been sang and the studies that's been broadcast this morning Lord but now we're here to hear from you we're here to hear from the word and because we draw our strength from the word we get our faith from the word we we get our overcoming power from the word and through the holy spirit that moves in our lives Lord so we just ask that you would come down and anoint us today anoint the speak allow me to get myself out of the way and and take these these thoughts that you've placed on my heart to to be able to share them with the people Lord but and let the people be receptive this morning that it's a two-way communication Lord that they will be able to receive what you would have in store and each person's individual Challenge and struggle and and wherever they're at in their Walk of Life that you will address what they have need of this morning we love you Lord with all of our hearts in Jesus name we pray and ask these things amen man you can have your seats thy seed shall possess the gates of his enemies how many's got enemies I'm not talking about your neighbor or the banker or the I'm talking about Satan I'm talking about a demonic Force that's been placed upon you or placed at you and these are your enemies but the word tells us because we have the same Faith we've died to oursel we've died to the world and the word tells us that we have the same faith that Abraham St stood upon and thy seed I'm a Seed of Abraham so by being that I can possess the Gate of every enemy that comes to hinder me to bind me to move up on my family to move up on my career to move up on anything that that that hinders me and what God wants me to do I can bind him and possess his Gates you know sometimes that's what we just need to do we just need to shut the gates of hell and S tell Satan just get back in there you have no rights to me so all of us at some point in our time have been on a on a journey we've been on a journey and and and a journey we know is traveling from one place to another and it usually takes a a pretty good while a long time to travel and this journey has a starting point and eventually it has an ending point but the adventure is what happens in between some of you know what I'm talking about you just went on a road trip with with your family and you think yeah there's a lot of Adventures go on in between but here we're talking about a journey a passage a progress from one stage to another and all of us can say this morning that life is a journey and and and we go from one stage in our life to another stage stage and then we start another portion into another stage into another stage but many times we forget about God and how he's involved in this journey of Our Lives you see brothers and sisters I want you to know this morning that in the good times God is there in the bad times God is there in the times of Sorrow God is there in the times of Health God is there you he never left Abraham he never left Abraham he never forsook Abraham he asked him to do something and Abraham was obedient to the word of God so that that's how important it is that we're obedient to the word of God and here he is on this journey as we go through this journey I want you to think about this as we think about Abraham and we just recited that story here is Abraham on this journey that he's going on up to this mountain to worship God and as we go through this journey our journey defines who we are your journey defines who you are how you react in a crisis it defines who you are the journey is what defines your character your journey tells people that's a real Christian that's a real believer they stand up the word that's a real man or woman of Faith that's a real Godly person based on your journey now if every time hardships come and every time situations arise you cow down and back away well that describes your character as well well they don't truly believe what they say they believe they don't truly stand on the word that they Proclaim that's right they don't really believe what they say they believe but on this journey it is the deciding factor of how how your journey goes so in continuing my thought on the King's Highway I'm going to speak this morning on going through the Journey going through the journey and the journey of life we have ups and we have downs we have highs and we have lows we have moments when we feel like there is nothing in the world that can defeat us and we have times when we feel like all the world and all of hell is stacked against us that's right it's a journey so I ask this question this morning how many of you are going through a journey hands all over the building each if you're living here you're breathing you're in a journey something is happening in your life and how are you reacting to it whether it's at school young young young people whether it's at your job whether it's in your marriage whether it's it's it's here at church whether it's a situation in your life whether it's a sickness whether it's a disease we're all in a journey amen that's exactly but the thing about a journey as an individual is your journey is different than this journey where you're at is different than where you're at what you're battling is is is completely different than what than what Gideon's battling Journeys are based upon individuals you see in this building right now there's people that are currently on the mountain top yeah and there's people that's absolutely walking through the valleys you say man how how how you preaching this after the kind of service we had on Wednesday because it's reality brother random said whenever you go and you get prayed for for healing you just better watch out yeah that's what he said he said because that makes Satan mad and Satan's going to try to come back and weasel his way back in so that's why we look at these things now I want you to watch what he says we find that in our Virtues Of Life everywhere you take to the pro and the con the law of average now we don't always live every day of our life in the wowy wowy Woos like Brother Jules preaches is doing no we can't live there you cannot live there you'll be in you'll be in an asylum somewhere if you're living day after day after day in the Wy wowy Woos so brother Brown says we take the law of average you have to have the night in order to to know how to appreciate the day and he says you have to have uh the the rain in order to appreciate the sunshine and you have to have the valley to appreciate the mountain you say I don't know why we we got to go through valleys so that you can appreciate what God is doing in your life that's exactly we look here and and we find Abraham and Sarah and we find Abraham and Sarah they after years had received this little one and he's now about the age of 12 years old and and and he's taken or or it's requested that God by God that Abraham would take his only child up and sacrif acfic him that has one meaning to take his life and so he he he requests that he goes up there and sacrifices this very child that he promises and so God now ask Abraham who is it Abraham is it me or Isaac is it me or Isaac that you cling to is it me or Isaac that means more to you is it me or Isaac that that you want to please and you want to serve and that you want to love with all that's within you is it me or is it the blessings I gave you you see we get ourselves in that in that problem right there we sometimes get oursel in that little trap but Abraham the prophet said he did not disbelieve God for one minute he said he could not disbelieve God for one minute because for years 25 years he'd been promised a child and he said now here he was in a place that he was dead as good as dead Abraham was dead and he said the very male was inside of him was dead Sarah's womb dead and he said he knew that if God could give him a child one who was received as from one who came from the dead Isaac was was given to them as one who was given from the dead that's no different than than the raising of Lazarus and so so Abraham knew that if God could give him a child from his from his baren loins and from her baren womb he knew that he could he had seen God in action and he knew by his faithfulness and his obedience he was to God that he was going to take his son up there and do exactly what God had commanded him so he begins to load everything up and he goes up there and he's beginning to get up there and he's he's at the altar now and he's laid Isaac down on the Altar and he says my Lord you can imagine the conversation he must have had my God I don't understand why this is happening I love you with all my heart I've served you my entire life I've given my life to you Lord and now you're asking me to give my give my one and only child but I will do what you say God and as he begins to take on the the sacrifice here and he begins to raise his hand back in Abraham's faithfulness it was at the point of death when God answered the prayer it was at the point of death when it didn't seem like there was any way out and he was fixing to l this this uh this dagger right in through his son's heart it was then when God moved on the scene he's an ontime God this journey may be rough this journey may be hard this journey may be full of doubts and fears and unbelief and disbelief and heartaches but in the moment when you need it most at the point of despair God moves on the scene here's Abraham here's Abraham think about this journey here's Abraham three days journey says he lifted up his eyes and he sees the mountain here he is 75 to 100 miles the prophet said from civilization he said up there there was no grass there was no water there was nothing but rocks surround him can we say there was no life there this was a desert isolated burning hot Rocky Top no life mountain and the prophet says up there there could not have been a ram up there he said it was impossible for a ram to been up there because if it would have got up there by itself something would have killed it along the way but here he is away from civilization 75 to 100 miles thinking on the situations you know that's when that's when the devil tries to whisper to you it ain't when you're at the family reunion no it's not when you're at at a get together or a ball game it's not it's not so much here in church you know he'll give you a little time here but it's when you go home it's when you're all alone it's when you're 75 miles away from civilization that those negative thoughts begin to run through your head that's when doubt begins to creep in that's when when those fear begins to creep in and every negative thought would come to him you know what he would say my Lord will provide himself a sacrifice this this Ram is up there and Abraham don't know it because this is a spoken word Ram of God and and brother brother Bram said that that that Ram that was up there he said that was the Lord Jesus Christ exactly in figurative speaking that's who it was the ram of God and he said that that that when Abraham was up there and that began to take place in him in complete obedience God tried that patriarch we don't like trying times we don't like trying times he says but he tried his servants he tried his servant and every Son of God has to come that way tried and chastened you see being tried is part of the journey being tried is what makes you who you are so God is trying him here and we look at this a are we going to accept the laws of Satan but you know Abraham sitting there he could have accepted did what Satan was saying but that's what happens with people that's where they fall away they don't stay right there obedient they're not willing to be tried you see when you're tried is when you got to stand on your two feet and say my god reigns when times are hard my god reigns my God provides when I'm sick my God heals but he said the problem is many fall away because they can't stand that trial so what are they doing they're instead of fighting for what God Said and for fighting what the word promises they're now accepting what Satan says they're listening to the negative how many times have you heard you're not going to make it yeah how many times have you heard your children don't stand a chance yeah yeah sure you have was that God talking to you no that wasn't God that was Satan now let me ask you how many of you has said okay I think that voice is right I'm just going to quit I'm just going to give up I'm going to turn around I'm going to walk away I'm not going to accept my healing I'm not going to accept what God will do for my children I'm not going to accept that I'm that I'm not going to make a Rapture how many of you did that don't you raise your hand we're going to talk if you do no you didn't do that why because you're standing on the infallible word of God that says no matter what Satan says the word says God was so pleased with Abraham and his obedience on his journey God knew he wasn't going to have to kill that that child God knew that he knows before the foundation of the world he knows where each and every one of us the battles that we're fighting today it's what are you going to do on the journey to get there we knew the outcome when I began to tell the story you knew Isaac wasn't going to die but have you thought about the journey it took for Abraham to get there you see when God spoke to him he's on that journey and God spoke to him what to do and said it's it's time for you Abraham to lay your Isaac down it's time for you to lay him down sacrifice your one and only give me your treasure child that's when the thoughts came it wasn't when he was rejoicing because he'd been given a child no it wasn't in the times of Rejoice that those NE negative thoughts came it was in the times when he said now give me back that's when the doubt came it's when he's Gathering the supplies for the to get to get to the end of the journey the wood the knife the people the the the mules or whatever it was going to pack that's when fear be to strike and the disbelief because he got no doubt began to think this is really happening this is really taking place in my life this is really something I'm fixing I have to go through and when he's looking at this mountain for three days off in a distance no doubt anxiety had to begin to build as he thinks about the Altar and he has to now explain to Isaac what's about to happen you see brothers and sisters when we're going through the Journey Through the battle through the trials through the valley through the desert places that's where the struggle is it's not when you get the big paycheck it's when you don't know if you got food to eat it's not when you when you when when you're healthy and everything's well it's when you're not not you you got the report that everything's not so good that's when the struggle starts but it's when those times is when we have to put aside the struggle and rely right back on to what the word says the word will carry you through the Journey the word is what carries you through the Journey Journey Abraham had to keep relying on the word God will provide a sacrifice God will provide a sacrifice well there's that mountain God will provide a sacrifice well I got firewood I've got a knife I got a slame God will provide a sacrifice listen what the prophet says before any Victory can be won there has to be great prices paid he says oh what prices sometimes they're very deep deep prices to be paid sometimes the the road the journey that we're on requires you to overcome some things it requires you to let go of some things young people it may require you to set aside some friends so-called friends it may require you to to when when the Pain's there it may require you to to hold on to something you never knew you had scars he says it'll take make great scars and tearing down but in order for you to have that mountain in order for you to have that mountain we've got to have that Valley he says before we can have the sunshine we've got to get the rain before we can have the light we've got to get the night before we can have right there had to be wrong and a and if you would have never known what wrong was how could you know what right was you know I don't know anybody that ever came to Christ perfect no cuz how could you ever know the saving power of God Almighty if you f if you thought that you done everything right that's why you're born in this world speaking lies because you got to know what it feels like to tell the truth when the truth hurts so there's a contrast that's taking place I want to look down another road here I'm going to turn to Daniel 1 if you want to follow along man I tell you as gloomy as it is outside it seems like a nighttime service in here Daniel chapter 1 in the third year of the reign of J hok ho J the king of Judah how about that came Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon unto Jerusalem and besieged it and the lord gave the king of Judah into his hand with part of the vessels of the house of God which he carried into the land of Shar to the house of his gods and he brought the vessels into the Treasure House of his God and the King spake to Ash panz the master of the Unix that he should bring certain children of Israel and of the king's seed are you with me the king seed and of the princes children in whom was no blemish but well favored and skillful in all wisdom and cunning of knowledge and understanding of Science and such boy I tell you that's describing something to me bring them to him and he says and he's just such as had ability in them to stand in the king's Palace and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the Cal the calans and the King appointed them a daily provision of the king's meat and of the wine which he drank so nourish them for three years do you see a time frame there's a journey beginning and I want to look at this this this little scripture today in probably a way that maybe most of us even myself included until about 2:00 in the morning didn't realize but here they're at the end of nurse them for three years that at the end thereof they may stand before the king so I want you to notice here these kids these kids here have been kidnapped these kids here have been brought into bondage they've been pulled into slavery this was the King's kids these were blameless faultless Christians Believers bride of Jesus Christ has been pulled in now and kidnapped for 3 years and it says now among these were the of the children of Judah Daniel hananiah Michelle and azeri now I want you to watch what happens here unto whom the prince of the Unix gave names for he gave unto Daniel the name of belto shazar and he gave unto hananiah of Shadrach and he gave to Michelle of meach and of Azariah abedo I'm all right are you with me but I want you to watch here what the devil is doing he's taking these children of God these four young men of God and he's trying to change completely change their identity he's trying to change who they are and the devil thinks if he can get you to change the way you think the way you talk the way you act then he can change what God has done in your life but these four kids would not stand for such he's trying to tell them that you're not really a child of God you can tell that light of somebody else devil because I know who I am I know in whom I have believed I know who saved my soul I know who delivered me from the sin and the Wrath of the life I was living and here in Daniel it talks about these young men they're probably 15 to 20 years old thank you Carson probably 15 to 20 years old from No Doubt wealthy influential families think about it stable Noble backgrounds good-look intelligent young men but here they find themselves kidnapped they find themselves kidnapped and they've been taken from their homes their families they've been ripped from the culture and the Heritage that they know to go now and start being uh uh pushed upon them false Idols false gods false teachings music that was not inspirational of God and now this has been pushed upon them and a and as we look at this I want you to look at their names and I want you to watch how Satan does so hananiah his name his given name means the Lord shows Grace how'd you like that to be your name well this this this this Devil comes in and he changes his name to Shadrach this says that means command of Aku a Samaritan Moon God so he begins to strip what he is in his life he begins to strip his identity and compare him to a moon God you see that's the way Satan is he tries to belittle you he tries to take away what God's done in your life and belittle you oh you're nobody they can't use you at church people don't respect you people don't look at you you can never stand up and sing a song Let's just let's just call you failure devil ever told any of that to you Michelle his name means who is what God is I like that one I like people look at me and say that's exactly who God is right there he looks and acts and talks and smells just like God but they look at him and they said we're going to change your name to meach which means who is what aou is so now he's part of this Moon God how many times has Satan said that oh you're not good enough in the kingdom of God so just serve this serve this for a while serve cigarettes serve drugs serve alcohol serve pornography serve these things we're going to call you who is what aou is and here is Azariah the name means the Lord helps these were Godly children who had Godly names and godly bringing ups and now Satan looks at him and says we're going to call you abendigo the servant of Nebo another false god how many ever seen that in the word before you see we always think oh oh Shadrach Meshach and if we called them that they're not going to be happy when we get to the other side you better remember Michelle and Azariah you better remember them by those names because if you go say hey Shadrach they're not going to enjoy what you're calling them but that's the way we're taught as children that's the way we look at this but there was a there was something that was happening on the journey in these kids these young kids life Satan was coming in and trying to disarray the whole life and taking these young men and totally isolating them and separating them from what God was trying to do in their lives we look at these young men and think about the kind of dedication and commitment they had to make to a god at 15 to 20 years old been held captive and here Nebuchadnezzar builds a a 90ft 8 story tall Idol this huge Idol that's sitting there and it's been placed in front of them and says this is Nebo let everyone know that every knee will bow to Neo and when they hear the music bow to Neo and anybody that refuses will be incinerated you realize what that is that's burnt to death that's burnt to where you don't have any bones left that that that that's burnt to a place that you you you're not even recognizable by nothing more than some ash incinerated we call it a Crematory that's for the dead they're going to throw them in there alive if you don't worship this if you don't worship Nebo and so around about verse 12 and we're little reading down through this the king gets word that these three Jews these three Jewish boys are not obey him that they're not going to fall down at the feet of the Statue of Nebo and so they call them in there because these three had actually been handpicked did you see how God likes to shall we say throw it in the face of Satan they had been handpicked because they were so good they were so righteous they were so perfect they were so without flaw they never lied they never done anything against anything that they ever said they were just perfect perfect little three little boys teenagers and so they had been handpicked to do some work for the king and the King really didn't want to have to kill him but the decree said the decree was put out there that anybody that don't bow down is going to had to be incinerated so here are these three powerless youth trapped Now by a Commandment that says you got to serve our Gods let me tell you I'm not serving any gods of this world I'm not serving any of the idols of this world so here they are coming here to this fiery death now you think about this situation they could have rationalized the situation you know that's what a lot of times we try to do we try to rationalize the situation so they could have just said you know what this is just a pile of rocks some metal it's just it's just a statue and it isn't even a real God it's just it's just an idol and you know if we just bow down to it it would save our lives is that is that really such a bad thing it doesn't it make sense to live instead of die you see they begin to rationalize but what God what did God say don't bow before any graveen image don't bow before any other Idol don't B I'm I'm the Lord your God and I'm I'm who you serve and so they've been taught that from their youth but they begin to rationalize they could have compromised and said well we we'll just do this to save save our lives and and and if we do it we can just work harder we'll pray harder we'll give more to God God will be mindful of that knowing that we done it just to so that we could pour more back into him you know sometimes that's what we do God don't care if I miss church I I'll just come back I'll do this and I'll do that and compromise they didn't compromise Believers don't compromise that's right the word is the word and we stand upon the word and so here they come to a place they wasn't going to compromise so the next time the music started and and they begin to tell them to worship they said no you see because when we compromise it leads to the next big thing and it leads to the next big thing and when you compromise doubt begins to get manifested in a bigger way doubt manifests doubt unbelief manifests unbelief and it begins to grow so do you think these guys might have been nervous when they stood before the king well sure they were sure they were because they didn't know what what what what for sure was going to happen all they knew is that they were going to have to stand up on the word of God no matter what happens and the Bible tells us that Shadrach Meshach and Abednego answered to the king and said oh Nebuchadnezzar we are not careful to answer thee in this matter and they said if it be so our God whom we serve is able to Deliver Us From The Burning fiery furnace so now they're taking the word and throwing it back at the Devil you see why it's so important that we know the word that we can recall scripture when we need it then when we're in a time of trouble we can we can rely back on what we've been taught in the word because why we're kicking it back into Satan into his face and saying we stand on what God says not what you want he will deliver he'll Deliver us out of the fiery furnace and then he go a step further and says and he will deliver us out of thine hand oh King sometimes you got to stand Toe totoe with the devil you're not taking my health you're not taking my children you're not taking my family you're not taking my job standing Toe to Toe because why God will Deliver Us in these situations he says but if if it not be it known unto thee Oh King that we will not serve thy Gods we will not worship the golden image which thou Hast set up let me tell you they were they were familiar with the law of Moses you know we've been given some some particular things in our life too we've been given a message they had the law of Moses we got the message of the hour and the message of the hour began to reveal what the Scrolls were really saying so they stood up upon Moses We Stand upon the message they had these Godly Parents that instilled the love of God into them and the love of doing what's right and obeying God so they had all of that and here they are they're standing there with circum circum circumstances that are rising in their life and they're having to stand now on biblical principles and these biblical principles are what's guiding them so here they're standing on the word of God on this journey something else they're standing up is each other are you with me they had each other that's why it's so important that you forsake not the Assembly of yourselves even as the day grows closer sir why because they drew strength from each other hey Shadrach what do you think I don't know what do you think I don't know Michelle tell me what you think I think we stand on the word I like the way you think and we come together and that's what happened on last Wednesday night we came together and we brought our licks of fire we brought brought our our our what God had done in our lives and we pulled together for each other right and we stood upon the word of God we didn't didn't come up with something new we didn't try to come up with a new new serum or a new injection or an anoc anation we didn't need that all we need is the word of God the word of God will defeat Satan in any place anytime anywhere under any circumstance so what happens here is Nebuchadnezzar these three that he enjoyed so much now he has done built up a f of fire against them and that's the way Satan is you make him mad get ready before Wednesday night service I I I I text brother Ron Spencer I said brother Ron I'm I'm I'm I'm Orchestra I'm uh in charge of the prayer meeting tonight and I said please pray for me I said because we're fixing to make Satan mad and I said you know when you make him mad you got a battle on your hands and I said you know this battle and I said so please pray for us he said you don't fight alone you don't fight alone we don't have to fight alone we've got a church group we got a church family that goes around the world and around the world and around the world I got a phone call last night from brother Ted to ask how the situation was how's sister Donna's doing how's I said man we had a real meeting God really moved and he said well just let everybody know we're praying let everybody know Tucson's praying let everybody know Phoenix is praying let everybody know Dewey's praying he began to name preachers I never had even heard of he said they called me and said have you heard yeah we're praying about it they drew strength from each other but here now this Nebuchadnezzar full of Fury against these three and he says light it up seven times hotter you know that's the way the devil is when you're going through a trial you're going through a battle he just tries to pour the heat pour the heat pour the heat more gas more gas more gas I just say this the bigger the battle the bigger the victory the hotter the fire the bigger the victory is and so here these three come in here Shadrach Meshach and abedo and he begins to cast them into the furnace they bind them bind them with their coats and their hos and it says their hats and other garments and they bind them and wrap them up and it was exceeding hot it says that it was so hot that the fire slew the man that took Shadrach mesach and abedo they couldn't even come into the presence of the fire it was so hot and here comes these three bound children 15 20 years old and they're bound and they're pushed off into the furnace into the pit of the furnace and it says Nebuchadnezzar was astonished and he rose up can you imagine as he looked down in there what is that I would not be denied I would not be Deni till Jesus came they wasn't bound anymore no they were down there it says they were walking around I don't think they was walking I think they was dancing I think they was cutting a rug I think they was praising God for moving on the sea so much that they had a hold to the hand of God because Nebuchadnezzar said who is that Fourth Man in the fire it looks like God it looks like the God they're talking about who is that Fourth Man In The Fire we don't fight alone it looks like the Son of God come here and look at this can you imagine as they walk in there and all the princes and the governors and the captains and all the counselors they begin to gather around it's hot you you ever looked into a fire you think man I ain't going to have no eyebrows well and they look off into the fire and oh my goodness look at these three boys and this man that's with them look at them this fire Nebuchadnezzar the fire that you build has no power against them the devil's fire his breath of Fury cannot have any power against us and he says look at him there's no power not even a hair on their head are singed their clothes are not even scorched and they come out of there and it says that they didn't even smell like smoke you talk about an all powerful God now we knew the outcome but the journey was hard the journey is where they had to make their stand the journeys where they had to make their stand and say We'll bow before no Idols we believe that our God is the only God we listen to only Godly music they began to make the stand on their Journey going through the fire was easy are you with me when you're in the fire and God's there with you what's hard about that but it was the journey that built their character it was the journey that told it proved to God who they were you know Daniel went through the same kind of situation they looked at Daniel and and they they brought Daniel in there and and I believe it was Darius Daniel had been been given away at the age of 16 to Darius by Nebuchadnezzar and now at 80 years years old Daniel stands there you talking about a journey 16 to 80 y'all we got some mathematicians how many years is that Sarah put you on the spot it's not that wasn't good enough for God God said I want more out of you Daniel so he made Daniel so favored that the governor said Daniel I'm going to promote you from ambassador to ruler over the entire nation it's a journey yeah it's a journey and sometimes we don't know why we're doing or what what why this Journey's taking us where we're going but God looks down here at Daniel and and blesses him in this time of trial and but the people got so discouraged the other ambassadors the other the other uh politicians might we say they got jealous of what what NE what what Darius was going to do for Daniel they got jealous and so they wanted to set up something against him I'm I'm glad the politicians today don't do that I'm glad they just changed the position of power just graciously and but back in those days they were jealous and so they were jealous of what God had done to for Daniel and they begin to look at there and say how can we get him in trouble with the King well the king had already Saidi am King I Am Lord only serve me and these other dignitaries these these politicians they looked out there and they said you know what if we could just get Daniel to show himself in front of the king we got him because he prays every single day he devotes himself for hours every single day to pray to that God he's got they saidwell why don't we just have the king write a decree that no can pray to no other gods outside of our God so unbeknown only darus he begins to write and he begins to make this script and this this this pledge and it goes out and says nobody can pray to any other God and if you're caught it's into the lion's den 64 year Journey coming to a head captivity so he's sitting there now and he's he's going in here and he's beginning to look and and everybody knows how trustworthy is everybody knows he won't back away on what he wants to or what his God wants him to do everybody knows he will not cow down everybody knows that he's still going to serve his God no matter what they say so at the noon of the day you know what Daniel did it says he stood tall on his knees in the window for everybody to see he stood tall on his knees for everybody to see what he was about to do you are my Lord my god Jehovah you are the one who provided for a a sacrifice for Abraham can you imagine as he began to pour out himself and they look and said now watch look at him King look at him Darius look what he's doing he's bowing down and you know Darius tried every way possible not to not to put him into that Lin's Den he loved Daniel but he had been conjured into writing a decree so he brings Daniel up and he begins to talk to Daniel and he tells him the situation and they say you got no no choice Daniel we've got to throw you into the lion's den at sundown so they bring Daniel up to the to the threshold of the Lion's Den now can you imagine 80y old man fixing to be thrown into a a rocky pit because he loves his Lord and so right there they begin to look in there and they begin to go and they grab Daniel no resistance if this is what it it comes to my God will provide you know sometimes we we we we take we accept what people say or what people do the critics the doctors whatever we accept that and we just kind of stand there but not Daniel he said if if this is the Lord's will push me in and so they take Daniel and they begin to push him in but I want you to notice at the very instant the angel of the the Lord come down and says and shut the lion's mouth Time After Time After Time people have been put in and devoured before they even their bones even hit the floor of the pit Daniel an 80-year-old man pushed into a pit he should have been broken to Pieces but he's down there feeding the cats come here Felix yeah can you imagine you see great victories are won but it's how you get there brother brandham said great victories have been won he said I can remember the first world war as a little boy and I could hear the whistles blowing I could imagine we could hear whistles blowing when Daniel's in the Lions Den he said I could hear whistles blowing and and farmers in the field they stopped their horses they wav their hats they scre dream they hollered what had happened he said the war was finally over the victory had been won stay on the road no matter where your journey takes you stay on the road stay on the path if your journey takes you into to doing things that you wonder how in the world am I ever going to get through this stay on the path if it takes you down a road that when you say my goodness uh how how will I ever be able to go through this fiery furnace stay on the path when the lies are breathing down your neck stay on the path God's mindful of each of our situations God's mindful of what we're going through he knows what we're going through listen to this he says before any Victory can be won great prices must be paid but in order to conquer and to win the greatest battle that ever won one stepped out to Glory many years ago you see that battle's not ours how do I go through these things you want alone how do I how do I go through how did Daniel go through the Lion's Den how did Shadrach Meshach and abedo go through the fiery fire they wasn't alone he said he he did not come as some great person he said but he's going to I'm going to prove it didn't take muskets and bullets and atomic bombs it don't take those things to beat the devil he said it don't take those things but he clothed himself you want to know how he clothed in humility can you imagine those three Hebrew children walking in humility Daniel walking in humility it was the road they traveled Adam's race all in bondage they were without hope without god without a chance without Mercy without anything that could help them great enemies of the lower region of the Lost had them shut up in darkness there was no way out sometimes you going to feel that way on your journey that I'm shut out there's no way out that I'm shut in they've got me held down they've got me they got me held captain and there was no one that could help nothing could be done it looked like a total and complete loss but our hero didn't he have a way with words my hero give me my hand my my hero your hero he came down from the portals of Glory condescending on man to do a job where no other man on Earth could do that's my god let's stand to our feet thank you Lord one more quote as we get ready to play the play some music here sister Becky I don't know what we what we're going to sing but listen to this we
