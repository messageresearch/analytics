[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] try to get this cor [Music] it's [Music] [Music] [Music] for [Music] [Applause] [Music] in [Music] [Applause] [Music] sh [Music] yeah [Music] [Applause] [Music] d [Music] [Music] to [Music] for [Music] [Music] now [Music] [Laughter] [Music] he [Music] yeah [Music] I [Music] good morning good to be in the house of the Lord if we all would stand and the children can be dismissed be dismissed for Sunday school Caleb berer would you open us up in a word of Prayer if we would turn to Psalms 18 we'll start with verse 19 and go to 30 he brought me forth also into a large place he delivered me because he delighted in me for I have kept the ways of the Lord and have not Wicked L departed from my God I was also upright before him and I kept myself from an iniquity with the merciful thou Wil show thyself merciful with an upright man thou will show thyself upright for thou wil Save The Afflicted people but will bring down high looks for by thee have I run through a troop and by my God have I leaped over a wall as for God his way is perfect the word of the Lord is tried be a butler to all those that trust in him brother Troy amen that's true you you may be seated it's good to be in the house of the Lord this morning morning it's chilly out but thank the Lord for such a wonderful place to come and hear his word um if you'll go with me this little thought and just came to me this week if you go me uh to Exodus 4 of course uh the printer didn't want to print this morning again so it prints everything else but on Sunday morning it doesn't print but in Exodus 4 and it's 4 and10 and I got this little thought because we come up here Austin comes up here and reads and some of the other ones that read and uh read the scriptures and uh it's hard when or I guess some people it might be a gift for them maybe they it's not hard to do speaking for some people but for some people it's harder to do public speaking in school and whatever it might be I was never a public speaker so sometimes when we read uh different scriptures and stuff it uh our words may come out wrong many of times or said a word wrong or this and that but I thought about Moses here in Exodus 4 and it starts in verse 10 and it said and Moses said unto the Lord oh my Lord I am not eloquent neither there here unto or neither here for to two4 nor since thou Hast spoken unto thy servant but I am slow speech and of a slow tongue and the Lord said unto him who hath made man's mouth or who ha make it or who maketh the dumb or death or the seeing or the blind have not I the Lord now therefore go and I will be with thy mouth and teach thee what Thou shalt say and it got me to thinking um you know we always want to do our best we always try to do our best but we're just human and we make make many mistakes and so that's not an excuse for us if if the Lord lays on something on our hearts for something for us to do then we should try to do it to the best of our ability and though we may fail or may mess up at least we'll be doing it for the Lord you know he he he was telling Moses here did I make the mouth to speak and and so forth and so he'll be with us and that's that's who we need then it got me to thinking of you know how uh God never picked the great and big and fancy stuff he always well as brother Tom was preaching on Wednesday night you know it was simple and talking about Paul you know when he would he was knocked down to the dust Paul had to forget everything he ever uh learned as far as being uh taught in the ways of all that he was taught he had to forget all that he was knocked down to the dust and that quote really stood out where brother Tom said when we raise up out of that dust that's where we you know make a mistake we'll have to get knocked back down to that dust again but it got me to thinking and I just seen this uh some of this scripture up here this morning but talking about when Jesus you know would come Isaiah painted a picture of what he would be and this is Isaiah 53 can go with me if you want to and follow along with me if you want to but it's the verse of Isaiah 53 and some of that was on portion of it was up on the screen this morning but this is Isaiah painting a picture of what Jesus will be when he comes I was talking to the kids this week and saying you know if we would have picked how we would have came we would have picked it to be fancy we would have pick it to be if we got chose what we would come like if we would have been strong and and all these different things would have came in riches but this is Isaiah painting a picture or of how Jesus would come and it's starting in verse one he says who hath believed a report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant as a root out of a dry ground and he had no no form cess and when we shall see him there's no beauty that we should desire him wasn't a great looking man to look at didn't have muscles poping out everywhere very simple he is despised and rejected a man a man of Sorrows and acquainted with grief we hid as were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did to see him strick and smitten a God and Afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was proved for our iniquities this is talking about us all we like like sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone to his own way the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all he was oppressed he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he has brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep to a sheep before her shears is dumb so he open it not his mouth he was taken from the prison and from judgment who shall declare his generation trouble he had all all the while he was here on Earth for he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people was he stricken and it goes on to say he made a grave he made his grave with the wicked went the rich in his death because he had done no violence neither was any deceit in his mouth yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him he he ha put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed and he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand he shall see all he shall see of the travail of his soul shall be satisfied and by by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many for he shall bear their iniquities therefore will I divide him a portion with the great and he shall divide the spoil with the strong because he had poured out his soul un death he was numbered with the transgressors and he Bears the sin of many made intercessions for TR for Trans the transgressors speaking never came in a fancy way never had the one man asked him where where does he live he said he the foxes have dens the bird have nests but he doesn't have a place to lay his head when he was born he didn't come down on a golden escalator from Heaven he was born over a manure po in a in a barn a little stable the most humble of ways he came as a baby so it just made me think of how God does stuff he doesn't always do stuff in the brightest and the shiniest ways here on Earth but he uses the humble and the meek and he uses the really lowly types and he doesn't maybe well we know for a fact he doesn't go get the fanciest people that's educated in the highest and fanciest schools Maybe Harvard and yel but he'll might take a Kentucky o belly or Kentucky Kian born in uh a little cabin somewhere and make something or out of his life and and use him as the the angel the seventh angel messenger so uh so so are we um brother Brandon was got this out of the six seal in 63 brother Brenham said so this made me think how Jesus came and then this made me think of how his bride will be too which is going to be us so so it starts in U so this young girl puts on a regular Western carry-on for this boy and when he came and when he come out each one of them was sure they was going to get this boy there was a little cousin there on the ranch and she was an orphan and so she just done all the work for these because they had to have their fingernails fixed and you know and they couldn't wash the dishes for the hands and things she done all the real hard work and then finally when the boy came they went out and got him in an old western style the Buckboard and they come down shooting their guns and carrying on you know and acting up and that night they had a great big dance out there oldfashioned dance and all the ranchers around about and uh and coming and with their dancing and so forth and first thing you know was he went on was ju Jubilee for two or three days and one night this boy stepped out to the little place just to rest a while from the dance and got away from these girls and he happened to look going down towards the cor Corral there went a little girl kind of a ragged looking she had a dish pan full of water she washed dishes and she and he thought I never seen her before I wonder where she come from so she just puts it in his way to go around beside so he just puts it in his way to go around beside of the Funk house and go down there and come back at the side of the crow and met her she was barefooted she she stopped She held her head down she seen who it was and she was very shy she knew this great person she was and she was just a cousin to these other girls their father was a foreman on the big AR armor outfit so they kept so they kept she kept looking down she was ashamed of being barefooted he said what's your name she told him said why why ain't out there to where the rest of them is and she kind of made excuses and so the next night he watched her again finally he was sitting out there and they all got to carrying on everything sit on the Corral Fence and watched for her to come throw the dishwash dishwater out and he watched her and he said to her he said you know my real purpose of being here she said no sir I don't he said my purpose of being here is hunting a wife he said I find a I find a character in you that you don't have that they don't have I find a character in you that they don't have I was thinking of the church you see said he said will you marry me she said me me I can't think of such a thing as me see that's the main boss's son he owned all the companies and ranches throughout the country and everything you see said yes said I couldn't find one in Chicago I I want a real wife I want a wife with character and the thing that I'm looking for I see in you said will you marry me she said well I it startled her she said yes and he said well I told her he would be back well he told her he would be back now you just make yourself ready and a year from today I'll be back and I'll go I'll come get you I'll take you away from here you won't have to work like this no more I'll take you down to Chicago and I'll build you home like you never seen she said I don't never had I never had a home I'm an orphan she said he said I'll build you a home a real one said and I'll be back he kept in track with her during the the time of the year she she worked everything that she could do to save enough money for at her dollar a day or whatever she had with her on board to buy her wedding dress perfect type of the church see she's got her garments ready and you know when she's and you know when she's displayed this wedding garment her cousin said why you poor silly kid you mean to think think that a man like that would have anything to do with you she said but but he promised amen said he was he promised I believe his word and he said oh was just making a fool out of you they said he was just making a fool out of you he'd have got somebody he'd have got one of them said yes but he promised me and I'm looking for it amen and I am too so kept getting later and later the day finally arrived certain hour he was to be there so she dressed in her garment she had everything even and she hadn't even heard from him but she knowed he would be there so she dressed up in her wedding clothes she got things ready well then they really they did they really did laugh then because the main boss had sent up to the foreman or ain't none of the girls had heard nothing about it so it was just all a mysterious thing to them that's it too it sure is but this girl just in the face of it all upon the basis of his word that he would be back for her so they got to laughing at her put her hands around one another and dancing around her said laugh they were laughing at her you know like that poor little silly kid she just stood there not a bit of bushing her she was holding her flowers and her wedding garment all fixed and she struggled you know his bride was made has made herself ready she kept holding her flowers waiting they said I know I told you it was wrong see he ain't coming said I got five and she said I got five more minutes he'll be here here they just laughed at her just about the time Old Clock ticked up to 5 minutes and they heard the horse Galloping sand rolling under the wheels the old Buckboard stopped she jumped up from between them and out the door and she jumped out of the carriage and she flew into his arms he said it's all over now honey left her little old cousin denomination sitting there looking and she went to Chicago to her home and he said I know of another great promise like that too yet I've got to prepare a place for you coming back to receive you they might be thinking we're crazy and saying we're crazy but brother to me right now in these seals breaking like this he said under the supernatural thing I can almost hear the sound and that clock and time taks away into eternity I can almost see that angel standing there and saying at the last of that seventh angel messenger time shall be no more that little loyal bride will fly away into the Arms of Jesus one of these days and be taken to the father's house let's think of these things as we're going along now he said and how true that is and in every age times got to be getting short people if Jesus said in the scripture there he said when you see these things happening he said look up for your Redemption draw nine and the way the world's going it's crumbling so we better start looking up God bless you Brother David [Music] R Troy was talking about the printer didn't want to work and I thought I thinking that this morning my computer started

with while they're here that way they don't have to go out and shop too much so so uh my wife has said that you know we'll try to maybe take some over there on Saturday they're going to come in on a Friday night and leave on a Wednesday so if they come in on a Friday night maybe take them a little bit of food on Saturday amen and then again maybe a little bit of food on Monday so if you want to

list of stuff to make amen and that way they're here we can show them a little bit of Kentucky hospitality would that be okay amen and and so that they can have plenty of food and also if you want to have them for supper or whatever I know we want to have them over at our place at least once if you want to have them fellowship with them or supper get in contact with M and Donna amen and that way not everybody's inviting them or man as you heard probably Wednesday God give us a good trip up toio last weekend amen and one thing I didn't mention and and I'll I'll say I'll say this remember when I told you Wednesday night about uh bringing out that scripture he that is born of God does not commit sin for his SE remaineth in him amen and I told you up there I never explained what it ever meant so I imagined they thinking hey he believes that somebody born of God he don't he's just perfect he never makes a failure at all amen but the point was it's what God's word says whether you understand it or not it's Our obligation to believe what the Bible says amen and so but but the the point of it is and when I was making it there and I wish I would have but I guess for a purpose God helped me from it but even Wednesday I didn't we all understand if you know the message you all understand how many understands what scure means a lot of you don't know what that scripture means he that is born of God does not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him for he cannot sin for he is born of God Amen well brother brandom explained that amen and I remember when I was at the Saw Shop I was testing Sam golden and John steeman on it I says do you believe that scripture and because I had tested others just to see if they believe the scripture contrary to anything and so others are no no no we don't well you know I don't understand the de it but God said where it says it and I remember Sam golden smiling at me he says yeah that's nothing but the truth a child of God can't disbelieve the word that sin is unbelief amen a real son and daughter of God can't disbelieve the word even Paul said nobody can speak by the Holy Ghost can call Jesus to curse amen those words won't come out of your mouth because Holy Ghost won't say those words amen and God Holy Spirit like brother Braham said God's spirit will believe the Bible amen you say you got the Holy Ghost and you deny this it's something else you got amen but anyway so that's what it means what the what the prophet of God said but it was and that un that sin is unbelief amen you cannot disbelieve a child of God cannot amen I'm not here to just start preaching but if something else comes to my mind on that amen and that is uh uh the prophet of God also taught us that that uh where the scripture says he that sins willfully after receiving the N of the truth that remaineth no more sacrifice for sin ain't that right amen and same thing as blasphemy against the Holy Ghost butam says a child of God can't blaspheme the Holy Ghost won't BL him the go ghost why because God won't let him amen because he won't lose one of his isn't that right because if there was any blasphemy if there was ever anybody that's worthy of uh that type of uh condemnation it was the Apostle Paul amen because he stood there and consented to the stoning of stepen and he was very harsh against the works of the Holy Ghost Paul was amen and I like what I heard the preacher say and it was true sometimes it seems like God punishes certain people for the same thing somebody else does he don't punish the others I got your attention now and you know why because God knows the heart God knows the heart and what did Paul say what was the reason that God didn't impute the sin to Paul because he said he did it in his ignorance that's right so God judges in he aren't you glad that God is the judge amen praise the Lord one more thing I wanted to say on the behalf of that is that the good thing that came out of last week and they in up in Ohio was was the fact not only the fact that uh uh you know we got to speak to that many but brother leev has given us an open opportunity would like for us to come once a month and Minister up there amen so and I know my cousins and some of them you know said they would come you know whenever I come they would come so am me not just them but maybe others so it's just kind of an open door for us and we really appreciate that we're very thankful for it amen amen I like doors God opens don't you I want God to open doors you know and sometimes we try to make things happen amen but you know we want God to make it happen ain't that right when God makes it happen it'll be done right so praise the Lord God bless you this morning amen I uh I want to continue Amen on our thought on eternal life on eternal life and of course Wednesday we talked about to two kinds of life that there is am that right two kinds of Life the one type of life is our natural life that we have amen that's found in Galatians me in I believe it was U Paul that talked about The Works of the flesh he called it the works of the Flesh in verse 19 and then in verse uh uh 22 he called the fruit of the spirit amen the life of the spirit is fruit of the spirit so if you will stand with me amen we'll just amen continue on with our thought amen see what the Lord will have I really feel like there's certainly a lot more in what we could have the direction that we could have went Wednesday but I feel like to go in this direction today amen and I hope that everybody uh enjoyed the video that brother Tommy has put together this morning of the crucifixion I'm enjoyed that up there amen I know it's a little bloody huh ain't that right it's a little bloody for our children it seems like but you know if there's anything that they should see is knowing from the very core of the young child what our Lord did for us on Calvary isn't that right amen and so this today today's uh theme kind of was on the crucifixion of Christ appreciate how many appreciates brother Tommy and Tammy and all the work they do to put this together let's give them a hand appreciate [Applause] it amen and then of course next weekend he still have on the resurrection so I don't know what that's all going to be but amen we're thankful for what the did Lord did and how he suffered for us and and really part of that death to self and dying to self we'll speak on we spoke on Wednesday and also this morning and this morning really is kind of a resurrection type of me message amen an Easter kind of message but anyway we just want to follow the leading of the spirit amen amen let's bow our heads Lord Jesus we come before you so grateful God that we can bow our heads to the dust God that you brought us from Lord Jesus and then Lord you quickened us father in our souls Lord you had put a seed father in every one of our souls God and Lord you quickened that spirit and that Soul father to eternal life life to your spirit Lord Jesus and you filled us with your spirit give us eternal life Lord Jesus we want to talk about that this morning with the help with your help Father and we ask God that you just get us out of the way now Lord and speak the words that you want spoken today and bless each one that has loved you enough this morning to come into your house Lord and we ask God you'll bless them Lord with being able to have a closer walk with you Lord when we leave this this place this morning for we ask it in Jesus name amen and amen amen amen we will turn if your bibles if you will and I'd like to read I guess the same scriptures that we read Amen in the beginning uh Wednesday night amen and we want to talk not so much amen perhaps it'll it'll kind of blend in amen but talking about the first life that I didn't even read about but maybe we'll we will in a minute uh and uh St Mark 8 and verse 34 it says and when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also he said unto them whosoever will come after me let him deny himself take up his cross and follow me for whosoever will save his life shall lose it but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospels the same shall save it amen for what shall a man profit profited what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul or what will a man give in exchange for his soul amen may God add His blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated this morning amen I ask a question Wednesday on what the answer to that is and that I to you know to the best of my understanding the answer Amen to what a man will give in exchange would be himself amen himself because in one case you can have your own life and I don't believe that brother uh that Jesus Christ was necessarily talking about just giving your life as father are sacrificing it amen perhaps into through the Dark Ages by eating being eaten by a lion which no doubt but that would also probably have a major bearing but because those people would not give their lives without the love of God but to actually die to self ain't that right to be born again we understand is die to ourself and our own ways and our own thoughts and our own ideas our very own life he that hateth not his own life also Jesus said is not worth worthy to be my disciples amen and we spoke much on that self part amen but on the other hand amen we know that God came to give us eternal life how many believes that Amen in uh St John verse uh chapter 6 I believe it is in verse 35 I'll just read and Jesus said unto them I am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never thirst but I say said unto you that ye also have seen me and believe not all that the father giveth me shall come to me how many believes that I like that amen and him that cometh to me will I in no wise cast out oh my I'll tell you what we could preach for a month on people who start and don't finish we could talk about people who have done and do great deeds and perhaps even get the baptism of the Holy Ghost on their flesh and on their Spirit they can speak in tongues and they can cast out Devils they can do all these things and still fail to get it amen so there is there is a lot of people that run in the race start in the race there's a lot in that category but there is a category amen how many believe there is a category that will not be lost and it's scary it's scary to think of the millions that do start and don't finish First Corinthians I believe it is amen and uh Paul talked about like Israel isn't that right he talked about Israel who was an example of people who came out of Egypt isn't that right but we're overthrown in the wilderness don't be like that you know and and we tempted they were tempted and tempted God and they murmured and they complained and out of two million people brother Woody two million two one two two people go in no not three four five six seven oh two out of the original Bunch why do I smile cuz if God has got a hold of you and you go through all these things and you're still faithful and loving God you ought to be the happiest person in the [Applause] world what that ought to do to us this morning amen grace that brought me safe thus far it'll be Grace that'll take me safely home my glory my praise be to God oh my when you think about that God never have me don't never let me be a murmurer and a complainer don't never let me be dissatisfied with Christen that's right discontent it's a horrible thing Paul could go through what he did and have much and have little and be cold and be in prison and could say I've learned you know I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me I can be in whatever state that I what God puts me I've learned that in whatever state I am there with to be happy content come on amen we want to talk to you with the help of the Lord this morning on the divine nature what eternal life is what eternal life does what eternal life doesn't do there's so much until I know we're going to just have a series out of it we're just going to go as far as we can would that be okay all right my so now notice here he says um all that the father giveth me shall come to me and him that cometh to me with I in no wise cast out woo Glory I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world praise be to God when God does something oh my no man can come under the father but by me amen and nobody can come unto me except my father draw his and all the father giveth me will come to me and I will lose nothing amen I came down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of him that sent me how many want to know if you going to heaven see not everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven how many believes it's so important to do the will of God that's what Jesus came to do and that's we what we are to do is to do whatever God's will is in order to do whatever God's will is you've got to die and rock to yourself I'm convinced this morning that there's still a whole lot of killing that needs to go on in our lives I don't know about you but I know there is in mine so God help me to die to myself before you can have a Revival before you can have more of God you're going to have to die more to yourself if you are exactly my here we go if you are not exactly where you ought to be with God you'll never get there unless you die to yourself more that's the only way you're going to get closer to God is to die to yourself more we're living in a selfish age we're living in an age of self love it's everything about ourselves that's not eternal life everything you do in the natural they going to mean nothing only what you do for God is going to mean anything when you take your last breath absolutely nothing you can gain the whole world and he says he ain't got nothing if you gain the whole world and lose your own soul how many believes the most valuable thing you have is your life it's your soul that should be every one of us our number one f Focus I don't know about you but I want my 60s I want my life in the future I want to be a sharper weapon in the hands of God don't you want to be a better Christian than what you have been Lord help me to be the best of whatever God has call me to be let's be the past let's be better than what we have [Applause] been amen that time folks it's a late hour it's time to be sharper to be better Christians when we have been amen Lord help us right God is good isn't he all right I came down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of him that sent me amen my my my aren't you glad for that eternal life makes you want to do the will of God Amen what is in the church age brother bam said he says they and the bride do only his will they have thus sayith the Lord or they keep still is that right that's our number one desire of a son or a daughter of God is to fulfill God's will in your life I want to tell you something there ain't a better place in the universe to walk and to be than in the will of God brother brandham didn't have to worry about which doctors or anything no man will stand before you just like Joshua just like Moses no nothing will stand before you as long as you're walking in the will of God don't go here don't go there unless it's God's Will and when you're in God's will he will watch out for you how many Bel that applies to you it applies to me when you walking in God's will nothing will stand before you amen what a place to be what a satisfying place to be amen amen y'all remember brother bam talking about he said you know he said man what if you was given the offer and I forget the exact number so I'll come up with my own but if you had 10,000 if God told you I will give you 10,000 years to be king of the world King of the universe do whatever you want just have all the pleasure just all that you ever can imagine whatever you want whatever you desire as he put it you could have for 10,000 years or you could have a life of misery and poverty and heartaches and as I would put it in there maybe they'll even take you and tie you to a post and burn you alive which one would you take afterwards you get eternal life but the 10,000 years of ruling that's the end then and you're cast off but says I'll take a heartache I'll take the pain I'll take the suffering and I'm here to tell you I can hear 68 million down through the Dark Ages out we're with that we'll take the heart we'll take a burning we'll take the lion death we'll take the sword over a life of pleasure cuz that the eternal life that we have is more valuable than anything I can hear him we gave our lives we died we suffered we was burned we was driven through through the sword we were fed the Lions they were 68 million and then we can't die to oursel a little bit here and this Le out of age that we have come on folks we can't do the simple things that God asked us to do because we've got our s in mind too much well it isn't what I want to do huh I want to do this and I want to do that what does God God wants you to do how many believe it's time to not think about ourselves so much and think about what he wants not about what you want but what he wants what does he want I want more of Jesus more and more and more I want more of Jesus than I ever had before but about how many we're going to get more of Christ as time goes on we're guaranteed to get more of him we're going to get so much of one of these days amen the very atams of this flesh will change called God's quickening part how many God know amen you were once dead in sins and trespasses has he quickened that means make alive how many beli amen when you're born again when you got the Holy Ghost eternal life means that you have been quickened made alive Lively [Applause] Souls the preacher will get a little loud that's all right I think it's time to sing a little louder I think it's time to praise a little louder praise a little deeper worshiping more it's time eternal life is Zoe zo is God's own life then not only that if it is God's own life then Peter says whereby are given unto us exceeding and great precious promises that by these ye may might be partakers of the divine nature how many believe we need a nature change we needed a nature change we still need a little bit more of a nature change amen our first nature was the works of the flesh adultery selfishness fornication selfishness uncleanness selfishness lasciviousness idolatry witchcraft hatred variance imulation wrath St kindness Meek what wait is that what it says is that works of the flesh I'm sorry I got to read this whole thing and ain't none of that in there heresies envyings murders drunkenness reings such like amen can I add a little more to it lovers of their s lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God truth Breakers hey highminded amen incontinent amen I tell you before as I have told you in the past that they which do such thing shall not inherit the kingdom of God Amen but the fruit of the spirit is love joy amen peace long suffering gentleness goodness and Faith amen partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through L how many know when you get eternal life you escape all of those attributes of the hatred murder vary jealousy oh Pride all of those things you escape all of that and you come up into a Heavenly atmosphere how many BL when you get the baptism the Holy Ghost when you get saved when you get eternal life you get caught up into a whole different atmosphere it's a Heavenly atmosphere I was thinking you know every one of us tomorrow we'll have to go back and toil anden we'll have our problem willever breakdown willever rainy days whatever lows and our highs and so forth but aren't you glad that sometimes on a Sunday morning Amen on Words tonight you can come and you leave all your cares at the door and forget about your worries and come up in Heavenly places and chist Jesus where the Holy Ghost can come down and baptize me people with the Holy Ghost you got shouting you got do you got W screaming and hard huh aren't you glad for a little Refuge once in a while just comes to mind but we can still sit there with all kinds of cares all kinds of worries cuz see being in that Heavenly atmosphere it's not about being in this building it's about the condition that you're in I mean know it shows you every time we come to the house of God we find out how free we really are how much praying that we've done how much of the Holy Ghost and how free we really are of we're still bound because you can come in here bound and you can leave as bound as what you came if not a little bit more miserable but because you found out how that you could be free and you really aren't is that okay just say what the Holy Ghost says something else just comes to mind brother bam says when you get into a church and there's fussing and bickering and fighting the Holy Ghost is just grieved way we've all been in services like that now haven't we that's right when there's bickering fussing you've got carnality in there if I got carnality up here you're sure going to find out no aren't you that's right if you got carnality out there I'm sure going to feel it the Holy Spirit feels it that's right and he's grieved away cuz you don't m in those places can I preach but says the when you lose your temper Holy Ghost leave but I kind of got a revelation on that not hope be attack but you be the good amen before you ever get mad the Holy Ghost is gone cuz how many knows you have to open yourself up and decide that you're going to get mad and the Holy Ghost don't get mad and if he if he's still in there and you got mad then that's him he leaves he has no part of it you look upon a woman who lost after her before you even look he's gone cuz he don't do that anything that you ought to do is contrary to where he G before you ever done ain't that right and then you got pray God come on back here come Lord I Repent aren't you glad for Grace amen amen praise the Lord amen all right we're going to go slow that all right we're going to go slow because I find out that amen Jesus is never in a hurry and so I don't want to be in hurry and I miss so much I miss so much we're not going and get in a hurry St John 6th chapter Jesus says whosoever eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood has everlasting life and I shall raise him up at the last day amen how many believe that another place Jesus said well let me just finish my story here he said and this is the Father's will which has sent me that of all that he hath given me I should lose nothing but should raise it up at the last day notice what he said the will of the father that sent me is that everybody that believes on me I will lose nothing but I will raise him up at the last day let me believe that now listen to this brother bam speaking and possessing all things because right on the next page of St John there he talks about and I think that he said he called it Eternal but Braham called it everlasting life maybe he did here too but he says whosoever eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life and I will raise him up at the last day for my flesh is meat indeed and my blood is drink indeed he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and I in him amen praise the Lord as the living father has sent me and I live by the father so he that eateth me he shall also live by me and this is that bread which came down from heaven not as your father should eat men and are dead but he that eateth of this bread shall live forever I mean the primary purpose of Christ coming it wasn't just to heal you hello it was to give you eternal life eternal life how many believe this what we're doing this morning what we're doing this morning being in church can't really be overemphasized how many believes that if you'll believe the word of God as it comes forth you can actually get eternal life and never have an end I'm gonna say something there's two two people I look watched on YouTube talking about their experience about going beyond the curtain of time I thought about playing it might yet you know and and you know whether it's really true or not I don't know but the one thing I know is that whatever it came out out of there they promoted Sinners repenting and turning to the Lord Jesus Christ so it had the right effect but in both of their scenarios he said when they were gone beyond the curtain of time one was one one one had uh what was it I'm not sure if it was a heart attack and the other one had de seizure but the heart attack man he talked about how that in the little period of time that he was there like 2,000 Souls I believe amen uh something in that on that order uh went into the regions of the Lost he seen that many going into the regions of the lost and then he's seen so many maybe 50 or something 2% I think it was that was going over into glory and you know both one thing that both of them said and I don't believe that they were joined together at all but the one thing that they said that caught my attention is he said most of the people that were in Hell thought they were going to heaven they thought they were right huh isn't that what the prophet of God said on that day going to be a lot of disappointments lot of disappointments how many knows you can't take a chance on your soul you make sure that you're sure that you're sure that your soul is right and ready to go amen how many will do that Lord help me to make sure I don't want to be deceived a tree is known by its fruit Ain that right and if we have the fruits of that flesh manifesting yet I'm not saying saying that you're not saved but I'm saying that you need to die some more to yourself amen now notice but B I'm speaking here did you ever think of what you were here for like I said going slow what are you doing going to school for children what are you working for Dad what you get up mother of a morning and get the kiddies to school wash their faces and make the back beds and cook and do it all he says come in and War out that night and the next day start the same thing what do do it for what do you labor and slave that and everything coming at night we're in one of the kids get sick and you walk the floor pray and cry struggle and they get well and then go and then back and then you do it again and every Sunday wash their faces and get them to church amen and well what's it all about what uh he here for is that all there is to it m that it be miserable knowing you got to go some anywhere anyhow see what's it all about oh brother it's an examination time it's an opportunity time how many believe that we believe that we are preaching the final message we are the mouthpiece of almighty God if that's true at evening night Tabernacle and I be a man of God the thing that I say heed to him it can change your soul it can save your life this is your opportunity today and this tap would be played on the day of judgment amen that this was your opportunity what did you with iten if your B's lit or cold and lukewarm this morning I tell you in the name of the lord it's time for you to get cuz this will be played back and you'll hear it in hell oh did you hear your pastor tell you you better quit your little Warmness you better get hot for God you better count the cost if you g the whole wall Lose Yourself it won't be worth a Time [Music] it's sincere you better get right you better make sure you better count the cost are you willing to really die to yourself that's one of the main things that Jesus ever said when he ever spoke about following him if you're willing to die to yourself cuz he knew the struggle we would have he knew that this flesh would be present Paul knew this flesh would be present amen and if you don't feed the right dog it'll overtake but if you're living and this you're born by the Holy Ghost living by the Holy Ghost amen it brings his body into subjection amen it's more powerful than the flesh it's more powerful than the lust of the Flesh and you're not bound to that oh if you're bound by the spirit and if you're living in the spirit amen therefore I say walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh Jesus knew the struggle we would have shut in with God in a secret place amen another thing about eternal life is it shuts you in it helps you escape the corruption that is in the flesh that is in the world escape it Escape that lay out of sea wo how many glad to be escaped from Leia you're glad to be escaped from lukewarmness you're hot Glory I would you were cold or hot amen how many's glad to be hot hot to God so out to [Applause] God that's why you're one or the other or the other you're one of three sounds different you're either cold or you're hot or you're lukewarm unfortunately the lukewarm and the cold go to the same place amen so don't think by being well I'm a pretty good church member I pay my tithe I come to church I raise my hand and you know that's good every good that you do that's good is good but make sure your soul is saved and filled with the Holy Ghost amen praise the Lord my it's an examination time it's an opportunity time an opportunity to accept this oh my souls in prison now remember when he preached that he said it couldn't be finished is it over is it is it too late I don't know but one of these days the man the preachers will preach to the complete lost the altar filed he thought it could be over with already what would you do your Prophet say today who thought it would happen in 1977 here we are 1977 and here we are 2024 oh I was thinking yesterday we aren't even to be here anymore hardly how late is it getting it's getting bitterly late I don't have my phone on me but end of message communion I listened to his last took a pcture of it I'll just quote it the best I can he said the world is getting into such a condition anymore if we go much longer the whole world will be completely he said if the world will be an insane Institute I believe that's the way he put it and I thought he last message upon the face of the Earth he says watch whole world go insane boy I wish I could read that quote on the national television wouldn't you the whole world will go completely insane and I'd say and we're here you people are insane and you need God I won't tell them their condition unless I give him a little way out ain't that right because I'm GNA believe that there's a way out amen you can still accept the Lord Jesus Christ as long as he's on that mediator mediator Throne as long as he's there you can come but there'll come a time when people will want to come how many believe when the tribulation period is and me they'll want to come brother B said they'll come to the altar pray and seek God and there won't be any God to be had this is the hour this is the time to repent this is the time to die to yourself to give your life to God even right after that scripture I read about amen if you gain the whole world he that is ashamed of me and of my words I'll be ashamed of him amen you ashamed of Jesus now and confess him and give you life to God when you come down to the Altar and tribulation period he'll turn this I'm ashamed of you I gave you the opportunity I stretched my hand out and I stretched my hand out you know men regard it now your Calamity comes I will laugh at you don't ask me to explain God he said he'll laugh at your calamity when your Calamity cometh at desolation I will laugh cuz when I stretch out my hand you would not you would not have my reproof you would none of my rebuke you would none of my chastisement and as many as I love I rebuke and Chase and how many please I feel the love of God coming forth from the pulpit this morning if it chastise us rebuke us that God's love to you cuz we need it I need it yeah I'm prone to be a selfish person how many's prone to be a selfish person God bless the rest of you God bless you we're prone to be selfish maybe you so selfish you didn't want to admit you were selfish and didn't want to raise that hand got a little discernment going on here I'm not ashamed to confess I'm A Low Down R Center this old man is but I'm getting this old man to die I want this old man to be done I want him to die amen only first step to getting anything from God is to repent to confess your sins amen God is faithful and just to forgive you of your sins amen and to cleanse you from all unrighteousness amen the opportunity to accept this tell me something to take its place tell me something that'll take the place of the baptism of the Holy Ghost the the eternal life to have eternal life what take what would take the place folks I'm here to tell you you don't have to wait to get you don't have to wait to get to heaven to live eternally you don't have to wait to get to heaven to have eternal life thank you Lord how many believe we have eternal life now it's arrived it has arrived Ephesians the first chapter it talked about the earnest of our Salvation how manyan these the Holy Ghost is the earnest of our Salvation that's right we got the down payment we got a portion of the money we got a portion of God and the only way that you'll ever have a portion of God is when you was way back in the mind of God before the first Stardust was ever created Eternal never had a beginning and it never has an End Amen all right I'mma hold off there let me see I'm hold off on that one and go to this one I'm on listen as I said last evening God has alloted that his scripture from the beginning before there was any time he was the Eternal he was eternal the Eternal one these things that's happening now are only the attributes of God thinking I'm thinking it was communion he says he talked he was talking to a lady or a young girl the way she was dressed and where he was s and all of that he says God knew that before there was one star usus created how about us this evening or this afternoon it's afternoon how many beli he knew where you'd he knew what you dress what you'd wear I'm funny I'm funny whenever I go to getting my tie together and my shirt and this that or the other I Lord what did you see me wearing I even ask God what do you want me to wear today huh what you what do you see me wearing and I usually don't worry about it too much I'll grabbed me one and I said you know God God will take care of that I knows he knows exactly what every one of us would were where we would sit amen now Len the things that's happening right now how many believes he knew this would happen before it ever started you know what that gives me comforting to know that if he knows this and this was ordained of God your day tomorrow is planned of God your day next week your week next week is planned of God your months next month is planned of God your next year is planned of God 2024 he got it got it all mapped out wo and for you to think that you're in the center of his will with not a worry in the world we've got to get this fear and this scare away from the people of God brother man said if you've got eternal life then you always was oh my listen let me get to it do you think that's happening at first it was just a thought and then a word when a word is expressed then it's spoken how many knows and God's word can never be broken Heaven and Earth will pass away but his word shall not pass away I wanted to talk to you sometime on the solidity of God's word and how that the word of God solidifies you makes you solid how many's glad for that amen when a thought is expressed and spoken it happens the whole thing is God and holding himself in his attributes and then God being made material tangible could talk to speak with his whole church body Therefore your name was in his thinking that's how you have eternal life you can't have it no other way if you've got eternal life you always was we just can't quite grasp that I don't think our little fin M grabs it but I'll tell you what when I do just get a little glimpse of it causes me to want to jump flip do a back flip just kidding I'd break my neck if I tried something like that makes you feel like it yeah the thing that you always was but how was you always cuz you know you wasn't preexist istent you was only pre-existent according to prophet in the mind of God you're being however there's a certain portion of you as any thoughts isn't that right let me tell you something the only way that you did pre-exist the only way I'm sounding contradictory but the only way that you did preexist was that if you have the Holy Ghost a't that right you're part of that Holy Ghost that Holy Ghost never did begin and it is a portion of him you existed in his Spirit you are part of his Spirit you existed in him amen praise the Lord that's how you have eternal life anything that was eternal never did begin and cannot end so you were only in his thinking your name and so forth now notice he says you was in him there as it thought now you are a person and can fellowship with him like you was in your father at the beginning how many knows brother taught that if you your natural being down here your natural being I was in my father my father was in his father his father was in his father his father was in his father and back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back how far do you go you want me to tell you how far back you go I can take you back all the way to the first father because there was two fathers how many know there was two fathers there's two fathers to the children of the Earth today one mother she's to call the mother of all living that was Eve but two fathers one of them was Adam mam would what that old [Music] serpent huh not as Cain who was of that Wicked one Cain come from that Wicked one Jesus clearly people that don't believe in in the two fathers and the devil having children even Jesus said you're of your father the devil even Jesus came and plainly said the field the whole world is a field there's a good seed there's the tears and there's the wheat the children of go God are the children of the Kingdom the children of the wicked the tears are the children of the wicked one he came and told us told them serenty Glory how many know I'll tell you what people won't repent their daddy is King aren't you glad to repent fin thing he says therefore repent be zealous therefore and repent God's children repent of their sins amen great great great great friend all the way that back but guess what your lineage and my lineage amen of the spiritual go back before the first star dust was ever made when God was alone he dwelt by himself oh I can't wait to get into marriage Ephesians there talking about husbands loving their wives as Christ loved the church amen talking about the attributes of God and what he was and so forth what that eternal life and how he's by himself and the family ref reflects what he had in his mind and all of that amen amen nothing got off on my my thought now but eternal life before there was any Stardust before anything Brother Brad not just Adam amen not just to Adam I think somebody asked well brother said his Billy Paul ask him he says well when did God begin when did God begin doesn't he have to have a beginning he said brother BR says no he never never never never had a beginning so back there before the beginning before the beginning before way way back there you always was you was there you was there w doesn't that do something for you to think that you was there and when he come to Calvary and and he died on the cross you died with him you was with him you believed him when he spoke his word he they said to the Pharisees you my word has no place in you there for you're not my children but your God's word has a place in your heart therefore you are his children you were there when he preached you were there when he died you were there when he went to hell and you are there when he rose we are risen with Christ and if we risen we will rise and go to heaven be with him he'll never leave us nor forsake us aren't you glad for that there's your Eternal origin I believe we have an eternal origin way back that's right I don't know about you but I like stretching my brains a little I like to try brother Sean to think back that far can't do it brother Brad can't do it but I like to try it almost blows my fuse when I think where did God begin you see atheists and people that don't believe God just can't fathom in their mind that there could be more stars that he created out there than there is sand upon the face of the Earth isn't that right brother there's more stars than there is sand the sand dunes of Arizona and all of that there's more stars than there is that for God for a being to never have began they just they can't no I just can't believe there is such a being but I do how many I believe it I believe that and amen there was even people even religious people all the days of Miracles has passed they ain't nobody getting the baptism of the Holy Ghost can we say the church world was failing to believe even their faith was believing with was was swaying their faith was going down and then God had to bring a prophet amen and pre a message to same yesterday today and forever oh if I can shouted I want to preach this up sometime amen because sometime people don't want to hear amen about brother B this and brother B that I want you understand amen what more important the god of the three Hebrew children am me the god of Daniel are the god that did stuff today I want hear what God did it our day that he was the same did the very same things how many believe you still the same yesterday today and forever it's all Jesus it's not about brother Brandon it's about what Jesus did through that Prophet amen praise the [Applause] Lord my we was in his thinking amen if you were with him at the beginning amen then he goes to talking about then you was there at with him at Calvary if you're an American you was there at Guam you was there to suffer the shame of our civil war and all that amen but at any rate you were in your great great great grandfather and been but now amen they didn't my great great great man didn't had no clue now God knew but my great-grandfather in the natural he didn't know that I would come on the earth is that right even my mom and dad didn't know what kind of child it was going to be I wonder if he's going to be a redheaded little boy if he's going to be 4 foot six or S foot S I don't know is that right they don't know but God did know amen and amen after I come and after I was born then what happens then you could have Fellowship how many know that's what God has with you and I when you're born again when you're saved you come into Fellowship once she was just a thought now it's reality W one time I was quiet somewhere in a Jee but now I'm not quiet anymore now I praise God for delivering me for saving me let me try to close with my first thought on this subject and that is Grace amen the first thought of what eternal life has done for us What It produced amen because we want to talk about that n we want to talk about the divine nature Ephesians 2 I guess I didn't put a sticker in it Ephesians 2 um 8 Ephesians 2:8 I'm on 38 that doesn't look right 28 where in oh I'm on I go from three to one let's go to two 28 for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourself it is the gift of God we got a baptism to do yet don't we lord just reminded me brother Jason wants to be baptized this morning best decision ever made best let's give him a hands God bless you best decision you'll ever [Applause] make how many knows that Grace is probably the deepest subject that there is Grace for you're saved by grace not any of your Works through faith and that not yourself even that's a gift of God you talk about Amazing Grace how many knows that if you get saved it'll be by the grace of God if you're saved this morning and filled with the Holy Ghost it's by the grace of almighty God it ain't your choosing it was his choosing his choosing before the foundation of the world that he was going to give you life all the father has given me will come to me that's Grace it's amazing and that's why we're going to sing through the ceaseless ages Amazing Grace how sweet this sound that saved a richet like me I once was lost but now I'm found I was blind but now I see how was sad but now I'm glad am me I sorrow but now I have joy unspeakable and full of Glory I Was Defeated now I'm Victorious everything is bad Grace amen Grace God's choosing his election how many's glad for his grace it was grace that brought you safe thus far it's Grace that speaks to you through the word of God it's Mercy it's love amen it's Grace that made you discontent with the world that made drugs not enough oh I like what brother bam says I'll tell you right now
