times amen and having brother Joe up that'll be all for the music thank you all very much amen praise the Lord amen am let's can remember Adriana amen that they'll figure out just what's going on with her rash amen and amen and the Lord will just touch her and take that away amen how many believes that we have a God that heals all of our sicknesses and diseases amen we're very grateful for that amen so let's just bow our heads Lord Jesus we come before you father tonight once again assembling ourselves again according to your word Lord and to your will father and Lord Jesus surrendering oursel to you Lord Jesus asking God that you'll just take the preeminence in everything that is said and done father Lord we ask God that Lord as I feel God you've laid something on my heart to speak tonight that you would just direct my thoughts and every word father to to people's hearts and their lives Lord Jesus that that we would go from here a better people than what we've come Lord better to serve you more submitted to you Lord and surrender to you we ask God you'll bless the meditation of our hearts reading of your word now in Jesus Christ oh and also Father for Adriana we ask God you would just wherever she is just now let your Holy Spirit sweep down and touch her body in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen amen all right my title you can pull that up if you want kind of a different title tonight amen what the world brings what Jesus brings and what you bring amen you've heard the sayings what do you bring to the table amen and so that's just kind of the thought the Lord laid on my heart is what do we bring to the table amen and uh I guess my my thought derive from Brother brandom's quote talking about he says well if you can't do anything but whistle whistle what do you bring bring something Ain that right bring something you know amen but you know I thought Lord have mercy brother GL and I think we can do a little better than that huh can anybody whistle can you whistle you can whistle right can you whistle go ahead all right we got some whistling going on Amen praising the Lord amen so God bless you tonight and so this all of this just kind of come from stemmed off of that amen amen thinking about what we bring amen and also amen so but first I want to amen uh we want to talk first about what the world brings amen what Jesus brings wow we could be on there for a couple of weeks couldn't we amen and then what you and I bring amen and I don't know how in the world I can fit all of that into one service but we'll just start amen and we're going to go slow because Jesus is never in a hurry amen and so we're just going to take it nice and slow and and see what the Lord will have and we'll go as far as we can and then we'll pick it up Sunday but it is good to see everybody out tonight amen God bless you amen one of the things that we bring amen amen and is that's a sacrifice amen this is part of the last part of what I want to say but we bring a sacrifice and when you get in your car when you get ready amen for church and you get on that road and when it's dark already you're bringing something amen you're bringing yourself amen how many knows it makes a big difference when you're here folks I don't know about you but if there was nobody here brother Brad I'd probably say well brother Brad you mean you're the only ones I guess we'll just you know go home and listen to a tape for something you know we'd be preaching the four walls but God bless you you brought something you did something amen God recognizes that amen all right so let's just uh start H by turning our bibles if you will to St John 10 St John 10 amen we for going to start with what the world brings what the World brings amen what basically we uh we know what the world brings is what the first Adam brought is that right what the first brought first Adam and Eve what they brought to us wasn't very nice amen wasn't very good very that wasn't very nice sin entered into the world amen amen now St John 10 and verse 10 the thief cometh not see he comes he brings something amen the devil brings something ain't that right the world brings something but for to steal and to kill and destroy I am come that you might have life and that you might have it more abundantly may God blessing bless this reading of the word you can be seated amen and we want to come back to that because that's going to be kind of where we come back to with when we talk about what Jesus brings amen I like that don't you Jesus right there in that verse and I wanted to go to that because I thought about what the world brings and that Jesus very clearly declared there that the enemy don't come but kill steal and destroy there ain't absolutely nothing good about what the devil brings what the enemy brings or what the world brings amen but what Jesus brings I come Jesus said I come what I bring is that you might have life and that you might have it AB more abundantly amen now in order to really understand a little bit about what the world gives what the world brings we want to go back in time so to speak and way back into the Old Testament to the smartest man ever lived right how many knows who that was Solomon he was given wisdom like you ain't never heard amen great wisdom smart man how many knows he was that it was a time I think if I'm not wrong it was kind of a a golden age for Israel is that right no Wars and all of those things it was a golden age if I'm not wrong uh he talked about a greater than Solomon is here he's talking about how that during the time of the reign of Solomon that everybody embrace the gift that got it brought to them and because they embraced that they were free from troubles and my they prospered like never before Solomon the richest man you can ever imagine I guess he was very very rich amen he had a lot of stuff and so we want to look at what Solomon said about the world what it brings amen Solomon if you want to go to Ecclesiastes 1 Ecclesiastes one the words of the preacher the son of David King in Jerusalem wow and here he starts vanity of vanities saith the preacher vanity vanities all is Vanity wow isn't there something good here do you have to say all all everything amen now let's bring it to our present age what did our Prophet Malachi 4 say this world was like the very best that this world is is a smoldering stinking dump how many I want to get this to you that the world that you and I are living in it is a terrible place ain't much good about this world why do you think the preacher says if you love the world or the things of the world you you got the wrong affection your affection is in the wrong place let's look at some things that uh cause Solomon to say this about the world and it's all negative there's not a lot of positive things at all that Solomon talked about this world and why the reason we want to look at the reason why that he said everything's vanity and and so forth and uh so he says all is Vanity what prophet hath a man of all his labor which he taketh Under the Sun what prophet is it what do you end up with what good is it all amen one gener generation passes away another generation cometh amen but the Earth abideth forever he talks about the sun the Sun Also arises and the sun goes down and hateth to the place where he arose amen so he talks about the sun that's all vanity hey it was nice sunshine today but where is it it's gone so what good is it huh what good is life one generation comes and off you go the next Generation take place vanity oh let me see here I'm just going to take my time talks about Generations talks about the very son going back to its place and I wrote down here in my Bible you see because we love sunshine how many love sunshine hey I ain't the shame I ain't a shame to say when I was down in Florida I sat back in a chair and I just basp in the sun I said this nice I like this you know that's right enjoy the sun nice warm sunshine while y'all were freezing up here but you guess what where's it at that come back to the cold that's right and the sun comes up and he goes you see when we we're longing for the sun to shine but constantly right that's why they even had an inspiration of a song says the sun will never go down in that City the sun it will never go down I mean there going to be no setting Sun's over there it'll shine Eternal bright and fair that's what we long for is that Eternal son Paul in First Corinthians I believe it is or second Corinthians he said it this way while we look not at the things which are seen but at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are Eternal so everything that you say is temporary two words one is mortality and the other one is temporary it's temporal I am looking for something Eternal aren't you amen amen all right so let's look at that and this is part of the reason that I believe that the great Solomon said what he said in this book all right the wind goeth towards the South and turneth about unto the north it whth about Contin continuously and the wind returneth again according to his circuit all right let me go on down here in verse eight All Things Are full of Labor man cannot utter it the eye is not satisfied with seeing nor the ear filled with hearing amen I got I want to do a lot of reading we'll come back to that the thing which has been it is that which shall be and that which is done is that which shall be done and there is no new thing under the sun is there anything whereof it may be said see this is new it hath been already of old time which was before us Amen brother Brandon when he was preaching on Jezebel religion he says you know you think you're all modern with your makeup and paint and stuff he said no that's his oldfashioned stuff amen Jezebel did it way back in in the old days that's oldfashioned that isn't new stuff that's you know modern no that's way back then look where it comes from amen there's no remembrance of the former things neither shall there be any remembrance of the things that are to come with those that shall come Hereafter in other words you think about your great great grandfather how many remembers your great great grandfather and his brothers and his sisters their nieces and their nephews none of us remember any of it why and we don't like that I don't know about you but I want a family that we remember forever I mean looking forward to that there won't be no passing and no go they're gone you think oh people will remember me now if you get lucky they might write you into history books huh and some of them will look at you like Abraham lincol George Washington and some of those but all the rest of aren't great enough to make it into the history books we just go to the grave and we get forgotten but aren't you glad that when God makes up his jewels he'll remember he puts our names down and he'll remember us and he'll call and we'll answer praise the Lord amen I'm glad for that amen so there's no more you know it it he didn't like that I don't like that either praise the Lord say I the preacher was King over Israel in Jerusalem and I gave my heart to seek and to search out by wisdom concerning all things that are done under the sun this sore travail ha God given Unto the Sons of men to be exercised thereby amen that's right how many know life is full of Trials a man that is born of a woman is a few days and full of trouble amen that's what this life is full of trouble s travail I have seen all the works that are done under the sun and behold all is Vanity and vexation of spirit Verse 18 he says for in much wisdom is much grief and he that increases knowledge increases sorrow the more you really got to thinking about it and knowing how things really are the more sadder it makes you is that right amen wow that's this world the world that we live in it it's a complete compl disappointment amen complete disappointment you see we brought nothing into this world and will certainly not carry anything out you can put all the gold in there you want to if you have any ain't going to do you bit of good all right amen but we'll get to Jesus in a little bit is that all right amen Hallelujah all right so the smarter you get the more grief you add to yourself no wonder uh Solomon he was a very very smart man he had gotten a lot of wisdom a whole lot of understanding I think he understood it pretty good that it's really when you add it all up it's all a bunch of vanity it means nothing let's look at what he did he said here I sought in my heart chapter 2 and verse three and I sought in my heart to give myself unto wine yet acquainted Mine Heart with wisdom and to lay hold on Folly till I might see what was that good for the sons of men which they should do Under This Heaven all the days of their life I made me great works of builted me houses I planted me Vineyards I made me Gardens and Orchards and planted trees in them of all kinds of fruits I made me pools of water he had a big old swimming pool he had a big Archard he had the best fruit oranges and tangerines and no doubt all of those good things you know num n water wood that bringeth forth trees I got me servants and maidens had servants born in my house also had great possessions of Great and Small cattle above all that were in Jerusalem before me it was very rich I gathered me also silver and gold and peculiar Treasures of the king and of the Providence provinces I got me men singers and women singers and the Delights of the sons of men as musical instruments that of All Sorts some man we get to enjoy music how many loves music sometimes music likes life a little bit better amen amen we Rejoice sure he did amen instruments and that of All Sorts so I was great and increased more and more that were before me in Jerusalem also my wisdom remained with me and whatsoever my eyes desired I kept not from them I withheld not my heart from any joy for my heart rejoice in all my labors and this is my portion of all my labor and then I looked upon all the works that my hands had wrought and all the labor that I had labored to do and behold man it was nice what a great thing listen to what he said said and behold all was vanity and vexation of spirit now how many know vexation that's kind of when you really feel bad and there was no Prophet under the sun no Prophet Under the Sun amen so he had Rich he was rich how many knows it's good to be rich it's nice to be rich nice to have stuff but it don't bring you Joy it ain't got nothing to do with giving you satisfaction if it was we wouldn't have to have Trump up in there I don't you know I didn't realize he was worth that many billions hello billions upon billions of dollars I can't even think of that much hello but that wasn't that that didn't satisfy him he wants to do something for something maybe make a name maybe be part of History he will be now amen the greatest back comeback story ever told I believe in the United States of America when they did things unprecedent and prosecuted him they've never done that to another Pro president tried to put him in jail and everything no by the way I'm going to go ahead and say that I'm counting to days Brother Brad I'm counting to days we got about five left right and then we're going to have a new president Hallelujah I'm looking forward to something besides this that's for sure that has been a nightmare amen but what did he say solom said all of these things I had it all I all he realized it still not satisfactory amen praise the Lord Brother baham says you know in this country there's so many people that's dissatisfied people it's amazing when you get around and find so much dissatisfaction people hardly know what to do amen some of them get so Disturbed to go down at the drugstore and purchase to themselves Arsenic and amen they'll go in the car and uh put carbon monoxide and kill themselves isn't that right plunge themselves to death in the river jumping off actually blow their brains out and everything they're just unsatisfied hospitals are full of unsatisfied people the insane institutions are overrun dissatisfied they don't know what to do there seems to be something they're reaching after but they just never came come to it I hope I'm talking to a bunch of people that have come amen and have that satisfaction down in their heart the very thing that Solomon couldn't get you and I have tonight woo cuz I'm here to tell you this world will make you frown this world will make you sad it'll drag you down it'll bring you depression and anxiety and amen everything it ain't nothing this world will give you nothing good I was thinking on the way I said man I'll tell you what this world will give you sickness amen it'll give you heartaches it'll give you disappointments it'll make you sick it'll kill you and then it'll cover you up bury you in some hole that's what this world will give you that's what it brings amen amen see folks I like it because when you think about it what he's saying what he's seeing he has all of that but he realized it all fades away It's All Temporary I believe in your heart and in my heart there's a desire for things that are Eternal that's why when brother Brandon went beyond the curtain of time what did he say he says man over there is the most glorious place there is no more tomorrow there's no yesterday there's no pretty good days and pretty bad days no it's all good and it's all now it's all forever it's Eternal over there amen okay chapter 2 let me see another reason want to look at another reason why he really didn't like this world this world is not my home I'm just passing through my treasures are laid up somewhere beyond the blue amen we are so out of place here we are so out of place we're so out of place in this body I don't know this may be some Side Road here but so out of place this is just not our home this body is not my home brother Glenn on the inside when I got born again there was a man started to grow a't that right that's the the real me is on the inside and then in the inside it loves the things that are holy and righteous and pure and joy and happiness and everything else but the outside man we all know the older you get the easier it is to become blue that's right to be sad and blue because this world will give you a lot to be blue about old age having to put these on every time huh feebleness anyway I guess we used to not talk too much about going to the gym or working out but folks I'm here to tell you if I quit working out or doing something folks I feel like you might as well cover me up you I still got to run out that driveway a little bit just to get my blood pumping just to halfway feel good amen but anyway all right where was we talking about Solomon and something else I got a couple more things I want to cover with Solomon before we go on I'm going to jump to jump to chapter 3 because I mentioned a minute ago how that the one thing that Solomon realized that we are and that is in time he said to everything there is a season and a time for every purpose Under the Sun there's a time for you to be born there's a time for you to die there's a time for you to plant and a time to pluck up that which is planted A Time to Kill a time to heal a time to break down and a time to build up I don't know about you but man everything you do falls apart it ends up having to be torn down what a world that right that's why we're looking for to get out of time amen a time to weep and a time to laugh you might laugh but it won't be long and you lose a loved one or something will happen and you'll cry like a baby you might have joy unspeakable and jump up like I do sometimes but you're going to be down again you're going to be sad because you're in this world that's how it is you got your UPS you got your Downs amen you got your ends you got your what uh ins and your outs got your times that you can talk good and times that you can't times that you can remember your words and times you don't know what you're saying next a time to weep and a time to laugh time to mourn and a time to dance that's right time to Cast Away stones and a time to gather Stones what a waste of time huh that's right a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing a time to get and a time to lose a time to keep and a time to Cast Away time to Ren and a time to swow time to keep silent and a time to speak a time to love and a time to hate a time of war and a time of Peace oh we have peace time well enjoy it it ain't going to be long we're going to have War again so what what's the use I think that's the way Solomon felt look at it what's the use what profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he had labored I have seen the travail which God has given to the sons of men to be exercised thereby I like that my goodness he didn't say I seen the great niceness that God has given everybody to living no he says he I seen the travail that he has given the sons of men to live in and to have to be exercised by that's right how many know we're put in here you're here amen a lot of people don't want to be here boom jump off a bridge do all kind they don't want to be here in this awful world even brother brandham said if I wasn't a Christian I'd probably be a suicide case how many knows the the world was rough on brother Brandon it was so rough on the prophet of God he did put a gun to his head he experienced so much sorrow Oh he had a great time of Joy telling his life story and how he met his wife and they had a little baby right time of happiness but then he disobeyed huh didn't do what he was supposed to do and he enjoy he not enjoyed he experienced sorrow like you could not imagine amen not just to take his wife the love of his life amen something special about that woman that you marry at a young age or that man that you marri at a young age that pure love that you got and God took that from him not only that but little Sharon rose with her crossed eyes and me he prayed says she didn't do it punish me but a black sheet came in front of him God wouldn't answer him and he knew sorrow he knew what these things were the travail amen that God has given the sons of men to be exercised thereby Amen Let me see therefore listen for there is no remembrance of the the wise more than that of the fool forever seeing that which is now is in the days to come shall all be forgotten and how dieth the wise man as the fool therefore I hated life I hated life because the work that is brought under the son is Grievous unto me for all his vanity and vexation of spirit amen there is nothing but death all around brother BR says I'm a dying man talking to a dying people amen when somebody gets cancer or gets something terminal say hey they're going to die boy shakes his up and oh my my my but you don't realize that that's each and every one of us time terries you're going to die we're all dying slowly but surely brother brandom said after about 20 23 years years old you're dying amen amen I hope I haven't got you too depressed oh if I don't if I don't get at least on the other half we're going to go home say oh we don't ever have a Wednesday night service like that again that is depressing woo Glory Hallelujah he said I hated life that's what he said yeah I hated all my labor which I had taken under the sun because I should leave it unto another man that shall be after me amen so you might work and you might get all of this but guess what you're still going to take your Changers shirt and your clothes that's the only thing you taken with you everything else gets left how many believes a real believer out say look and I'm looking for something that I can build a house I can build and another not inhabit I'm going to plant a Vineyard amen and I'm going to eat the fruit of that of how many knows that's what we're going into the Millennium to do we're going to live a thousand years we'll plant and all kinds of things that we'll do amen that's what we're longing for not to do all this labor just to give it to somebody else amen cuz who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool yet shall he have rule over all my labor wherein I labored and where and I have showed myself wise Under the Sun this also is Vanity it ain't right how manyan know this world ain't right there's a lot of things that ain't right but Jesus come to make it right doesn't he he is coming to make it all right he's making all the wrongs right he's straightening it all out it's all vanity right now amen amen another reason another reason that he uh thought that this world was a terrible place that it brings terrible things all right I said in my heart God shall judge the righteous this is in chapter 3: 18 I said in my heart concerning the estate of the sons of men that God May might manifest them and they might see that they themselves are beasts amen wow didn't brother Braham say that somebody ain't with filled with the Holy Ghost you're nothing but a brute beast that's right without the Holy Ghost you're just a The Brute Beast my for that which bealth the sons of men befalleth beasts even one thing befalleth them as the one dieth so dieth the other yay they all have one breath so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast for all is Vanity in other words he's saying you know why can't we as humans die a little bit different than what animals do you think was a highest species but folks how many knows I won't forget even over at brother Billy's lers I think right there remember that big tanker turned over caught fire and a man burnt alive screaming and horrible death we see the deer hit isin't that right they get hit humans get hit talk about look at the war look at the Ukraine war hundreds of thousands of people killed ruthless whether it's uh Russia or or Ukraine and they show you these videos of those little robots whatever you call them flying across there and Russian soldiers scrambling trying to get under something and basically begging for their lives and they shoot them ruthless beasts horrible amen we die like rats that's right humans die like rats amen so man had no preeminence above the Beast for all his vanity all go to one place all are of the dust and all return to the Dust just amen wherefore I perceive that there is nothing better than that a man should rejoice in his own works for that is his portion for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him different places really when it comes to this world the best you can do is enjoy the works of your hand enjoy the food enjoy life eat and drink and be merry for tomorrow you die it's the best that this world offers and how many knows that's really all the majority of the people out there do they're just worried about their finances and uh having a good life and so forth It's all they're really concerned about they're not concerned about their soul not concerned about where they're going to go after this you could have communism you could have what those people want those leftists want having everything in common all get all the money from the rich and so forth they still wouldn't be happy people aren't happy with Communism people aren't happy with with with freedom democracy and so forth there's no satisfaction seems like there's no contentment there's no fulfillment and in the Old Testament that's how it was amen my my my but I like this they lacked in the Old Testament those people had no Comfort they had no peace they had no joy they didn't have the Holy Ghost and think about it everything about the devil everything is death sickness if the devil can put anything on you he'll put cancer on you he'll put high blood pressure on you he'll put sugar on you anything to try to destroy you kill you you'll try to get between husbands and wives and arguments and fusses and St come to church and try to cause curses and St and Def that's the devil kill steal destroy that's what the devil does amen that's what he brings that's what the world brings but what does Jesus bring he come that you might have life and that more abundantly not just a natural life but something on the inside he came to take you from mortality to immortality amen cuz in immortality it is just temporary Amen brother brah said it's not even really real right he says only the things that you can't see are Eternal those things are real this is all just passing away Like This Moment's passing away an hour from now will probably be well I don't know back home I guess by around 9:00 we're all in this time but I don't know about you but when I get in the presence well not just well it's a little more so here but cuz we live in the presence of God wherever we are ain't that right man but over there but says it's No Tomorrow there's no time you're just there you have arrived you're in the presence of almighty God you're in that Perfection cuz you're in the presence of God praise be to God all right so in the midst of this in the midst of this darkness in the midst of what the world brings and devil brings and all this sorrow this sadness this sickness depression in the middle of it all God comes and I think of his brother Joe read that uh yeah he read it and I had read it about a week or so before we are troubled in this world we're troubled on every side we're distressed we're perplexed we're pro persecuted we're cast down but in the midst of all of that how many know you can still have what Jesus brings you can have joy unspeakable and full of Glory you can have peace that passes understanding down in your heart you can have the wonderful love of my Blessed Redeemer way down in the depths of your heart you can have the love of God overflowing joy unspeakable how many glad for that in the midst of the world of Darkness Jesus is the light in our day in our life he brings Joy he brings oh peace my peace give I unto you not the way that the world gives my joy I give to you and I will come to you I'll send the comforter he will bring Comfort To You Paul said amen he says I have learned that whatever state I am to be there with to be content I have learned he said whatever state he was it doesn't matter you have Christ on the inside he had contentment a Believer has contentment a Believer has satisfaction amen we eat amen he had all the fruit he had all of those things that he had the fruit trees and everything everything you can imagine but it never satisfied but you got food we got food that's what we come on Wednesday night amen because we come to eat a little more of this food he says you eat this food and you'll never hunger again you drink this water that I've got for you that I bring and you'll never thirst again there's something about being satisfied content amen we need more of it times and seasons the eye is not satisfied with seeing nor the ear filled with hearing I thought the mouth is never satisfied with eating that right oh my maybe you go to a restaurant you spend 50 bucks on the best biggest ribeye they got sweet potatoes and whatever else and you eat that you just enjoy that and at the end of it can I bring you some ice cream and no ma'am I couldn't put more in here if I cried huh no you're completely full but guess what you're still not full you'll never be full as long as you live you'll be hungry again it ain't but a few more short hours boy I got to go eat again is that right same way with drinking you got to go drink again you think you got rested but no you're tired again you got to rest again everything's a repeat a repeat a repeat and we get tired of that I mean it's over there we won't do that we won't have to have all that amen like the sun am me we enjoy the sun then it's gone enjoy one day and then he gone see even the days repeat but it says on that song says amen that uh how does that song Go amen that day shall be one Eternal day bright and bright and fair a't that right one Eternal day just going to be one day eternity how many's looking forward to it amen praise be to God hallelujah amen we eat food we get hungry Again drink we get thirsty again just just never any satisfaction in this world Amen praise the Lord he came to bring hope in a hopeless World a sinking ship and he gives us a Lifeboat that's what Jesus does to a Dying World he gives his life he came that we might have life more abundantly not just your normal life amen joy unspeakable in a world of Sorrow he gives us joy unspeakable and what is it how many believes that that's not just some Joy that's not just some peace that's not just some love that's the very essence of God it's the joy that God has it's the peace that God has cuz it's the holy ghost in your heart he gives you of himself and that makes life worthwhile you see Because He Lives I Can Face tomorrow because he lives amen all fear is gone praise be to God how many's glad for that all fear is gone see these things Jesus said have I spoken unto you being yet present with you but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will sent in my name how many's glad that God has sent us a little Comfort Solomon could never be comforted he could never be satisfied could never be happy but when Jesus comes let him come in your life a sinner Let Jesus come into your life amen could preach a whole message on then Jesus came amen then Jesus came and made all the difference in the world doesn't it how how many this morning I mean this evening said boy I'll tell you what when Jesus Come into my heart it made the whole world my world completely different it made a difference for everybody that he met in the Bible Legion all of them when he touched them here we are in Leia way back in the end of the world when Jesus comes and touches his life touches your life makes all the difference in the world praise be to God he brings peace he brings love kindness in a very unkind world he brings gentleness in the very rough world he brings forgiveness in the very sinful world he brings holiness in a very corrupt world Amen that's what Jesus brings amen all right we're going to stop there on that let's go to the last one what do we bring what we bring amen what we bring Malachi 1 Malachi 1 I hope that clock is right Malachi 1 a son honth his father and a servant his master if I then be a father where is M honor and if I be a master where is my fear sayith the lord of hosts unto you o priests that that despise my name and you say wherein have we despised thy name ye offered polluted bread upon mine Altar and you say wherein have we polluted thee in that ye say the table of the Lord is contemptible and if you offer a blind for sacrifice is it not evil and if you offer the lame and the sick is it not evil offer it now unto thy governor and see if he's very happy with you amen so what do we bring first of all we know that when we come before mighty God we have nothing to bring there's no good in us we can't claim any self-righteousness a lot of people will try to quit this and try to quit that before coming to the Lord no you need to come to the Lord so he'll help you quit that how many believes that when you come to Christ he says you've got to be willing to give all you got to lose your life and you'll preserve your life don't come have hazard don't come offering God some lame or blind offering don't give him second best he wants the best amen that's right amen you got to come bring your filthy rags and surrender your life to him how many believe there nothing like a surrendered life to almighty God and we think we're surrendered but listen to what brother baham says science can only climb so so far then it has to drop off see we've got untapped resources there's never been touched of power unlimited of God that we ought to be moving into and we're living million miles below our privileges tonight of privilege of Christians of to be enjoying I feel ashamed of myself when I look out there and see the institutions when he looked at himself can you imagine when brother brandham was coming to Christ and when he seed what he really looked like he was ashamed of himself and I think anybody that's really filled with the Holy Ghost realize hey you know maybe I'm not a surrendered is what I could be maybe not having given him to Full Sacrifice like I should like he deserves folks I'm here to tell you if you're going to get into the water just dive all the way in all the way in under that is the way to be be a Christian listen to what he says see the institutions the sickness the troubles that's going on right now our church ought to be walking the street Healing The Sick raising the dead casting out Devils doing signs and wonders making the whole real whole world realize that Jesus Lives that's what needs to be done so that's kind of the ambition to goal where we want to be is where God wants us to be at doing something for God Amen I don't know if you know that song brother Joshua I give myself away I give myself away so you can use me amen when you come you got to give yourself all you can do is give yourself and now when you do when you finally give yourself when we as we have no doubt we've given oursel to God Sunday uh Sunday rededicate ourselves saying we choose God we choose life we choose chose a live rededication once he does that and then he FS you then you begin to do something for God bring an offering to him be of some value bring something to the table amen what good are you what good am I for the Lord amen we have to ask ourselves that question tonight what do we bring and I won't go through it I don't have time to but I wanted to go over to uh I'm going to touch a couple scriptures anyway when Paul talked about how that each member of the body has been given a different gift God gives you something he places you in the body ain't that right and God's going to use that to do something for him see he he says there are diversities different ministrations but the same Lord he says and there are diversities of operations but the same God which worketh all in all but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all how many knows God loves for us to be fruit bearers he loves for us to be profitable how many wants to be a profitable Christian we don't want to serve the Lord in vain we want to give something back say God used this even he said he gives his certain servants he gives them a talent or 10 talents and so forth amen they go and win some more they multiply with it God loves when you do that amen and each one of us according to Paul have been given a gift amen of some sort we don't always KN know just what but um see God has said something in the church Apostles prophets thirdly teachers after that Miracles Gifts of healing helps governments diversities of tongues and so forth all these different things another way that Paul explained it was for as the body is one and ha one member and all members of that body being many are one body amen for by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body whether we be Jews or Gentiles fond or free for the body is not one member but any and many so he's saying it's like our body here and I was listening to a tape and brother Bram was talking about he says you know how the he was saying you you businessmen he said you know if you want a preacher call a preacher don't be go into pulpit and try to do be something that you're not God has called you to do a certain thing and then he goes to talking about all the different ones he says man people get in trouble when they try and impersonate and he made a statement he says be what God has made you and abide in the place that God has blessed you amen Bel s or Uzziah I believe it was remember he got out of his place he was the king a great man he thought he could go burn incense and 40 preachers said no that God it because he got Pride lifted up amen Amen in other words whatever God is maor a lot of times in the lot of times in the group or whatever everybody has an idea this that or the other but Abraham says a lot of times everybody wants to be a chief too many chiefs and not enough Indians amen and so you got to watch that now I want to say this as your pastor man if God blesses you and something stay in it keep doing whatever God is blessing you to do amen cuz if you don't boy you can sure find a lot of trouble amen and I'll tell you what I sometimes think of us and more how little I've done how little I've done and yet I say Lord I've done what I felt you've called me to do amen all right now so I've got here what do we bring well like when we come to church what do you bring what do you bring when you come to church David says I will enter his gates with Thanksgiving in our in my heart I will enter his courts with praise amen we come to church and we bring something with us that's right how many knows it's supposed to be a link of Fire amen you're supposed to be prayed up and bring your lick of fire but I wonder sometimes we don't have a little chunk of ice we bring maybe a block of ice I got wrote down here be careful that you ain't bringing icebergs bring a leak of fire bring a Hallelujah bring a praise the Lord bring come into church and be a benefit I mean that's what the whole five-fold Ministries is for the edifying of the body of Christ Christ and everybody in the church has a place has something that God calls you to do whatever that is do it heartedly as unto the Lord let me say that that's what we bring we bring a surrendered self and whatever it is that you can do amen I'm going before I close I'm going to you know and brother Braham says well do I have that quote somewhere yes brother BR says now I come home just a little for a little rest I lost 20 pounds in this last meeting and brother Mercer and brother gold was up there a while ago and they said brother bandam I just noticed what you do you put your whole heart into it that's said that's the only way you can do the right kind of a job for the Lord is to put everything that you've got right in the Forefront for Christ all your strength all your soul all your heart all your mind and everything you got how believe that when we come to bring an offering to God he deserves the very best that we have not something lame amen amen listen so all your mind all that you got when you're doing something he says do it right or don't do it at all just leave it alone if you ain't if you're going to be a Christian put everything you got into Christ amen how many knows the devil do anything to keep you out of church whatever it is that keeps you out of church remember that's the devil amen I know Sister Hannah and Audrey are in here just say under hey you know we're not going to let the devil keep us out amen sometimes we don't feel like it we go any anyway sometimes if you're going to be a Christian put everything that you've got yours that's your time your talent your everything now it's just noticing this young fellow that's your wife brother Burns isn't it playing and singing there the young couple it isn't the piano neither is it an organ but it's some kind of an instruments and they strum it and pick it and do something like that for the Lord if you can do that and sing with Souls do something no matter if you can whistle whistle w we can do a little more whist I can scream a little I can praise the Lord what are you bringing what are you offering to God what's he worthy of he's worthy of our praise amen he's worthy of praise and glory that's right amen whistle do something whatever you got put it to the use of God's service amen amen you might not be a loud and boisterous worshipper amen you might not do all of that but maybe you're a prayer Warrior huh maybe you have a tendency to drop to your knees and talk the Lord Brother Glenn Sherry amen maybe a prayer War you don't realize how much that does even brother B says y'all praying for me you don't know what that does for me why because God answered those prayers no wonder we got good church services because we got prayer [Applause] warriors may not be seen but behind the scenes you're praying God give us a good service help brother berer hello help everybody tonight open their hearts amen amen you may not Hallelujah you may not run you may not dance amen maybe you're poor and you just put $5 in the offering huh and guess what what does that do pay the light bill pay the power bill it makes so that this can work so a sinner can hear the word and they can get saved and you get credit for that while you're doing something do something for God bring something don't come empty-handed don't come empty-hearted come with a full Heart full of the Holy Ghost amen amen praise the Lord amen we got business people here amen people put in the offering you know let me tell you something God has blessed The church here I'm going to say it again I'm going to say it again I'm telling you we used to not have much of an offering I was shocked brother Brian you were shocked they me to have 15 or $16,000 in the bank huh be able to spend 8 or $110,000 on things that we need and so for that's a blessing amen and when people have needs we can help them thank God it makes a difference whatever God's blessed you in maybe you're a helper just a help in the church amen there's no difference between the janitor and the pastor we're both servants we're Servants of God Amen how many beli we're all God's servants amen oh my that's right carried that praise the Lord you support the church by what brother bam showing up you do something those that did not couldn't make it brother Danny not feeling well but what did they do what are you doing you're listening you hit that button stream is that right you're doing something anything you possibly can praying and believ leing but if it all possible everybody comes that can ain't that right cuz that makes a big difference like I said earlier it be hard if there's nobody here says I am not used to preaching to myself at all even though my wife says hey what are you saying oh I'm just talking to [Laughter] myself I do a lot of it it's terrible how much have I that I'll do sometimes amen all right what else you sisters well I'm just a housewife let me ask you sisters something how would you sisters what do you what would you think about being the pastor would you moms like to be a pastor to Pastor well brother Brad I think I'm going to declare something a little bit different that you moms are the assistant pastor you ain't never heard that before have you boy I better have a good one to pull myself out of that one brother Bram said what you sisters you don't think you have an important job you ain't bringing what are you bringing the very next thing to the preacher what is motherhood is the most most important thing that there is and brother bam said you moms you're a pastor to your little children how many knows that's your little flock that's your little flock and you teach them so I'm going to say to you Mom be a good pastor cuz you are assisting this pastor because if you don't raise them right I'm going to have a lot of trouble on my hands if you don't do your job I going to have a hard time doing mine amen so does that make sense y'all ain't going to vote me out for that are you that's the way I saw it very how many knows that's a very very important job is raising them children and taking time set them down on that couch and you read that Bible and you explain things to them you teach them to be kind you teach them to be tolerant you T teach them to be longsuffering you teach them that others are going to be mean to them sometimes and you're going to have to learn how to well here we go doing my job right teaching you how to do your job what did Brother Bram says Susanna Wesley sat three hours a day or whatever with those children and taught them and look what come forth motherhood is the backbone of the nation it's the backbone of the church amen because that's what's coming up next all of them Woodies boys that's right he's coming up next there are next deacons trustees maybe preachers maybe they'll be missionaries might as well put it in their head right that's right it's possible never know what they'll be brother Troy you and your boys we're going overtime now brother r that all right I didn't I a this ain't in the script right here other than the moms or the pastors and teach the children that's right even brother Bram says man we need people that have uh something that God comes down and gets a hold of we've seen different ones different young lot of young ministers in the message rising up and man I'm telling you what I wish I could preach like them they could absolutely spit it out like what did Brother juwel not uh jubble said like shucking corn just a shucking that corn preaching like a shucking corn amen but praise the Lord how many Lord help us to bring something offer ourself Lord I offer myself to you amen amen so that you can use me that's my heart's desire Lord let us offer a surrendered
