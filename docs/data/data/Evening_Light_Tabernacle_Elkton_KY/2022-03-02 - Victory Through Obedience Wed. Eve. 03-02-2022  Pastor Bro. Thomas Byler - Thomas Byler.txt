that was nigh on to perfect day wasn't it very nice praise be to god i didn't tell you what i've been looking for that day all winter amen so god bless you it's just good to see you everybody amen it's by our heads kind heavenly father we come before you lord jesus grateful lord to be able to come again lord before you to be able to speak to you lord and have fellowship with you lord jesus and one another lord around the word of god and father we just ask god that you just take the meditation of our heart and that which we feel like you've laid upon our heart lord jesus and direct us lord jesus and the path that we should go help us to say what needs to be said lord anoint us in the right direction in the ears of the years that they might hear what they need father supply their need lord jesus we just ask god that you'll bless each and every one both here and out there we just ask your blessing upon the reading in the word the meditation of our heart forgive us of any wrong anything that might not be done wrong or thought wrong father i want everything under the blood lord jesus so that we're ready to hear from you we just commit this service now into your hands for your honor and your glory in jesus name amen and amen amen so i want to speak amen on a subject amen that i have no doubt but spoke before and but i've uh mentioned that i think it last wednesday when we was at home amend us talk a little bit out of the book of deuteronomy amen as a matter of fact we almost just sat down and listened to the whole book of deuteronomy tonight amen i was just dating should i do that or what but anyway it would be a blessing amen you know the bible talked in the old testament that a certain time of the year the priests were together get together and they were supposed to read the whole scroll they were supposed to read the scrolls and so forth and that's what they would do amen so we would certainly be blessed to have that kind of a service sometimes where we just sit down and listen to the word when we because i'll tell you what i i certainly enjoy you know i don't can't always maybe just sit down but even if i'm working or whatever i will try to try to listen you know because you have the privilege now of even on your phone downloading your bible and and you can listen to the bible about any time amen so that that makes it real good amen and so it's busy as what we are nowadays and i'll tell you what the book of deuteronomy i just listened to it and and listen to it again and again amen i really it just i got inspiration from i guess and and one thing i noticed and that is that there is so many quotes out of the old testament not of that book that were brought over in the new testament that peter talked about the peculiar people and so forth god's chosen people and that paul talked about the hebrews and romans i guess i believe it was where it talks about the word is not in heaven or here there he says the word is naive even in thy mouth amen and that comes out of the book of deuteronomy and brought over into the new head a whole lot of things that are brought over amen and so we're just going to do the best we can with the help of the lord and we'll talk about the commandments of the lord and i titled this i believe it was uh you know uh let me see what i did here blessing and blessing prosperity and victory through obedience amen through obedience amen so basically that's what i want to talk about is obeying the commandments of the lord is that all right and what it does amen what it does to obey what god said do amen so praise the lord turn your bibles and i think we'll go and start i've got a lot of scriptures we could probably just read bible tonight you see all of those tabs right that's all scriptures we and so anyway let's go to luke let's start with luke something real simple here in luke the fourth chapter luke 4. and let's just read the first four verses and jesus being full of the holy ghost returned from jordan and was led by the spirit into the wilderness being 40 days tempted of the devil and in those days he did eat nothing and when they had ended they were entity afterwards hungered and the devil said unto him if thou be the son of god command these stones that it be made bread and jesus answereth hymns saying it is written that man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god may god add his blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated so we see here brothers and sisters that we are to live not by bread alone but by every word that comes out of god's mouth amen praise the lord in john 15 as we begin to talk about god's commandments in john 15 let's go to john 15 and verse 14. there's other scriptures that i could mention but i i've mentioned quite a few times before and i'm going to have enough that i mentioned i won't mention those but in john 14 20 i'm sorry in john 15 14. it says ye are my friends if you do whatsoever i command you amen whatsoever i command you and you know as i go tonight i mean if i was to just lean on this and i probably will lean pretty heavy in this way uh it would look like i am teaching law and you know teaching law and salvation by law but salvation don't come by law amen this is for people who have been born again amen who serve the lord who have given gotten the free gift of the holy ghost because it's free right however once you are a christian there's things that god wants us to do right there's god thing there's things that he wants you to do and he wants you to do here he says if you are my friends and if you do whatsoever i command you over in chapter 14 in verse 21 it says he that hath my commandments and keepeth them he it is that love with me amen here it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and i will love him and will manifest myself to him amen so there again jesus is saying that amen the one that obeys god the one that does what god says is the one that loves him this really has to do with being in a family the family of our heavenly father amen and dwelling under his blessings right to enter dwelling under his blessings and also under his chastisement right because how many believes that when you do wrong and when you sin there is uh you know people people they say well i do i don't get punished for that do i get punished if i repent well yeah you do because that's what jason means it means to correct right if there is no chastening there's no correction and god will correct you sure he'll forgive you if he didn't forgive you you'd be damned to hell but he's still going to teach you that's what our heavenly father does he tries to teach us amen and we all know that in a family when a father tells a child something now you know it might be a young lady might be a little boy or whatever and says look don't never talk to strangers right we teach them that for a reason don't we somebody approaches you and you aren't comfortable get away from them get back to mom and dad it's for their own good something that they'll learn as a matter of fact most of us can say that most of the discipline and the chastisement that we got from our parents if once you grow up and really see it the way that you should see it you will go back and thank mom and dad for that hard whooping that you just barely could stand at the time now right because you realize that it was actually something that was for your own good the bible says isn't that right it was for your own good it was going to help you when you get older it's going to make life a lot better for you if you get taught and if you get chastised it meant such well because i don't mean to go down this road but such disrespect such as telling people yes sir yeah and not to talk over people just all kinds of things you touch you know teach respect because you disrespect especially now age and that right disrespect could get you shot amen and so you know and so it just it it's a whole lot better to be respectful than disrespectful and everything and that's the way it is where heavenly father he don't just put a bunch of things on us to see if we can do it or whatever but it's for our good and it's for our blessing and as long as we do what our parents just tell us to do as long as we're under their roof we know that we are blessed we are taken care of we're watched out for and so forth but if you are rebellious and you don't do what you're supposed to do well that parent most likely isn't going to bless you when you end up in jail and you call mom and daddy to get you out of jail they just may tell you well maybe you ought to just sit there for a while ah because every time you do that and make it easy and support the tradition is going to do it again and be in the same place but anyway so amen and so that's kind of the focus of it is that as long as you're under god's obedience unless you're as long as you're an obedient child god's blessings are upon you amen now let me just say one thing over in peter over in peter first peter 2 9 it says ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood and holy nation a peculiar people that you should show forth the praises of him who have called you out of darkness into his marvelous light how many believe that we are a very blessed people i like that song i am blessed i am blessed this reminded me this uh sermon brother brad preached that's awful long ago about being blessed and because we are truly blessed amen and another look just to see how really blessed we are i begin to think and see that over in uh uh over in deuteronomy now i wanted to say that to say this over here if i could find it now amen over in deuteronomy if you want to go with me you can amen in deuteronomy the seventh chapter and verse 6 he says for thou art a holy people notice why it's the same wording as what people's peter said you're a holy people unto the lord your god the lord thy god has chosen to be thee to be a special people unto himself right above all people that are upon the face of the earth y'all hang on to your seats tonight but do you realize that you are more blessed you are the most blessed people on the face of the earth if god is your father if you know him to be your daddy if he's your heavenly father you are you are a blessed people above everybody out there doesn't that just do something wow not because of what you've done but because he chose you we are a chosen generation hallelujah we want to establish that first amen i think there was another one i ran across ran across over here in chapter 26 and verse 18 the lord hath vouched thee this day to be his peculiar people and that what peter said you're a peculiar people that's what israel was a peculiar people peter picks it up out of the old testament no doubt and realizes that not only were they but those that are born again they're a peculiar people a chosen nation amen as he hath promised thee that thou should escape all his commandments and to make the high above all nations which ye have made in praise and in name and in honor and that thou mayest be a holy people unto the lord thy god as he has spoken praise be to god it is amazing at how much of a resemblance there is between the believer the true believer now joshua and cable especially to the new testament saints amen if you'll notice over in deuteronomy the sixth chapter and when he gave begin to give out commandments one of them was in verse 16 he shall not tempt the lord your god amen isn't that exactly what jesus repeated to the devil thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god am i right so that was one of the things that was brought right over but you shall diligently keep the commandments of the lord your god his testimonies his statutes which he commanded thee this day well some folks may not think that you got to keep any commandments in the new testament the law's all done away with is that or is that right no no no no no peter says it this way i was looking for where paul was talking about uh that men acknowledged that the things we say is the commandments of the lord and this is what i came to and and there's a little something i spoke on sunday let you women keep silent this is in first corinthians 14 and verse 34. let your women keep silent in the churches for it is not permitted for them to speak but they are commandment to be under obedience as also saith the law and if they will learn anything let them ask their husbands at home for it is a shame for a woman to speak in the church what came the word of god out from you or did he come up from you only in other words he was trying to say that you're not the only one who gets the word of the lord notice the very next scripture how binding this is right after he says that if any man think that he's a preacher or should this says prophet or spiritual spiritual then let him acknowledge that the things that i write unto you are the commandments of the lord amen somebody knows this the whole new testament everything paul wrote are the commandments of the lord how many believe it that's right because why paul was a messenger that god used to write almost the whole new testament he said all scripture is given by inspiration of god and his profitable doctrine for reproof for instruction in righteousness amen and so forth all right so back to deuteronomy let's go back to deuteronomy again and pick up where we talked about that he said that he has chosen thee to be a special people unto himself i like that i mean he was truly god that chose us because he knew what was in us before the foundation of the world he knew what you would have on the inside of your heart he knew what you would be amen he chose abraham how he believes he chose abraham and abraham i want to use for an example here for just a little bit but maybe before we go on let me just read something that brother bam said about abraham now we find out the new testament says that abraham staggered not at the promise of god was strong through faith amen isn't that right now we know that abraham he wasn't so perfect now paul under the blood when he wrote it when he was inspired he didn't see none of that none of that came out right he said he's saying or not the old testament you can see all kinds of staggers and that his wife talked him into maybe this son supposed to be born through hagar take ar to yourself and that made a real mess of the whole world for forever and her ceiling deal with huh sure and there and he lied and he you know he he brought his dad out he brought his nephew lot out and got it said separate yourself from all you kindred listen to what he said oh my remember another thing he told him to do was to separate from as a kindred and all of his people he says god in order to get a man or a woman boy or girl to obey him you have to separate yourself from all unbelief amen i want to say that's what we're preaching about tonight is trying to separate ourselves from all this belief and disobedience amen if you don't get nothing else from tonight's service remember this if you want to get closer to god see what else you're failing to obey and start obeying it huh that's what you do because remember back to what jesus said man is not to live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god everything he says if you love me do if you might call my friends then do whatsoever things i command you amen praise the lord now a total separation from all unbelief remember abraham the patriarch was never absolutely fully blessed until he obeyed exactly what god said do and we will never never never receive a blessing have the blessings until we obey what god said do how many believe that you want to be blessed more you'll never give receive the full blessings of god until it's complete and full obedience and like i said sunday it's a searching of our heart examine yourself i mean as we've got to examine ourselves see where you're at with god dig a little deeper and then right got to dig a little deeper you want more of god you've got to make more room for god amen all right the lord god did not set his love upon you this is in deuteronomy 7 again if anybody wants to follow deuteronomy 7 and 7 the lord did not set his love upon you nor choose you because you were more in number than any people for ye were the fewest of all people but because the lord loved you and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers hath the lord brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you out of the house of the bondage from the hand of pharaoh king of egypt like we could all testify that we were once in sin and god brought us out in that right look at what god did for you because why because he loved you amen now let's go down to verse 11 thou shalt therefore keep the commandments and statutes and judgment which i command thee this day to do them wherefore it shall come to pass now notice what i said about obedience what comes through obedience that if ye hearken to these judgments and keep and do them the lord thy god shall keep thee unto thee the covenant and the mercy which he swear unto the fathers he will love thee and bless thee and multiply thee he will also bless the fruit of thy womb the fruit of thy land my corn and thy wine and thy oil the increase of thy kind the flocks of thy sheep in the land which he swear unto thy fathers to give thee now here's the phrase i underline thou shalt be blessed above all people let me just stop and say this that i know that god blesses you financially he blesses you in your natural he promised to do that he promised that you would be taken care of that you would prosper you know jesus is called the son of prosperity everything he does prospers and when he's in you it doesn't matter if you're in jail you're singing songs like paul did he still prospered the angels came and brushed the gates down opened them up even no matter what he prospered and thou shalt be blessed above all people and thou shalt not uh there shall not be a male or female barren among you or among your cattle and the lord will take away from the all sickness and put none of these evil diseases of egypt which thou knowest upon thee but will lay them upon all them that hate thee amen amen somebody knows it's better not to touch one of god's little ones for it's better than a mule song were hanged about his neck somebody tries to trip you up somebody don't just give it to god watch out god will take care of it my place says god will prepay them to their face how many members one place god said don't take vengeance upon yourselves he says i vengeance is mine saith the lord i will repay so if you're obeying god command following his commandments don't worry about your enemies god will take care of your enemies one place in deuteronomy i don't think i'll come across my yet i might yet but he says your enemy will come in at you from one direction and they will flee in seven direction don't you get too happy now but we find out that whenever israel would backslide whenever they would get away from god the bible says that they would let uh i forget not what it was but there would be groups bands of people that would come in and you know and take them and make sleeves out of them and to take their stuff started to happen [Music] amen how many knows that when you disobey one of god's commandments you automatically the devil comes and steals your joy all of a sudden you're all you know you get robbed amen okay thou shalt be blessed above all people now i want to go just over here but let's go to 7 chapter 6 and verse after he said you shall not tempt the lord thy god you shall ye ye shall diligently keep the commandments of the lord your god his testimonies his statutes which he had commanded i'ma bring this down micah which he hath commanded that thou sh and thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of the lord that it may be well with thee and that thou mayest go in and possess the good land which the lord swear unto thy fathers to cast out all thine enemies from before thee as the lord has spoken i want to tell you i truly believe that when you obey god god gets rid of all of those enemies that want to torment you all the enemies whatever it might be god will drive them out because you sure can't now can you no god will have to do it all you got to do is follow christ amen thank god i thank the lord for his grace you're a holy people you're a peculiar people amen over in deuteronomy 26 again i want to pick that back up and read almost the whole chapter okay i'll read down to verse 13 and then i want to jump over to 28 because i'll tell you what i really like that from 15 to 18 that is a great congregational reading right there amen where he talks about cursed be he that removeth his neighbor's landmark and all the people said amen almost the whole chapter god was teaching us to say amen all right now let me see here 28 i believe it is that is not yep chapter 28 let's start here and it shall come to pass if thou shalt hearken diligently i like that notice this is what happens when you truly hearken diligently unto the voice of the lord thy god to observe and to do all his commandments which i command thee this day that the lord thy god will set thee on high above all the nations of the earth amen now i want to say something before i go on here because i don't want to give people the wrong impression matthew 5 jesus says blessed are the meek for the shall inherit blessed are the peacemakers blessed blessed blessed blessed bless it and with some of these things here i'm not here to decide look this is what was carried over this isn't you know all of these is exactly something you'll have will happen to you i i'm not here to say that but what i'm trying to give you an example of is this is the way that god blessed them back then and this is the you know because it talks about your cat well i got no cattle on flocks and sheep you know but what basically from what i'm reading here the overall is god's going to be with you no matter what amen but i know in the other in the old in the new testament you know we weren't flop we aren't promised a flowery bed of ease look at the christians down through the dark they did not have it easy but they they prospered and they blossomed no matter what come their way even in giving your life and having your head chopped up there is prosperity in it why because you know what's on the other side that you have eternal life okay so just as a teacher i want to try to make sure that nobody gets confused and they shall come to pass if thou shall hear and diligently unto the voice of the lord thy god to observe and to do all his commandments which i command thee this day the lord thy god will set thee high above all nations of the earth and all these blessings shall come upon thee and overtake thee if thou shalt hearken unto the voice notice how many times he says this is what's going to happen if you obey now how many knows that's exactly true in a new testament you cannot expect to not obey and be blessed i should get a resounding amen because the prophet of god said abraham was never fully blessed until he fully obeyed neither will a believer a boy or girl neither will we until we come to that place amen but i like it because it's gonna it's gonna come and it's just gonna overtake you i like when i like that kind of word it's not something you're gonna have to struggle for not to fight for god's gonna just come to come and he's going to overtake you maybe that reminds me of somebody coming up behind you just grab you and you're knocking it down god opening in the windows of the blessed open the windows of heaven and pouring out your blessing amen that'll probably almost knock you off your feet blessed shall thou be in the city and bless it shall thou be in the field amen blessed shall be the fruit of thy body and the fruit of thy ground and the fruit of the cattle the increase of thy kind the flocks of thy sheep bless it shall be thy basket in my store blessed shalt thou be when i come to sin and bless it shall be thou when that goes out amen how many fields that way this morning you know i am blessed i am blessed i am every day that i live when i wake up in the morning when i lay my head to rest i am blessed how many is blessed tonight when you set your heart to the lord you're blessed because remember this one thing you're either gonna people either live in the blessings of god or in the damnation of god or the curse of god am i right and thou shalt the lord shall cause on enemies to rise there it is rise up against thee to be smitten before that face and they shall come out against thee one way and flee before the seven ways i like that the lord shall command the blessing upon thee in thy store houses and in all that thou said is the hand unto and he shall bless thee in the land which the lord thy god giveth thee israel had a what we might call a absolute promise of natural blessings didn't they they had a promise of natural blessings we have a promise of natural blessings but mostly i say spiritual blessings jesus said seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all the things shall be added unto you in other words god is going to take care of you food clothing when i was thinking about this i was laying there and i was thinking lord everything i have i have because of your blessings because of you the house that i dwell in it's because of your blessing a little farm that it's because of god's it's not something i did it was simply god's blessing amen i don't know about you but sometimes i don't i feel like i don't obey the lord as much as i should you know some of them little things they just are natural fleshless likes to you know go a little too fast or do this that or the other and lord pricks us am i right but yet god blesses you and you'll look at the old testament as much as a man would serve god god would bless the man and however much he would not serve him he would not bless him amen that's why i believed in full i don't know about you without like the full blessings of god the car you drive the money you have the breath that i have the help that i have 60 years old i'm you know i'm thankful a lot of folks don't make it to 60 thank you lord for letting me make it to 60. amen everything is god's blessings can i go on he commanded a blessing upon that storehouse and let me just stop when i think about when i think about tommy if i just kept serving the devil if i just stayed out there where would i be brother david says he'd be six foot under tommy you know how many times would we almost go down right so many times i thought about brother time back then i said you know look at the life that he had how little he had how uh how he ended in jail that was the culmination of the great serving of the devil as you end up in jail your wife fixing to leave you and you ain't got nothing and you know what you're gonna do that's the culmination of the blessings of the devil huh but now look at brother tommy look look at what god's blessing with amen praise god right why because he gave his heart to the lord because he began to serve god and the more you do the more god blesses you he does and i know i know you know you i don't mean to preach a message of prosperity against somebody's feelings but the fact is when you serve god you're promised to prosper you will prosper i don't care if you're as broke as paul was paul still prospered every time they tried to kill him they didn't get it done isn't that right not until god was finished with him he prospered in everything that he does well brother bob i sure wish you had a scripture for it blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in this way of the sinners nor sitteth in the seat and scornful praise be to god he's not an unbeliever right but his delight is in the law of the lord and in his law does he meditate day and night after this wednesday night i hope every one of us meditate am i keeping all these commandments am i doing everything god said to do am i meditating on his law on what he asked us to do day and night because jesus said am i right if you do whatever i command you and in his law does he meditate day and night and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit and his season his leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper don't get so loud whatever he does shall prosper how about david he loved the lord you know the lord is my shepherd i shall not want he knew all about what it was like to serve god god loved him he slew goliath he slew lions and bears until he broke god's law and coveted his neighbor's wife then all hades so to speak come down on him people were making love with his wives up on the roof in front of the public all kinds of terrible things that god did to david absalon taking the throne and overthrowing it and dying itself and it was really bad because god already promised if you don't do what i ask you this is what's going to happen all these things are going to happen i wish i had the scripts if he talks about a deity woman that wouldn't even let her feet go on the grass or whatever a dainty woman that will never be unfaithful to her husband will eat her children because they don't commit obey the commandments of lord read deed around me become terrible how about [Music] samson killing a thousand philistines right he was a hero nobody can stop him unstoppable until he disobeyed and he cut his hair for the rest of his life it was a miserable boy how many believes out of the way of a transgressor is hard amen i trust each and every one of us with the help of the lord both here and out there know that when you don't listen to that still small voice that tells you the scripture tells you what's right and you go against that how many know you pay for it sure you do you get miserable you don't have no joy anymore it just goes bad god's not going to bless you for doing bad he's going to punish you for doing bad sure he'll forgive you but he still has your child he's going to teach you how many beliefs we need to learn that's right abraham another example abraham he didn't obey he took his father and brother bam says that he went out there and god promised him all he thinks but he took his lot and all of them and not until he separated himself from lot not until they had that spat huh his own kindred had his spat and he lot went one way abraham went the other way and then god appeared to him the bible says amen and spoke to him and gave him the promise of a promised son and so forth how about saul i know that saul he wasn't very careful about obeying what god said do y'all remember what saul did he brought the king back brought all the sheep and the goats back and sacked the sacrifice to god when god said i want you to destroy all the animals and everybody man woman and child kill them all and when samuel came to him saul goes up the samuel says samuel i have obeyed the commandments of the lord samuel said then why am i here in a bunch of bleeding sheep huh i'm not supposed to be hearing no sheep and i don't know if it's go uh what the name of the king was anymore but anyway found that wrong samuel brought the king out and chopped him to pieces isn't that right he said this is how you obey god chop the guy all the pieces that's what god said i was listening to that as i was working a little bit this morning and how that how that uh israel one day when joshua and all those joshua cross to draw over on dry land and all those people heard about it they all consolidated and he says they were like the sand of the sea like the sand of the sea the guys came to fight against joshua and so forth they were all destroyed and the bible says that god hardened them guys hearts to come and fight against them to bring judgment upon them for what they had done already i thought wow they knew they couldn't win because they already heard all the terrible stories of this god that is with them but they still hardened our day they went it says they went to their neighbors and everybody got together and we said well they're coming we better go find them the only smart guys you know who the smart guys were there was a couple of them that uh me and i got to remember i don't know if this what their names were anymore but you'll remember the story how that there was some of the leaders of a nation that was close by that put on old clothes old wine bottles and so forth and looking all haggard and stuff and they came up to joshua and uh and came to him and says we come from the far land you know we want to make peace and we want to have arm you know and so forth and they lied like the devil they were not from far and joshua and them made them and the elders made a league with that they were smart because they knew that was the best thing to do it's trying to go make peace with these guys but anyway joshua and the elders made a league with him he consulted with the elders but one thing that the word said it says but he didn't consult the lord he should have consulted the lord about it not just the elders maybe he wouldn't have been trapped because when they found out that they were from a very close nation and so forth all of israel wanted them they wanted to kill them but the elder says no we don't gave them our word we can't and they became slaves basically to him amen but i just thought it was something how that folks i'm here to tell you i'm going to just put it in plain words here that if you obey god and do what god said do god will take care of your enemies those things that your enemy whether it's whatever it might be lust of the flesh hello whatever it might be if you obey god the way that all of that will go by the wayside amen god will take care of that enemy that's what i believe that this scripture says i will drive out your enemies from before you if you hearken diligently unto the voice of the lord folks we would have a lot less problems people would have a lot less problems if they just obey god when i got to thinking about this and and what obeying god and what serving god does and the enemies that it keeps you from i had to think of the tattoos the earrings and all the things that people will do to themselves because they're completely lost their minds are not the way it's supposed to be and then we know that somebody that ain't filled with the holy ghost their mind isn't right i think well that's the enemies that would have come upon me that's what would be upon you oh thank god for his grace aren't you glad for that but saul was not so careful about obeying god isn't that right and god didn't like it too well he did not like it too well and whenever uh saul was still king and they were fighting the philistines as you know and they were all uh in their they couldn't prevail against them and they were all you know goliath was making his boats and all of that but when one surrendered man like david came along right god used him in such a mighty way amen because why because david obeyed and had his heart set completely on god amen praise the lord joshua just a couple more is that okay talk about joshua this is all i hate to miss something let me see how far did i even make it okay yes i believe i did already or no i don't know that i made it so far but i want to read this this is in deuteronomy 6 again and we'll go down to verse two that thou mightest fear the lord thy god and keep all these statues and his commandments which i command ye this commandee thou and thy son and thy son's son all the days of thy life keep them all the days of the life that the days may be prolonged i think about brother biscuit i think about perry green i think about brother parish i think about some of these preachers up in their 80s and so forth when you serve the lord it could be lay members think about it when you serve the lord with all your heart you're actually promised long days how do we believe that children you know what the new testament says that thou mayest live long on the earth obey your parents the thou mayest thing live long and so forth here therefore israel and observe to do it that it may be well with thee and that you may increase mightily as the lord god of thy fathers has promised thee in the land that floweth with milk and honey hero israel the lord our god is one lord now here's another new testament commandment if you look and find it and thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart with all thy soul and with all thy might and these words which i command thee this day shall be in thy heart and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children and thou shalt talk to the uh of them when thou sittest in thy house and when that isn't that something god has to tell all this this because we have such a quick way of forgetting these things he says i he's got to he got to tell us where to sit and what to talk when we're sitting i like that don't you when i see this in this house and when i walk us by the way and when the lie is down and when thou die rises up isn't that comparable to psalms 1 and on his law does he meditate day and night amen when thou rises up and that's oh my because you stopped that you quit doing a lot of these things and that's why our pews are so empty because people just drift away from god thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes and thou shall write them upon the posts of thy house and on thy yea how many believes we need to be dedicated to obeying the lord joshua one if you want to go with me my final scripture well i got one more joshua one you all know after the death of moses and so forth god told joshua so my servant moses is dead and so forth now take these people across and so forth and every place where the soul of your feet shall tread shall be shall be yours verse 5 and there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life and as i was with moses so will i be with thee and i will not fail to eat nor forsake me can i stop for a minute how many believes that every christian has that promise that jesus promised that he would never leave you nor forsake you every christian has that promise and if you stay in christ the way that you should i believe that god will take care of any man or any problem or anything that comes in front of you god will take care of it how many believes that i will not fairly no for safety be strong and of good courage so many times i find god telling his people don't you be scared you have courage when your enemies way outnumber you don't you be afraid be strong and courageous for unto this people shall not divide for inherits the lamb which i swear unto their fathers to give them only be that strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do all according to the law which moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest prosper whither so ever thou goest how many believes there's prosperity promise to joshua if he obeys the commandments of god prosperity is promised many times that prosper verity is overcoming the enemy it can be edgy it can be anything but you will prosper amen this book of the law verse 8 shall not depart out of the mouth but thou shalt meditate therein day and night the damas observe to do according all that is written therein for then shall die then shalt thou make thy way prosperous and then shalt thou have good success amen praise be to god have not i commanded thee be strong and have a good courage be not afraid neither be thou dismayed for the lord thy god is with thee wither so ever thou goest brother braham said of pot of first wife he said she was a beautiful woman honorable the highest woman in the country begged him and persuaded him and she caught him and tried to hug up to him and so forth yet he jerked till he even pulled his coat off and run from her that's how much joseph obeyed the lord hello yes sir and when he come in they told a lie on him said he come in to ravage her and left his coat there and from there he went to the dungeon but in the dungeon god was with him no matter where they put him he was always a type of the son of prosperity amen i mean joseph was the son of i'm saying things that always go good but many are the afflictions of the righteous but that's right but the lord delivered them out of them all because if joseph at first he wanted to kill joseph and one of his brothers got in their heart no don't kill him just throw him in a pit and that right and from there they sold him off from there he became you know a a servant in a i guess a prison keeper's house right and so forth and from there things went from bad to worse right bad to worse but yet he was a sign of prosperity even there he was blessed and he rose to the very right hand of pharaoh everything joseph done prospered and when jesus returns in the millennium that's the reason that the deserts will blossom as it rose everything does will prosper he is the son of prosperity amen amen one more scripture over in revelations stand with me if you would musicians you can come revelations 22 and verse 12 says it this way behold i come quickly and my reward is with me to give every man according to his work shall be on alpha and omega the beginning and the end the first and the last blessed are they that do his commandments that they may have a right to the tree of life and may enter in through the gates into the city amen the powerheads i want you to think about something i don't know what it might be but whatever it is that you realize that there's an area in your life where you could obey god more or there's an area perhaps that you have a really hard time with a weak link whatever it might be you'd want to say god tonight i want to surrender myself i want to say god help me lord that i might keep all your
