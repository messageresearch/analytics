foreign foreign [Music] so foreign uh my brothers and sisters the um i don't want to ever jesus foreign no don't think about anything else he built anything else on that foundation so it's really important what we build our foundation on i was thinking this morning i was thinking i was one thing that struck me this morning if you're one telling me the romans created the chapter [Music] [Music] [Music] where the ability to record a person's voice where you can hear it later 100 years around 15 60 almost 80 years you know the quantum happens for non-terms and there's numerous other inventions but with any infection it can be used for good and it can be used for that but i was just thinking this morning where would we be if we didn't have the written word and he didn't have [Music] is [Music] what you see in video form can be propaganda but what you read in god's word [Applause] [Music] and he's going to take care of you and provide for are going to want to accept what god wants to do for you this morning it doesn't mean that you're any better than anyone else this means that god loves you and you will love your person to that call but let me uh read from this uh first and uh in the devotionals this morning in the old devotional there's chief options coming out of it from them today and for today but i mean out of reading i have no job world war two devotional army

with him also freely give us all things but who shall lay anything in [Music] speaking to you is the individual these words right here and who shall lay in the charge of god's way is god's justified who is he that is christ that god gave his prison again who is even at the right hand of god who also makes his decision for who should separate us from the love of christ so appropriations distress perfection profession our nation for pearl assortment [Music] [Music] [Music] but like i said the most important thing is when you look at these words and you look at these persons you got to see yourself you're going to see yourself and what god is doing for you as an individual you know how are you doing for other people brother brown talked about two things that other preachers lately have been talking about but the one that was from yesterday when he the world is pretty dark out there the only life that's out there this morning with your heart it means you're like that's where the light is not even in books right to be based upon one decision that you make and that decision is just you're going to achieve jesus that's the only thing that matters crazy [Music] [Music] you [Music] so [Music] [Music] by the living word of standing on the promises of god yes standing i'm standing on the promises of god standing on the promises of christ [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music]

you'll help me it'll be a little better yet amen so amen just it's just amazing i never cease to be amazed at how that i can preach something for 30 years amen and still get something new out of the same scriptures amen and so we know that it's just unending amen and it's a fountain that'll never run dry and so if you will stand with me let's just go before the lord in prayer and heavenly father we come before you lord once again gathering ourselves together lord in your precious name and you said wherever two would gather in your name there you would be in our midst lord and we're so grateful father for your holy spirit that you sent back on the day of pentecost father and that it's been here for two thousand years and it's still here it still inhabits the hearts of those who believe your word it still leads and guides us in our lives and directs us and blesses us father and keeps us lord in the hollow of your hand lord and we're so grateful for your holy spirit that we sense here this morning and we asked god that you'll just bless the meditation of our heart father this morning and lord that which we feel like it's related upon our heart to minister to the people may we go from here better people than what we've come lord jesus and we just ask god you'd help us to completely yield to you that you have your perfect way and we just love you lord jesus with all of our heart bless the word now father we ask it in jesus christ's name amen and amen if you will turn to the philippians and amen will try not to go too long we'll have to the communion this morning amen philippians 3 philippians 3. and we'll begin with verse 6 concerning seal persecuting the church touching the righteousness which is in the law i was blameless but paul says what things were gained to me those i counted loss for christ yea doubtless i count all things but lost for the excellency of the knowledge of christ jesus my lord for whom i have suffered the loss of all things and count them and do count them but down that i may win christ and be found in him not having my own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through faith in christ the righteousness which is of god by faith that i may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable conformable unto his death if by any means i might attain unto the resurrection of the dead not as though i had already attained either were already perfect but i follow after if that i may apprehend that for which i also i am apprehended of christ jesus brethren i count not myself to have apprehended but there's one thing i do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before i press towers to mark for the prize and notice how he spells that p-r-i-z-e all right of the high calling of god in christ jesus let us therefore as many as be perfect be thus minded and if and if in anything ye be otherwise minded god will shall reveal given this to us unto you this unto you may god had his blessings to the reading of the words you can be seated this morning amen this morning i want to speak on precision precision amen something i don't believe i've ever spoke on before amen but uh and i was just meditating and you know it's funny i i always try to keep the lord on my mind and and somewhere along the lines sometimes the lord will just of course you know that's just usually i get my messages but he'll just quicken something to my mind amen and i was meditating on on and thinking about uh the prophet of god brother abraham having went beyond the curtain of time that one morning y'all remember he was caught up and he's seen all of uh he's seen all these people right he's seen all these people dressed in robes and so forth and now all uh everybody was imperfection he was so beautiful and and he describes of course how everybody was you know and how beautiful it was and you know he began to wonder who these people were and so forth and he because the angel that was there with me says these are your people these are your people he says these are all branhams you're thinking perhaps his family and there was millions right there was millions of them and he says no these are not branhams these are your converts amen now how many knows that in the prophetic age in the old testament different ones it always talks about that group that like joseph and them being gathered with his people and he was gathered with his free people amen and so we know that he had a vision and so forth and he says you know that before he was told that before he would meet the lord he'd have to be judged so forth for what he has preached and so forth and he says well will paul have to have to do the same thing well paul be judged with his group but before he said that if you'll notice what i want to say was he says no these are not brandons but they're your converts right so they were actually converts of brother branham's and they were gathered with him and he said it says well we'll you know he says you'll be judged for what you have preached he says well will paul have to be judged for what he preached he says he sure will you know and he says and startling startling to me when i first heard it brother branham said well praise be to god brother branham was happy because he says well if paul's going to have to he says and if paul's group make it i will too because i preached just what paul preached amen and what did those millions cry out he says we are resting on that now and and if you'll notice that paul here in philippians i believe it was no not philippians galatians i believe it is hold on a second let me go back here just a few pages back this is what paul taught he said this paul said in galatians 1 he says he says i marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of christ unto another gospel which is not another but there be some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of christ but though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you let him be a curse as we said before he says it again so say i now again if any man preach any of the gospel unto you then that which ye have received let him be accursed first he said an angel but though we are an angel next he says though if any man preach a gospel which you have not received let him be accursed for i do or do i now persuade men or god or do i seek to please men for if i yet please men i should not be the servant of god i certify to you brethren that the gospel was preached of me is that that was preached of me was not after man neither received i i ate of men neither was i taught it but by the revelation of jesus christ how many know that the word of the lord always comes to a prophet amen and that's why different places in different times in brother branham's ministry amen different when we say well brother branham you are a prophet of god don't you aren't you in the place to where you could add to the bible he says well that may be true i may be in that position but the word has already been established and if anybody anything other than let it be a curse so you could never preach something other than what has been preached according to the word or you'd have a contradiction amen so having established that and talking about how that we know that he was he was seeing millions of people that's what this morning i'm not ashamed to say that i'm a convert of the problem of god brother branham because paul said follow me as i follow christ paul will be gathered with his group arenas will be gathered with his group martin will be gathered with his group every age has a group that they're gathered with how many knows that amen the seven stars that god had in his right hand and remember jesus said that as they do to you they do unto me right so amen now notice but i want to i want to go to a thought that i had okay and the thought was this and i just want to read this to you okay would that be all right brother bam says the other day at the christian in los angeles i was preaching at their breakfast which went on in national or nationwide broadcast and i was just tearing the thing just up as hard as i could i couldn't do nothing else because i may know that abandoned would preach against everything that was wrong let me tell you something denominations don't stand much of a chance a church that's not based on the word of god don't stand much of a chance the bible in the o in revelation calls her harlots prostitutes she's the mother of harlots and abominations of the earth amen and he was just tearing the nomination and so forth up he says because how many knows that during brother bannon's time when he was preaching and so forth you wouldn't believe the adversity that he had isn't that right we could go on to turn 63 65 when most churches put him out even though jesus would still come down to the platform and do the very same things that he did with the woman and i'll discern the thoughts and intents of the heart and come and prove that it was jesus christ resurrected [Music] and i'm not ashamed of the testimonies of what god has done in this generation because listen to all the times that uh the old testament and david all says he said that we ought to repeat the testimonies of god think about the testimonies before god teach your children the testimonies of god tell your children's children what god has did and we're not just here to say what he did like that but we're here to say what god did today amen all right so there he was and he was just doing all that and of course at the time that wasn't too popular right but he said that he said there was a danny henry there was a danny henry that came up you know after he was done preaching this is jane russell i guess she's some movie star or something jane russell uh his first cousin that's right he says her cousin a baptist note not one word of it but was a so stern and he walked up and he says brother madam them words that you said could be easily put be put to the book of revelations now another place brother bam says he insulted him by saying that that's an addition to the word of god huh because you can't add to or take away because if you do right you'd be out of the program of god he says that could be added to the bible right there listen and he threw his arms around me and started speaking in french and he didn't know one word of french he didn't know how to speak in french amen listen up here he re phrases it against up here and when he did he began he began to speak in with tongues he says and then there was a lady from louisiana sitting there out there a french woman raised up and she says that isn't unknown tongues i'm a frenchman here is what he said notice she wrote it on a paper right because she heard exactly what he said and another man came up from down through there and woke up a young fellow walking down through there was the interpreter of french for the u.n the united nations he had just drifted into the meeting and he said what's uh here's what she said he said exactly the same thing and this boy danny henry he didn't know any any french amen but yet he spoke in tongues and there was three witnesses let every word be established and they wrote this down all right he says this is what this is what he had prophesied or said he says because thou has chosen the narrow path the harder way that is what of thine own choosing amen that's what i want to talk a little bit about notice how did he did this of his own choosing brother bannon was offered airplanes and uh preachers would come up to him uh you know the leaders of the big denominational groups they come up and say look better venom you know we want to be part of this and we want to sponsor you and and we'll have an airplane and we'll fly you everywhere and so forth and and pay you a salary and all these things and and so forth right very good friend of his he would be made offers he says yeah well what is the catch well you know just this about uh you know you about this water baptism the godhead maybe the serpent seed you know and always bawling the women out and he said well that's what god's called me to do yet you know but it was always a catch and he turned that down flat isn't that right and he chose the harder way he didn't choose the easy way he chose the hard way because the hard way we know that christ is always in every age to be a christian you'll be persecuted amen they'll cast you out and their name out as evil and everything else it's the hard way and it because he chose notice he says thou has chosen the narrow path the harder way now notice he says this is where i picked it up thou has picked the correct and precise decision oh my the precise and the correct and precise decision and this is my way [Music] because in because of this momentous decision a huge portion of heaven awaits you hey man how many remembers the old lady uh the young lady that came up and shook his hand and so forth and she was young and absolutely beautiful long hair everything it's the angels who said don't you remember her she said our precious brother our precious brother amen and and he says dude i don't remember her no and he said you she was past 80 years old i don't think it was 90 i think this is what past 80 years old when you led her to christ and there was millions there you know why there was millions there because you didn't compromise on the word of god aren't you glad that for that it didn't compromise he didn't take it easy on the people he tore the people's eyes up he told the truth oh my but that position that word position is what caught my attention in my mind that i said i was pretty sure he said the precise and correct decision how many knows any correct decision is precise i like that oh my gosh the thinking i want to take some words with the help of the lord as we might think about what position means to be prison position means to be precise or accurate or perfect dead on right it's a precise decision and he made the right choice oh my and i like what he said one place he says now this was your choosing you chose it you chose the right choice oh how many knows that whether you go to heaven or whether you end up in hell at the end of this life depends on what choice that you make but brandon brother brian mentioned about making that choice for christ it's the most important choice that you'll ever make in life it was the most important choice i made amen when i was like 20 years old so if i learned right there brothers and sisters i'm so glad for the grace of god that was something down in my heart said there's got to be more to rock and roll and smoking dope and heaven drugs and everything else there's got to be something up to life i said lord here i am whatever you want to do with my life i made a choice twice with the god's help in that right it was him that planted something that and because of that my whole entire life has been different [Music] amen oh my you gotta make that right choice your whole world every individual you are going to create your world by the choice that you and you know when god came and did what he did the signs and the wonders that he performed remember when he came and he preferred those signs and wonders of god says now you know what now the choice is forced upon people you have to make a choice you got to make this decision is it of god or isn't of god huh you got to can't walk away from it praise be to god oh my now notice what he said he says a huge portion and i really didn't know for sure in the past perhaps what that meant but he always almost in every search of these quotes he mentions he says and that's in the vision here that you all have heard about that i had just a little while ago isn't that right the vision of what you had of that other side it was a huge portion of the people that are gonna be in heaven they await you aren't you glad for that oh my let me uh and let me just say this as it comes to mind there's something about precision i love precision precision is the opposite of sloppy being sloppy i just want to make a statement if you could get this in your head young people you'd get somewhere in life if you are sloppy about your decisions you are sloppy about the choices that you make you will not go very far in this life you could easily end up in jail prison or a drug addict or whatnot huh young ladies you could end up having babies and children and not having a husband that cares whether it's taken care of not your life could be a nightmare because of chis decisions you need to be precise about what choices you make amen hasn't it always irritated you a little bit with rich people people who have gotten somewhere in life and then the little things they're completely fanatical about you say why do they have to be so picky about the little things that's where they got where they are because they know that if they're slopping those little things they'll be slapping the big things every little little thing matters if you're going to get anywhere why are they so tight the reason they're so tight is why they have so much money they're not sloppy you just spend it and it goes out their pocket as fast as it comes in got your attention now but think about it i thought that he cries spiritually i believe that god wants us to be precise he wants to be he wants us to be correct he wants us to hit the mall somebody tells me what sin means raise your hand so i don't have a bunch answering but a glenn disobedient disobedience that's one anybody else sister hannah unbelief that's another one how about another one that's what i'm looking for all right brother ben key to the door says sin means sin means to miss the mark like you're shooting you miss the mark you better adjust your gun or your sights oh my hallelujah didn't jesus say that if you will believe all things are possible if you say that this mountain move and believe with all your it'll be moved [Music] what for him think whatsoever desire when you pray believe and you shall have have them remember the one man who was one of his daughter i believe healed this who first believe is thou that i can do it he says lord help my unbelief amen he says you know if a man believes he says nothing is impossible to a man that believes yes sin is unbelief and it means to miss the mark let me just come to the very foundation of the gospel go ye jesus said when he was risen from the dead and talked to his disciples going into all the world and preached the gospel he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned pretty straight shot ain't it just a straight shot he that believeth and his baptized shall be saved in other words you're going to get to live eternally but if that believeth not shall be damned now you see why the world is so damned because they don't believe what god did that's right amen so that's the very foundation you have to believe it's semester mark listen because there's something wrong like shooting in a gun you miss the mark see you come back and try over it means to turn around you've missed the mark when you're a christian you want to join a church you miss the mark you want to be a christian and be sprinkled in the name of the father son holy you missed the mark you better come back amen i'll tell you right now anytime you're practicing any time of shooting me and brother tommy had his bow and arrow shoot you know and i love it caleb remembers back in the day when we was man you know if it was if it's a uh if it get out of that bull's eye we were unhappy i mean you just got the rhythm of you could put still it in there drill it in there drill it in there but years have went by and i tried to you know do a pretty good job and so forth trying to you know come up in maybe third or fourth place and hey you know i better go practice i remember john michael you know wanted to go to them shoots and so forth and i would get a day or two and just go out there and get that rhythm again but it's hard to do in just a time or two and they're right you got to get you got to keep practicing keep working on it isn't that what paul said i'm pressing i haven't got it yet but i'm working on it and i'm working on it to come to that resurrection to come to that place of perfection paul said i have account everything i ever had but done that i might know him that i might zero in on him amen because that's the only way you can serve god it's all or nothing how many believe that oh my amen how many loves the lord jesus said it this way when he says about you wanting to be precise whosoever therefore shall confess me before men him will i confess before my father which is in heaven how many know another place he said draw nigh unto god and god will draw an eye unto you in other words if you want to aim to get closer to god you better start drawing closer to him if you want him to come closer to you you better start drawing closer to him but whosoever will deny me before men one other place he says him will i deny before all the holy angels in heaven i don't know you if in this world you're ashamed to confess jesus christ there come a day when he'll be ashamed of you think not that i am condescend peace on the earth i didn't come to send peace by the sower oh my because why he says for i am i'm come to set a man at variance against his father and daughter and against her mother and daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law a man's foes shall be they of his own household he that loveth father and mother more than me is not worthy of me he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me he that taketh not up his cross and follows me is not worthy of me he that findeth his life shall lose it and he that loses his life for my sake shall find it what is he saying that you can't have your focus on any family member you've got to have your focus 100 on christ he ain't got to fill you with the holy ghost he ain't going to change your life unless you completely surrender to him amen amen how many likes that that was the way that jesus said you better focus on it amen all right we want to talk about focusing for just a few minutes but there's another story brother bran said that i really liked as you know brother bannon was a hunter he loved the outdoors amen and he was a squirrel hunter and he went out one day and he started to shoot a squirrel and i find out now brother bannon wanted to hit he would wait for a squirrel to go to a certain place at a certain distance before he would shoot that squirrel whenever he would shoot that squirrel he didn't want to hit him in the hips he didn't want to gut shoot that he didn't want to hit him in the chest he wanted to hit him right in the head right in the eye that's why he wanted to hit him he was just that way and i hit him somewhere else besides the eye and i got nervous i tried again on the paper in other words he began to shoot on paper and it wouldn't hit the squirrel i wouldn't hit the target it would hit somewhere within a quarter of an inch or so an inch something at 50 yards now no it would do better than it i done everything to the gun that i know to do seemed like to fix it and i wrapped it up in the box and sent it back to the winchester company for examination for re-betting it wrote me a nice letter and i have my rifle file at home he says and it says reverend branham that rifle was grouped it was made to group an inch at every 25 yards it's just a model 75 it's not a target good gun it's just a plinker you'll never get any better than that now that was the winchester company made the gun said an inch at 25 yards i drove nine straight holes at 50 yards now here's my thought my wife said not bill she said if that company who made the rifle will tell you that then it uh why won't you it won't do no better than that then who are you say that it will i say honey little husband and wife here honey here's what it is i don't care what the company said i've seen it do it how many knows i'll tell you you ever get a good taste of the baptism the holy ghost don't you tell me there ain't no really sweet loving and wonderful feeling that comes with the baptism of the holy ghost i've seen it do it man that's the important part is that experience works hope experience brings hope and he knew that he would do it he would drove 10 attacks straight one hole after another 10 times he knew he would do it and then let him tore up huh in other words he loved precision he wanted it dead on amen how many is that way spiritual lord i want it right on i don't want it almost i don't want to take a shotgun only take time i take a shotgun to a test to set gun shotgun i'm going to ever try to shotgun see if it shoots straight michael he's a turkey hunter so he knows that you want that shotgun even to shoot a turkey you want those the the compound of those many bullets to be a certain place and you want to know where that's going but that's the only time you want to use a unless unless you want to go squirrel hunting with a shotgun you can do that too but listen when it comes to a rifle you want it dead on caleb back there he he know he knows we've spent time together and you know it's just not good enough unless it's right there in the bullseye especially a certain distance because we know that when it gets way out there it'll miss the whole target huh if you're a deer hunter and you go out there and you see a big old monster book well i tell you what there's one thing i've always wanted to do that if i see that book i want to let you see him i want to bring him home and i don't want to hear no excuses well i missed him not when you got a weapon like a rifle in your hand that reaches way out there because i'll tell you what if you shoot and you miss that deer you absolutely sinned you have missed the mark it didn't do you no good to hunt him all that time and all that effort that you put into it and all the court you put out it didn't do you a billy good because you failed when it come right down to the time because she wasn't precise and everything else has to be in order isn't that right you can't flinch i mean those flinching you can't jerk you got to watch for twigs and branches use all kinds of obstacles you got to watch for and so always in our christian life you got to watch for those obstacles in your life that want to trip you up in your christian walk with god you got to be precise about it oh my how we could think of daniel daniel and lion said how many knows that he was precise they said you can't pray and they said they can't pray right well he kept right on praying how many times a day hey [Music] three times a day he was precise about his prayer life and when it comes down to him being thrown in the lions then god didn't spare him he let him throw him in the lungs then we expect to be saved long before then but god don't always save you before the lines he lets you fall into the lion's den but guess what how many knows god was precise on time because those lions didn't want to even come close to daniel they don't like fire there was a pillar of fire with daniel and it kept them away from daniel huh daniel made the right choice i don't care what the world says i'm going to pray anyway christianity nowadays is at an all-time low so to speak it's looked down upon amen they call them conservatives huh look down upon i don't care how much it's looked down upon still the only way still the greatest way it's the thing that will triumph over everything else and no matter how much they did that daniel didn't care what the local government did they were he was gonna pray to his god same way with the three hebrew children what were the three hebrew children's name somebody say it out loud i'm wondering why there ain't no more shad racks around brother john where's our b shots where's our vietnamese amen a bit shadrach good names right not kane not dathan even saul not really huh saul in the old testament he was not much count saul in the new testament needed a new name before he was worth the time to be called paul that's why we have so many pulse johns peters huh anyway let's get back on on thought here oh my now notice he said you know i've seen it do it and i sat down there when the other brethren they were shooting at squirrels they anywhere they wanted to hit him it was all right mid center back anywhere and i was under the tree crying why can't i get my gun right can you imagine a man so nervous over a gun it bothered brother adam he was crying about i just can't get it right the other brethren that's the way listen with denominations churches out there well if you're a little bit of a lesbian or a homosexual or this side or the other you know god loves us all or maybe uh my god don't care about how the sister's dress or if he cuts his hair or not when paul said it's a shame for her to do it wear pants it's an abomination in the sight of god for a woman to wear the garment pertains to a man it was never accepted years ago think about it just shoot here splatter there you don't have to doesn't matter how you baptize it doesn't matter if you believe in one god yeah it does how many believes are god's group god's children they want to be precise upon i want the right way i want god's way that's the only way is god's way every other way is wrong my thinking's wrong you're thinking i have to forget all my thinking let the bible do my thinking for me let this might be in you which was also in christ jesus [Music] give me a whole new mind and you talk about brave you talk about a christian and then when you get the baptism of the holy ghost before they got the holy ghost on the day of pentecost remember peter in them they were scared in the upper room they were afraid that more soldiers were gonna come and drag them away and crucify them but they were in that upper room but after they got the holy ghost oh my they wouldn't come out from that upper room and they went out into the coke home place and and begin to preach to the whole group they were not afraid to get into the middle of a crowd and say hey y'all god give us more courage like hey y'all i'd give a thousand dollars so one senator would get up there and just blast him the way that it is when he's got his voice in congress just tell them how it is tell him the reason that the world's falling apart and there you can't find god no worries because you put him out how's it going how is that working out for you not so good right this country was based upon christianity upon belief in god and you have put him out now you'll get the fruit of your own way yeah that's right you better be scared of those bombs that russia's got waiting for you because these gave god the one waiting on us brother brown to say last thing he seen in america was it completely annihilated burned over completely burned over he says that's what's going to happen with this place i'm looking to get out of here and if i'm gonna get out of here if you're gonna get out of here this morning how many believes you're gonna have to be more precise about your life you're gonna have to be more precise about your prayer life i believe it's the holy spirit calling us amen jesus said man shall not live by by the law but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god shall man live by you'll never be victorious unless you get rid of all unbelief separate yourself from all of your unbelief all of your own ways we got too much of our own ways too much of our own thinking left yet we got to be precise about how we live well i don't know if i'll go to church tonight you sloppy you are so sloppy [Music] i don't know if i'll read my bible i don't know if i'll pray you sloppy [Music] i don't know about you but i'm not satisfied until i get the baptism of the holy ghost and he's leading me and guiding me and directing me i'm not happy in this church until we have the same kind of services that they used to have if you used to hit zero it can hit zero again think about it god's bull's-eye is hebrews 13 8 he don't never change he's the same yesterday today and forever he don't die he don't get old he don't forget he's alive today as he was when david drew goliath he's alive today as he went and killed the lion oh aren't you no aren't you glad that god is real god is alive he's dead up my word has gone forth and it will not return void god says heaven and earth will pass away but my word it's gonna hit its mark we used to be better men and women we used to be that if we said something that was a bond that was the bull's eye you could rely on it but look at where it's gotten to today huh lord help us we better get zeroed in says you know here i am in a pulpit here and i know i've got the answer today of judgment but he says the voice came back when he was crying about that he says i made you that way i made you that way that you would be irritated if it doesn't hit the bullseye that's why oh the prophet of god that's why everything he taught it was exactly according to the bible he says don't you just put your name on the book and be thinking that you're a part of the church of god the bible says by one spirit are we all baptized to one body that's how you come into christ that's the real joining of church it's be by the baptism of the holy ghost you are joined into the body of christ and members in particular that's how you become a member not just by shaking the preacher's hand or showing up in church or being regular in church said don't do it you got to be born by the spirit of god jesus says unless a man is born again he'll never see the kingdom of heaven all you have is a mental conception of it [Music] amen you love the lord let's not miss the mark let's be more precise it's got to be that on we have to be zeroed amen zeroed on what the road on what zeroed on christ how many remembers christ's mystery of god revealed by the band talks about how that in the bible says you know the mystery of christ is christ in you the hope of glory christ is the center of the revelation of the whole thing he says therefore our conversation in our life it all ought to be centered around christ everything we do everything we say our reaction has to be centered in christ it has to be like christ huh how about let's make a deal this morning i'll look at my life and see if every portion of it is centered you look at yours look at your life really good and see if everything you do everything you say every action that you have it's focused on christ how much we have heard in the last couple months of uh having god's morning when you get up having him wearing the middle of the day telling your children about it tying up on your bedpost day and night meditated on a day and night heaven centered on him because how many knows you get that vision you got that vision of him in the center of your life off and it ain't long before you're doing things way off and you get a little off how about way out there huh people not these pews are a lot of pews are empty folks from people who have gotten off got their focus off their vision off of the center and that is christ in you the hope of glory remember when the power of god come back from beyond the curtain of time he said there's nothing but perfect love there there wasn't anybody there remembering what somebody else had done to them nobody there like that there was nobody there with bitterness no hatred or variance none whatsoever and he began to zero it down and i say you know and it'll take perfect love to put you in there i'm here to tell you christ wants us perfectly in him he wants us perfectly in him i'll go a little further he wants you to be perfect [Music] is that a mouse can i hear a mouse we're getting quiet now aren't we it's quiet when the preacher says we gotta be perfect i say unto you jesus matthew 5 41 44 but i say unto you well let me go back one you have heard that it has been said thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate that enemy but i say until you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you pray for them that despitefully use you and persecute you [Music] can i take my time folks i want you to know that god does not want a fair weather friend i want to tell you right now i don't like a fair weather friend when i say i'm your friend i try to be that through the thick and the thin through the good and the bad no matter what i'm gonna be your friend hello some friends the first time somebody does a little something against ain't no friends no more i'm gonna defriend him you never was much of a friend in the first place go ahead and befriend me if you please would i don't want a friend like you amen how about god oh my remember he says and it was my way he chose my way brother chose god's way that's a smart choice that's a that's a precise choice to choose god's way remember another scripture that comes to my mind is where uh over in hebrews that i believe it was hebrews he says you know i won't let them come i won't let them enter into my rest because you know they stumbled they fell at this side or the other and he says and they have not known my ways people don't know god's way god's way is for you to go through some really hard times as a christian and still love god anyway i ain't quitting for nothing that's god's way god allowed all kinds of hardships to befall israel huh he let him get thirsty he let him get hungry he let him get trapped and nowhere to go running in circles down there by the red sea what are we going to do what are we going to do what we're going to do i'd love to get you to say what am i going to do what am i going to do because then you're going to make a choice well god well i'll tell you what god gonna be like that right or just stand still and watch god bring us through the thing that's what he's looking for he was looking for that in daniel he was looking for the rack and we never finished my side dragon we shot him indigo shadrach meshach and abednego they didn't know for sure whether god was going to do it or not but they made a right and correct and precise choice and they got in the king's face and said we are not very careful about how we tell you this but we're not dying and it made that king so mad because they were disrespectful to him you know we are not bound to that image he got that furnace seven times hotter i will fry the boys god didn't stop it didn't deliver him he let him fall in the very soldiers that pushed him in that fiery furnace died because of the heat but when the king went to looking at him all burnt to a crisp he says didn't we throw three in there yeah there's four and the fourth man looks like the son of god hello lord they made the right choice they made the precise choice and god was there precisely on time if you will be precise about your choices god will be precise about you oh man that ought to get us running around this church it ought to make us so we can't hardly stand ourselves to know that if you will give oh i want more of jesus more and more and more i want more of jesus so i give him more of me make a choice to serve god see what happens reject him and see what happens aren't you glad make the right make the choice not be let me just say this a lot of times we have to get another job you know why because we got fired i know about you but i don't like to get fired it forces you to have to go out there and look for another job huh you might have a car wreck and you really like that car but guess what now you're forced to get another car there's a lot of problems a lot of issues sometimes trials that we have that force us into things and we adjust accordingly don't we we are survivors the human beings two are survivors but that's not the kind i'm talking about you know what i'm talking about when brother ben made a choice he wasn't forced into it he wasn't coerced into it it was his choosing that angel said it was you just something you chose to do [Applause] not because he was pushed god can push us into anything is that right but when you make a choice let me tell you this the atomic bombs aren't flying the economy hasn't crashed crashed we all got food in our fridge in our freezers and everything is going good huh i would dare say most of us are doing better than probably ever have maybe not all maybe not all but think about it and it's not a catastrophe that's pushing us into something but i'm here to tell you god is looking at what you will do and how you will serve him in the good times even israel he says you know you were skinny and all alone and everything but now you've gotten fat and you have forsaken me and you have forgotten where you was huge from people forget that hey it's when it's going good that's when you need to remember god when you need to get even more closer to god not just the bad times don't make god have to throw you on your back in some hospital to get you to get closer to him i don't want him to have to do that to me amen god is good isn't he all right i got another ten minutes is that all right i love the lord don't you don't be sloppy because i don't know about you but i have been many times in my life too sloppy with things i don't know about if you're anything like me or not but you're too sloppy with things but in my old age i'm sure everyone reminds me no as you get older you're less sloppy about things folks how about if you have a job how many knows you're not sloppy if you want that job you better be there at seven o'clock you're not better not be sloppy or you'll lose your job you sisters you can't be too sloppy or your house is gonna look really terrible them dishes are gonna stink in that tank wow you can't be stopping you got to get it done you got to do something with it you got to make a choice amen and then you've got the extremists right to where it's just got to be perfect the carpet in that certain room you go back and forth a certain way and you want to see all those lines just perfectly don't just go wrong in a circle vacuum back you know extremists maybe we need to be that about our life be an extremist about your life because if you're sloppy folks you're going to have a rough life it's not going to be good amen lord help us amen you love him this morning praise the lord many scriptures we could go to but we're not perfect paul said we're not perfect i haven't quite gotten there yet but i'm working on it i'm forgetting no things behind and i'm pressing on i'm pressing for the mark for the prize of the high calling even paul said you know though that run in a race run all but he said one receives the prize i mean those are churches churches churches churches brides to all kind of people but there's one that's going to be there with him he's going to have a church that's without spot without wrinkle amen thank you lord hold on a minute i didn't finish my scripture he brought me back to it despitefully use you and persecute you that you may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh the sun to rise on the evil and the good and send us reign on the just and the unjust and if you love them which love you what what reward have you do not even republicans the same and if you sleep you salute your brother only do not others also do not even republicans that way isn't that the way that it is every clan i don't care what it is every group of people they love their own and they make fun of the others huh they don't care so much about the others let me just say this imagine a world where everybody did this it would be a perfect world everybody would love everybody he'd have perfect love with everybody there would be no racial things there would be no barriers between rich or poor or or whatever it might be everybody would love everybody and isn't it strange isn't it something that brother i mean not brother but jesus himself stopped and used the illustration of loving your enemies and the very last words he used be ye therefore perfect even as your daddy is perfect to put it in the new version even as your father which is in heaven is perfect amen the way that i have been taught of what perfection is is that if you are in christ as long as you're still in this flesh this flesh will still make mistakes but if instantly when you make that mistake you say god forgive me god still sees you as perfect he sees you as perfect because you're being cleansed as you go because you know i know both know that this flesh will always strip you up there always be somewhere huh but you know we as preachers we got to be careful when it comes to this subject it's a touchy subject because easily we can say well you'll never be perfect now be careful because if you lean too much that way all you're telling people is you don't got to worry about being perfect you ain't gotta worry about the mistake and those failures that you have hey if it's sin and if it's against the word of god you'd ought to hurt you when you do it you ought to be oh my folks i think every christian in here of the mistakes that you've made in the past i say that because of personal experience when you look back at those mistakes you really still regret him you still regret him oh if i just wouldn't have done that amen so in closing how many this morning would say lord help me this morning to be more precise let me make the precise decision the right decision because how many knows every decision that you make that's wrong it's gonna it's it's terrible it's god's not gonna bless it but every choice that you make that is right and according to him god will bless you for it god help us this morning to make right choices right choices correct choices precise choices once again most of us that want to be precise about something a lot of times something that seems simple you go over it and you go over it you check it out this way and that way huh you think about it you really really dissect it before you actually do something because you want it the right way that's the way you ought to do in your life don't be sloppy when it comes to your christian life be like paul the center of his life was christ god bless you stand with me if you will bowed heads knowing full well we truly believe that the presence of jesus christ is here this morning there's anybody that has never accepted the lord as their savior you want to raise your hand say i want to accept jesus as my savior i want to confess him right here right here i want to just confess the lord jesus christ with my heart god bless you god bless you most of us no doubt have done that already and that's why we don't raise our hands because we've already done that but what about the sloppiness in our lives and you want to say god i really do need to be more precise lord god bless those hands all over the building lord jesus i need to be more precise about my life and the way that i walk with you enoch was translated and he was not but before he had his testimony he was precise in pleasing god in his life lord jesus that's what we want this morning as we raise our hands lord jesus we want to be precise and live the way that you want us to live lord lord we want to lay aside every weight we want to check everything about the way that we've got our guns aimed and the way that we're pointing and the way that we're going lord jesus we want to check our lives to make sure that we're living by the token because lord we're told that we better lay aside everything else until that token is in our life which is the literal life of jesus christ living in us and to have that perfect love that's in our heart lord jesus because that's the only thing that's going to be there that's the only thing that's going to make the rapture the mark of the rapture lord it'll only be if those that have that absolute the love of god in their hearts and lord jesus most of all we also want to be able to say that we're your friend as we read wednesday you said if you are my friends if you do whatsoever i command you lord so we ask god that you'd help us to be precise about everything in our life lord bless our hands this morning we raise to you now lord we say we want to be more like you jesus i want more of jesus more and more and more i want more of jesus so i'll give him right now more of me we ask these blessings and favors in jesus name amen and amen turn your bibles if you will we'll go into the communion service first corinthians first corinthians
