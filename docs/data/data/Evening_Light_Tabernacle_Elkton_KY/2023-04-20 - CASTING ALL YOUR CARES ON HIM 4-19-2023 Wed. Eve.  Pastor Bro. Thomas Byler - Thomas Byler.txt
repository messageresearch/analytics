praise report just a minute or two um I just wanted to thank the Lord so back in November of 2020 I was actually flying here Celia and um a friend gave me a handgun the day before as a gift and I forgot it in my carry-on bag and brought it through at the airport and uh I got arrested at the airport and my parents were with me and They confiscated the gun but they ended up letting me get on my flight and everything but I never thought I'd see a gun again I didn't know if I was going to get prosecuted when I was reading online and they said it was a minimum three thousand dollar fine from TSA um and then the state could prosecute too so I was really nervous but back then we just prayed and committed to God and said whatever happens and I never heard anything about them um but I kind of always lived in the back of my head just waiting for the phone call that it was time to go to court and on Monday I got a call from a detective with Seattle Police Department and he told me that the statue of limitations has run out on the case they never prosecuted so I'm free and clear and they also shipped a gun here to Elkton so I got to come back too so I just want to thank the Lord all right I've never been more happy to pay a 25 shipping fee better than a three thousand dollar fine amen I was down this evening as brother Butler comes listening Jesus the light of the world oh don't you Saints of light Proclaim when Jesus the light of the world my life and mercy in his name Jesus the light of the world shine all around us Jesus the light of the world hear the savior's earnest [Music] [Music] drops of Mercy are Pride [Music] thank you musicians we appreciate it amen amen so I think it's what not this is it not this Sunday but the next or special meetings are or is it two more Sundays two more Sundays isn't it yeah I think it is two all right so we're looking forward to that so we'll try to hey man I don't know if I'll preach all of the services from here and then or not but we'll just see amen good to see you all tonight God bless you good to see everybody tonight and and just to be in the house of the Lord amen amen come to the doctor's office today amen praise the Lord so amen I was praying about what to speak on and just didn't really was trying to find the mind of the Lord and thought about the fruit is Spirit you know just talk about the fruit of the spirit and go through that but amen I was kind of going through something this week that was just kind of laying on Weighing on my heart and amen the Lord just kind of give me a little thought from it so I'm just going to share that with you amen and so I trust it'll be a blessing to everybody tonight amen hey man so let's just bow our heads Lord Jesus we come before your father so grateful Lord Jesus that we can rely on you father to come and to speak to the church God the things that we have need of hearing father Lord to cause us to have a closer walk with you Lord to be more like you Lord Jesus and we do appreciate father Sunday's service Lord father just miss so many meant so much for us Lord Jesus how that we can amen sometimes just get too comfortable Lord Jesus and gets lack on you father but we know God that you always bring us back lord and so we ask God that you would just help us fathers Lord we know that it has to be your mind it has to be your word and father I pray God that we go from here are better people than what we come Lord and we know father that you'll speak to us if we'll just yield ourselves to you father Lord we just ask God you'll bless the meditation of our heart now in the reading of the word in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen and amen it's always good to be in the house of the Lord amen amen praise the Lord I believe everybody that's holy he goes still loves to come to the house of God amen praise the Lord all right this is going to be going back a little bit on the message I've certainly ministered on before but we want to try to just go over it again I hope you don't mind amen and it has to do with really it has to do with guarding guarding ourselves amen um and also about having a walk with the Lord amen and uh so turn your bibles if you will to II Peter first Peter if you will we'll just get into the word first Peter and I'll just kind of share you with my testimony a little bit first Peter and five first Peter 5. and verse 6 humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you in due time casting all your cares upon Him for he careth for you and I believe she titled that casting all your cares upon Him amen praise the Lord for he careth for you be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour whom resists steadfast in the faith amen I hope that that will be a key word that we use and expound on this evening amen resisting the devil Amen in faith amen how many knows that your faith is what quenches all the fiery darts of the wicked amen faith we also understand is not one of the five senses that we have but in a Believer is the only one really that has this it has that called The Prophet called it is Sixth Sense amen how many believes we've got to live by that Sixth Sense amen knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world but the God of all Grace who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus after that ye have suffered a while make you perfect established strengthened and settle you amen may God add His blessings to reading of the word you can be seated tonight amen amen I was just kind of going through something a little bit this week something was just kind of Weighing on my mind and amen and all my heart and I was just seeking the Lord about it and praying about it and amen this came to me amen and about casting all your cares upon Him for he cares for you amen of course just being able to pray and being able to commit it to God I experienced the experience of being able to images lay it on the Lord and just give it to the god amen and and I stand here with that amen gone with that care so to speak out of my heart out of my life so I believe that it's you can do that amen it believes you can do that you can cast your cares on the Lord because he cares for you amen now another place you know Jesus I believe it was said in Matthew 11 and 28 he says come unto me all ye that laborer and our heavy laden and I will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn to me for our meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest unto your souls amen so we could look at it we realize that you and I were born with a heavy weight on us amen a lot of cares and I'll tell you what a man that is born of a woman is a few days and amen full of trouble so you can expect a whole lot of trouble in this world other than that you know and then not only that but all the days of your life now unfortunately those that don't have Christ don't have a place to take their cares a place to take their burdens their weight amen but the Christian does we've got somewhere where we can take it praise the Lord and God will just fix us up so to speak you know I had to think you know this week I was going and I was trying to work on my tractor and getting Tobacco off of it and so forth taking them big hydraulic hoses off something I'd never done before and so anyway we took it off and realized that somehow we got to plug them hoses hoses and artists Hydraulics you're gonna go screw viewing everywhere right don't take much of a Byler to figure that one out you know but anyway that went uh I went you know I went to Lewisburg and they had the size before then the size above it below it and above it the ones that hey uh up here to Elk and there they do hydraulic hoses they had the one above it they had the one below but I went over to aiming all the way over to that place over there in Russellville and they do and I forget the name of the place but it's a big Dave's slices and hydraulics there the thing below it and above us and then they had two of them that had a special coupling on it you know and it was 25 or more dollars each and it was five fifty two dollars or so for for just two little couplings and they said but I can have it tomorrow you know I can have them for about eleven dollars you know and I needed about four of them because I want to plug everything that needs plugged I got some extra but anyway car you know it was a little frustrating and then so it was the next day of course the next day I come to find out they didn't have they didn't get it so we'll get it in tomorrow and I'm like oh boy you know this place deals with this you know so anyway that Tractor Supply to Nava we went to the other places over there nobody hardly had it you know but uh you know it's nice when you go to a place and they have what you need amen amen and you know Paul said my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in Christ Jesus so when we come to church folks I want you to know when you come to Christ you come to a place that he can take care of what your need is oh aren't you glad for that amen and I don't care what your care is I don't care what problem is your trouble is your trial is it don't matter Cass not some of your cares about it but it casts all your cares upon Him for he cares about you how many knows he knows everything about you not like living for the Lord because I'll tell you now that if you didn't have a daily walk with Christ and you didn't have fellowship with on them a daily basis you'd be a miserable person oh my God praise the Lord but you know I want to go into something with the help of the Lord but now I know there's not I want to just realize that you know that we come to church we come to Christ not just church but certainly this should be a place that when you have a need for something amen and I want to finish the story but anyway they ordered it did they said they'll be a day later so today I went there and they had my coupling so praise the Lord hallelujah you know but you know when I went there at first I needed two males and I I believe it was two males and a female right well I got so caught up in trying to find something that they give me four males well I got home and I said I forgot about the female you know I need to tell them I need a female and so I got that you know I got back to the track this afternoon you know and I said I gotta go try that see away from that back end you know and in any way come to find out no no you're still stuck that's this boy that's just how it is with heavy equipment you know it takes three days to try to get a couple plugs or something you know but you're gonna have to be patient but anyway so anyway now where was I yeah I'm about as forgetful as I did about the female right but anyway it was diving away and realizing no you gotta have females so thank God I had their car took their card with me right I give them a call hey yeah thanks for getting me them caps real nice like you know I appreciate it and I realized I need a female also can you order me yeah no problem we'll have it at 9 o'clock oh not happy but whenever your need is supplied how many believe that Christ surprise you or need tonight amen so we can catch all of our care all of our cares we can cast upon him oh my cares are like needs or or things you know uh things that you have need of your carers amen and do so cast all of those upon him praise the Lord you know now and I want to go into something like I said have you preached on many times before but I want to go into it again because we realize that it says here that the devil be over be vigilant because your adversary the devil has a roaring God walketh about seeking whom he may devour tonight's service it's got to have it's got to do with dying daily I was thinking on the way to church you know amen you mean I gotta deny daily what that means is that you've got to kill yourself every day yeah you get every day and I don't nobody gonna commit the suicide here folks let's not misread this But You Gotta Die to yourself that's chance to die every day why because that self always wants to raise up amen info now we know that better brand of preach a message called the greatest battle that was ever fought wouldn't it any minute he got his message I'll just love the way the prophet God could lay down out there under the river green beans look up in the skies and get it he can pick up a cigarette back and get him in he could drive down the road and get the message you know and so anyway he was looking at the solar system and the galaxies and everything like that and he realized that all of those places you know they have a place amen and they stay where they're supposed to be amen and he talked and he began to talk about what our greatest battle is and how did our greatest battle starts in the mind and the human mind is where the great battle star amen and that's where the problem is right here I like what Phil Bontrager he says I talked about he says if you can bring every thought captive to the word of God Amen it'll stop a lot of problems in your life yeah why do we gotta Die daily because the devil don't stop the devil don't never stop trying to get you and if you don't die every day and if you don't know what you're fighting why you never know how to defeat him but this man's caught the greatest battle ever found it's a great message see brother begins to talk about amen he begins with talking about the three little rings and I really was wishing that I'd have had about another day because I really want to get back on my projector and so forth up there and and you know a little much more teaching and so on but he's at the three little Rings which was the body and the three second one was the spirit but inside of that third one was the soul amen and he talked about on the outside we have she taste feel here and smell damn it and so many people and you and I whether you taste I don't deal with so much you know and smell I don't deal with so much you know because that has a whole lot to do with the state that I ate today nice State too you know but it's really gotten very little spiritual significance but not the things that I see the things that I hear hello Amy not that has a bearing on my life and the way that I no I mean the way that we feel has a big balance on our life amen and so that's control but the man talked about how they were controlled by these senses or we make contact with this Earth through these census how many believe that amenities outer senses and so forth now on the inside since of course we realize on the spiritual side is your mind is in the spirit Realm how many believe that your mind is in the spirit realm and Brother Band talk about how that we have conscience we have reasoning we have memories we have infect affections and we have imaginations thank you wow and we got a lot of noise huh that better something up here huh well well well just get on out of here Dev I know you just don't like this service already all right let's see what I'm doing wrong all right you all get to see whether I know how to do this thing or not all right we'll let the clip be back there somewhere praise the Lord all right so we see you in the in the spiritual realm we have we have an imaginations and these are all I call them 12 doors 12 doors that the devil can get into you he can give you problems with he can give me problems with because see part of my problem was is the devil tried to get in my memory this week and he tried to make me think things because so what you think affects you I mean it affects your whole world the thoughts that you allow to go through your mind affects you oh my it's a very very important thing this right here is amen devil as of support don't worry about your neighbor don't never know about nobody else just think about you just think about yourself that's what I think about myself amen it's quite something but you know in our government oh I take accountability for what I didn't but after they're in office no they didn't you know immigration problems that's happening now that was Trump's fault oh that's really taking responsibility they didn't do that when he was here and the American people they just swallowed up don't they but let me tell you as a Christian to me as a Christian we got to take responsibility for ourselves how many believe that got to take responsibility for ourself it's your world it's your mind it's your your Galaxy is the prophet of God's head amen oh my now notice so we see that there's those those and then there's two more there's actually two more actually let's say yeah do more things all right dispute realm is affections and all of those but in this song oh how many knows that only has one of two that's gonna govern you Faith or doubt Faith or doubt your whole world everything else amen all of you all of your feelings all of your imaginations all of your spirit is going to be controlled by the property God said by the three moral agency uh the power of self-will the choice that you make of whether you're going to be operated by doubt or whether you're going to be operated by faith I may believe that amen now conscious let's just talk about it's for a little bit because that means they want to get they don't like Christians they don't like for women to walk down into Walmart with a dress on and long hair because they're conscious they know that what they're doing is wrong that's what they're supposed to dress like you realize that you are the world's conscience they know better they know but they don't like it and if the devil Devil Couldn't he wants to get rid of the Christians why do you think they kill them get rid of them give me the one I'm not we don't want no Commandments we don't want nothing but to do with God because their conscience bothers them remember even brother man said they're all laughing you this out of the other day of a conscience that bothers somebody trying to appease themselves and they're trying to satisfy that in Old way and getting themselves fixed by having a fix or the drugs or all of that trying to drown out their conscience foreign you glad that you don't have to do all of that because you came to the place to work for your conscience and things are taken care of they know they're going to come to the door of death they know they're going to die huh we know that we're gonna pass away but we won't have to be scared of it huh and it bothers them people even go to church people go to church and denominations church and everything else to try to appease their mind and their conscience but it can never bring its satisfaction amen just one of those things is precious how many believes it's precious to have a conscience we're supposed to be sensitive in our conscience but sensitive with everything that we do every word that we speak amen but people as the prophet of God said don't have any conscience a lot of people don't have conscience amen so we think about these different avenues that the devil actually tries to work in now notice Let me just read on and in the end on the inside amen you're a free Malaysian you either accept it or reject or rejected you to accept Faith or doubt and that creates and makes your world now notice that for Satan begin at the principle of part to cause the spirit of man to doubt God's word at first I thought about speaking on the power of the spoken word or the power of the word because remember this that God uses word to create our world and the devil uses word to deceive us he uses word God has said she said and the devil said yeah but huh Thou shalt not surely he used words and brought this whole thing into what it is because of somebody believing the wrong word how many beliefs it's a very important what word you allowed to go in your mind a thought that you allowed to go in your mind and it's a daily Bible folks I know I know because the devil will try to cause you to have a memory an infection and things like that because we all have affection we're supposed to have affection feel kindly affectionate one to another isn't that right people don't even have that they don't even have any kind of a feeling now notice this and I want to just say this greatest battle on paragraph 52 but the RAM says if this church right now could be put together and knitted together with such that every person would be in one Accord with not one shadow of a doubt anywhere there wouldn't be one feeble person in our midst in another five minutes oh my there would not be nobody here Desiring the Holy Ghost but what would receive and if you could get that something fixed oh my hello how many of those Let Jesus fix it I believe this is a fixer-up place this is where Jesus fixes that what does he do he teaches us the cast all of our cares upon him for he cares for you now we know that we are all born in sin shaping and they will get it coming into the world speaking lies we all come needing fixed we need fixed and a lot of times we fall short of the glory of God a lot of times we fail we need fixed amen I hope you don't leave this building tonight until you get fixed if you need fixing tonight amen no sense in it amen praise the Lord all right praise be the God now notice what he said now first it must be accepted in the mind and then it's believed with the heart then the word of God become a reality I mean believe that amen first before you can ever become the kind of Christian that you're supposed to be you have to first receive it in your mind then believe it with your heart amen and then it becomes a reality amen amen now notice I'm gonna stop there and read perhaps the other half here in a little bit you see way back Yonder he says if we want to open up our channels then and we've uh we can see we find that about this one and that one over there thousands of them testifying of what God has done but the devil will try to come right back see if he could get in there at all amen if notice if he can get in our Senses at all he's got your army routed right then how many knows if he can get you see your teeth you feel you hear your smell if he can get in any of those channels he's got you who got you right there your affection you look at the wrong thing how many of those he's got you right there I mean you got to watch what you look at you gotta watch what kind of affections you have um I want to go somewhere but I'm going to hold off praise the Lord he got your army routed but right back right then if you've got your senses your seed tastes feel hear and smell he says they're all right but don't trust them unless they agree with the word praise be to God how many knows even while I was while I was struggling with this thought that the devil put in my mind it caused me to feel a certain way and then I said now I know that that feeling isn't the way that I should feel huh this feeling that I got is causing me to have thoughts that I shouldn't think huh it's not according to the word whoa man am I ever glad and I prayed and I prayed and I cast my cares upon Him and all of a sudden God give me the right thought all of a sudden my mind began to think the right thoughts and my feeling begin to feel right again it's not always easy to take the right things because the devil will come into your memory over a minute oh you remember this and you remember don't let the devil come in there in your memory because most of the time the devil coming oh you remembered I'll tell you right now if I would go back and I think about everything I ever done wrong I'd just pretty much want to damn myself don't even don't even bring it back don't even pick it up I don't want to hear it because that ain't nothing but huh wouldn't we all we all we dwell on the past on your past the failures that you've had come into that memory amen then it'll make you think like you shouldn't think feel like you shouldn't feel praise the Lord amen I'm happy in the Lord anyway it doesn't matter it would come my way follow you on how many please there's after such a thrill in Victory can I say something we either live Victorious lives or defeated lives I believe as Christians sin should be under our feet all of our affections and all of our reasons and all our emotes sometimes we have good days and sometimes we have bad days I ain't got nothing to do with it amen praise the Lord oh my praise God let me go on now notice don't trust them unless they agree with the word that's right listen they're okay but if they disagree with the word don't you listen to them how many's ever had a feeling huh that was a really bad feeling and you knew that wasn't God let me tell you as a Christian all of us as mature Christians here for mature Christians not just We Are Tonight you can tell when you've got a feeling that you shouldn't have amen we don't go by those feelings we bring those feelings under subjection say God I'm casting my feelings on you Lord my memories on you I'm cast my memory on the Lord cast all your cares for on him for he cares for you you know I wrote a couple things down I'll just maybe mention it well maybe I'll read it when you don't cast your cares upon Him it means that you have a lack of faith in him you're not operating by faith whether you don't cast your cares because whatever your care is he can fix it he can take care of it amen but a lot of times sometimes we we try to fix things ourselves because either we think that God is not able but most likely we do it because we know God isn't going to fix it the way we want it fixed so we're going to fix it the way we want to fix it and that's when we get our dirty hands in it and mess it up royally and I'm here to tell you when you do that it's the devil governing you the devil governing me when I'm going to fix something that we all want to fix it I'm going to make it happen let me tell you something that's an Esau person there's always a spiritual church and there's a natural carnal search the carnal Church tries to achieve it by natural means I'm going to make this happen no no no give it to the Lord cast your cares upon Him and let him take care of it for you he who shall supply all your need amen Lord help me when I think about it these I'll tell you what these emotions and these affections these feelings if they're not a whack it's a terrible thing are you with me nobody likes to feel terrible have bad affections and all of that nobody praise be to God I thought you know now notice let's go on so now imaginations oh boy do we let our imaginations run away from us sometimes don't we conscience memories reasons and affections they're all right if they agree with the word but if your affection doesn't agree with the word I mean knows if you ain't got the right affection then get rid of that affection you got the wrong affection amen get rid of it you'll blow a flu right quick if you reason if your reason disagrees with the word get away from it amen or any of those things now notice what do you got then you've got a solar system Hallelujah God sets the Stars up there in order and says hang out till I call you stay right there can we say that to our feelings and our emotions you stay in check say where you're supposed to be might you stay where you're supposed to be now notice and stay right there nothing's gonna move them when God can get a man in his hands till he can get all of his senses and conscience and all of that cleaned out until there he stands God there behind it in the spirit there's not a devil in the world that can poke in there whoa folks don't miss that tonight if you don't go home with nothing else but if you've got the faith of soldier of faith in there amen guarding every emotion every faction every Avenue that the devil will come at you with he can roar all they want stupid they'll never go in there if the holy spirit is in there governing controlling every portion of you amen oh my praise be to God aren't you glad for that now notice let me just say did like this now notice now what's the matter see she had to open up a Channel first before anything bad comes either like Eve before she could take any word in she had to open up her mind isn't that right the devil uses it the same way God uses it you'll never be saved until you believe your Gods who loved the world and he gave his only begotten son whosoever believeth him shall not perish isn't that right till you believe that with all of your heart now notice now you've got the soldier the Holy Spirit placed at the Battlefront to take God's word see he is the word and he stands then there's nothing going to stop it then nothing every one of the other channels are cleared up just like an old boiler with flu stopped up you put a fire in a Blow The Thing Up he said that's what's the matter with so many blowed up Christians is because if they don't clean that channel now how many believe we got to keep our channels every channel clear keep it cleaned up amen because I'll tell you right now the people of the world they do not keep it clean they run away for their affections they've run away with their emotions they run away with their imaginations completely run away look at where they at today my my you tonight can be very thankful if you've got faith in the word of God and it holds you there brings every one of your emotions whether it's your conscience whether it's your feeling whether it's your factions whether it's your memory whatever it is in check that's not according to the word that's not according to dirt amen the devil can't touch you how many wants to be the way a place that the devil can't touch you how many people it takes to dying daily because you'll have feelings tomorrow again you'll have factions again tomorrow you'll have thoughts again tomorrow let me love all of those here every day that I was looking for a place to get in amen but Lord help us all right amen they don't go down there on the inside it's got to get cleaned out lay aside everything and been coming from the inside out amen with an unadulterated word of God that's truly the truth praise be to God Amen now notice if one little iota of God's word was disbelief believing the word you can't do it you got to shut off all these other things conscience memory reasonings other things amen casting down reasoning we don't reason about it at all nothing at all just accept it on the what the word of God has said and so and it sets a stream now notice this front line it's it sets a stream between you and God and every channel comes open between you and God then he says there's the battle that's the very front lying somebody believes that's where the front line of every one of our battles is is this right here you got to deal with this right here see taste feel hear smell Faith or doubt amen watch you take in what you what you believe the word that you take in amen that's where it's all at according to the prophet of God amen now something else that I thought about amen thank you well let me let me finish this other quote before I go into there notice he says it must be accepted in the mind and so forth he says and then he says in every sense of your soul and body poured out with the Holy Spirit then your sense of God your conscience of God you're everything that's Godly flows through you how many ones that see that's what I want everything that's Godly flows through me amen there's not a doubt anywhere there's nothing that can rise up there's nothing that can come up in your memory saying well miss so and so they tried to trust God it doesn't matter how many tried it and it didn't make it or fail or whatever it doesn't matter amen now no matter what Miss Jones or one of them did now notice but Abraham says kill him at the beginning stop him dead in his tracks how many believes in stopping the devil dead in his tracks it ain't how long you can make the war linger huh how many knows sometimes we fight with stuff for a long long time I have years and years and years Amen to fight with things fight with things in my mind oh my praise be to God you know I want to say about memory especially me when I was thinking about memory and the things that the devil tried to bring back in my mind you know I thought Lord Jesus I am so glad that I don't have to remember all that I can cast all of that in the Lord because if I would live by the things that I would remember I would be nuts I would be crazy you would probably be too huh amen now notice hey that's right now notice no matter don't make the war linger it's stop it right now if you'll come and you'll keep them memories and conscience and everything that you're thinking about well I might fail and so forth he says don't even do that at all throw it aside and open up the channel and say God your word is eternally true and it's for me if the whole church failed if the whole world fails yet I can't fail because I am taking your word let's talk about that word the rest of the service for about 10 or so minutes well let's go out early tonight Tommy I know he's got a long way to go whether Steve's got just as far as not feather amen amen we appreciate how long distance God persons amen and our short distance people but listen let's talk about that word with the help of the Lord first of all the word the Bible talks about how that wears to bring to bring every thought into captivity to what The Obedience of the word of God I was thinking today amen about uh something that Jesus said it is found in Matthew 12 Matthew 12. this is where I want to just say something as a pastor here to the congregation here to us amen because I want us to I want us to because I know that if we're truly a Church of God the devil's not going to be happy with that he's not going to leave us alone he's going to attack us he's going to come in any channel any Avenue that he possibly can and I'm believing I'm talking to mature Christians I have believed that we hit that evening like Tabernacle our mature Christians where there's a lot of things that we are above are you with me if we're not above it then we're still children amen still babes in Christ amen things that uh you know things that men you we should never have to battle again amen and I got to thinking about this in Matthew 12 and verse 30 5 a good man out of the good Treasure of his heart bringeth forth good things and an evil man out of the evil Treasure of his heart bringeth forth evil things but I say unto you that Every Idle word that men shall speak they shall give an account thereof at the day of judgment for by thy words Thou shalt be justified and by thy words Thou shalt be condemned amen how many beliefs it's very important the things that we speak the things that we say every word not notice Every Idle Word so now I got to thinking of how that every time that you did something that you shouldn't do every time that you have said something that you shouldn't say remember all of that is going to be played back and it's all got to be so to speak straightened out if not here over there huh if not here over there every every word that you have spoken amen everything you've said and how many beliefs even your thoughts even your thoughts people think well God's is going to judge them for this big thing and that big thing and then no he's going to go into every detail of their life every thought they've ever had everything they've ever said everything they've ever done is going to say look at that look at that look at that look at that I thought boy oh boy Thomas Byler you gotta better make sure you've got things right I'm at least it's important to get things under the blood get things under the blood of Jesus Christ and when they're under the blood folks remember when something's under the blood if you bring it up I bring it up you are guilty of whatever that sin is that's the only way that you can live righteous and holy before God is get whatever it is under the blood in the sea of his forgetfulness and I'm so glad that I can cast my sins on him and Lord all my sins and all my failures anything I've ever said wrong Lord anything I've ever said to spoken to somebody because I've spoken things that I regret speaking amen I have to look back and I said I should have said that different amen now this is going to get a little touchy is that okay but a lot of times people will do things that that we don't like and if somebody crosses us amen all of a sudden we decide we have a boycott that person I ain't gonna do nothing for that guy anymore huh now let me ask you I don't know if you ever have hopefully not but has that feeling has that ever been right no not because Jesus says you know even if people persecute you and despitefully you do good to those that die look for something that you can do good amen why because that's what Christ would do that's still that self that has to die I may believe that that shows you that you're still alive you didn't find the right thought you didn't find the right path to walk amen anytime you've gossiped it'll have to be a given account for amen isn't that something let me tell you something I believe this church we need to be above gossip I was thinking about that how that gossip gossip is literally it's absolute poison those poison acids of malice and all the little things it's poison and I wanted you to know that I as a pastor have watched people drink that poison and there's many of them that are out in the world now they're gone poison gossip what's gossip gossip is when I talk to you about so and so now did you know by the as soon as somebody says you know so and so you better put a red flag up watch out this is either God or it's the devil amen and if I talk about the brother or sister because here we're brothers and sisters how many believe that we got to keep the devil out we don't ever have to deal with that mess and if you talk bad about people you should give an account you should apologize you should make it right how many believe that that's right amen but a lot of time let me tell you sometimes we think that we're this person ought to make about remember if you do the same thing you're a hypocrite you make sure you haven't done that same thing yeah that's right we gotta all we all stand before the Judgment seat of Christ when I sit and I listen I say words very important listen Bible says what uh how did I want to put this amen um what do you say to somebody or about somebody if you can't say something good [Music] that's the correct answer if you can't say something good about something don't say nothing at all it's good it's okay to talk about people if it's good but if it's bad remember that's not God it's not God at all that's sowing seeds of Discord amen sowing seeds of Discord I've been guilty of it we probably all have say anything to be ought to have said Amen brother listen it better be especially about but the pastor and so forth you're going to speak and make that person have less confidence in that Pastor you remember you'll give account for it on the day of judgment because you might as well have gotten a shotgun and shot the man in the back by killing his influence and making other people think less of him amen and I feel like that goes for every one of us whether it's me you or you me or whatever anytime you talk negative and here at evening like Tabernacle we don't want to talk negative about each other we lift each other up and we say positive things and if anybody does other than that shut him down shut her down whoever it is shut me down hello and I'll tell you it'll stop that acid it'll stop the devil in these tracks because I'll tell you what I know I know what it's like I know what it's like to have and you know you remember when Paul said one place I wanted to pull this up Paul says you know if some of you burn and some of you are hurting I more amen this and I thought you know some of us feel like you know maybe we're hurt folks I'm telling you what you multiply that by 10 whatever you have ever experienced you multiply that by 10 or more that's what this guy goes through because I care about every one of y'all's feelings your affections and everything else and have to deal with it any family that's ever come and has it gone it's heartbreak for me anything I've ever tried to straighten up and couldn't be you don't know how I'm heartbroken that makes me hello you talk about heartbreak yeah I know heartbreak but I know one thing I can't hold anything I don't hold anything I cast all my carriers on the Lord because even brother Bynum because hurt so many sometimes remember whatever unless you don't know he's been cut deep many times we all get cut deep by each other amen but do we let that infest sucks no we let the blood of Jesus Christ take that and heal us cast all your cares upon Him for he careth for you amen I have you know I have I don't want it too personal but somebody's not coming here anymore and I was kind of that way look if they're going to do that and so forth and uh you know then I'm just gonna not gonna have nothing to do with him what the holy spirit says that's not the right attitude you should try to do something that would make them really feel of you as a Christian and do something good if you possibly can how many believes there's a wrong thought and a wrong attitude and there's a right attitude to things amen now I'm here to tell you this right now the differences between God using you and the devil using you to get it right amen this means God's going to use you it's going to mean that little things that you go through amen it's going to mold the character of Christ in you amen mistreat you that's Christ amen but our carnal nature he doesn't want to do that it's hard but it takes prayer and it takes casting all your cares upon him for he careth for you you love him so remember brother and sister say good things about one another because I feel like this I feel like I feel like the Lord has brought us up he's he's brought us up the devil wants us to be at the bottom of the ladder he don't want us up here the devil wants us down here admiring in the muck we're beyond that we're past that how many is with me we're past juvenile we're past brother Glenn we're past being children having to be taught how to talk because remember two-year-olds they have to be taught how to talk amen and we should be past that you ain't got to tell me brother Bible I know I need to keep my shot mouth shut unless he's good don't say nothing at all that's learning how to talk why because words man I'll tell you what the devil is in those words remember the devil was in speaking to Eve and he can paint you such a purdy picture amen but remember as the prophet of God said if it ain't right it's the devil amen and most of the time the things that's wrong listen do you realize that you're you know you know the past or deacons are supposed to take care of the the elderly and so forth he says but who wants the pastor to do what's his responsibility over the spiritual part of the church in other words if there's something wrong that's on him he has to straighten out he has to do that amen praise the Lord but I'm so grateful brothers and sisters it doesn't matter what we are past this what the future is whatever your situation whatever your feeling is tonight you can cast your cares on him for he careth for you I say to you tonight let's go forward let's let's let God Rule and reign in our hearts because he's about to come folks it's it's a whole lot remember the bicycle story amen whenever whenever your carnal and and looking right down here you're just looking they there you're going to fall off you got to look their tires to the End Amen we're not worried about this Stat or the other our finances so much and all this other stuff that's going on we're having a goal and that goal is to meet Jesus in the air how many is with me I want to meet him in the air I want to be ready to meet him in the air because there's going to be a meeting in the air amen we don't have long to stay here praise be to God how many appreciates what the holy spirit's been doing in the church I really appreciate it all I'm saying is to you is a pastor tonight don't let the devil in don't give him an inch don't give him a feeling an affection a memory don't give him no room at all see I believe God's word and I want to follow Christ to the letter amen praise be to God you love him tonight amen stand with me maybe you have a family member maybe you have someone else maybe it's not you maybe it is you but with our heads bowed eyes closed I wonder if there's those tonight because I believe that the holy spirit let me just say the things that I did tonight if you've got to care that you'd like to cast on him and see God I
