when you think of the alternative so uh let's turn with me if you would until your bible's into matthew 6. i'll read a portion of scripture there we're gonna we're trying a new microphone tonight so if this thing messes up or it's it's not good it's it's not brother micah's fault it's it's my fault so seeing that song fill my cup how many wants a feeling of christ tonight a true dedication and commitment and feeling of christ i i tell you it's been on my my mind there and i had a it seemed like a million thoughts coming at me here and i feel like i've got about four sermons combined into one so bear with me i i won't keep you long i don't think maybe 30 40 minutes tonight i know you're hot you're tired you've probably had supper and and you're ready to take a nap or go to sleep for tomorrow so the heat really takes it out of you but bear with us and let's just dedicate a few minutes if we could to hear what the lord has in store for us matthew chapter 6 we'll go to verse 5 and 13. and when thou prayest thou shall not be as the hypocrites are for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets that they may be seen of men verily i say unto you they have their reward but thou when thou prayest enter into thy closet and when thou has shut thy door pray to thy father which is in secret and thy father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly but when ye pray use not vain rep the heathens do for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking be not ye therefore like unto them for your father knoweth what things you have need of before you ask them isn't that a nice statement right there he knows what you need before you even ask how much of a greater father could there be so after this manner therefore pray ye our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our death as we forgive our debtors lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen let's pray heavenly father we just come before you tonight with humble hearts lord and we just asked lord jesus as we've read the scripture we could call the completion of the service now knowing we've read your word father and we've heard from you but lord jesus we just ask that that you would be with us for the next few moments that you would come down and speak to our hearts that you would move me out of the way that we could minister the word as you've laid it upon my heart lord jesus to encourage and inspire and draw us closer to you father we're no doubt living in a late hour and we just want more of you father and we want to be closer to you and more committed in our daily walk with you we just want to tell you we love you and appreciate you in jesus name we pray amen amen you have your seats is this is this volume okay it sounds different to me i don't know what it sounds like to you all right we're gonna go good to have ellie with us i'll title my message tonight if we could life with an intimate god life with an intimate god and we look at this little portion of scripture here and it's it's a portion of scripture that i just love we've heard it most of our lives uh and we should know it by heart and in this scripture here jesus uh jesus is explaining to the disciples on how to pray and when we look at this it's basically broken down into two parts uh jesus is not praying a prayer here why would he have to pray to himself he's just it's not necessary but he's telling us how we as christians as believers can begin to pray and so the first half is making mention and tells about our father it tells about how good our father is and it talks and it's lifting him up when we look at the second half of this portion of scripture jesus is telling us about us it's telling about you and i it's telling about our needs and and and how god is going to provide our needs and telling us how to pray for our needs and then it ends up again with the believer again exhorting the father above all and so jesus is explaining here a relationship jesus is bringing into the people a relationship and a communication between us and him how we can approach god how do we talk to god and so the communication is being laid here and so how many tonight would agree with me in saying that we desire a closer walk with god tonight i want to know more about god than i've ever known before i want to know more about his riches i want to know more about his wealth i want to know more about his his love and his desire and what he would have for us in store for us tonight i heard a little humorous story and i i sometimes bring humor in but i'm careful with it but uh we're hot we're tired so maybe it'll lighten the evening okay so i heard this story about two men they were talking about which one was the real christian and and one said well i'm a christian and the other started and says you know i don't know about this i kind of doubt your confession that you're making here and and and i just don't believe you really are what you say i just don't believe you're really a christian he looked at him he said i tell you what in fact i'll bet you ten dollars but you don't even know the lord's prayer and this man thought about it for a minute he said okay i'll take that bet so the man looked at him and he said okay recite it to me so the man looked at him and he started now i lay me down to sleep i pray the lord my soul to keep if i should die before i wake i pray the lord my soul to take and the other man smiling looked at him reached in his pocket and he said well here's your ten dollars he said i didn't think you knew but you did they didn't have that intimate relationship with christ they both claimed that they were christians they both claimed to be something that they wasn't they didn't they wasn't well versed in the scriptures they wasn't able to relate with christ the way he wants to communicate with us and like i said i titled my message tonight life with an intimate god so in order to understand what life with an intimate god is like we have to understand what the word intimacy really means and when we we see the word intimacy we hear it we it varies from context to context and there's many people that hear the word intimacy they automatically think of a sexual interaction or a connotation but it's more than that intimacy is so much more than that as believers we sing songs that have to do with us being intimate with god and intimate with jesus and because our world connects intimacy with a sexual act it's difficult for the people to understand the true meaning of the word but listen to what it is intimacy means creating an authentic connection an authentic connection it has more to do with shared moments moments when you're connected with god moments that you can remember moments that you share and you can reflect back and say oh i remember god led me through this trial i remember when god healed me of this sickness i remember when god saved my children intimate shared moments with god intimacy is linked with feelings of closeness and safety and trust and transparency amongst partners you see it's so much more than an act intimacy is a feeling of closeness for intimacy to be sustainable and nourishing you it requires trust and transparency and the rituals of connection it requires empathy you know what empathy is empathy is being able to put yourself in somebody else's shoes and feel what they feel that is intimacy intimacy is having a very close friend or confidant it's marked by a very close association a contact or familiarity with a person you and that person become so close there's a relationship a bond the connection that's been made between you and another person and it's a warm friendship that's developed as time goes on as you get to know more and more and more about each other and we can see this begins to develop when young couples begin to date young couples begin to date and there becomes a feeling and it's more than just an attraction but it's a friendship it's a warmness and they begin to they begin to feel safe with one another they begin to trust one another next thing they do what they do they step up an engagement and they begin to go into the next portion of their life and it becomes even more and more trustworthy more safe a feeling of safety about it and transparency and it keeps going on and on and on until we get into the marriage stage you get into the marriage they didn't 100 complete transparent there's no secrets in marriage you're awful quiet if you've got secrets in your marriage we don't have a healthy marriage there's no secrets in marriage and it's much like our relationship with god it's a lot like that it consists of continual growth it consists of learning and developing and trusting god and being transparent just like in a marriage if you're not transparent with your spouse if you're not transparent with god that means you're hiding something from god you're not coming clean with everything that you've got before god so how can god bless you how can god fellowship with you how can god wrap his arm around you and completely love you the way he should and pull you close into his bosom if you're telling him lies if you're living a life of lies you see it's hard for the world or the unsaved person i should say to understand how we as christians desire an intimacy with jesus christ very few of any have laid eyes upon him very few if any have touched him or felt his touch but we still we sing songs to him we pray to him we worship him with all that's within us saint john 20 29 says blessed are they that have not seen but yet have believed i know he's real can i touch him no can i feel him i feel the spirit moving but to physically shake his hand put my arm around him no but i believe it and the world looks at us and they say man those people sing songs to a to a jesus to a god that they can't even touch feel see smell hear and they scratch their head in astonishment have you ever went to a restaurant you sat down to eat and you your family prays sometimes we'll join hands even at a restaurant and we'll pray and people look astonished wow what are they doing why is that it's because they don't get it they don't get it but but i get it you and i get it because we're child of god we're a child of god tonight we're children of god and we love him and we want to share that love with him we share the way we love god throughout the holy spirit and we get it it's a relationship intimacy means that we're creating an authentic connection between us and god a tight relationship so that your thoughts are intertwined with his attributes think about what i just said your thoughts are intertwined with his attributes your actions are the result of his word of his life being living out through you through the new earth you know god says it's for whosoever will i believe i'm looking at a lot of whosoever wills there's a relationship that god has built upon a new birth you know i was riding around the farm the other day and uh i noticed as i was riding there was a deer standing up in the edge of the woods and i just kept riding and i got closer and i got closer and i got closer and before you know it i'm 15 to 20 yards from this deer and i'm sitting there and i'm thinking what is wrong with this crazy deer is this thing sick she looks healthy she looks like she's in good shape what is wrong with her why isn't she snorting and stomping and blowing why isn't she running away and then it dawned on me what time of year it is she's got a baby nearby she's no doubt got a baby nearby there's something in there the special connection there that that baby's bedded down and that birth when that new birth took place that deer's whole demeanor changed she says i'm going to stay here and watch over my baby i'm going to protect my little baby i'm not going to run i got to know that this person's not a threat to my baby why because and when that baby was born something kicked in it said a new birth i was talking to a friend who who's kind of associated with the with the alpha pregnancy center in hopkinsville and i just asked what is that all about because i didn't know and you know i was just thinking it was for you know women who who had gotten pregnant basically and out of wedlock that's what i thought it was no it's more than that there's a lot more to that the number one thing that they do is to try to prevent abortion and i thought that's a good deed they're trying to prevent abortion and he i said well how do you do that he said well studies have shown and we found out that if we can give them an ultrasound yep if we can give them an ultrasound and let them see the baby that they're carrying in their womb the risk or the chance for abortion decreases by oh 85 percent why is that it's because something has kicked in in that mother's mind i'm carrying a baby and i'm fixing to birth this baby and it's mine there's a relationship there that that baby is attached in the womb and she's nurturing and and getting her nourishment off that mother and now she realizes by picture this is my baby it's just like christians at the new birth so when something strikes your soul when something gets ahold of you and you give yourself to christ there's a bond that's formed there's a new level of commitment it's no longer just a church experience it's a god experience because there's been a birth to take place and that relationship is formed between you and god and the bible says that he will never leave you and he will never forsake you i'll not leave you comfortless i will come to you a little while in the world seeing me no more but you see me because you live and you shall live also and today you shall know that i am in my father and you and me and i in you do you see the connection do you see the bond that is built between jesus and us so brothers and sisters we have a promise tonight that we can rest assured that god's going to uphold his end of the deal god is going to uphold his end of the deal and we don't have to worry about that but a relationship is a two-way street oh there's where we get in trouble we want god to give and give and give and give and all we want to do is take and take and take and take that's not the way a relationship works you have to give and take you see when you're talking about an intimate relationship it's god says i'm going to give you so much of me but in return i want so much of you i want to hear you talk back to me i want to hear you pray to me i want to hear you sing to me i want to hear you whisper love songs in my ear our god has feelings he's looking for that he desires and is longing for us to communicate day by day by day with him it's reciprocating you know uh we uh as carpenters i guess we i guess i say i build stuff but we got reciprocating saws and it cuts both ways it cuts and it goes in and out cut cut cut cut cut now if i use a circular saw it's only spinning in one direction and it's just cutting constantly one direction if i reverse that blade you know what it'll do is set to burn the wood it won't cut because you're asking to do something that's not made to do and sometimes i thought about that and i thought you know sometimes we try to put the cart in front of the horse and we try to push people into church as a as a circular saw instead of giving them time to get accustomed and get acquainted with god to where they can reciprocate love with god we try to force them into church try to force them into doing things try to force them not to do things do's and don'ts and all we do is just light a fire in them of hatred and despise come on church we need to make sure that the relationships that we're trying to to push and to and to kindle are reciprocating relationships you ought to love god because god first loved you kyle calvary is the reason we have intimate relationship with god so we have a commitment to make ours is easy i said ours is easy god's not so much he took the hard road calvary was not an easy road being beaten is not an easy road being spit on and mopped is not an easy road and laying there and pinned up for the whole world to see and groaning and gasping for your last breath of life that's not easy let me ask you what was that that's love that's love it's the greatest love you'll ever experience in your life it's love it's god's passion for you it's god saying i'm committed to you i give my life i lay it down from the altar for you right here no matter what you do from this point on you're mine he didn't he didn't save us to lose us we try to throw people off the bridge when they make a mistake god don't work that way he may not like what you do he still loves you with that very thought it ought to make us want to worship god in a way we've never worshiped in order to make us want to pray to god in a way we've never prayed in order to set our hearts on fire and make us sell us in such a way that we say god i never want to lose this relationship with you there was a young disciple of christ and he was desiring all that god had for him he wanted god in all of his capacity and he visited the home of an elderly christian man and he'd heard about this man and this old man was up in the age and he had never lost his first love for jesus after all the years after all the trials after all the trouble he'd never lost his first love for christ and this elderly man was sitting out on a porch with his dog and he's taken in the sunset and this young man asked him said why is it sir that most christians zealously chase after god during the first year or two of their conversion but then they fall into a complacent ritual let's be careful but then they fall into a complacent ritual where they go to church once or twice a week and they end up not looking any different than than their neighbors and they don't look any different than unbelievers and they don't look any different than those people that that aren't even christians he said i've heard though mister that you're not like that i've been told that you have fervently sought after god throughout all of your life people see something in you but they don't see most other people who call themselves christian what makes you different sir what makes you different and the old man smiled and he replied he said son let me tell you a story he says one day i was sitting here quietly in the sun with my dog and suddenly this large jackrabbit jumped up and ran across the yard in front of us and he said well my dog jumped off and took off after it it's a big old jackrabbit he chased the rabbit over the hills with passion soon other dogs joined him attracted by his barking and he said what a sight it was as i sat here and i watched this pack of dogs and they ran across the creeks and up the banks and threw the thickets and through the thorns he said gradually though however one by one the other dogs dropped out of the pursuit they were discouraged by the course they were frustrated by the chase and only my dog continued to hotly pursue that little jack rabbit in that story young man lies the answer to your question you know that young man he said he sat there confused it's silent and he said sir i don't understand what is the connection between the jack rabbit chase and the quest for god you fail to understand says the old man because you failed to ask the obvious question the obvious question is why didn't the other dogs continue on in the chase and the answer to that question son is this they have not seen the rabbit think about that they had not seen the rabbit and unless you have seen the prize brothers and sisters the chase is too difficult why do people fall away they have not seen the prize they've not laid eyes upon the jesus that you've seen they don't see jesus as savior and healer and delivery counselor and friend and provider and lover they not laid eyes on him in that capacity so therefore they begin to fall away and because they lack the passion they lack the determination to keep up in the race and stay in the chase god desires to have a close intimate personal loving dynamic powerful relationship with you the deeper the more intimate the more genuine the more real your relationship with god is you know what happens the more the devils the more demons begin to fear and tremble in your presence they say oh my goodness he's up again i can't believe his feats hit the floor again this morning i'm gonna have to him all day today she's going to be a witness everywhere she goes what are we going to do how many times have you asked or thought to people are you a christian many times we get the answer we perceive as well i've been baptized or i go to church well that's not going to tell us a whole lot that's not really answering the question the better question we ought to ask is are you in love with jesus then you'll get the right answer then you'll find out where the truth really lies do you are you in love with jesus oh yes i'll tell you what i can't wait to get to church on sunday morning i can't wait when i go to work i turn my radio up and i listen to those songs of worship and praise and it just fires my soul up are you a christian are you in love with christ well i love going to the honky honky-tonk you say what i'm saying the actions speak a little different when you ask the question in the right way are you in love with jesus because it's time brothers and sisters it's time that we submit and we obey and we get down to the real deal are you really a christian are you really what you say you are because it's maturing time and faith it's time to develop a close personal intimate relationship with god because when you've got this intimate relationship it allows god to look down into your heart and it doesn't stop there god opens up himself and allows us to look down into him and to see what all lies in there when you open up the word have you ever opened up a word and read a scripture that you've read 10 or 15 times in your life and you read it again and it's something new it's a new revelation to you what is that that's god saying i'm going to open myself up to you son i'm going to open myself up to you daughter i want to share myself with you this morning imagine looking into the heart of god and seeing what he sees the scripture says you shall love the lord your god with all your heart with what all your soul with what all your mind and with what all your strength oh they didn't say a little it didn't say some it didn't say when you feel like it because let me tell you a lot of times i don't feel like it i tell you sometimes you know i don't know maybe it's just me but sometimes you just get into mulley grubs even my wife asked me today what's wrong with what's going on nothing oh there's something going on i can tell no it's nothing i just not nothing oh it's something it because you got to preach no it's not that i'm not it's not that i'm not nervous but i'm good what is it i don't know nothing there's nothing just i'm in the milly grips but god allows us opportunities like that to take advantage of those opportunities because i told myself i was walking i told myself i said you know i can either keep my mind set on the way i feel right now and discouragement and disgust or or i can turn on some music that gets me excited about god and i can sit down here and i can just tell god how good you've been to me god you've given me a wonderful family you've given me a great home you've given me a wonderful church family you give me a good pastor you've given me a beautiful place you've given us automobiles and food and clothes and it goes on and on and on it doesn't quit and you know what all of a sudden i got the feeling i got to step in a little higher you know i wasn't as discouraged as i was anymore because i realized it was all a negative connotation in my mind between me and where i stood what's happening around me means nothing what's happening between me and god means everything stay with me as we go through these quotes here man was born to have fellowship man in the beginning back in the garden of eden he had a wonderful fellowship god would come down and fellowship with this company of men and woman adam and eve every evening in the cool of the evening he would come down under the great palm trees paint the picture in your mind god would come down under the great palm trees and perhaps his sacred light as it was was shining down on adam and eve and that great cathedral out in the open something about nature and god coming down there in the garden fellowshipping and adam and eve out there fellowshipping with god they had nothing to worry about as long as they were fellowshipping he says because the greatest fellowship that any man ever has when he fellowship with god and god gave himself open to man to fellowship back and forth with his creature the creator fellow shipping with the creature and god is fellowshipping with adam in the garden and adam has nothing to worry about everything is smooth it's running right he didn't have to worry about clothes he didn't have to worry about something to eat he didn't have to worry about sickness he didn't have to worry about death or sorrow because father the heavenly father who watched over him and fellowshipped with him daily wow listen now god longs for that fellowship he yearns he wants people to speak with him to talk with them he said you might sing too much i might preach too much but one thing i'll never do too much of is pray fellowship because god is yearning for that you can't overdo it the bible says man everywhere to pray and lift up holy hands you can never have too much fellowship with god so let me ask you what happened to that kind of fellowship what happened to that kind of fellowship that that fellowship was lost stay with me now it's important i got about 15 more minutes the old serpent he found his way in to break fellowship between adam and eve and ultimately breaking fellowship between them and god now think about this scene we painted where god's coming down his his shekinah glory the the glory of god is shining down upon adam and eve and the cool of eden and can you imagine old satan that old devil surfaced in there and he's looking at all this and he's thinking my goodness what is happening here what is what is taking place here and i can imagine him just standing back and looking at this and thinking we didn't have this in heaven no all they did in heaven was sing and worship and praise that's all they did in heaven but what is going on now what is this i've never seen this before why why's god wrapping his arm around adam and wrapping his arm around eve and why is he pulling a man close is he whispering in their ear what is he doing look at them every day when the sun sets it's cool it's calm what's happening fellowship fellowship it's if aiden begins to look at this fellowship he says i got to do something to get between this i've got to do something to break this up i've got to do something so that this doesn't happen every day and and he said here's to adam and eve and eve a beautiful woman and adam with his dark shaggy locks hanging down around his head and those eyes looking over his little sweetheart a perfectly built woman he said in her hair and she looked up and her eyes as blue as the sky and adam loved her he said oh how he loved her we just think we know a love story we think these novels sometimes these women get hung up in these novels and hallmark and christmas reason no he loved her adam loved her he said oh how he loved her but when sin entered in their little home was broke when sin entered in her their little home was broke up because of an old lustful beast he said the devil that got into the animal called a serpent not a reptile no no the devil was not a snake no he wasn't a snake in the beginning like he is now he was cursed he was a beast he was more subtle than any beast he looked more like a man than anything you've ever had he walked upright there's where the devil got in him and he come to eve this beautiful made woman and she did what was wrong what did she do she broke that intimate relationship for a lustful desire and then she brought forth her son cain who had the nature of his daddy a murderer a hater a killer what happened to that stillness that whisper that softness that gentleness it was broken the fellowship had been broken and god when he come down to talk and that fellowship been broken he says can you imagine adam and eve sitting in the garden under those palm trees and god would come down and say my children and they say yes father is all well yes father all is well have you enjoyed the blessings of your father this day it's before the fall he's retelling the story before the fall yes father we've enjoyed the blessings you've given us today and he says listen now here comes leo the line he said in leo the lion comes up and meows like a kitten and adam pats him on the head and he kneels himself down and here comes cheetah and the tiger and all them comes up and lays down in meows and god's great voice roaring through the treetops my creation have you enjoyed what i've made for you today yes father every day no death no sorrow no sickness it's wonderful and then the first thing you know the sin she said and god came down roared through the treetops wants to be worshipped he's god and his children wasn't there to worship and here come leo and knelt down there and cheetah come up and knelt down and they come up and kneel down and but where's adam he's not there god like he's done every single day since the creation has come down in fellowship and wanted to talk and get intimate with adam and eve and he comes down this time and there is no adam there is no eve and he says leo have you seen him have you seen adam no adam where art thou cheetah have you seen adam no adam where art thou he says see it's the nature of man to run from god when the fellowship's been broken you ever notice that when people get away from god what do they do they run as hard as they can to get away from church from preachers from from from their parents that are that are christians from the past they see the pastor coming whoop no the other way why is that it's because that fellowship's been broken and they find themselves in that atom state where they're running from god because there's no fellowship there and it ought to have been adam saying father i've sinned father i've done wrong father i'm wrong where are you i need to confess to you where are you god but he's hiding adam where art thou my boy where aren't there adam adam my boy we're hard thou and directly he looks over he sees adam standing behind the bushes and he says come out adam what's his reply i can't i'm naked who told you you were naked the woman you gave me broken fellowship distrust uncommitted undevoted and the woman said the serpent did it the serpent did it the greatest picture of fellowship broken i could have titled this message a heartbroken god can you imagine the feeling god must have had when he stepped on the scene that day and the love of his life those two hid from him when everything that he had built the world he created around them now broke in ruins he wasn't heartbroken because of what was going to happen he was heartbroken because of the distrust and the lack of fellowship he says god can't talk to his people no more and god's got to keep his word so god went over and got some sheepskins a couple of innocent little lambs and he slayed those lambs and and stripped the hives off of those lambs and took them over there into the bushes and said took those bloody sheepskins and thrown them back i said put them on and here come adam and eve wrapped up in these sheeps and they come out and wrapped up in these sheepskins of blood coming down dripping over his manly shoulders he says and eve the pretty little thing adam sweetheart his darling comes out and blood running down her legs and the blood running off adam's shoulders and i can see it here wrapped around his shoulder and the blood in his hair and eve has bent down her head bent down them old bloody sheepskins and walk out before god brother and sister i don't ever want to have to approach god in that manner i want to be able to approach god head on with a smile on my face and say lord it's a beautiful day to see you today and eve now walks and says have i done what have we done it's gone god said adam because you listened to your wife instead of me i took you from the dust of the earth and now to the dust you'll return woman because you listen to the serpent instead of your own husband because you listen to a serpent instead of your own husband he said i'll multiply your sorrows in conception because you caused the innocent lives of two little lambs now when you produce life you'll be in sorrow and you'll in conception you'll just pain and serpent because you did this off goes your legs and you'll crawl on your belly all the days of your life and you'll be hated and the dust shall be your meat what a what a change in scenario what a change in scenery here oh my something's happening aches begin to come into eve's shoulders oh ah adam has now got rheumatism in his back arthritis don't ask me how he knew it he just knew it he begins to look and he looks over at eve of tears running down her pretty cheeks and her lips that have never had any manicure on them he said it's look in there now and there's lips that were once red natural red are turning pale and wrinkly wrinkles are coming under her eyes you can't hide it ladies you can try it's coming it's scriptural wrinkles now coming under her eyes adam's hair begins to slip out shag begins to come out here graves begin to set in i was at a nursing home today giving shots given the vaccines and the lady looked up to me and she said son what happened to your hair you had hair last time you was here i don't know who she thought i was but i said i ain't had hair in a while i said some people turn gray mine turns loose tears dropping off of his manly chest his chest begin to sink in hollow can you see the transformation of losing fellowship with god the transformation that takes place when you get away from talking with god and even knew she was the cause of it and says adam what have i done darling what have i done i'm because of it we're condemned look at us we're turning back to dust and god has hit his face from us we can't see him no more look at these bloody skins i'm ashamed of this i'm ashamed of what i become adam darling i would take all of this off of you if i could but it's happened to us honey and god said depart out of my presence that almost makes my heart skip a beat it puts a pit in my stomach to think of the importance of the fellowship and how important intimacy is with god and how important it is that we stay focused and committed and love god and the way he wants to be loved and worshipped because i cannot imagine to hear that word depart from my presence but he said depart from my presence no matter how bad it hurt him he had to keep his word he said adam put his arm around his little wife and they started moving down through the garden of eden and i could hear that old bloody sheepskin slapping on their side as a reminder of what they've done brothers and sisters we all have our gardens to walk through we all have our serpents to face but praise god for a hill called calvary because on that hill called calvary you could still come back today and enter into that place of fellowship because of a place called calvary you can have an intimate relationship with god because of a place called calvary you can have a life in harmony with god you don't need those bloody lambskins tonight you don't need last skins draped over you because the blood of jesus christ was shed on the cross over two thousand years ago and that blood covers us and it it preserves us and it makes a way of fellowship back between us and christ and that's what we're striving for thank god for the blood the death burial resurrection that's what unifies us in christ i must find a place to stop here the book of luke the book of luke tells us all about the life of jesus christ amongst the people think about it you read the gospels and i'm focusing on luke and you'll you'll see why here in a minute but the book of luke it focuses on and tells all about what jesus did around the people amongst the people everywhere he went what do the people see how he treat the people right well you go over into the book of acts which many scholars believe is a continuation of the book of luke what happens in the book of acts it's no longer about god or jesus amongst the people as described in the book of luke now it's talking about jesus in the people on the day of pentecost when the fire came down what was that it was god indwelling in his people it was god making a way back after calvary to come down and say i'm now going to communicate with you now i'm going to move myself in you and now you're going to move for me jesus dwelling inside of us jesus dwelling inside of us no longer rejected as king of the jews no longer rejected as king of the jesus jews but now he's accepted as king of kings and lord of lords right here right here in my heart right there in your heart right there where jesus comes in and you feel that little fire that burns inside that says i need more of you god the holy ghost is not just a a theory but it's an experience it's an experience that you'll live every day of your life if you walk with christ it's an experience that is so real it's what causes you to grow in god it's what gives you that intimate relationship when that holy ghost dwells in you it inspires you to act under the authority of jesus christ you want that garden to be an experience get in with god the spirit makes your body and actions react to the inspiration it's no longer do's and don'ts you know for years i heard don't do this don't do that believers don't do this believers don't do that women don't do this women don't do that i heard all the doo doo doo's and don't don't don'ts i've ever wanted to hear because you know what it means it means if you're having to be told not to do or do that or don't do you don't have a relationship with god anyway but when you get that personal relationship with god it's not about do's and don'ts but it's a message of respect stay with me just another minute message of respect i don't have this in my notes but you know i've never had to tell my wife don't you do this don't you do that i joke with her every now and then i say you know what i'm fixing to tell you the rules of this house no i don't have to tell her that i don't have to worry when she goes somewhere she don't have to worry when i go somewhere because i'm not going to do anything i shouldn't do you know why because i love her i love her with the love greater than i could ever show any person on this earth she's my wife i'm a spouse to her we have a relationship it's a trust it's a commitment it's a dedication i trust your marriage is that way because that's what god that's what christ is looking for he's looking for a church he's looking for a bride without spa or wrinkle that's what he's looking for he's looking for a church that's not committing spiritual fornications you know god's a jealous god i'm closing i promise god is a jealous god he's not going to share his bride with anything in this world he's not going to do it he's not going to do it he says the church is found committing spiritual fornication he said just like a woman would share her love from her husband to another man that woman's not fit to be lived with if it i'm just going to leave that alone when the church begins to share her fellowship with the world god is a jealous god he put israel away from that for that and he'll do the same thing for you he's going to have a bride listen he's going to have a bride that hasn't got a wrinkle in she's wholly washed by the blood of his own self let's stand our feet i feel like we got 20 avenues we could go down we'll leave that up to brother balor when he gets back you love the lord tonight musicians as you come brother josh you just put that little song up maybe if we pull it up oh how i love jesus if you just play that who's playing tonight there's nothing like the love of jesus there's nothing like the fellowship of jesus there's nothing like it [Music] [Applause] [Music]
