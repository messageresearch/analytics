shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty surely he shall deliver thee From The Snare of the Fowler and from the noise of pestilence Thou shalt not be afraid for the tear by night nor for the error arrow that flyeth by day fall at thy side and ten thousand at thy right hand but it shall not come nigh thee because thou has made the Lord which is my Refugee Refuge even the most high thy habitation he shall for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways Thou shalt tread upon the lion and Adder the Young Lion and the dragon shall thou trample under feet together he shall call upon me and I will answer him I will be with him in trouble I will deliver him and honor him with long life will I satisfy him and show him my salvation amen praise the Lord amen you can be seated dismissed for Sunday School foreign brothers and sisters you know when you read things like that what do you have to worry about what do you I mean if you're trusting and truly believing you really have nothing to worry about I know that's an easy thing to say it's a harder thing to believe if you would uh come with me to Hebrews the third chapter foreign worth the time change I was down in my office for hours this morning but before I get started you all know what we're doing about section off some of the land so that we can pay off the principal of the church loan so when I went to the bank on Tuesday I wasn't able to go on Monday the amount that we owe is about fifty eight thousand and sixty two dollars and there's some change there so with the offer of 36 000 that would bring it down to twenty three thousand dollars and change but the I'm going to be making a church payment before the 10th before Thursday I'll be making a a church payment so when it's all said and done but depending on when all this is done if it's before this December payment uh we'd actually instead of 22 would be down to twenty one thousand dollars worth of principal and I told the banker we wouldn't renegotiate the payment we'd just stick with the payment that we have and that that would mean if if we didn't have any major expenses that the church should be paid off within 18 months a year and a half so and that's making the regular payments that we have every month so the Lord's being faithful and blessing I I'm like any of you business let's just you can pay it off with the the way things work out there in the world the better off we are with not having to have a big church payment but turning changing everything here going to Hebrews the third chapter and and I was just reading this morning going different places in that Psalm this morning was in that devotional for today in the that devotional that brother put together for the message that Tom was the the scripture reading one of the scripture readings for this morning but I'll just go to this third chapter our mom was about to use an acronym I I stopped myself well let me read here wherefore holy brethren partakers of the Heavenly call and consider the Apostle and high Priests of our profession Jesus Christ excuse me Christ Jesus and um so Paul's telling us here to really think about our profession first I didn't pronounce that right but he goes on to say who was faithful to him that appointed him as also Moses was faithful in all his house so he whether you believe it or not God is faithful Christ is faithful just like Moses was Faithful over the house of Israel and I just wrote down some other people that you can go through the Bible that were faithful in the house that God gave him to be faithful but let me read a few more of these scriptures for this man was counter-worthy of more Glory than Moses and so much as he who hath builded the house had more honor than the house for every house is built by some man but he did buildeth all things as God and he goes on to say and Moses verily was faithful in all his house as a servant for the testimony of those things through this word to be spoken after him and I just got some examples uh we all know that Jesus Christ of Christ Jesus was faithful completely in what God intended him to do and is still faithful this morning bringing about administering to us as the saints of God and then we know that Abraham ought to be faithful he was faithful at all as an example for us as Believers Believers that we should follow just just mention most Moses was faithful and all that God gave them to do but as a Gentiles we have an example we can look back to and Paul was faithful in all his house when God gave him to do while he was opening the church to the to the world and you could say the same thing for the message to the our brother Branham was faithful and all the things that God had him to do in the age that we lived this morning but let me read I hope I didn't lose my place here some of these other scriptures I'm not going to read this whole chapter this morning um and he goes on by Christ as the son over his own house whose house are we If We Hold Fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the Hope firm on to the end and you know that's where we're at this morning in the world that way are you going to hold on to the end he that endures to the end will be saved are you gonna hold that God gave you this morning no matter what's going on out those four walls this afternoon or this morning whatever's going on are you going to hold faithful to the promises God gave you that by Christ that's the son over his own house whose house are we If We Hold Fast the confidence and then rejoicing of the Hope firm unto the end wherefore as the Holy Ghost say today if you will hear my hear his voice Harden not your heart says in the propagation in The Temptations in the wilderness and I'll stop there because it goes on talking about how the children of Israel weren't faithful and that they chose a different path but I'm just going to read some Iraq that word Faithful is pretty pretty strong word but I was I was going through a dictionary and I'll just these are some of these are some of the of the synonyms for that word not being I'm not I don't even qualify to to know the English language so I won't try to be an English teacher here but um but basically someone that is faithful or faith is is consistent also he's Resolute if you're faithful you're going to be Resolute and that's with the promises that God gave you and the calling he put you in you're going to be Resolute you're not going to question what God wants you to do you're going to be a staunch believer you're not going to let the things you're not going to be flighty you're not going to be moving left or right you're going to stay firm on the path that God gave you and you're going to be steady and true dependable and that's a to be faithful you got to be dependent upon and you all know out there in the world you can't Outsiders trust in people you got to trust people but you know dependability is a hard trait to find anymore out there and he goes on to say reliable a faithful person will be reliable if you give someone a promise whether it's here in church or out there in the world you're going to be reliable you're going to hold fast to the promises you give people it goes on to say a tribe A faithful person has been tried trustworthing affectionate devoted loving and well they're just using other examples but the one thing I thought was kind of funny uh your antonym or the opposite the negative thing about being faithful the one word that really struck to me the reading the dictionary was treacherous so if you're if if you have all the opposite values of being faithful the one thing that struck me this morning was being someone who was stretched us basically you're not no one can count on you whatever you say you don't know if you're telling someone the truth or not but I was just going to read a few of these scriptures in the Bible in my thoughts and chain reference Bible not want to take a lot of time this morning and um I'll the different chapters but it's on page 14 14 if you have a Thompson Chain reference Bible knowing therefore the Lord thy God he is God that's uh in Deuteronomy the seventh and the 9th first and faithful God who keepeth Covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his and keep his Commandments to a thousand Generations so that's a promising word right there what God promised 2 000 years ago what God promised yesterday is all the same in the eyes of God and he goes to say in First Kings the eighth chapter and the 56th verse blessed be the Lord that hath given rest on To His People Israel according to all that he promised there hath not one fell one word of all those good promises which he promised by the hand of Moses his servant and you can take a scripture like that and just bring it completely through all the word of God and God whatever that promise is God will bring it about and he goes in Psalms 36 chapter and the fifth verse the mercy of the Lord is in the heavens and thy faithfulness reaches on to the clouds and then Psalms 89 and 1 I will sing of the mercies of the Lord forever with my mouth will I make known by faithfulness to all generations and then jumping up into the New Testament here uh First Corinthians the first chapter ninth verse again talks about it God is faithful by whom you were called unto the fellowship of his son Jesus Christ Our Lord you know it's when we read the word of God or when I read the word of God it's just words until you pray and meditate over it and God vindicates you to your heart and life it's just words a lot of times unless God makes it real to you but you have to be in a place in your life where you're actually reading it and trying to apply it into who God reveals it to you and then in Hebrews the sixth chapter and the 18th verse and this is really important I'll finish with this one here there are two immutable things in which it was impossible for God the line but we might have strong consolation who have fled for The Refuge to lay hold on the hope that set us before us to our circumference thought you know this morning no matter where you're at you walk or where you're at in in your life that God can't live he made a promise to us or made a promise to you God's going to bring it about I I know your enemy out there in the world out there is trying to shake the promises of God out of your heart and out of your life but God is more than able to bring about those promises and everyone's heart alive here this morning brother David amen loving with all your heart this morning how many beliefs we serve an awesome God this morning amen amen I stand this morning and sing that little course Glory Glory Hallelujah amen since I laid my burdens down amen well Glory Glory oh

on and going up the Alberta way amen we're one day closer one week or a year or how are you going to look at it closer to the coming of the Lord Jesus I trust that you're still looking for the coming of the Lord if we're not looking for his coming then we I I don't know why we would be here even amen because this is all that there is to live for is the coming of the Lord the coming of the Lord is the uh whatever the right whoever the brother was he was not a master of the English language I'm not either but I can't think of a word uh uh Power of Love to express really what the coming of the Lord means to Christianity because without that all of our uh our walk with Christ would have all been in vain amen but we know it's not in vain we know there is we have a problem us amen so God bless all of you is good to see you and good to be but Tom again just thank him for his invitation and the friendship that we've had over the years also and I just uh uh this is just a little foretaste of what's coming amen so we trust the Lord will bless you today and trust God will have his way I want to this morning maybe a little bit more of a preaching I talk about the time teaching but I'm I'm not a teacher I just however the Lord leads but uh this afternoon I would the lower willing I would like to maybe uh do something a little different and uh maybe testify a little bit about my wife's healing of the cancer and uh maybe preach a little bit along those lines and just maybe it will build a little bit of faith for somebody that might have a need here also I I believe God is still alive he's he's still on the throne and he's still if he saved if he still saves people then he still heals people so so Lord willing this afternoon we will but we'll do that I'll try to get right into the word I know you got a communion I guess foot washing also or all of us so I try not burn out the whole time amen you know the Lord Jesus amen amen let's just borrow his forwarder prayer before we go through the word Heavenly Father oh God how we desire Lord that you would just come in our midst and take over the service how do you saw our Lord and you would move in a special way father and speak to the hearts of the people their God we're we're just men Lord we're nothing but you are everything father and we pray Lord God today Lord that you will just come in a special way make the word real to US Open the word to our hearts Lord help us to see the hour and the time that we are living in Father we are depending upon you Lord I ask dear God as we turn back the pages that you would open our eyes of understanding Lord and speak to your hearts meet their needs Lord and Lord we pray if there's any that are bound uh but by Satan in any way Lord that you will set them free through the preaching of the word give us a victory Lord God In The Name of Jesus Christ we ask these things for your glory amen amen if you have your Bibles let's turn to Nehemiah chapter 8 Nehemiah chapter 8 and uh we'll start at uh what does read from verse 12 down to the end of the chapter this is after Nehemiah I build the wall and restored their form of worship the way they had it before uh you know they went in into captivity and all those things and uh in the first part of the chapter they brought they brought the book to the priest to read and I believe it's a perfect time of uh of the age that that we live in so I want to pick up a verse 13 for the sake of time on the second day were gathered together the chief of the fathers of all the people the priests the Levites unto Ezra describe even to understand the words of the law for they found written in the law which the Lord had commanded by Moses that the children of Israel should dwell in booths in the Feast of the seventh month and that they should publish and Proclaim in all their cities and in Jerusalem saying go forth unto the mount and fetch all the branches and pine branches and Myrtle branches and palm branches and branches of thick trees to make booths as it is written so the people went forth and brought them and made themselves booths everyone up on the roof of his house and in their courts and in the courts of the house of God and in the streets Street of the Watergate and in the street out the gate of Ephraim and all the congregation of them that were come again out of the Captivity made booth and sat onto the booze for since the days of Joshua the son of none undo that they had not the children of Israel done so and there was a very great gladness also day by day from the first day until the last day he read in the book of The Law of God and they kept the feast seven days and on the eighth day was his solemn assembly according unto the manner God bless the reading of his word you can be seated this morning I want to title it a solemn a solemn meeting place a solemn meeting place I went on uh we you know this the scripture reading here we understand the Old Testament is all you know it's it's types and shadows of what is to come and uh and uh we understand that there's a day of the seventh Church age which is the Feast of the seventh month and uh you know I hope these things don't get old to us that you know seven we we hear it from for we've heard it for many years you know what a seventh day to seventh month and all these things but you know if we if we look at it we stop and look at it and think about it you know is is seven is completion and uh so after seven there's nowhere else to go and uh and that's why in the seventh Church age I mean God had restored everything and so these scriptures here are a type the age and the time the hour that we are living in amen the problem of God said that we are that uh that that the the Feast of Tabernacles was the last feast or the seventh Feast he said we are worshiping now under the Feast of Tabernacles the sevens Church age it is that in the Millennium will be worshiping under the Feast of Tabernacles again because that is the seventh day because no man has ever taken that seventh day did you realize that amen God said in the day you eat thereof that day you shall die and nobody has lived A Thousand Years yet amen but we will take it amen so that is the seventh day where we live and worship under that Seven's Feast again but we are now worshiping under the Feast of Tabernacles in the church age on the spiritual side of it is that right amen so and and I I I I think we should all know that we are are most certainly in the seventh Church age the last and not not only in the seventh Church age but that we are at the very end all of the seven of the short Change at the closing of the world's history we are living here brother Brad amen God bless you good to see you amen we are living in the closing of and I know it's hard for us to even grasp a hold of that but that we are living in the closing of the world's history but I think if we if we look around a little bit and just on a world stage I don't want to spend any time in that but if you just take a glance on the world station and if you ever if you ever even open your iPad or whatever or look at headline news you don't even have to read the story The the actual story just read the headlines and it'll tell you we are at the end time everything is about destruction and hate and War and and even in the Sports World you see headlines you know and it's a constant it's like every week or every day or whatever you know people don't just play sports anymore they they get in the fights they can't people can't hold their tempers they can't hold their emotions but that's on the world side but that lets you know the condition where the world is in right now that they have come into a place where they have they have literally have lost their minds and their emotions are completely out of control you know there was a time in this country where you could have a different viewpoint on politics and you can still get along but now you you almost have to keep your beliefs and Secret you know if you don't want to have an argument you know we have to back home uh thankfully we have a neighbor right across the street they actually they're they're uh they definitely don't have the same viewpoints that we do as far as when it comes to politics but we get along just fine I can call them but I'm aware that you know if we're all out of town I can call them and say I have a package coming from Amazon you know if it comes can you go get it and put it in your house you know Wonderful neighbors you know but that's something you don't see very often anymore you know a lot of a lot of a lot of places they won't even speak to you if you have a different viewpoint but you know that's out there but you know those spirits come into the spiritual realm also comes into the church where if you have a different Viewpoint to somebody else you won't even speak to one another I think it's a shame that we claim to have the greatest message that ever has come to the Earth amen a place which really is our subtle meeting place is under the message of the hour but yet if I meet somebody and they have a different Viewpoint we can't even speak to each other sometimes we ought to be able to wrap our arms around one another say God bless you amen I might have a different Viewpoint than you do but the old brother sister let's press on to the to the end road to the end of the goal amen we're not going to stay here and you know we can everything we're going to go to heaven together let's just get along here right I'm not talking about compromising on the world I'm not talking about that because we should never compromise on the word you understand but amen there is hey yo when it comes to human beings and we all are human beings yet when it comes to human beings we are going to have different viewpoints on certain things but a lot of things that we argue and fuss about have nothing to do with salvation there's a lot of honestly there's a lot of uh you know viewpoints and arguments and things that take place in the ranks of the message that are are really only because of legalistic views come on Church we've become so legalistic that we can't hardly move I tell you I'm learning sisters I came out of a system like that and I don't want to go back in but I want to say this morning this message is not rules and regulations and orders and but yet God has an order we understand that God has a word that we have to follow and we love him Jesus said if you love me keep my Commandments is that right so so there is the law of God there is a word of God that as Christians we want to keep but a lot of little things that we're arguing first about you're just like the Pharisees full of time you know back in the days of Jesus Christ you know you're argue about I'll find your hats and how wide they're going to be the Garment should be and all that stuff and none of it is in the Bible I'm so happy this morning that we are free from those things that we are free from the dominationalism and I would say this morning let's not go back to denominationalism let's stay away from it God has brought us into a meeting place with him let's stay free free in the spirit free to worship they may not bow by any man's ideas not bound by a certain Church God has brought us into a fellowship amen so you know John and and John chapter 7 verse 37 uh the Bible says in the last day that great day of defeats Jesus stood and Christ saying if any man thirsts I hope we still have a thirst If any man thirst let him come unto me and drink he that believes on me he that Believers on me as the scripture has said out of his Bellagio four rivers rivers of Living Water listen this message is not just a little Supernatural trigger and it's a river of water it's a it's full of blessings it's full of joy amen if you don't have the joy of the Lord in your heart this morning it's because you did something you are not where you ought to be God doesn't lack the joy God doesn't like the supernatural God is full of joy and full of blessings and full of Correction but if you don't love that correction you don't you can't get into the spirit of the hour the spirit of the word and the joy what God has given to you you're just Bachelor that's all I don't know what to say I don't know what to say Jesus said he that thirst let him come unto me and then as the scripture has sent out of his belly shall flow rivers in other words there's plenty of it we don't have to drink sparingly you know it's just like brother bam said about a little fish on the oldest brother Paul he said yo a little bit of fish out in the ocean he said I'd better drink sparity up this water I'm not run out one day you know how foolish that is well it's just as foolish when you think that you don't want to ask God for big things that you might exhaust God's blessings you could never exhaust His blessings you're going to never exhaust his miracles you could never exhausted salvation Hallelujah you never exhaust is healing hey man listen if we believe that there are salvation then we have to believe there's healing healing and salvation are in the same atonement Hallelujah I'm going to get on the nice service but amen I I I believe God's still alive Billy Joe hey man so amen Jesus said in the last day the great day of the feast so he made it Jesus made it specific that that the last day was the great day of the feast was the last day is that right hey Miss oh it's not just any day listen the hour you're living in brother Brian is not just any day what do you recognize it or realize or not you are living in a special day [Applause] oh my we are living in a time that Enoch was our type where one man took a body change oh you're living a day where it's going to be more than one I don't know about you but I'm gonna be changed though so they're sure one more now surely one more besides me right and then you got to believe it the same way amen so you're living in a special day amen that God will not just take one man and allow him to walk into that next Dimension without tasting death that's going to be a group and I don't know how big that group's gonna be but it doesn't matter how big we know that every predestinator seed is going to be there and I'm going to believe that I'm one of them yo when I first come to the message from the title remembers very well yo one of the main songs we always sing I'm so glad I can say I'm one of them you know what I tell you after 30 some years I'm still glad I can say I'm one of them my I can't believe it's been that long but your ability is that it's well I guess I I I'm gonna have my 40-year anniversary in September 1982 September 26th so I baptized name of the Lord Jesus Christ if I'm doing my math right it's 40 years right I gotta check with other people a lot of times amen amen but I'm still I slide to actually I'm more glad about it today I'm happy about it today because I can look back at all that time and all the struggles and all the things I went through it all the times when you feel like you can't take another step and yet I can look back and I say well here I am so I'm happy about it today than the evil was because now I understand more about it than I did then you know when when you first come to the Lord yo you're you're saved you're enthused you're happy but really honestly you don't know much about what you're happy about is that right you just know something happened you know something changed you you know something delivered you from your habits that's all you know we know water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we knew that but that's about all we do modern baptism serpency you know the great Harlot but now we can look back and we say my it wasn't just those fundamental doctrines yet you gotta have that as a foundation but now we can see where we are today as the Bride of Jesus Christ that God has called us not just called us but he's called us and brought us into a place a solemn meeting place God never called you to a church he called you to himself amen amen he said let him come unto me he didn't say let him come under the church let him come unto me too many people have a church experience but don't have a Christ experience is that right I want a Christ experience amen so Jesus was speaking directly and distinctly that this great feast was the last feast and if you notice Jesus showed up on the last they are the feast I mean you remember early on in the chapter uh uh John chapter 7 amen uh he said that he was not going to go up then when you go up to the feast he said no I will not go here you go up I will not go up because my time is not yet so I would ask you did Jesus tell a story thank you he said I I will not go my time is not yet but then he went yo if you are a really good critic you could say well Jesus said something that wasn't true he said I'm not going out but he did oh I'll tell you there's some things about God you just cannot explain amen but amen he went to the feast and he he he cried out at the feast let him as the stars come unto me but you you if you go back and read the story I won't go there but but if you go back and look at it the people didn't know who he was as a matter of fact when Jesus came to the feast and he made that statement amen it caused a division the Bible says there was a division because of him Hallelujah Jesus causes division sometimes amen not that he wants to but just by speaking the truth because what they didn't know who he was and though and they were they one of us yeah they're trying to say away it's not this that Prophet from Galilean oh no Prophet comes out of Galilee and he argued about it finally that do you also Come From Galilee or they were just fussing at one another and all of this they didn't understand who Jesus Christ was but the invitation had gone out amen he that has thirsty let him come to me that's all yo listen Jesus is not looking and I know he's his contrary to probably 98 of the churches in America or the world but Jesus is not looking to save the world [Music] I know I know you know he didn't believe it and you know I I know I know all those things we argue about but but bring it back to the Bible and look at the if Jesus is looking to save the world what did Jesus say I don't even pray for them but in John 17 I believe it is he prayed for you Hallelujah he said I pray for them I pray that they will be that they will have the same position as I had with the father I pray that they'll have the same place so Jesus prayed for us he prayed for the predestinated but he didn't pray for the world yo people become so upsetting yo when you say that the problem of God made the statement he says I don't even pray for America oh how terrible but you know God even told I believe it was uh Jeremiah or a seagull I forget which exactly right now but he told them he said don't even pray for them so it's exactly the scripture why because they have turned down the gospel they've turned down the supernatural message that God has sent and because this country in the world has turned it down judgment is coming upon the world and once you cross the line and the prophet of God said that she did cross the line now when you cross the line when they when a nation crosses the line they never come back across the line again right and when you as an individual cross the line between mercy and judgment you'll never come back to Mercy again is that right amen but don't let the devil lie to you and tell you that you crossed the line when you didn't thank you ah listen I I know the same devil you know personal confrontations with him sometimes I tell you I got I got conversations in my mind with him sometimes I just Mandy go on forever amen you know but I I always come out the winner not because I can out talk him but because I can go back to the book I go back to the Bible says all right you might have a good argument Satan but really it's not good enough because this is who I am and the Bible says greater is he that's in me and he that's in the world so get away from me amen greater he that's in you than he that's in the world who's the world Satan sickness lies everything contrary to the word is the world so if you have the Holy Spirit greater is he that's in you so don't let the devil lie to you say well you have crossed the line listen uh let me um I won't get through anything else I'm just going to quit at some point but but uh listen there's a difference between a predestinated seed and a non predestinated seed that can blaspheme right now I'm not predestined this he can blaspheme and never have a chance you married a woman that made the statement and said I wouldn't let my cow follow your religion what happened to her but what did Apostle Paul say I who was before a blasphemer figure that one out because Paul was a predestinated servant to the first church age and it is ignorance he said it but you know when that I know I know that just doesn't seem fair how could one blaspheme and yo never have a chance again but another guy can look Paul Paul was not Paul was not your favorite theologian he was feared amongst the church I'm talking about the Believers the Believers were afraid which at that time you saw right they were afraid of him but that seed was in him and no matter what he did and even so much that when when he met the light he had letters in his hand to take people like you and I and commit them to prison or do whatever he wanted to do he had the power he had the letters from the high priest and he was on his way to cause more trouble for the church and God said okay that's far enough Saul that says as long as my leash will go amen and Saul come the end of his Legion God said it's kind of like fishing you know you are you I might get a big one you let him go for so long but fine you know if it's a real big one and you yo you're coming to the end of the line say okay I gotta put the brakes on a little harder we're coming to the end of the road y'all want to just lock it up real quick go a little slows it doesn't break the line but finally come to the end of it amen anywhere you're wearing a little devil out but I guess the fish is not a devil but you know justify to the spirits like hey you wear that Old Devil out you know and then you know listen Saul Saul was Saul was so mean but he was religious I did that himself should tell you I you know I I think we all have met people like Saul religious as could be but mean as could be [Applause] go to church have a good time at church but in their heart they're full of evil but so amen was acting like a non predestinated seed but that's not what he was Hallelujah he had a seat on the inside that was predestinated that came from the mind of God before the foundation of the world and God says today it's your day this is as far as you want to go I'm going to reel you in amen and he was on his road down in God and he met that Pillar of Fire and brother Madison knocked him off his high horse anything you wander around in the dirt for a while because you lost his eye that that light blinded him oh Hallelujah May that light blind us to the things of the world amen may have blind us to all the carnelly around us amen and the boy says soul Soul what persecutes thou me now him being a Hebrew he knew that the light had to be Jehovah laughs oh he said Lord who are you all the prophet of God said that that that scholar saw me in a store he would never he would have never called I mean he knew that Delight he knew that that had to be the Lord Lord who are you and to his surprise to his surprise the boys came back says I am Jesus now put yourself in salt choose from it you imagine if you were Saul and you were persecuting those people that were trying to tell you that there was a man in the land by the name of Jesus he was a prophet he did all these things and you're trying to you're trying to stab all that nonsense you're trying to put those people in prison you're trying to get rid of those Fanatics that taught all those things and then the voice comes back and says I'm Jesus but you know what it was too late for Saul to do anything different than what he did because you're ready at calling Lord but then the boys come back says I'm Jesus and it's hard for you to kick against the pricks Hallelujah and you know the rest of the of the story but what was it Saul was predestinated amen and even though he was breathing out threatening God says today is your day maybe you're here today and maybe you're just sick and tired of it I just can't take anymore of this all I do is preach this and preach that and I just and God says today is your day amen why don't you ones meet the pillar of fire meet that same light that Saul met and it changed him and not only changed him but it changed his name Saul to Paul and at the same time I'm way over my notes now but at the same time God spoke to a man named ananias he said I want you to go to so and so and and pray for a certain man named Saul and I said oh wait a minute Lord you know I know we are the message church and we we have the truth and we we know well we know that you've raised from the dead and you send them a high and you send back the Holy Spirit and we are these Brave message Believers but do you know who you got Lord do you know who you're talking about can you imagine saying that he didn't exactly say those words but he didn't question Lord we have heard many things about this man but God said don't worry about it don't worry about it I have ordained him oh and then and now look look at that at the change of attitude with ananias well he went down there and he met Saul he goes brother Saul no more you're my enemy or I'm afraid of you oh I I know I don't know if my brother's all God has spoke on both ends is that right and got it listen I don't believe and you'll think about it you know maybe uh uh maybe Saul had committed some of ananias's family to prison maybe yeah committed young to death I don't know what he did because they all knew each other you understand so maybe uh somebody anodized his family was imprisoned because of Saul I tell you it'll take the Holy Spirit the wrap your arms around us always say God bless you brother amen but I'm here to tell you if you have the Holy Spirit you can do it you can't forgive one another they might have mistreated you yo whatever stole from you cheated you in business whatever it might be but if you have the Holy Spirit you can say God bless you brother [Applause] you know what we're coming to communion aren't we ah it's not my place to preach those things I guess I'm not the pastor here but you know and we're coming to the Lord's table let's come with a clear mind let's come with no no ought against one another God has brought you into a solemn meeting place a place of worship that he has chosen Hallelujah God chose the place of worship and the place of worship is not easy like Tabernacle but it's Jesus Christ [Applause] he's at the place that I choose to put my name and he chose to put his name in Jesus Christ oh I'm so glad that God sent us a message today amen that has taken us away from thinking that we have to belong to a certain Church and then but we've been called through Jesus Christ amen but listen let me tell you something if you call to Jesus Christ you will go to church somewhere oh yeah I think yo I catch those Spirits I'm dying well bless God that's right brother Bill I'm just Christ I need the fellowship with nobody Church do you imagine brother Parish I thought so like I'll be it was right there he just pulled it out but yo I claim to have the Holy Spirit he claims to have the Holy Spirit but I'm never going to fellowship with him I'm called the Christ I don't need your fellowship can you imagine we need one another that's right and if you if you yo uh I don't want to ruin the service anyhow but but uh you know if you have the Holy Spirit it will go the extra mile with the same spirit that's what people go to sports uh uh things you know because and you know the thing about going to uh doing sports event is you know when you go there you know that every person there wanted to be there at least I hope so you know why would you pay the price why would you buy a ticket if you don't want to be there just tell your friends I don't want to go so you know when you go to the sports event they all wanted to be there it's a little different than Church because when you come here you don't know for sure that everybody wanted to be here oh Hallelujah say Amen anyhow because there's always somebody that really is going to be here I'm just here because or let me just say even if you are just here because God can still save you this morning and the reason I said save you because if you don't want to be here you're probably not saved I'm sorry but the gospel is the gospel of truth is the truth if we claim to have the spirit of God we're going to do what things do to have this the people who have the spirit of God how can I say I love the Lord but I'm not going to do what the word says so if you don't like coming to church you know it is yeah it's a drag to come here just get saved it'll be all right I better go on oh my but you know Jesus said uh and yes I said we're in the last Church age right Jesus said in Revelation 3 20 behold I stand at the door so if he's standing at the door that means he's probably on the outside right because the scripture goes on and says if you open it he'll come in so he's on the outside he's knocking and this is the only church age that Jesus was outside the church now stop and thinking about that you know we we uh you know as as message Believers we've gotten so used to these scriptures and things we don't think much about sometimes but think about really what that scripture means if he's standing outside the church then that means that the church I'm just speaking not not individual churches now but I'm speaking of the church age in general that that Christ is not in the church age therefore most of your churches that are gathering today to have church are gathering without Jesus oh come on I I know we don't like that we but but that's the truth he's not in there he's outside and he's calling not to a church but to the individual [Applause] right he that hears what my voice and his voice is the word [Applause] he that hears my word and Believers on him that sent me has everlasting life right so he that hears my voice amen and opened the door that's why that's why there was no handle on the outside of the door that the art is painted you remember the story he said there's just one flaw with your pain there's no handle on the outside it's all that's the purpose of the painting that's the main point of it is there's no handle you have to open it oh Hallelujah I can't open the door for you I can't open it here come on in no you have to open it when Jesus calls out come unto me are you that labor and are heavy laden I'll give you a rest even Jesus himself will not force the door open could Jesus open the door yes sure he could he can go through the door he wanted to the dog would even have to hold me and just go through it right but he wants you to open it he he wants to call to you and let you respond back oh yeah and as soon as you open that door he's ready to come in you remember those those two um in uh Luke chapter 24 on the road to Emmaus and he went on the journey you remember and Jesus stepped out walked with them and it started talking down and they had no idea who it was like a lot of church people crossing me right in the midst speaking to you and a lot of people don't even recognize who it is finally finally after all they're they're talking the things they finally Jesus at all fools didn't you like your pastor to call you fool fool this love heart you believe all that the prophets have spoken all night Christ have suffered first he goes on and he starts he starts revealing himself what by the scripture he could just come out and said look guys I am the Messiah I race from the dead here I am but he had to take the word and the Bible say he went back and he began at Moses amen and brought up all the prophecies and the things that was concerning himself I like it he wasn't preached about somebody else he was preaching about himself and then when we preach about the end time message and the word that God has said we're preaching about ourself what God has done for us I mean I don't mean are you you understand what I mean amen we're preaching about this day the word speaks about me the Bible said I'm an overcomer I'm preaching about me you're preaching about you is that right and then when it comes to the end of the journey where they were going he made as though he would go on why he Jesus Christ is always the same in character every age I stand at the door and knock you have to open I won't force my way in they come to the end of their Road he acts like it's going to go on and they said oh Master abide with us he had to be invited and brother man said Jesus always goes where he's invited [Applause] oh that's why sometimes he would even go to places amen where the Pharisees would never go he talked to people at the Pharisees would never talk to aren't you glad he talks to prostitute drug addicts the woman at the well that's not that's what she was she had too many husbands how do you explain any other way anymore a woman and Jesus knew how his disciples were thinking he knew what they would think if they would catch him talking to a woman like that so if the Bible said he sent them away to get food and while they're away getting food he talks to the woman what he didn't finish the conversation quick enough they came back and caught him [Music] [Laughter] Hallelujah they come back the trip was a little quicker than than well not I Jesus knows all things so he of course knew but but they come back quicker than expected maybe they come up and they they hear the conversation they see the woman they know who she is they know she was and her master was talking to them yo even the decide people boss just couldn't believe it their master talking to a person like that and so they listened to the conversation for a little bit and uh he said he says go get your husband you know they they knew the story of the woman right so they're like oh my and then she says I have no husband young Johnson maybe to Peter is Wheaton told everybody that our masters never wrong that discernment that discernment is never wrong go get your husband I have no husband oh deflated like a balloon but I said you remember the next words oh I'm so glad there's always another word it's also written that's another word amen he says you have said the truth you have five and the one you're with now is not yours oh my listen that discernment never fails you remember a story about brother Brandon I'm in a meeting call out a lady and he said you live at so-and-so place and her friend that came with her to the meeting yo she knew no she don't live in she don't live at that address and she's like oh what do I do now he missed it but what you didn't know even her friend didn't know I tell you God is up to date the holy spirit is up to date [Music] her friend didn't know that she had moved but the Holy Spirit knew it I wrote a tape this morning I believe it was preaching Cleveland Tennessee and he's come to the end and he started calling people out he he had talked about the angel that came Abraham had his back turned so he turned his back to the audience he starts talking to the people and he says think about this he's got his back to the audience and he says there's a man to my right I'm looking right at him huh there's no mirror up there right I'm looking right at him and he says you have you have such and such he says you are in Mennonite your name is Reverend Mr Miller you know I would like to ask the critics of this day that have left the message and try to tell us it's false I would like to know why out of the thousands of times that somebody on the tapes didn't raise up that that you could hear it and say ah brother Branham that is absolutely false I challenge you go look for a place where you ever hear that you will never hear it but what you will always hear is your reaction that what he told them was right and if you ever pay attention to some of those discernments in one person he sometimes names as much as 15 different things and one discernment that there's no way he could have known that that oak tree was on the left side of the driveway see we don't think about it because well I see you live here on the road curves this way and there's a tree over here the house sits over here and if you really pay attention to what he's saying there's just one thing you have to know they have to know they have another how did he know and surely if he was guessing him he's going to get something wrong probably all of it God has brought you into a place a solid meeting place God didn't call you the brother Branham he called you to himself and then Christ is our solemn meeting place hallelujah amen this message is more than justice social Gathering or just to Gathering other people together listen we're not starting another church age we are at the end of the ages of the Seven Ages and were do we go from here amen there's only seven days in a week right the Bible speaks of an eighth day oh I know we got people trying to tell us that we're now in the Eighth Day um I'm very sad to disappointed we are because I expected the age day to be something different than what the seventh was because the Bible calls this day a holy convocation you say well what's he talking about then brother Bill it's talking about eternity right Sunday Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday what's the next day after Saturday oh we're back to the first day you know Jesus raised on the first day of the week Monday's not the first day of the week right Jesus raised on the first day of the week which was Sunday that's why we have church on Sunday to honor the resurrection and the Holy Ghost came back on the day of Pentecost right on the first day of the week that's why we have church on Sunday not Saturday amen is for us and you know what one day the Jews will recognize that but right now you haven't recognized it yet but you have been called into this holy convocation our reality a message amen listen when Jesus was at the feast amen there was very few that recognized who he was and I'll say today that is very few in this generation in this church age that recognize what this message is foreign to a lot of people it's just another you know we have our favorite scriptures you know Revelation 10 7 Malachi 4 no it's more than that yo when when Nehemiah had built the wall and and you know the wall was restored that in this chapter they come back they gathered together and they bought they brought the book yeah they brought the book part two the priests that they might read it and the Bible said that what are they going to read they went back to the law of Moses and then because that was their foundation and their worship had been restored as it was in that day but when when the wall was torn down and all that happened the Bible says that they hadn't worshiped that way since the days of Joshua but now the wall has been built up under much opposition and you are still pressing on under much opposition the world doesn't like you you realize what you believe is absolutely not politically correct [Music] and if the world this generation especially ever really get a hold of some of the things that brother Branham said it might end it might send us to jail but good if you don't believe that I say you haven't heard very many tapes lately because everything he preached toward this church age apart the signs of the time he preached many times and shows it sounds like he preached it yesterday Hallelujah we are a rare breed hahaha Hallelujah you are a special people why because you you have been brought together up to hear the law once again in time I'm not speaking of this day your eyes have been opened what to receive the Seven Seals Amen brother Brandon said that the Seven Seals to us or or rather the law to Israel was what the Seven Seals are to us it was God's provide away when Moses gave the law that was their Foundation that was their teaching that was gospel right away and that's what brought them when Nicki Minaj the wall and brought them back that's why he went back to Moses yo people laugh at us cause oh you're so quoting that Prophet aren't you yeah which one Moses about random I'll quote both of them Paul Paul was two thousand years ago you see if it's a true prophet and take this the way I mean it if it's a true Prophet what he preaches is as good as what's in the Bible where you say that something to tell you you know what people really think you know we're not pleasing by the random above anything but if it's a war listen the word comes to the prophet and not just because we say so but because God Vindicated it okay and we are ordained to stay with the vindication because the Vindication was not just for real talking about all these things to happen but it brought us back to the word just like Nehemiah and when they read the law and everything was distorted there the name was revealed to them what tribe they they come from all these things was restored under nehemiah's Ministry Why by reading the law by reading Moses a man Moses was a man right but the word he gave was true for every generation for Israel and if you notice one of your your best known scriptures in the message Malachi 4 what does it say remember ye the law of Moses why God is getting ready to turn us back not getting ready I'm speaking you know past tense when the message came what to turn our hearts back she says Remember You The Law of Moses my servant which I commanded him in horror right and then he goes on and do I will send you lie to the prophet in other words the word will come up through every generation just like Jesus came unless and still stood up on the last day of the feast we are in the last feast and Jesus has stood up amongst us and showed himself Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah we're worshiping under the Feast of Tabernacles we're worshiping under the last church-aged message and when this ends up we'll go into then we'll go into the Eighth Day spiritually speaking is that right Hallelujah God has brought what he has restored it back the word convocation means a a calling out a calling out that we've been brought to a holy convocation oh try to get a hold of it that you're not just coming to evening light Tabernacle you're not just going to a church and hearing somebody preach and yell at you and whatever or or Shake somebody's hand you've been called to a holy convocation you've been called to a place of worship reverence the presence of the Lord will bring reverence it's not the holy people it wasn't the holy God on the mountain I mean what's the holy God rather it wasn't the Holy Mountain it was the God on the mountain Hallelujah and it's not the only people it's God in the people it's the holy ghost in the people hahaha Hallelujah and man we're nothing we're dirt but saved by grace Hallelujah oh the Holy Ghost in power and it's keeping me alive it's keeping me alive I don't even know the song but it's still keeping me alive amen I know something has kept me amen what is it God God amen has come amongst us amen I'm just going to bring it to a closer I'll never get done but I know we got communion in the service just shortly after again but let me just say this morning you are called to a special place and that special place is in Jesus Christ and if you're in Jesus Christ as I said before you will do the works of Christ you'll live for Christ you'll dress like you're a Christian come on oh it's still the truth it don't matter how old he gets don't matter how few people do it it's still true you know we can we we can preach these things and you know because we can read it in the message so it's a little bit easier for us to say it because somebody already said it but you go back and put yourself in the shoes of brother Branham and what he was preaching the opposition he faced to say those things but that message opened up the way for us I say this morning God help us to stay with what he brought help us not to compromise amen young people you are an overcomer don't let the devil say you can't make it by the grace of God by the problems of God you've already made you say well I just don't feel like it I don't I feel like a loser who doesn't feel like a loser sometimes we've all felt like a loser but I don't care what we rise above the feelings and the emotions in our flesh all because greater's he that's in meat and he that's in the world is flesh there's something on the way that Jesus on the inside working to the outside making a difference if Jesus doesn't make a difference in your life you have not met him when he met the woman at the well it changed her life it changed his life One Moment In His presence and Zacchaeus said I'll make everything right whatever Iraq take it illegally up pay it back fourfold showing that he was a Jew that believed the law because that was the requirement and he immediately went up on meeting Jesus he says I will repay everything which also shows that he knew that he had he had cheated some people all right otherwise why would he be sorry oh I'll repair it he just admitted I'm guilty yeah you ask people down to a certain question

one thing that will cover your sin and that's the blood of Jesus Christ how do we get him up our hands because you remember Jesus is on your hands how do you get them off by accepting them in your heart couldn't wash it off he tried to wash his hands there's no water there's no worldly entertainment there's nothing there's no religious spirit there's nothing that can wash the blood of Jesus off of your hands it's only one way to get it off say Lord I accept it in my heart hey man let's stand together don't you want to do that this morning let's accept him in our heart because he's on your
