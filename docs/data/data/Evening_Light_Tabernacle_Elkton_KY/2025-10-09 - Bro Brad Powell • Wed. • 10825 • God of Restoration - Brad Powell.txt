Tonight, we want to remember Sister Janette, Father, she was at the hospital and Father, for her breathing, couldn't breathe right, Lord. And the doctors don't know for sure if it's just the heart or if it's the lungs, Lord. But we're going to do test next week.

I believe we hitting on two and four tonight. [Music] Does everybody get that or it's a it's a drummer's thing. Okay. But man, y'all sound good tonight. &gt;&gt; Here to praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And uh it's not fair. You sang my favorite song and I'm pinned up in the back. &gt;&gt; And uh you know, my theophony was calling me, too. &gt;&gt; And so, we're looking forward to the to the word tonight. And I've got a little something I want to share with you. Won't you have your seats for just a minute? Let my eyes adjust here. I've been reading up close. You know, when you get over 40, if you read close, you can't see far away. If you look far away, you can't read up close. So, I have to have to find a balance in that there. So, uh you know, and I was thinking and getting ready to come and and studying out the word and trying to get ready for tonight's service. And I thought about this come to my mind. and thought, "Why are we why are we at church? &gt;&gt; Why why do why did you ask yourself, why did I come to church tonight? &gt;&gt; Is it just because it's a Wednesday night and it's the thing we're supposed to do?" &gt;&gt; Or do we come to church because we have a need? We we have a desire. We have we want something more from God. We're wanting We need a We need healing. We need deliverance. We need freedom from bondage. What is the reason? Why did you come through those doors tonight? &gt;&gt; Because I believe when we come through those doors with with an attitude of Lord, I'm here because I need I want I desire a closer walk with you. I desire a better relationship with you. I desire a a physical touch in my body. And we come with that attitude and not just, well, it's Wednesday night, so I'm going to church. &gt;&gt; But come with a need. Come with a desire. Come with with expectations. And see if God doesn't begin to meet your expectations in your life &gt;&gt; because he's there. That's what he wants. He wants to meet your expectations. &gt;&gt; You know, there's there's nothing greater than than a father that's able to when their child wants something to go in and just say, "I I want to do this for you, son. I want to do this for you, daughter, because I know I know you want this. I know you desire it. And and I want to meet those expectations because I'm able to do it. &gt;&gt; You know, WE GOT A GOD that's able to do &gt;&gt; above, beyond, and abundantly beyond what we could ever imagine. &gt;&gt; So, so when when we come into the house of God, let's ask ourselves, why am I really here? &gt;&gt; That that was just kind of free for you. But it it you know I thought about it. I thought that's the way I have to be. That's the way we all ministers have to come and say, 'Lord, how do you want to use me tonight? What are the needs of the people? You know, your prayers that you put before God inspires the minister on what to preach? &gt;&gt; Because we've all had writer's block. Is that right, Brother Baler? We be in a study and we're like, my goodness, I don't know what we're going to do tonight. I don't know what we're going to preach. I don't know what I'm going to say. I don't know what we're going to do. But then somebody begins to pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, I have this in my life. This is in my life. I need this. Lord, I have this desire. And then, you know, it works on a on a two-way line. It's and and and it goes up to the main line. It comes down and it begins to come into the heart of the preacher. And all of a sudden, you're going down avenues you never even be on never even imagined that you was going to be going down. &gt;&gt; For one, That's the way God works. I want to share this with you real quick as a as a testimony and and and a testimony of our church. You know, I I believe we're a a a church that is on fire and that is that the the Holy Ghost is moving in the lives of the people. We're seeing the manifestations of the power and demonstration of God in our church and in our lives, in our homes and our children, and in the people we come in contact with. We had prayer for a gentleman named Roy. Uh you might remember some here a while back and he was going to go he has prostate prostate cancer and and and it was it was the one we was telling you about and we had prayer for him and and they sent us an update. They'd been down to the Mayo Clinic and it says the the doctors at Mayo recommends Roy have more aggressive treatment. They're in alignment with the doctors in Houston. Hormone therapy radiation. We have an appointment with Vanderbilt on Friday. If you recall, she says Vanderbilt is reluctant to do radiation because it has metastasized to various areas. So Vanderbilt gives not a very good report. This is what she says next. However, Mayo Clinic did a new PSA test today and his PSA is 4.1, the lowest it has ever been. It gets better. She says, "We are believing God is hearing and answering your prayers." You see how God uses his people? He's believe we we believe in that God is hearing and answering your prayers. Thank you so much for all the prayers you have offered up on Royy's behalf. He is definitely sustaining us and we are confident that he will continue to guide us. Bless you. &gt;&gt; That was just coincidence. She said bless you. But that's how God is moving in the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; The people we come in contact with, they begin to have confidence because of the life we live. &gt;&gt; They see the things that's happening in a church that's on fire where the Holy Ghost is moving in the people and the people are getting back to the original word. And we're seeing the manifestation and the power and demonstration of THE HOLY GHOST IN action in a church. I want to read this to you as we get ready to get started here and and this brother Brandham here and and then we'll stand for a reading of the word. We got several scriptures we want to go to, but I want to read this to you. We're getting back on our church ages uh series here and it says, "The end time evangelist message is from Malachi 4. It is a restoring. The message and messenger both will have to be a restoration of the faith." I believe that's what we're seeing. And he will restore the faith of the children back to or the faith of the children back to the fathers just before the destruction of time. What is it? It's a message that goes forth, a message and messenger of the last days. That's not to bring them to a creed. And we read this last time, but I want to read it again. BUT TO JERK THEM OUT OF THOSE creeds and bring them back to the original faith. THAT'S WHERE I WANTED TO GET TO THE ORIGINAL FAITH, BROTHERS and sisters. I'm looking for an ORIGINAL GOSPEL. &gt;&gt; I'M NOT LOOKING for some KIND OF COUNTERFEIT GOSPEL. I'M NOT LOOKING FOR A COUNTERFEIT RELIGION, a counterfeit healing, a counterfeit deliverance, a counterfeit salvation, but I'm looking for an original, SOMETHING THAT WILL STICK INTO the lives of me and the believers. the Pentecostal fathers where the church is to be in the last days. Not the Mosaic fathers, but the Pentecostal fathers. It's a message that'll go forth that'll what HE SAYS IT'LL RESTORE THE FAITH OF THE PEOPLE, the church today that's out of all these different corruptions and putrified and sword body of denominations. &gt;&gt; How many can say that's where we used to be? But it's getting it back to a living faith. It's not a dead faith. &gt;&gt; It's not something that's tucked away in a tomb or something that was in a days gone by, but it is a living faith and a living God. The message, listen to this. I think this is astonishing. The message has been going on for years. We talk about the message of the hour and he says the message has been going on for years. HE SAYS THAT'S RIGHT. IT'S time now that we should receive and believe the end time evangelism is to restore. Joel says in the book of Joel, I will restore all the years that the canker worm has eaten. He says TO RESTORE HIS BRIDE, THE ONE THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN in Eden, but she fell because she disbelieved the word. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He says, "But here she's he he's going to restore a tree that will believe the word." &gt;&gt; You know, it does us no good to know the word, to read the word, study the word if we don't put the word in action. If the word DOES NOT BECOME ALIVE ON THE INSIDE, what good does it do TO HAVE IT? &gt;&gt; KNOWLEDGE IS NO good if you don't deliver what you know. &gt;&gt; So here believe the word and she'll come up on the day on the day of Pentecost that original doctrine that original faith. But what did Rome do? He says, "Rome then comes in and they begin to send in a cankerworm and they send in a palmer worm and they begin to come in here and they begin to eat eat his part off the fruit and they eat the leaves and they eat EVERYTHING AND THEY SUCKED IT all down." &gt;&gt; So man-made religion comes into the original word of God. THE WORD OF GOD THAT WAS JESUS CHRIST IN action in the apostles. JESUS CHRIST IN action in the believers. &gt;&gt; And now the message has now become distorted by man-made ideas. And these worms are eating and eating and eating and gnawing and gnawing. Now if you think that is just a simple thing, let me tell you how many's ever seen a field full of army worms. Has anybody ever seen it? I witnessed it. It is the most amazing, frustrating, discouraging thing that you'll ever see. our whole back back field. We had it looking good. It was green. It was full. It was lush. It was just beautiful a couple years ago. And I begin to look out there one morning. I'm watching and it's getting brown. It's just like a strip and it's getting brown and it's getting brown. AND AS AS TIME GOES ON, WITHIN HOURS, these worms, these army worms have begun to eat in our field. AND THEY START AT ONE end and they just go and they devour &gt;&gt; whatever is in their way. If it's green, it's dead. &gt;&gt; And so our whole field, we could just watch it just like it was just like moving like a wave of of of of uh destruction coming across the field. And that's what has happened in the with the word of God over time. man has went in and they begin to devour it with their man-made traditions, their man-made theologies, &gt;&gt; THEIR IDEAS THAT THEY want to live by, &gt;&gt; instead of sticking to the root word. &gt;&gt; This is the greenery. This is the life. [Applause] &gt;&gt; This is what sustains YOU. THIS IS THE WATER OF THE WORD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; And yet the canker worms and the palmer worms and they come in and they eat and they eat and they take out and they destroy and THEY BEGIN TO PICK APART the word the way they want it to read. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a destruction that's taking place across the land. Stand with me for the reading of the word if you could. We we went a completely different direction from where we was going to. We were going to talk about Job and somebody didn't want to talk about Job. So, we're still going to talk about restoration, but we're going in a different direction. Turn with me if you would to Ecclesiastes chapter 3. If Brother Devin get that up, it would sure help me. There we go. And verse 14 and 15. I know that whatsoever God doeth, it shall be forever. Now, that didn't say for a short period of time, did it? &gt;&gt; Forever. Nothing can be put to it, nor any taken from it, and God doeth it that men should fear before him. That which hath been is now, and that which is to be hath already been. And God requireth that which is past. Hebrews chapter 13. Familiar scripture. Very familiar scripture. Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and &gt;&gt; forever. Be not carried about with diverse and strange doctrines, the Palmer worm, the canker worm. For it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace, not with meats which have not profited them that have been occupied therein. Last one, John 1 and one 1-5. In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God, and the word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him, and without him was not anything made that was made. In him was life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In him was life, &gt;&gt; and the life was the light of men, and the light shineth in darkness, and darkness comprehended it not. Let's just pray. Heavenly Father, we come before you tonight and we just thankful for uh the service thus far, Lord. And we just ask that you continue to move and bless and anoint anoint the speaker tonight, Lord, that I could get myself out of the way and just take this these broken thoughts that you've placed on my heart and deliver it to the needy hearts that have need of it tonight, Lord. And I raise my hand and say, "Lord, I need it. I need more of you. I need more revelation. I need more uh uh more uh discipline in this hour. I need more uh of a closer walk with you, Father. So Lord, bless us tonight with your presence and your word tonight. We love you. We give you honor, praise, and glory. And may everything we say and do and the worship and the praise at the end of service just bring glory to you and be pleasing to your ears tonight, Lord. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. You can have your seats. Now, in laying a foundation tonight, I want to take a a thought and speak briefly on a topic that's been in the news lately. And and you know, I I was looking at this and I I began to think about it and you know, we have a Secretary of Defense or Secretary of War we call him now. I kind of like it that way. But, uh, we have a Secretary of War defense, Pete Hegsth. And Pete Hexth, how many has kept up with anything in the news in the last two weeks? Few hands. But Pete Hexth, who is a secretary of defense, became the secretary in January of 25 this year. So this last couple of weeks, he calls in all of the generals into the military and all the flagged officers, everybody of importance, of leadership, and he calls them into Quantico, Virginia. Now, you can imagine the rumors going around. We're fixing to start World War II. This is happening. Russia's doing this. Russia's doing that. It had nothing to do with that. But his whole commission, his whole his whole directive was aimed at a project that he called restoring military standards. Restoring military standards. NOW, THIS STANDARD IS SOMETHING THAT HE wanted to he wanted to put it out across THE WHOLE UNITED STATES armed services. He he he put these in place and he wants to look at this and he wants to to change the focus of physical fitness, of grooming, of training, and he wants to eliminate policies related to diversity and inclusion. &gt;&gt; You think, man, where in the world are you going with this? BUT HE HAS PUT THESE STANDARDS OF PRACTICE IN PLACE THAT THE ARMY HAS TO follow this standard. The Navy has to follow this standard. And I'm assuming the Air Force has to follow this standard. &gt;&gt; Yeah. The Marines have to follow a standard. And he says he begins to look at this and he's beginning to GET THEM INTO A PLACE. WHY? HE'S WANTING TO GET THEM BACK TO A STANDARD, TO A WAY of living that everybody IS FOLLOWING THE WORD THE WAY IT WAS WRITTEN. AND HE'S TALKING ABOUT HE WANTS TO GET RID of the diversity and the inclusion. And that's what we need. WE NEED PREACHERS IN THIS HOUR WHO will stand BEHIND THE PULLPIT AND TELL PEOPLE THE TRUTH AND THE WORD THE WAY IT WAS WRITTEN AND THE way it was delivered on the day of Pentecost. AND QUIT LETTING PEOPLE DIVERT THE WORD TO THE WAY THEY LIKE IT. &gt;&gt; THEY DIVERT THIS WAY AND THEY DIVERT THAT WAY. AND CHRISTIANITY IS an inclusive deal anymore. &gt;&gt; LET ME TELL YOU, HEAVEN IS NOT AN ALL-INCLUSIVE RESORT. &gt;&gt; NOT EVERYBODY'S GOING. But the WORLD LOOKS AT IT AND THEY CLAIM Christianity fits everybody. Aussie Osburn and tell how many souls he sent to hell with his music, his image. But you know, somebody said, "I got to witness to him at the very end." and and and he he he said he loved the Lord and and I gave him a Bible and I hope he did. I hope he did. But not everybody's going. Not everybody's going. So as Pete Hegth begin to put this out, some of the generals liked him, some of them love him, some of them hate him. But he's got a standard. So I'm not here to debate or question tonight whether we like him, love him, or hate him. That's not that's not the story. But what we're looking at tonight, BUT WHAT I WOULD DO want to see is the key principles that he introduced. Pete Hgse did not introduce something that he just came up with. HE DID NOT MANUFACTURE A SET OF STANDARDS that said, "Well, I think I want to do it this way because I'm the Secretary of War. I'm the Secretary of Defense. I WANT THIS TO be the standard. He didn't come UP WITH THAT. HE didn't dream this up or manufacture this and say, "Oh, I think this WOULD WORK BETTER. I think we would have a better a better church if this would happen." &gt;&gt; He didn't do that. But when we look AT WHAT HE DID, HE TOOK A SET OF GUIDELINES. HE TOOK A SET OF GUIDELINES THAT WERE ESTABLISHED THAT WERE ESTABLISHED YEARS and years and years ago. AND THEY WERE ESTABLISHED TO PREPARE SOLDIERS FOR THE BATTLE AND FOR A WAR THAT WAS BEING FOUGHT ON A BATTLEFIELD. &gt;&gt; We didn't come one OF THE MO WE didn't become one of the most uh most dominant militaries in in in the history of the world by being dirty, &gt;&gt; by being lazy, &gt;&gt; by not studying our enemy. &gt;&gt; So why is it okay for Christians to walk that way? WHY IS IT OKAY FOR US TO TO TO TO GET DOY on the WORD TO GET DOY AND TO PULL BACK AND NOT REALLY GET IN there and dig into the WORD OR TO STAY ON FIRE? &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, HE'S requiring these guys to exercise twice a day or daily and then come in for a physical fitness test every six months AND IF THEY DON'T PASS, they be reprimanded and they're put on a probation period. What if God done that for us? Brother Ver, did you read your Bible today? Don't answer. Don't Don't I'm not Don't get the rope. Did you read your Bible today? Did you pray today? Six months down the road, what have you done? Hey, we all have to have stuff to keep us on track. I got this app, y'all. I've been trying to read the Bible in a year, and I and I do it, but I I I don't know that I'd do it in a year because I lose track. So, I got this app now. You know, this this right here, this phone can be the the best thing or the worst thing. &gt;&gt; So, I got this app here, Holy Bible, Bible, my plan. That's what I got. My plan. Bible in a year. 365 day reading plan. I just started it in the middle of the month last month. I'm 23 days in. I'm one day ahead. I like it when it says I'm one day ahead. Cuz I have seen it when it says uh you're behind. But we need things to keep us on track. AND THAT'S THE WAY THE MILITARY HAS BECOME. THEY begin to PUT OUT THIS BLUEPRINT. AND IT'S A BLUEPRINT THAT WAS PROVEN. IT'S BEEN TESTED. IT'S BEEN TRIED WHEN OUR MILITARY WAS AT ITS PEAK. &gt;&gt; Now listen, I'm not trying to get political tonight. That's not what I'M TRYING TO DO. BUT I DO want us to realize THAT THIS THESE POLICIES, THEY MANDATE PHYSICAL training for SERVICE MEMBERS. WE NEED PHYSICAL TRAINING as men and women, sons and DAUGHTERS OF GOD. WE NEED TO TRAIN OURSELVES TO THE WORD so that WHEN THE WORD GOES FORTH, &gt;&gt; we hear the word and we know the word. Because many times I'm afraid that we get so caught up in in the the preaching of the word that sometimes we amen when we should say oh me. &gt;&gt; So we have to have our ears trained to the word. NOW I WAS THINKING ABOUT THIS brothers and sisters. I was thinking on this department of defense versus department of war because you know it was a big thing. WE DON'T WANT TO BE CALLED THE DEPARTMENT of war. It looks like we're out to fight everybody. Like we're trying to dominate everybody. We're just a Department of Defense. It was originally called the Department of War. Am I right? &gt;&gt; You military guys, look at they shaking. They like this. I'm preaching down their alley tonight. IT WAS CALLED THE DEPARTMENT OF WAR. And I got to thinking about that and I thought, you know what? We as Christians, we are in a spiritual warfare tonight. &gt;&gt; WE LIVE EVERY DAY WE GET UP OUT OF THE BED AND OUR FEET HIT THE FLOOR. WE ARE IN A WAR. WE ARE IN A BATTLE. AND I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT I don't always want to be on the defense. &gt;&gt; When you're in THE DEFENSE, YOU'RE ALWAYS TAKING BLOWS. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE ALWAYS TAKING BLOWS. WHEN YOU'RE ON THE DEFENSE, you say, "Well, a boxer PUTS UP HIS GUARD AND HE'S GUARDING HIMSELF." WE GOT THE SHIELD OF WE GOT the shield of faith. We got righteousness. We got truth. WE GOT PRAYER. WE GOT ALL OF THOSE WEAPONS. WE'VE GOT THE WORD OF GOD, BUT WHAT GOOD DOES IT DO YOU TO HAVE THE WORD OF GOD IF YOU NEVER swing your sword? &gt;&gt; And we SIT BACK AND WE DEFEND against everything. Oh, the devil's hitting my my finances. Oh, the devil, he's he's hitting my children. The devil's hitting my home, my marriage. The devil's hitting ME OVER HERE. I I'VE lost my zeal. You're putting up your guard and you're taking lick after lick after lick. You ever seen a boxer? They put them in the ropes and they just wear them out. Some of us let the devil throw us in the ROPES AND JUST WEAR us out. &gt;&gt; WHY QUIT LIVING AS A DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AND FIND YOURSELF AS A DEPARTMENT OF WAR AND FIGHT YOUR BATTLES? PULL OUT THE SWORD. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities. &gt;&gt; You see, the life of the believer is against spiritual enemies. &gt;&gt; And we don't have to back down from these enemies. &gt;&gt; Think about it. Listen what the word says. Finally, my brethren, be strong in the LORD, IN THE POWER OF HIS MIGHT. PUT ON THE WHOLE ARMOR of God &gt;&gt; that you may be able to STAND AGAINST THE WS OF THE DEVIL. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood blood, against principalities, against powers and rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. Therefore take unto you the whole armor. &gt;&gt; The whole armor, truth, righteousness, peace, salvation. This is the armor, the word of God. And when you've done all to withstand in the evil day, having done all to stand, stand therefore. &gt;&gt; You know, when you you look at the military and you look at the the military uh attire of the day that this is being described, you're putting on the whole armor, you got your helmet, you got your shield, you got your sword, YOU GOT ALL THIS armor on the front, but you KNOW WHERE YOU'RE NOT COVERED up in the back. YOU SEE, GOD DOESN'T PLAN ON HIS CHILDREN fleeing from the scene of THE BATTLE. &gt;&gt; YOU MAY GET DOWN. YOU MAY GET KNOCKED DOWN. YOU MAY FEEL LIKE YOU'RE DEPRESSED and defeated and you've been been OVERTAKEN BY THE ENEMY, BUT YOU NEVER TURN YOUR BACK. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE TOO EXPOSED STANDING FACE TO FACE AND SAY, "GOD, HELP ME FIGHT THIS BATTLE. &gt;&gt; I stand on THE WORD OF GOD, SO HELP ME FIGHT THIS BATTLE. The question was asked, why does the military have standards? This was this was when I was researching this, I found this question and I thought this is pretty good. Why does the military have standards? And the response to the question was this. Standards and discipline are the bedrock &gt;&gt; of military operations. They are vital for maintaining order, unit cohesion, ensuring readiness, and achieving mission success. I don't know about y'all, but I'm planning on taking a rapture. &gt;&gt; I'm planning on leaving this world, and I'm planning to do whatever IT TAKES TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN THAT MISSION. SO WHAT I NEED IS I NEED A WORD THAT STANDS UPON THE ROCK UPON THE WORD OF JESUS CHRIST. THIS BEDROCK, BROTHERS AND SISTERS, WHY WOULD THEY SAY BEDROCK? THEY SAID BEDROCK BECAUSE BEDROCK is considered the earth's foundation. When you get into A LAYER OF BEDROCK, IT'S A WELL cemented layer of rock and it MAKES A CONTINUOUS FOUNDATION through the earth's crust. This bedrock layer that there there is nothing that can break it. It doesn't change. It doesn't waver. IT DOESN'T RATTLE. ARE YOU WITH ME? &gt;&gt; WE NEED TO BE ON THE WORD OF GOD TONIGHT. THE ROCK OF THE HOUR. BROTHERS AND SISTERS, GOD IS looking for a group of believers in this end time &gt;&gt; that are building their life on a firm foundation of the word of God and the life of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; You see, upon this layer of bedrock, there's all kinds of loose sediment. There's sand, there's pebbles, there there's there's material that won't pack and won't stay tight. And it's they call it loose sediment, but that don't change the bedrock. You see, as believers, you may have to be out there around people in the world that's loose living. You may be surrounded by loose living people, &gt;&gt; but you have to be solid as bedrock. You have to be solid as bedrock. WHEN I NEEDED SALVATION, WHO DID I GO TO? &gt;&gt; The rock. &gt;&gt; When I needed A FRIEND, WHO DID I GO TO? &gt;&gt; The Rock. &gt;&gt; When I needed When I needed a shelter, WHO DID I GO TO? THE ROCK. WHEN I NEED AN ANSWER IN LIFE, WHO DO I GO TO? &gt;&gt; The Rock. &gt;&gt; He's the rock of my salvation. &gt;&gt; The Rock is where I stand. The song says, "When the winds of sorrow blew blow and and who do I go to? I go to the rock in the church age book in Ephesians church age part verse three or paragraph 3." He says, "The key given to me of the word of the Lord whereby I was able to determine the messenger for each age is a most scriptural one. In fact, it might be called the keystone in the Bible." How many knows what a keystone is? MJ's the only one in this building knows what a keystone is. Well, you're going to know tonight. The keystone is a central wedgehaped stone at the apex of an arch. So, if you want to know what a keystone looks like, when you go out of the building tonight, you look at these four windows right here. There's brick work that goes up the side. And as the bricks begin to turn up the arch, there is a there is a limestone looking rock or stone that sets up there that looks like this. It's wedge shaped and it goes in there and it wedges into those brick. Now that plays a very important system in that and the part of that the function because the keystone is the final stone that is placed into the arch or a vault. So here the builders go up and they take this and they begin to build up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up and they begin and then they stick this wedge this stone down in the brick. Now the weight of all of the building is now resting on that keystone. Do you see how important the keystone is? The weight of the entire building. It has to bear THE LOAD. AND WITHOUT the keystone, the arch collapses, the building collapses, the rest of the brick comes down and loses because all of the support is GONE AND IT FALLS. BROTHERS AND SISTERS, WE HAVE A keystone message. &gt;&gt; AND THE PROPHET TELLS US THAT THE KEYSTONE OF THE BIBLE, YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT IT IS. How many wants to know what the keystone of the Bible is? He says the keystone is the REVELATION THAT GOD NEVER CHANGES. THAT GOD NEVER CHANGES HIS WAYS and are unchangeable and and his ways are unchangeable as he is. And he goes back to Hebrews 13 and 8 and he goes back to Ecclesiastes 3 and he begins to read those scriptures and he SAYS HERE IT IS with an exclamation point. Here it is the unchanging God with unchanging ways. WHAT HE DID AT THE FIRST. &gt;&gt; What he did at the first, &gt;&gt; he says he will have to keep on doing until it's done for the last time. &gt;&gt; The message that's been going around the world since the days of Paul, the message that's been going around since 53, not 1953, 53. The message that's been going around, the keystone revelation is that God never changes. &gt;&gt; That message keeps going and going and going. It's a beautiful picture. It's beautiful when you begin to look at it. And he says, "There will never be a change." AND HE SAYS, "APPLY THAT TO the church ages." Can you imagine God's word, God's revelation, God and who he is and God's unchanging ways? If he's a healer then, he's a healer now. If he's a deliverer then, he's a deliverer now. &gt;&gt; If he's gives you freedom then, he gives you freedom now. &gt;&gt; And it keeps going AND IT KEEPS GOING. MESSAGE AFTER MESSAGE, AGE after age after age, it's never changed one time. He said, "Apply that to the church ages." The kind of man that God chose for the first age and how God manifested in that man's ministry would be an example for all other ages. SO WHAT GOD DID IN THE FIRST CHURCH age is what he listen what he wants to do in all other ages. &gt;&gt; He wants to do this. We read the Bible stories. We hear the things that happened. We hear the the the incredible stories. THESE ARE NOT JUST FAKE STORIES. THIS IS NOT FAKE NEWS. This is not CNN. &gt;&gt; THIS IS GOD MOVING DOWN THROUGH TIME AND delivering his people. So, HE WANTS TO BE YOUR HEALER. HE WANTS to be your freedom giver. &gt;&gt; He wants to be all these things. He wants to move in you. You say, "Well, I didn't want it." Neither did Paul. Did you realize that the messenger of the first age, Paul, is going down the road name was Saul? And he's going down the road and HE'S GOING TO PERSECUTE EVERYBODY that stands for Jesus. Do you realize that he didn't want to be the first age messenger? &gt;&gt; That's not what he was WANT TO DO. HE WAS WANTING TO STAND FIRM ON WHAT HE BELIEVED. &gt;&gt; HE WANTED TO TAKE THE MESSAGE AS HE understood it. &gt;&gt; But God says, "I can restore you, Paul. &gt;&gt; I CAN RESTORE YOU THE WAY I WANT TO BE IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN. I CAN BRING you all the WAY BACK." SO HERE PAUL, WHY DO YOU PERSECUTE? SAUL, WHY DO YOU PERSECUTE against me? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Lord, you know when he heard that voice, it was a different kind of atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Lord, AND WHAT DID GOD DO? GOD HAD TO BLIND HIM AND stricken him blind for what? Three days. And Ananas came and prayed for him, right? And Ananas WAS AFRAID BECAUSE HE WAS AFRAID OF WHAT SAUL WAS GOING TO DO TO HIM because he was going to persecute people like Ananas. &gt;&gt; BUT GOD SAYS, "I'M GOING TO USE SOMEBODY LIKE YOU, PAUL. I'm going to use somebody like you." AND HE BEGINS TO GO AND he begins to work and through and move through Paul through the life of the first age messenger Paul. And he begins to take THE MESSAGE AND HE takes the word. And the prophet said, "We know exactly what the word was because it was recorded by the Holy Spirit in the original church." &gt;&gt; Listen to this. He said it was founded in the original church and it was founded and God how God manifested himself in her. Did you hear what I said? &gt;&gt; In her. HE DIDN'T SAY, "AND GOD MANIFESTED himself in Paul and Peter and James and John and Mark and the rest of the apostles," but he said he manifested himself in her. So who is her? Who is her? It's a common misconception that the bride of Christ is only in the last age. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; We talk better than that. BUT IT'S A COMMON MISCONCEPTION THAT PEOPLE THINK, "OH, THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST IS IN THE LAST church age. That's all the bride is." But he says, "No, God manifested himself in her. That her WAS THE BRIDE OF THAT DAY. THAT'S WHO IT WAS. IT was the true believers from every age before us, every church age, Samrna, Pergamma, Thyra, Tatyra, Sardis, Philip, Leotaa. There was bride in every single age. &gt;&gt; You see how big? But what how how can you say that? Well, I'll tell you what he said. The message has been going around and around and around. So there was people aund years ago, &gt;&gt; 150 years ago that we never knew. Maybe some of your family, your great great great granddaddy. Maybe you had a great great great uncle. Maybe you got one that was in jail and you got one that was a believer. But that message was going around and around and around. He says, "Now there is a false bride." And we see her in Revelation 17. He said, ' But now the true bride will be made up of thousands times thousands of people. &gt;&gt; It will be the elect out of every church age. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine, brothers and sisters? CAN YOU IMAGINE the length of the marriage table supper uh t supper table thousands of miles long? Brother Baller. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; We made it. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; Come see me when you get time. &gt;&gt; I'll be there in a few thousand years. BUT BELIEVERS FROM THOUSANDS OF THOUSANDS OF BELIEVERS and he says what was it? It was from every age. Every time a message went forth the people believed it and accepted it in the light that it was. &gt;&gt; Now what does that say for us? We've got more light. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; We got more accountability. WE GOT MORE TO STAND ON. WE GOT MORE TO BELIEVE IN. WE'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO TO STAND A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN what they did, but they saw everything that was in their day and in their light. And he said, Jesus teaches that same thing. But behold, the bridegroom cometh and go out to meet him. Now, I want you to watch what he's talking here. He's he in this message, he's bringing it down. He says, "Those sleeping virgins," he's talking about the foolish virgin and the WISE VIRGINS. THE WISE VIRGINS, THEY'VE BEEN STANDING ON THAT ORIGINAL word and they've been standing there and they've been feeding on that word and feeding on that word and feeding on the word just eating it up. You say, "How do you know that?" Because they were full of oil. And he said the then then you got these sleeping versions. They come and they they rub their eyes. Can you imagine that? They're rubbing their eyes and here he's coming after them and they they're rubbing their eyes and trying to wake up from a slumber. And they said, "I suppose I should have some of that oil, too." You see, they've heard the trumpet sound in the last hour, in the last watch, AND THEY KNOW THAT THE BRIDE NOW they know the bridegroom's cometh. You see, people preach and they teach and they all over the world there's going to be a rapture. Jesus is coming back. Jesus is coming back. Come as you are. Alcoholic, drug addict, it doesn't matter. Just just come as you are. Wear what you want. Do what you want. Jesus is coming. They're rubbing their eyes. They're not seeing clearly. And so here now they're looking at they SAY, "MAYBE I SUPPOSE I should have some of this oil. MAYBE I MAYBE I SHOULD SEE ABOUT THIS Godhead deal that everybody's talking about around this message. MAY MAYBE MAYBE I SHOULD MAYBE I SHOULD LOOK INTO THIS WATER baptism thing. Maybe I should check this out a LITTLE BIT DEEPER. MAYBE I SHOULD MAYBE I SHOULD GET IN THERE AND and really see God and see that he is a healer and that he can deliver me from these habits that I have. &gt;&gt; You see, they're wanting it now. NOW THEY'RE WANTING GOD. NOW THEY'RE WANTING the true word because the hour is at hand. &gt;&gt; Brother Ber, I don't want to have to live like the any different tomorrow than I live today, knowing that the hours at hand. If Jesus comes tomorrow, I hope I can get up and my life I can live the same way as I live today. &gt;&gt; THAT'S HOW PREPARED I WANT TO BE. &gt;&gt; I don't want to be thinking all today I can get by with this or I can get by with that. THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; EVERY CHOICE and every decision we make in our lives affects tomorrow. &gt;&gt; And they're sitting here, maybe maybe I should get some me some oil. But brothers and sisters, it's too late then. It's too late for them to go get the oil. The bridegroom has already been announced. He's already on the scene. Don't be that foolish. Get your oil now. &gt;&gt; That's right. have your vessels full. Now, &gt;&gt; the real true bride is standing there and she says, "We got enough." Think about this. This real TRUE BRIDE, SHE'S STANDING THERE. SHE SAYS, "WE GOT ENOUGH FOR OURSELF. WE GOT ENOUGH OF the Holy Spirit." Brothers and sisters, THAT'S THE KIND OF LIFE I WANT TO LIVE. GOD, FILL ME UP WITH ENOUGH. MAKE SURE I'VE got enough. I don't want to come up short. give me enough. He says, she stands there and says, I've got enough to get in, but we can't give you nothing. And while that foolish virgin was gone, while that foolish virgin was gone, and now she's going to try to figure out how to get in. Now she's gone, she wants to try to figure out how to get some oil. and she's trying to figure this all out. And now while she's gone, the bridegroom comes and went in with the bride. And now the bridegroom looks at this this beautiful bride of Jesus Christ and says, "My love, my darling, my sweetheart, come away. &gt;&gt; Come away. Come away with me. You've lived virtuous. You've lived pure. You've tried to live a life without spot and wrinkle. You've longed for me. You've waited for me. You've been passionate about me. Your whole life. You've wanted me. Come away. What a great what a great feeling that'll be, brother Ber. What a great feeling that will be when he when he ascend when he descends and comes down and says come away. &gt;&gt; Come away. &gt;&gt; Come away. You see, he says it it isn't the way that we think. It isn't the way we think it will be. He says, "We we think that he's just going to hunt him out a few thousand people from this age and take them." He said, 'N no, it's the elected out of every age. &gt;&gt; Out of every age. So, we've established a standard. And we look at the church age book and we begin to read and we see that in this church age book, the prophet tells us that the church is the standard that was set on the day of Pentecost. that that is the standard for the believer today. And there's no other pattern. &gt;&gt; If you try to cut the pattern, it won't fit. &gt;&gt; You know, I can remember my grandmother, she used to go to the to one of them fabric stores. I'll say it's Jo-Ann's. It's probably was Jo-Ann's. That's an old place. Jo-Ann's Fabric. And they had these patterns in there. And you you go back there and you open up a drawer. And I can remember them little packages was paper packages that had three little kids or three something, three little people on it. Am I right? Some of you seamstress know what I'm talking about. And you go through there and you begin to look and you try to find out a pattern that you want to fit. And you want to make your clothes to fit you off of that pattern. But you know what? If you take that pattern and you lay it out and you got a pattern that fits you and you begin to trim it and you don't stay on the lines, well, that pattern don't fit no more. Now you're having to draw it in. Some of you know what I'm talking about. BUT GOD HAS SET A PATTERN. GOD HAS SET A PATTERN THAT DOES NOT CHANGE. AND THE one who will follow that PATTERN IS THE WISE, THE BORNAGAIN, BLOODBOUGHT, virtuous bride OF JESUS CHRIST. FOLLOWS THE PATTERN that has been laid before her. She doesn't try to trim it. &gt;&gt; She doesn't think, "Oh, I think it would look better if I cut a little bit off here." &gt;&gt; NO, SHE STICKS WITH THE PATTERN. AND no matter, he says, "No matter WHAT WHAT YOUR SCHOLARS SAY, THIS PATTERN HAS to stay the same." &gt;&gt; You know, Brother Brandham had a vision and he was talking about in this vision that the bride of Jesus Christ was marching in there. And he said, "Oh, they were so beautiful, long-haired, no makeup, and they were marching in the vision." And he said, "But all of a sudden, I seen one of them get out of step." AND HE SAID, "I BEGIN TO HOLLER AT HIM." &gt;&gt; You go look it up. That's what he said. I BEGIN TO HOLLER AT HIM. GET BACK IN LINE. GET BACK IN STEP. &gt;&gt; WHY WAS THAT? HE BECAUSE THEY WERE OFF THE PATTERN. HE SAID, BUT THEN AS THE VISION went on, he watched them and HE SAID THAT BRIDE, that virtuous bride was marching PERFECTLY IN LINE with the word. &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE HE TOOK THE WORD, THE MESSAGE THAT WAS going around and he brought it to the to the people in this age. &gt;&gt; And so now they're marching perfectly in line with the word. So the pattern don't change. It doesn't matter what scholars say. It doesn't matter what your neighbor thinks. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter what the church down the road teaches. It doesn't matter what some minister preaches. &gt;&gt; If it's off the word, &gt;&gt; it's off the pattern. Amen. &gt;&gt; If I preach something that's off the word, it's off the pattern. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You see why we talk about a standard has to be trained. An ear that's trained. &gt;&gt; You should be able to recognize when a preacher preaches something off the word. &gt;&gt; Your ear should be so tuned in. Yeah. &gt;&gt; If the prophet said that when every word of God goes forth, you can say and you can punctuate the word of God with an amen. &gt;&gt; What does that say when the word is misused? Oh me. &gt;&gt; We ought to be able to to catch that. Listen what he says. The fact of the matter IS THIS. WHAT GOD DID AT PENTECOST, he has to keep going until the church age close. That's a direct quote. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Look it up. Here's you another one. As long as men are being called and sent forth with the word of life, there is an apostolic age going forth. &gt;&gt; So, the word has not stopped. &gt;&gt; The power has not stopped. The demonstration has not stopped. &gt;&gt; We just got to get in the word. We got to get in there. He says, "How is it done?" The true church is always going to be like the original Pentecost. They're going to try to be like the original Pentecost. He says, "Listen," he says, "Having the same spirit of God in them, they will try to approximate the Apostle Paul. You have to work from the original." The true church will always be the one that tries to follow in the steps of her founders at Pentecost. and her messengers will follow the Apostle Paul, the first messenger of the first age. It's that simple and that's wonderful. So, let's look at this false bride for just a minute. Let's look at what he's talking about with this false bride. He says, "Because now, since you can understand how to judge the true church, what it was like, what she was at the day of Pentecost, and how it was in the book of Acts, we can apply the same rules to show us the church failed. You've heard the word test. &gt;&gt; Give it the word test. Should I do this? Give it the word test. &gt;&gt; Should I go to this this this event? Give it the word test. &gt;&gt; Should I date this guy? Give it the word test. Should I marry this man? Give it the word test. Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; You know, we would save ourselves a whole lot of trouble in life if we would give things the word test. &gt;&gt; Well, we could stop and preach here for a little while, but we got about 10 minutes, 15 minutes left. These same rules apply that to show the errors that crept into the first church. The errors that crept in, they begin to take and they begin to pull out certain parts of the word. &gt;&gt; And then when when Arinius came on the scene, they took the word that was there and they said, "We don't like this." And they pulled that out. And then and then as Colomba comes on the scene, look at the darkness. As Columbus comes on the scene, as they took out more and more and more of the word, the world got darker and darker and darker. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Then Wesley, Luther and Wesley move on the scene. And then we have a revival. We have a reformation. We have something taking place. And then we see a little bit of light coming back in. But then in the last church age, they didn't want none of them Holy Ghost fililled Bible toten quote quoting people &gt;&gt; and churches. &gt;&gt; They didn't want it. &gt;&gt; We want to DO OUR THING. WE WANT to do what we want to do. There was a move that went across the nation from the Isuza street into the message of the hour, the birth of the prophet of the hour. Think about everything that happened around that 1900s. &gt;&gt; GOD WAS TRYING TO MOVE IN A WAY GREATER THAN HE'S PROBABLY moved in any age. And here we stand rejecting God. Give it the word test. There's a true church. There's a false church. And that false vine will always try to usurp the position of the true church and contend that she, the false church, that she, not the elect, but she is the real authentic one. I hate to be critical. I hate to be critical because when I see people worshiping the Lord, I can't help but think that he appreciates the worship. But sometime is the worship heartfelt. &gt;&gt; Stages are filled across the world right now. Hands up worshiping living any kind of life. and they say they got it. &gt;&gt; You don't have to do what that church down there on Taylor's Chapel Road does. We got it. &gt;&gt; That's what they say. 80,000 people singing gratitude. You know what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; You saw it. 80,000 people singing gratitude. So I throw up my hands. Beautiful song. I love it. We've been practicing it. Sister Becky's going to sing it for you one day. BUT THE WORD IS THEY'VE GOT SOMETHING. But what do they have? &gt;&gt; What do they have? An emotion, a feeling. &gt;&gt; I want more than an emotion. I want more than a feeling. I WANT A GOD IN POWER AND DEMONSTRATION and action and believer IN MY LIFE &gt;&gt; WHEN I HAVE A NEED. I WANT A GOD THAT SHOWS UP on time. You see, a lot of times they put they put God off way off in the distance and they're constantly worshiping and praising and it's beautiful. I have to be careful in what I say because it's beautiful. &gt;&gt; It's harmonious. It's moving. But they got a God off in a in a such a distant heavenly place. I want a God that stands behind this pull pit. I want a God that sits at my dinner table. &gt;&gt; I want a God that that that that goes in the car when I go places. &gt;&gt; I WANT A GOD THAT GOES WITH MY CHILDREN ON THEIR JOB. I want a God that GOES WITH MY CHILDREN TO THEIR SCHOOLS. I WANT A GOD THAT GOES WITH ME WHEN I GO grocery shopping. I WANT A GOD THAT'S with me everywhere I go. &gt;&gt; Not off in some distant land. &gt;&gt; We're going to find a place to close here. Acts 2:38. Peter said unto them, "Repent. Repent and me. Baptize every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For the promise is unto you, your children, and to all that are far off, as many as the Lord our God shall call. The promise, listen what he says. The promise of the power with which the apostles were endued at Pentecost is to you. Now listen, the Jews, read your church age book. The power that it was given to them on the day the apostles that were endued with on Pentecost is to you the Jews and to your children the Jews. Where does that leave us? Where does that leave us? Why has he LEFT US OUT? WHY HAS HE GIVEN ALL THE POWER TO THE JEWS? WHY HAS HE GIVEN IT ALL TO THE PEOPLE WHO who even despised him and rejected him? He didn't forget you. &gt;&gt; AND IT IS GIVEN TO ALL THAT ARE A FAR OFF, THE GENTILES. &gt;&gt; THAT'S US. THAT'S ME. THAT'S YOU. AND HE'S GIVEN IT TO US, TOO. AND AS MANY as the Lord OUR GOD SHALL CALL, BOTH JEW and Gentile. He didn't leave anybody out. &gt;&gt; He was THINKING ABOUT YOU. THIS POWER IS ENDUED UNTO you once you've been baptized and you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost. It's a promise that's made to you. And he says in the church age book, the what the church had at Pentecost is her inalienable right. &gt;&gt; Why do people try to rob us of our rights? &gt;&gt; Have you noticed that a lot of times people will try to rob you of your right? You you go and you tell somebody, "Well, I'm praying for somebody that's got cancer. I'm praying they're going to be healed." Wait, what's a doctor say? &gt;&gt; Huh? Well, I'M PRAYING FOR SOMEBODY WHO'S WHO'S BOUND BY DRUG ADDICTION AND THEY THEY they can't get over it and they're just fighting and battling a terrible drug addiction. Well, you know that stuff. You can't never get off of it. You know, heroin once you once you take it, you're addicted for life. But we've got inalienable rights. &gt;&gt; Inalienable rights. Originally, she had the pure word of God. SHE HAD THE POWER OF THE SPIRIT manifested in diverse signs. What? There should be signs amongst us and wonders and gifts of the Holy Ghost. You mean there can be speaking in tongues and somebody can stand up and interpret it? You mean there can be wonders that happen? You mean if somebody were to fall dead, we could we could simply pray and they could raise up. &gt;&gt; Now I got you thinking. Now I got you thinking. But these are the signs and the wonders and the gifts of the Holy Ghost. So, HOW MANY OF YOU'S GOT THE HOLY GHOST? &gt;&gt; SO, SO LET ME ASK YOU, WHY SHOULDN'T WE BE LOOKING FOR SIGNS and miracles and wonders? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why shouldn't we? What's hindering you from believing that signs, miracles, wonders, and gifts live amongst this group of people? &gt;&gt; Some of you is living testimonies. &gt;&gt; That's right. Let me ask you this. Are we looking for Jesus? Because you know the rapture is going to be one miraculous event. If you hadn't thought about it, think about it. There's going to be trumpet sound. There's going to be quaking. There's going to be an ascension or descension of a of Jesus Christ coming down to catch away a bride. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now, if we're not looking for signs and wonders, miracles, and gifts, we probably shouldn't be looking for a rapture. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; But I'm looking for those things. I believe in those things. Let me tell you, WHEN MY SON THE other day was laying in the bed for two days with a busting HEADACHE ALL DOWN, EVERYTHING GOES through your mind. Jo, I said, "Jois, maybe you need to call somebody." Being in the medical field is not always good. Cuz the first thing goes through my mind, he's been in college, he's been in a dorm, he's got menitis. Two days he's laying with a headache, busting. He said, "I I can't even get out of bed. I throwing up. Such a such a hard headache. I didn't need a God that was off in some distance. &gt;&gt; When I went in there and I laid my hands on him in the bed and said, "Son, I'm going to pray for you that God will deliver you from these headaches." I needed a God that that could be felt. He needed a God that he could feel touching HIM AND SAY, "GOD IS MOVING ON THE SCENE." &gt;&gt; That's what we're looking for. &gt;&gt; It's not It's not some big me. It's not some big you. IT'S GOD. &gt;&gt; IT'S GOD THAT WE'RE TRUSTING IN. IT'S GOD THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR. IT'S GOD IN THE MIRACLES. IT'S GOD IN THE HOLY GHOST. IT'S GOD IN the deliverance. &gt;&gt; We're just vessels. &gt;&gt; We're just vessels. We're filled with the Holy Ghost. So, we should be looking for the signs and the wonders. You say, "Well, you're getting way out of line, preacher." Let me ask you, what did Jesus do while he was here on earth? When I read my Bible, it says Jesus healed the sick. He raised the dead. Restored sight to the blind eyes. The lame walk, the dumb talk. He even did plastic surgery on a Roman soldier's ear. Can you imagine that day? They're coming to bind Jesus and Jesus is in the go and they're sitting there. They're fixing to take Jesus away and Peter pulls OUT HIS SWORD AND HACKS AWAY at this guy. ear. &gt;&gt; Malchus, I think was his name. I think that's right. And he hacks his ear off. And Jesus says, "My goodness, Peter, what in the world are you doing? Come, come here, Malcus. Come here. Get stick that thing back on there." Can you imagine? Why did Why did Jesus have to do that? He had to have a message of restoration. CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED to Peter if Peter would have had to go before the Roman council as a as SOMEBODY WHO TRIED TO murder a Roman soldier and who cut his ear off? They would have been immediate capital punishment for Peter. So Jesus says, "I'm in the restoration business. We can put this on and it's as though it never happened." Yeah, &gt;&gt; we need Jesus in our life to look at us and say, "LET ME STICK THAT BACK ON BECAUSE IT'S AS THOUGH IT never happened." &gt;&gt; You say, "You're talking about, oh, you're talking about ALL THESE MIRACLES." YEAH. THE WORD SAYS in Luke 24, "Behold, I send the promise of my father upon you. Go and tar in Jerusalem until you be endued with what? Power from on high." &gt;&gt; Power from on high. Acts two, Peter said unto them, repent. Listen what he says. Many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, save yourselves. They were glad and received his word and were baptized. And the same day were added unto them about 3,000. And they continued steadfastly in the apostles doctrine. They went straight back to the standard. And they they they steadfastly stayed in the apostles doctrine and fellowship and breaking bread. And fear came upon every soul. And many, let me say that again. And many wonders and signs were done by the apostles. &gt;&gt; You say, "That's the apostles." It's the same Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; It's the same Holy Ghost. Well, that was Peter and that was James. That was John. That was Paul. That was Mark. That was Bartholomew. That was all THESE GUYS. IT'S THE same Holy Ghost. It's the same restorer of the word that come in and moved in on the scene. It was the same God that come in uh in in the days of Moses when they crossed the Red Sea. And Miriam picked up that tambourine and she began to praise God because of what God had done. Why? Because he had restored them out of bondage. &gt;&gt; Signs, wonders, miracles. The bride in action. Peter and John, they leave the day of Pentecost. Wouldn't it have been neat to be there on that day? I I'm very thankful for the age we live in because man, what a reward when we make it to the other side. But Peter and John, they leave out of the house, out of the out of the the the the day of Pentecost in the upper room and they're going around there and they're walking out the temple and and they're going out there about the hour to pray and there's a certain man laying there laying from his mother's womb. Now, the whole city knows that this guy's been laying there for years after years after years. He's never taken one single step. And he's been laying there daily asking for arms. Asking for arms. Can you can you help me? Can you give me some money? Can you give me some some something to sustain me? And Peter and John look at him and they fasten their eyes on him. And it says they they look at him and and John says, "Look on us." Who were they looking at? They were looking at the Holy Ghost working through Peter and John. Look on us. And he said, PETER SAID, "SILVER AND GOLD HAVE I NONE, BUT SUCH AS I HAVE, I GIVETH THEE. AND IN the name of Jesus Christ, NOT IN THE NAME OF PETER, not in the name of John, not in the name of Brad, not in the name of Thomas, not in the name of John Ler, but in the name of Jesus Christ, look it up on us. In the name of Jesus Christ, pick up thy bed and walk. You say, "Well, what about Matthew 12 38?" You're talking about signs and wonders and miracles and God moving on the scene. What about Matthew 12:38 where it says, "Certain of the scribes and the Pharisees answer, saying, "Master, would we see a sign from thee?" And he answered them and said, "An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign, and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas. For as Jonas was in three days and nights in the whale's belly, so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth." Oh, thank you, brother. The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation and condemn it because they repented at the preaching of Jonas and and behold, a greater than Jonas is here. And then he goes ON TO SAY, "THE QUEEN OF THE SOUTH SHALL rise up in judgment. She she drove on a camel train for hundreds of miles, a years and years journey to go see Solomon." And he said, "She's going to rise up in the last day because she come from the uttermost parts of the world of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon. And behold, a greater than Solomon is here." &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. So who are these people that is seeking this evil uh this this this sign? It wasn't apostles. Stay with me here. Stay with me. The apostles through the name of Jesus Christ do signs, wonders, miracles, gifts. This wasn't the apostles asking Jesus, "Show us a sign." They were just merely living the life of Christ. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But this was Pharisees and Sadducees. &gt;&gt; They were coming in there and they want to get in there and they're trying to to look at Jesus and they're looking at this and they say, "Show us a sign." And he looks at him and says, "An adulterous generation seeks a sign." You see, they ain't they're not the bride. You commit fornication on Jesus Christ. You commit adultery on him. You've got your own doctrines, your own ideas, your own way of thinking. You're living like a Pharisee, like a Sadducee. &gt;&gt; But the bride is living the life. Lord, &gt;&gt; so the signs follow the believer. &gt;&gt; The believer don't beg for signs. We're not we're not out here saying, "God, show us this, show us that, show us this." But we're just simply living the word and letting the WORD MANIFEST. LISTEN, I'M NOT UP HERE SHOUTING to try to get the Holy Ghost. WE DON'T DANCE to try to get the Holy Ghost. We don't sing to try to get the Holy Ghost. We sing, SHOUT, AND DANCE BECAUSE we got the Holy Ghost. But an evil and adulterous generation is seeking a sign. Why? Because spiritual adultery had taken place. These Sadducees, these Pharisees, they were full of corruption. This was a test of Jesus. We're not testing Jesus. &gt;&gt; No, we're requesting. We have needs. &gt;&gt; We just petition our needs. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And God delivers. &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's what you want. Sometimes it's not what you want. But in all things give praise. Stand with me if you would. I know it's a little different tonight, but I trust that the word was was edifying for you that you was able to feed tonight and getting into the word and just makes me realize and and see that God is moving in this hour. And I believe it's I believe it's it's the preaching of the word that prepares the hearts of the believers. It's the preaching of the word that that that gives us encouragement. It's the preaching of the word that inspires us and and and and and helps us to push forward and gives us the encouragement we need to be who God called us to be. You know, it's easy to just be a a wallflower and just sit over there out of the way and and never expect God to do anything. That that's the easy road. But the road of a of a bornagain believing warrior is to fight for what for what God has given you. Those inalienable rights. prophet said already the visible manifestations of what I've been telling you are seen all around us. See he's preaching the word and as the preaching of the word goes forth he begins to see those those manifestations happening. There is a fact that the prophet for the last age must bring forth a message from God that will forrun the second coming of the Lord. For by his message with the hearts of the children be turned back to the Pentecostal fathers, and with the restoration of the word will come the restoration of the power. &gt;&gt; It's nothing we man nothing we manufacture. &gt;&gt; It's just simply going back to the blueprint and letting God move in our life. Let's bow our heads. Sister Becky, if you just play, how great is our God. [Music] Heavenly Father, [Music] we're living in a late hour. An hour of deception all around. All a lot of deception in the name of Jesus. A lot of deception in the name of the church. a lot of deception in the name of Christianity. Counterfeit, [Music] you know, that that that counterfeit bill that the prophet talked about and preached about, they had to take that counterfeit bill and they they made it off an original, but there's something about that counterfeit. It's just not exactly right. Lord, I pray that we will stand on the original Pentecostal faith of our fathers, filled with the Holy Ghost, with God moving in our church, God moving in our lives and moving in our homes, that restoration will begin to continue to take place in our in our lives and in our children, in our homes. deliverance. As we've seen in the last weeks, we've seen we've seen young people be delivered from habits. We've seen young people delivered from lifestyles that were damning lifestyles that led to lead led to a early death and destruction. [Music] But we've seen deliverance. [Music] We don't we don't manufacture it. just manifest as we spread the word. We share the word. We share the life. We share we share what you're doing in our church and in our homes and in our lives. And and and upon sharing the word as as they say, go and preach the gospel. What is the gospel? It's the good news. It's the good things you do, Lord. It's the deliverance. It's the healing. It's the It's the freedom we find. So Lord, encourage us. Encourage us as we as we seek revelation, more revelation, more of you, more of your goodness, more of your power, more of your glory. Forgive us, Lord, where we fail you. We fall short so many times, Lord. And I just want to personally say, I'm sorry. I'm sorry for anything that I've ever done that was a hindrance of the movement of the spirit or a hindrance of somebody in their life. And so many times I find I I I would, as we say, put my foot in my mouth and I say things maybe that I shouldn't and I don't get checked before it's too late. So Lord, allow me, help me, Lord, in that aspect that I would only say and do what would be pleasing to you. I don't ever want to be a stumbling block. But Lord, may my life just be a stepping stone as they look and they say, "I want what he's got. I want what she's got. I want what that sister's got. I want what that young brother's got." And we only have that by staying with the original word. The word is our sword. Faith is our shield. That's where we find our salvation. Help us, Lord, in this hour. We commit our lives to you, Lord, more fervently today than yesterday. Deal with us, lead us, guide us, direct us, encamp us with your guardian angels, Lord. We love you, Lord, with all of our hearts in Jesus name. Amen. How great is our God. Sing with me. How great is our God and all will see how great [Music] the splendor of the king.
