bring them in bring them in bring the little ones to Jesus praise the Lord let's bow our heads together heavenly father as I stand before my brother and sister today dear God what you've put into their charge into their care what a great awesome responsibility yet what a blessing a joy father they just stand here wanting to bring their little daughter back to you you gave her to them we know Lord with this child did not come a how to manual how to be a father how to be a mother how to do this and that but you've already given us that it's your word so I pray that you'd help them Lord may you guide them so they can guide her father may they be able to lead her and teach her in the right ways us so Lord keep her from the evils of the day and diseases and sicknesses Lord God would you watch over father would we dedicate our little life to you today in the name of the Lord Jesus we pray amen I'll tell you one thing she's a grer ain't she bless you a lot of people do that when they're around me I don't know why Stand Together are you happy to be in the house of the Lord today it's a great privilege for us to be gathered together again in the house of God um before we read the word I wanted to say again how much I appreciate all the work and all the effort that everybody's doing in our uh flood relief I'd asked brother Michael earlier this morning before we came to church kind of give me a list of states that he was aware of that people have been sending help from just so everybody will know it would be totally impossible for us to do what has been done so you listen to the list Virginia West Virginia Pennsylvania Georgia Arkansas Kentucky North Carolina Louisiana Oklahoma Arizona and all over the United States of people sending Amazon packages so nered daily sometimes more than one trip a day Amazon is coming and dropping stuff off it gives you hope for Humanity you know you thank God is there anybody left that even loves that even cares for people but there really are there really are I want to say to U all of those of our church that have done all that they're doing daily how much we appreciate it so very much with that being said said a lot of the places where we're taking the stuff that we found so far um we're probably going to slow down to maybe two days a week as far as being able to make the deliveries so brother Michael want me to announce that to you that they will be posting it on Facebook when volunteers can come over and and help them sort through it all and um we so appreciate every hour that you're spending and giving of your time some of our brothers have t taken off work uh to be able to do this our sisters have come brought their children sitting over there in the cafeteria and it's just been it's been wonderful and I want you to know I appreciate it I took her of the I said you know I think it's good myself that I enjoy seeing our youth also coming and helping we need as as the people of God to realize our life is not our own a person that lives a life to themsel lives a very selfish life aelf self-centered life after all eternal life is living for others and doing for others and most of this that we are doing we will never see these people that we're doing it for but we don't have to that's not the reason we're doing it in the first place now myself and the brothers has been able to make some of these deliveries we're seeing the people and some of them we've seen some of them we've been able to see as they come and get food and come and get generators and gasoline and so on and so on but a lot of them that's getting it we will never see and we're not doing it for that anyway we're doing it to help and once again I want to say how appreciative I am for the facility that the Lord has given us to where we can be able to do all that from our place over here can you imagine trying to do this from our old church I told some of the people the other day in North Carolina that they would have died literally died had they been waiting for the federal government to get to them cuz some of the places were going to the federal government still hasn't showed up so they're backs in the hollers and the sticks and all that sort of thing and I told Brother Daryl a while ago I guess one reason that means something special to us going to those places is that's where he found us he didn't find us in the big halls or the great big Cathedrals but he found some of us on bar stools and some of us was in the offest shape that ever was but he and his Mercy aren't you glad glad he's that kind of a God so we're that kind of people so again I can't say enough and I I just want you to know Carol and myself were so proud of each of you of what you're doing some have given time lots have given money there's been thousands and thousands of dollars that's come from businesses and just all kinds of of people that's doing that and we say to them they probably never come to church here never hear me say it but I I would like to acknowledge that as well I want to thanked them for doing it many of the things that's been given have been given because of people here in the church as their business associates and they basically trust them so we want to be able to handle it in of course in such a way that'll please the Lord one day when we all stand before him according to the Bible there is a book I know the name of it it's called The Book of remembrance so everything we do not just in time of flood but everything we do to help anyone the Lord Jesus keeps a record so when these people finally get are able to Res resolve many of their problems and get to a stage of normaly whatever that will be for some of them who's lost absolutely everything and our church will get out of this mode of doing this I'd say we don't stop all the good works I'd say we don't stop being kind as a matter of fact for most of us we didn't just start doing it we've just just never quite done it in this scope before don't you love the Lord for giving us the opportunity to not be able to go around the world you see because I'm the type of person that I am a quiet individual I don't let people know what we're doing people look at our church they wow you know that big church big this big that they're so selfish they don't do this well people don't have a clue but for one time people can be able to look and see oh they're reaching out to the local community they're they're doing something that's just the first time they've saw it in a scope or they can see it but I think there's a reason in all that so I appreciate each one of you everybody understand me every one of you men women boys girls the sisters some grandmothers just coming watching their kids while their their children can be able to help about we just want you to know we're grateful and there's been people of the community or friends of the people that don't even come to church here that want to come in and help so if you find somebody that's not quite dressed up to par you know what's going on but they want to help you know what if they want to help I'm going to let them come and help cuz who knows it might get around us woo something might change their lives praise the Lord let's turn the scripture today in the book of fimon one the smallest books of the New Testament but filled with all types of wonderful nuggets from the word of God we've been speaking about the brides Bill of Rights and today I want to speak to you about the right to a position in Christ the right to a position in Christ fimon just of course the chapter 1 verse 5 hearing of thy love and faith which thou Hast toward the lord Jesus and toward All Saints you see people think they can love God with all their heart and not really love his children that's totally impossible if you love the Lord Jesus right you will love all of his children even those you don't agree with even those that you may not humanly ever have that contact and be close friends with them there's people like that and they may feel the same way about you but you still love them you may not like their ways and like certain things about them that's not even the same thing now look at this verse six that the communication of thy faith communication how in the world do you communicate faith that the communication and the word that Paul uses here is is coia so it's fellowship and being able to ajoin yourself that the communication of thy face may become or come to pass and be effectual that the communication so your your Fai is talking your faith is expressing itself how does faith talk how does faith communicate now what she says that the communication of thy faith may become effectual so a person can have faith in God and an element of his word and believe it's a truth and yet it needs to rise to another level to where the communication of their faith will become so it's not like the communication of your faith initially receives the full impact of all it can be but God gives to every one of of us a Measure of Faith then as we grow that measure can grow with us we will be able to endure more be able to accomplish more and it can also become effectual look at the word here that he used energus which of course you're familiar with the word energy powerful active so the communication of your faith may become powerful and active how just by hearing the word no just by going to church no just by doing good deeds no by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus so you mean that makes our faith more active more powerful more energous has more energy to it I love this word acknowledging you know I'm a meaning guy and I look I like to look up the meanings of these words eposis we've looked at it before precise and correct knowledge used of the knowledge of things ethical and divine so this is how that our faith becomes more effectual by the acknowledging precise knowledge by acknowledging not every good thing that's in our flesh and believe me most of us are professionals at doing that but that's actually not what makes our faith effectual it's by acknowledging with a precise knowledge of what we are in Christ Jesus of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus Philippians 4:8 finally bre Brethren whatsoever things are true now in order not to take up too much time today yesterday when I was studying I took every one of these words and looked up the meaning of them and I don't have some type of special concordance and some type of special bible program all you got to do is go to the Lexicon or the strong concordance you don't have one you can do it online and you click on every one of these words it'll change your life finally Brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report if there be any virtue if there be any praise think on these things well I can say amen and we can go home if we could get what I've read already this morning will be changed towards the world can I give you the meaning of one more word think on these things I may not say this correctly it's a qu a long long word longed zi to take into account to make an account of now probably most of you here today have a pretty good idea of how much is in your checking account or if you've got a savings account pretty much how much is in there you know how many outstanding checks that you may have and so on so you're not going to write a check for a million dollars if you ain't got but 75 cents in the bank because I'll be coming ministering to you in the jail if you do now this is what people you laugh at that but this is what a lot of times people do spiritually whenever they think above them what they really are so they think they have all this in their account of what they can do who they are so on and so on and so on but the word that Paul uses is absolutely phenomenal read me me hear the meaning of this this word deals with reality if I log isi or reckon that my bank book has $25 in it it has $25 in it otherwise I am deceiving myself this word refers to facts not supposition so then a person with honesty with loyalty with truth with all the great things that we read there then think think on these things so you look at yourself and say am I truly honest am I honest with God am I honest with my wife my husband my brothers my pastor my church am I loyal am I Royal am I true am I faithful and then you can think on that and then you look at the account in your life and you say yeah I think I've got $25 worth of honesty yep there it is on my account I've got $25 so we think on what is factual according to where we are and the church said amen let's bow our heads together Lord Jesus thank you so much for your word today I pray father you would help me to be able to get out of the way Lord I know it's a miracle every time that you're able to get a human being into your hands if it's for five minutes or an hour and they can be able to speak words that have value of eternal life because we as Mortals cannot do that so once again I'm asking for a supernatural event to take place in this service today that you would anoint that part of yourself and my life which is a gift help me Lord that I can step aside I pray also for my brothers and sisters that you would anoint them that they would be able to lay aside their duties of the day and whatever they're going through their anxieties frustrations of life that they may be able to tap into the anointing and grab a hold of what you're saying Lord in this hour that we live we will be blessed and helped father I also pray over this prayer cloth laying before me Lord you see this need of this individual dear God they they need your help Lord they realize without without Supernatural intervention they will die not live and they're fearing death dear God I pray in the name of Jesus you would move on their hearts father may they come to a saving knowledge they requested a prayer call Father May the Holy Ghost go to them today I pray we commit the word the people the speaker and the hearer into your care in Jesus name amen God bless you you may be seated things that are to be the word made flesh therefore you walked with him when you were in him when he was on Earth you suffered with him you died with him and you are risen with him manifested attributes of God setting in Heavenly places already raised resurrected to New Life setting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus I read all that to get to this all that means so much nowadays church that means so much to us to see our self positionally placed in Jesus Christ so if we have been given the right to have a position in Christ Jesus no doubt it will be one of the greatest battles of our life to be able to get to that spot and then after we are there to be able to maintain it like the children of Israel the historian Usher says the book of of Joshua covers a span of about 26 years so they start in the South SL when they cross the Jordan and they start moving they're moving northward moving northward as they do they're conquering cities they're taking kingdoms they're defeating Kings they leave an element of people behind them so the enemy won't rout around behind them and regain what they took away from them eventually they go to the north up toward the Galilee up to the Northern Heights that the where close to Syria is now and they finally conquer the land now the fighting men are able to go back if their inheritance was down in the South close to Hebron they would go back down there if it was in Ephraim they'd go there manessa Jerusalem wherever they were and whenever they come back now they have to change their mentality they're not fighting to get the land they're no longer running into these masses of Philistines and great Giants and all that by the grace of God they've been able to defeat the masses of them but what they've got is little tiny pockets of these people that are still hid little tiny Pockets here and there and there and it was I'm I'm thinking Joseph that the tribe of Joseph that they they begin to let this certain element of people live and they no longer started killing them well once it started with them it went from there to Dan from Dan to naftali from naftali to Reuben and it was like a move that started moving in the message of that day so instead of slaying the enemy they start letting the enemy live so they're living here they're living there they're living there and the next thing you know then these Jewish men are marrying these women which according to the law they were forbidden to do but now it enters into the element of compromise and God said because you have done this I will leave them here and I will make them to be a thorn in your side now that's a terrible thing because it was not the will of God but it was the people that did that because maybe they figured they had more Love by letting the enemy live remember God is not a cruel God he was not telling them to kill the amorites jebusites Hittites Philistines and so on and so on even their children because God is mean and cruel but he knew a baby amalekite grows up to be an adult amalaki if you'll remember that when you go to letting in little sins and little bitty things that start out as a little tiny baby in your life in your home remember that little tiny sin many times grows up to become a giant how many knows it's a truth from your own life so then they have to change their sinking now they're entering into spot that they're not trying to get more no more property no more boundaries although they never got exactly all the property that God told them but they change their mentality so they're fighting to keep what they've got well it's the same with us we're out there in the world we're lost decrepit blind we don't know anything about God God gets a hold of us saves us sanctifies us and calls us into his body then we find a church hopefully we get into that part of of a Ministry and we go to finding our slot where God wants us to be then why happens the battle changes many of you years ago you battled and struggled so hard with this Habit in your life and that habit you said Lord I'll never get over this but by the grace of God you can look back today and say praise God I'm delivered of that and yet God in a mighty way delivered you well that don't bother me no more and that don't bother me no more but don't think because you're free from those things Satan stops he simply comes in another way sometimes even with some of those things same things to trying to pull you out now of your new inheritance which you've received now it is a spiritual inheritance in that it is a new birth a quick and Seed Gene by the presence of God something you never had before something you never even knew was there so it becomes quickened by the Breath of God then maybe God gives you a wife if you're a man God gives you children so your inheritance is expanding those children grow up now it's a whole lot easier when they're three or four or five years old now son don't you do that don't you do that I'll smack you if you do boy I'm telling you one thing but when you deal with that boy whenever he's 18 or 20 it's a lot different than when he's five is that right so what are you doing your inheritance is expanding and it takes the spirit of God for us as parents to know how to be able to deal with them whenever they get older but what are you doing you're still trying to keep everything that God has given you and it will be a battle from the time that you're born again until you leave this world either by the way of the Grave or by a body change now perfect Fai in our position enables us to be able to see where we are then we can take what what God had Paul to write here in the book of fimon and a the people of God to see and know by the account that they take of themselves do y'all do that to yourself all the time do you ever you know like you balance your checkbook and whether you've got it online and you can pull up your account and you know show your face or whatever and open it up you can see the outstanding accounts or if you still get them in the mail and you do that why so that you'll know where you are just know where you are so you got this working balance or you ain't got that working balance and you're trying to figure out what's going on we ought to do the same thing spiritually okay I'm a Child of God I'm a word believer I believe this I believe that I believe that that's only the as aspect of your account that you're showing on your paper form as we would say but you've always got on the other side it's amazing that when we write those checks that the bank actually takes that out of our account wow why do they do that life would be so much more funner if they wouldn't right if they would just say okay well we're going to do you this favor for the whole year whenever these checks come through we're not going to take it from your account we're actually going to pay it for you wow let me know where you Bank okay but they're not going to do that and it's the same way with trials and tests and sometimes differences that come between us God saying oh Lord I love my brothers that's what the word tells me to do Lord I do I love my brothers and then God will force you to write a check on brotherly love and brotherly love will run through the account and boy the spirit of God knows what he's going to do and he's going to come up and I don't mind telling you there's many times we find our check bouncing on brotherly love I've never had any to bounce on those that get along with me of you oh my goodness those Little Darlings that think the sun rose and set in me I got plenty of money in my account to take care of them saints it's them ones that don't like me it's them ones that don't care for me now I use myself as a big example I got broad shoulders I'm a little man but I got broad shoulders if I do this to some of you it hurts your feelings but sometimes I get tried and I really have to struggle to love folks that don't like me oh Lord brother Donnie not you just like the rest of all you rotten low down mortal sitting you're hearing me today and what happens it's my check runs through the bank and I get a you know it's flagged and I get an acknowledgement as it was I can say on my phone in an app that you're overdown we're going to charge you $35 or whatever your bank personally charge it because you don't have the money to cover that well how in the world is that I'm a Christian I love the Lord I believe the Lord but you've not been monitoring your account properly you see you don't have the right amount of forgiveness that you need for others and you're holding grudges and you're not able to override this and override that and it'll always be those that God knows you struggle with are the ones that push your buttons and you saying how do they know me that well how do they know me to push the combinations of my a and Y and c and Z buttons and that brings me to the peak not of explosion in the Holy Ghost but in your Humanity cuz God wants you to check your account and the church said now watch if we then would be able to walk every day of our life constantly checking our accounts monitoring where we are God help me if I'm short in any Avenue please help me Lord that if there's if there's a check that runs through that it don't come up and fles that I'm short on what needs to happen now when the Lord Jesus come to the Earth we know we preached on this for years and years that he so condescended to our level that he laid aside this this stupendous Glory that was there and he become one of us and he laid aside all his robes and his dim and everything that was there and stepped into a body of Flesh and become a human being that he might be able to feel the way we feel so no doubt the Lord Jesus there was people that he really really could feel close to we know there's even certain disciples he was closer to than others and yet no doubt there was also people that he just you know he grieved and he sigh the scripture tells us that he did and he was a Man of Sorrows acquainted with grief and tipped it in all points like as we are so the Lord Jesus must have as a human become frustrated sometimes with the people that he loved the most and those that said they loved him the most and said they understood him and believing you imagine James and John when they come to him and they want a great exalted position and how Jesus reprimands them and he uses this instance in a way I'd imagine old James and John their face got as red as blood because they felt like that Jesus was publicly humiliating them and to be honest with you they needed it because they wanted themselves they thought themselves Superior over the rest of the brothers I hope you understand we still got a few jameses and John's around the message but the key about James and John at that time was they didn't have the Holy Ghost we never find James and John ever doing that again and the church said so you see without the Holy Ghost and our soul we will never have the proper Measure of Faith to be able to communicate the faith that we have to give us confidence in our position now whether or not you understand this the Lord Jesus even though he was the word and the fullness thereof made flesh he condescended Beyond a spot even though he knew he pre-existed now pre Jesus stage he was Christ listen pre human body stage he was Christos logos thought fullness of God attributes of everything God was pre Jesus now remember Jesus was not existing in the Old Testament what is Jesus human body of redemption but it was Christ the Bible does not say Moses chose to suffer the reproach of Jesus but the reproach of Christ what is Christ the anointed one the anointed Ed word so he must condens sin then when he becomes Jesus to a place that he's not living operating thinking overcoming doing all that with the fullness of Christos in his soul because how can you and I be compared to him so if we would be compared to him him was all of that great power and that's the way he overcome and then he' turn and tell us be of good Comfort I've overcome the world you said well sure you could because you've got the fullness of God in you well and yet that gives you a great Advantage but he overcome as a man with the Holy Ghost he did not overcome The Temptations of Matthew 4 as God he did not die on the cross as God but as a man so Jesus himself actually allowed himself to to be deprived of the dependency to depend on and overcome by this preexistence thought of Christ so he overcomes as Jesus filled with the Holy Ghost now in order to accomplish this you say why in the world would he do that so he could come back to the state of perfect faith in who he was now remember he was not born of the Virgin with that state remember they they they never called him Jesus Christ at his birth but Thou shalt call his name why he was not Christos at his birth that did not happen to 30 years later then the father come in Him Praise the Lord now then becomes Jesus Christ as a matter of fact you'll never even find him being referred to in the four gospels as the Lord Jesus Christ he never gained that title till after the resurrection Lord father Jesus man Christ Christo anointed word so he allows himself to be on this Earth for this period of time and he actually steps apart from these great attributes and he allows himself to be grown into a measure of perfect Faith so it's not like that he looked at it and said oh I know who I am I know everything about me I know all my trials are over I know all my tests is over I knew I pre-existed I knew I was the word I am the one who created all things all things were made by me and for me and without anything made that was made but he actually stepped back from that him himself and allowed himself to grow Luke 2:52 he grew in wisdom and understanding before God and man so the Lord Jesus would have to read the word and whenever he read the word about scriptures pertaining to himself and actually gave him face wow yes sir the very author of Faith himself had to grow in faith notice this oh my I love this perfect faith that he was the anointed Messiah that the spirit of God was upon him and he said now and my I can do nothing I can do nothing but it's my facei in God and God was in him and the word made manifest and when the word of God comes in you amen it's made manifest for you are a Believer listen this this is why I do not believe every person that says they are a Believer is this kind of believer believer and a Believer is the Fai of God that moves in you a Believer is the faith of God that moves in you that's a real believer you like that you like that I like I like like the teaching of where we can see what faith really is now turn with me if you would to Genesis 3:1 let's let's look back at the Garden of Eden now and whenever Satan come against the first human being on the earth now remember they were positionally placed in the Garden of Eden Adam was placed first years later years and years and years after God had stopped creating he brings Eve into existence now watch the serpent was more subtile than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made and he said unto the woman yay has God said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden I want you to notice this is not a talking rattlesnake this is not a talking Copperhead or a talking gardener snake or a black snake it was a two-legged snake that's the kind you really got to watch most of us are scared to death copperheads and rattlesnakes and boy constrictors and all kinds of things like that and set under a two-legged snake that's leading you Soul To Hell Amen Brother D now what did happen Moses breaks into this and and he he doesn't go in to what had happened prior to this in order to make Genesis 3:1 able to say what it does but what happened of course we know was that Satan had a soul but the serpent did not have a soul but he had a place for a soul and Satan is wanting to inject himself into the human race he's wanting the Earth he's wanting a domain by now the Angels had already fallen and Satan had went over on the north side of heaven and preached to the angels and exalted himself above them and so many of them pulled away from the kingdom of Michael which was Christ and they joined over there where were they what Dominion what domain I I don't know I'm not sure that any of us know but I'm sure that the Angels fa the prophet tells us that God created to the Earth and brought it into existence after the Angels had already fallen so this was a Heavenly dispensation where they were so when God started creating the M the millions and millions or trillions maybe it is now of planets that they have found there was this one little tiny Speck of dust that God put out in the middle of this tremendous culdesac I'll call it called our galaxy and God put it in so many miles away from the the center of the universe and God gave it a moon and God gave it a sun and God placed it in exact proximity of where it needed to be to be able to produce what is called the habitable zone now our our planet rotates approximately being where it is to our our greatest sour of Light which is the sun approximately an average of 93 million miles from the Sun now if it was several thousand miles closer then the temperature would be so hot none of us could live if it was several thousand miles farther away it would be colder than it would be like Pluto or Mars so God placed it exactly in the right Zone where life could come upon it and uh our next main object of light of course being the moon on an average of I'm thinking maybe 237,000 miles now not million but Thousand Miles then our closest neighbors all around and we look out in the night sky and we see them so they they were placed there positionally in what is called the horizontal rainbow and then there's the ecliptical view which is what we can see from the Earth but what's amazing is I've been in South Africa and different continents of the earth and when you look at the night sky in South Africa it looks different than what it does here in the hills of Tennessee now being to Canada and seeing the northern lights and when you look at it from there it looks different from there so I'm told from being out in outer space whenever they look at it they see it totally different so if a person was on another planet and looking this way and look toward the Stars you'd never be able to read the same images of Leo the Lion the Virgin Urus you'd never be able to see it so it's like whoever put the Earth where they did they put it in such a spot that they could look at the night sky and read the story of redemption reconciliation the fall of the Dragon amen Aras so on and so on so God works and operates off of position you follow me so far or dilute some off the horizontal rainbow position is very important to God our spiritual position and also our natural position so the devil had had embodied The Serpent and the serpent could already talk of course he was the next one closest to man on the earth so God creating every form of life and he come right up right before he made his son he made this beast and he give him a futuristic image by that I mean he was the closest one that looked like man so if God made man in his own image and God is invisible well where do we get this image at then God is invisible right and yet the Bible said I to the image of God made he them male and female created he them where was that image Christ Christ so God places him in the garden and and oh my what a paradise it must have been and God simply gave them the a very simple command and God just told Adam I remember at this stage Adam was not planting So Adam wasn't going out digging holes you know and planting it and Miracle growing it and mulching it and all that sort of thing he all all that was already done for Adam but what God told Adam to do is just d dress it and keep it that's all you got to do just go out there and dress it you see anything needs to be done just dress it keep it so every day he would just go out in his dominion and he would dress it and keep it and all my just lived a beautiful wonderful life but there was one sad part about that life in that he had no one to share it with so he lived it by himself and then God opens up his side and brings out this rib and and then God divides his spirit and pulls out this feminist part because she was in him and places this inside this body that God has made which is not in the original creation and then when he when he woke up maybe God would have said to her now go over there and stand by just take him by the hand I've done it many a time with our Saints some sitting here and some that's gone on I'd be the first face they would see after a surgery well I can imagine that'd be frightening but I'm there with them patting them on the shoulder you know or holding their hand or whatever and you imagine when Adam went to sleep he went to sleep by himself but he woke up with someone her long blonde hair hanging down her back maybe real long beautiful hair her blue eyes as blue as they could be the azur skies that the Lord God had created and when he goes to batting his eyes as the Divine anastesia goes to wearing off and he comes to himself and he feels something he had never felt before it was a small dainty hand he actually felt two cuz one was under his and another one was on top of his It's A peculiar feeling within his humanity and he finally comes to him he opens his eyes and he looks there and something was in him struck his being and all of a sudden the revelation of God flooded his soul and he said you are is shy because you came from ish ish is our English word man Isa is the word woman the devil watching in the operating room or from the outside doorway at least seeing a suff thises it this is my way my entrance into the human race the Angels his Fallen Angels standing around him imagine him turning around saying mark it down I will get her by getting her I don't really want him he's Original Seed I can't mix myself with him but I can mix myself with her she is only a channel to accomplish the means I desire I want his domain so now I catch you up to verse two and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God has said You shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest you die now let's look again carefully at verse three but of the fruit of the tree Hebrew words are unlike our English words they can mean have two different meanings that are so opposite look at this word per this is what the word Moses used for fruit produce of the ground or offspring uhoh Offspring children progeny of the womb oh I mean I thought was talk about an apple tree oh was it a cherry tree maybe a pomegranate mango why are we talking about progyny or children or offspring of the womb from a tree in the Garden of Eden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst Toc middle among a number of persons so there is a middle ground of a number of persons between of things arranged by TW so we've got a man tree a woman tree if the man tree will come to the woman tree the progyny will be Christ but it's arranged by twos so if the right is arranged by twos there must also be another person on the other side of the dark side so it cannot be Eve alone because the middle can only be an arrangement between two persons well I believe this is about the quietest I ever heard y'all mou life children it's okay to breathe I mean it don't scare me you can there you go everybody now on three breathe in and out now listen this oh my my and the serpent said into to the woman you shall not surely die now what are we talking about position so what's it trying to do talk her out of her position I just it just because you find the word the message of the hour I should say it finds you by the grace of God and leads you to it don't mean that you won't fight all hell after you find the truth because Satan will do his best to try to talk you out of your place the way to did Eve in the Garden of Eden same might with every God called preacher every God called Deacon every trustee you know whoever you are just La member if God leads you here at our church we welcome everyone that God calls here that's as a matter of fact that's all I want here is those that God wants I'm not interested in having a big church I personally prefer a small church but I want everyone here that God wants but just because God leads you here don't mean that you won't fight to stay here until you get here so the serpent said unto the woman you shall not surely die now he's saying exact opposite of what God Said her position will be determined by her response will she say what the word says about her by his stripes I am already healed oh wish she said well the doctor said it was a hopeless case well you know what the doctor he may been perfectly honest but until the Lord says otherwise we believe what the Lord says now once he's going to explain the reason why he's already opened the womb of her mind now for God does know that in the day you eat thereof you're going to be blind lost wretched thrown out of the Garden of Eden you'll never have peace again another day in your life you're going to cause every blind child you're going to cause every man every woman he's not going to tell her the truth but God knows in the day you eat thereof oh wow then your eyes shall be opened and ye shall be as Gods knowing good and evil and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and it was pleasant to the eyes now let me just say this before I go into the meanings of this words I've eat a lot of apples in my life and like you I've got my favorites but I ain't never in my life eat no apple no Peach no apricot I've eat fruits in China fruits in Egypt fruits in Israel fruits in different parts of the world where I've been I ain't never had no fruit to do to me what we're fixing to read about so then I have to question maybe it's a different type of fruit and when the woman saw the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant desire wish longings of one's heart lust so if any of you all ever went to Kroger and you see those honey crisp or those Macintosh or Gayla or and you're just standing there lusting oh I can't control myself I'm lusted I'm lusted Lord have mercy honey send me after church I'll buy you one if that's what so if any of you ever lusted after an apple like that you mean an apple does that to you well you starving to death you ain't never had no fruit in your life or what notice the mean's words now as I said you look at where I'm getting this Hebrew lexicon longing of one's heart lust appetite covetousness in a bad sense thing desired object of Desire oh I want that pump no I want it so bad I just can't take it I got come on be realistic and it was Pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired covet take pleasure in Delight to be desirable to Delight greatly desire greatly now maybe you've ate of an apple I've never tasted before to make one wise I am familiar with an apple today keeps a doctor away but I ain't never found one that can make you wise so she's standing there with this apple said oh oh if I could get that Apple I would be a PhD an lldd A Bachelor of Arts a Bachelor of Science a bachelor of chemistry a oh if I could just get that Apple if I could get it I'd become so wise thank God for the evening light a tree to be desired to make one wise to look upon have Insight so whatever this fruit is is going to illuminate her and what's it going to illuminate her about herself oh you were made for this you see your husband's never told you about this has he he's never illuminated you he's never enlightened you can't you see how tricky the devil is so this whatever this is is going to give her wisdom about herself it's going to illuminate her about herself what she is her potential friends cannot you see the political stance of our day she's he's trying to get her to doubt her god-given position and convince her she's another can't you see why politics in our nation and around the world is identity politics have you wondered and not understood why the homosexual agenda the transgender agenda look look how go sex this sex that sex something else why it started with sex in the beginning and it will end up in the same way so then what do they do they feed this and they started years ago of course not with so much the children but now it's aim right toward the children and trying to put image and slded seeds in their mind even though biologically they were born a girl but try to convince them you're not really a girl you're not really a girl you're a boy and try to tell a boy I mean I ain't too smart but you ought to be able to look at certain parts about you that ought to be the answer unless you're a knucklehead or you're under the influence of this agenda of the last day which is going to bring this world into destruction so what do they do they crossdress and some of these perverted abominable denominations churches bringing all this into their churches and showing it out before the little children why sewing a seed in their mind they not really a boy you're not really a girl what do they want to do change them from what God made him God made you to be a holy ghost filed child of God don't you let the devil talk you out of your place oh my oh my goodness so the word wise on the meaning of this word I would advise you to buckle up your seat belt cuz it may be a bumpy right to look at have insight to have Insight have comprehension apparently all the apples that I've got they must have been stripped of all these abilities I just get the plain old plain old apples you know that tastes good to have comprehension to lay yes sir crosswise some of you people that think you're so polished I ain't talking about you I'm talking about some of Renegades that like to listen to me to pick every word I got to say I challenge you you look it up in your Bible and you'll find the same meanings and let me say it again I put the challenge forth several years ago some of you that's pulling away from this word of this hour I make the challenge again if you're so right and we're so wrong meet me somewhere and we'll go to an insane institution and I'll pick the worst one in there and you pick the second one and let's see your God work don't give me your words don't give me your words you're not known by words you're known by power and demonstration so if we're wrong and we're Hellbound and let's see you do the works of God then if it don't shut your mouth a YouTube channel ain't nothing oh come on somebody don't sit there and get all scared to death act like a bunch of chickens come on put your wings in the air act like eagles this morning I'm not afraid to say that if you're right and we're wrong let God speak for you let God speak on your behalf YouTube Don't Count Google don't count the power of God is what counts and testifies [Applause] dear Jesus girl told me Wednesday night she said it sound like John the Baptist is at the church tonight oh my notice here in verse seven the eyes NOW Watch What Happens let me let me breathe the light part of this verse six let me goad and start the STP again when the woman saw the tree was good forfill that it was pleasant to the eyes in the tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also unto her husband with her gave unto her husband with her and he did it I see some of you is getting because your face is red as blood oh oh my this is how oh my that Satan injected himself this is what brings floods this is what brings storms I tell you some of the stuff I've seen the last few days I come home telling Carol said you know what I saw today is I looked across the Earth and I saw ravaged by these floods and all these things I told her I said some of these things that I saw we they will never they'll never be changed until the coming of the Lord trees 100 years old trees 50 years old 75 years old this Earth shall still still be bearing the scars in the tribulation period from this hurricane to come up to here but one of these days when the son of David comes on the earth she'll be healed of all of her wounds hallelujah oh children we want to be a part of a kingdom which will never end and the only way we can do it is get in our place and stay there oh dear God verse seven the eyes of them both were opened and they knew that they were naked I quote the prophet in saying this right if eating apples it makes you realize you're naked we better pass the apples around again so whatever it was they partook of open their senses that never felt fear that never felt anxiety heartache trouble you imagine the moment that they realized we have been lied to what a horrible thing it's going to be one day when people are judged before the white throne and they hear those words depart from me you workers of iniquity and as a man had a dream many many years ago he was in the regions of the lost and he would reach down and pick up a man and look at him drop him back down and go pick up another and look at him drop him back down go look pick up another drop him back down and someone in the dream said what's he looking for and a voice answered back for that man who sent that preacher that preached him into hell Being A God Called man can be one of the greatest honors of life but to be a preacher that don't tell the truth you couldn't hardly have any worse thing ever happen to you I know you pray for the ministry but pray for him like never before Oh my God and the eyes of them both were opened and they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons that's the English word the Hebrew word is loin cloth well if they ate an apple why was not it the first sign of human beings wearing masks that's what they told us we're supposed to do right we found out there lying so why didn't Adam and Eve go out there and then they get why get a fig Leaf I mean get one of these little video guys and just s them together and come out of the garden of e and got your Hello Lord how you doing well God I tell you one thing we realize that we uh we ate this apple here and we got we disobeyed the word so we decided that we'd make a we'd make a mask and we'll wear a mask around why would they cover thems with a loin cloth Lucifer got out of his position talk the serpent out of his position he talked Eve out of her position she talked Adam out of his then when God comes down in the Garden of Eden that day and search for his children it was their custom to go to church every day so God showed up a church and they wasn't there so he goes through the garden of Edom Adam Adam where are you he knew where he was but he's waiting for Adam to cry out here I am father I'm lost help me oh my so God kills a lamb and takes the skin off of it throws it in behind the bush and Adam says I'm hid I was afraid I was afraid and I hid myself who told thee that thou was naked and stop partaking the fruit of which I forbid me the woman that thou gavest to be with me she gave me of the fruit so the Lord God calls them to come out here walks the serpent God looks at him and says because you have done this thing on your belly you will go and dust will be your meat all the days of your life and somebody please remind me what have our human bodies made out of can't you see why he gets a thrill out of tormenting you why he gets a thrill out of trying to make you sick so he lost his legs his punishment is bowing down and on your belly you'll go he wasn't on his belly before that's in your Bible right but if you notice he offers No Redemption then the Lord says unto the man and you remember the story and the woman and you imagine they heard a harshness in God's voice that never heard before and it frightened them sometimes the way we get scared in church y'all ever hear that in the voice of God you say oh Jesus oh Jesus I'm sorry why it's it's the laziness of humanity that sometimes he has to raise his voice above a whisper and yet people don't like a preacher like that a lot of preachers that shows and not preaching with the voice of God CU sometimes God gets angry with us and upset with us and he use a man to express and God must have raised his tenor of his voice and changed and and my Adam was looking at him but oh I never heard talk before Oh and evil Stander shake it and oh Adam Adam ad what have we done and as much as it broke his heart he said leave get out get out the prophet said I can see him little Eve lays her head over on his chest she starts crying his tears out of his eyes come down and mingle with her tears and they run down his body and that sheep skin slapping against his leg the tears and the blood merge together God showing the tears of a repentant sinner mixing with the blood of the Lamb will produce the Covenant and the pillar of fire come down and got in front of him and said wait a minute I promise you I will bring you back you see friends before there can ever be a resurrection in this last day the bride must come to her position it will be so powerful whenever member of the the bride that's on the earth comes to their position it will cause a resurrection and a Rapture look at how powerful position is so when Jesus dies and raised again Jesus could not he could not call the General Resurrection before he went to the Cross but when he raised and he told John in the Book of Revelation I am he that was dead and I have the power of death hell and the grave he did not have the keys and his hands when he raised liers from the grave he did not have the keys in his hands when he raised the wiow from name son that didn't happen to do he went down on the door of hell and he snatched it now he's got the voice of the entire resurrection and when his bride comes to her place the bride in China the bride in Japan the bride in Guam the bride all over Africa the bride all over India the bride all over the

you're worri I want you I'm going to be where you want me come home come on oh God help us Romans 12:5 Paul says so we being many or one body in Christ and everyone members of one another 1 Corinthians 1:2 and to the Church of God which is at Corinth to them that are Sanctified in Christ Jesus called to be Saints with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ Our Lord both theirs and ours verse 29 that no flesh should glory in his presence verse 30 but of him are ye in Christ Jesus who of God has made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and Redemption 2 Corinthians 2:14 now thanks be unto God which always causes us to Triumph in Christ and make us manifest the savior of his knowledge By Us in every place Galatians 2:16 knowing that a man is not justified by The Works of the law but by the face of Jesus Christ not faith in him but by the facei of Jesus Christ even we have believed in Jesus Christ this is the way a True Believer believes in Jesus Christ not a nominal Fai not a nominal belief but a believer's belief let bu it hallelujah hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus Hallelujah many of you know the Exodus walk as God called us out of where we were from Egypt as it were we've experienced the mult multitude that fell away we've experienced the Mana we've experienced the water from the rock we've experienced those wonderful things that God did for us but could it be that we've moved into the Book of Joshua remember the hand that God showed the prophet whenever he led him into the dream of the vision and he come down the hand and pointed to this in Joshua remember Joshua repres represents not some certain preacher but the holy ghost that is going to lead every believer into their position many of you are already there it's not like you're going to wake up after a while and oh praise God I'm finally going to get straightened out all 60 years of my life has been in vain absolutely not all it is is just being able to recognize that you're there and then once you get there by the communication of your face you can have the acknowledgement and allow it to grow and become energized and be God what God wants you to be because of your confession in Christ Jesus I'm saved I'm Sanctified I'm filled with the Holy Ghost brother Donnie will we always be human always until the body change that's right but Paul didn't say acknowledge what you are in your flesh but acknowledge what you are in Christ Jesus Hallelujah I may would just raise your hand to the Lord today and say Lord help me to be that Give Me Faith in who I am Give Me Faith so the Lord Jesus read the word and it gave him Faith about who he was no doubt it helped him when he read about Moses no doubt it helped him when he read about Joshua and many of the Old Testament characters but it done something different for him when he read what was written about himself remember when it when he went to the church at Nazareth several years ago we stood on that that little place there and they reconstructed a little small community there in Nazareth and it's a it's a steep place it's kind like almost a brow that's on a head it kind of juts out a little bit and they they LED Jesus to this place after he reads the scripture when he read the scripture the anointing is upon me cuz he's anointed me to preach the gospel and Jesus said this day this scripture is fulfill so what did he do he read the scripture pertaining to himself and it gave him face I just can't keep on wondering if he didn't have an Enlightenment an understanding of what they were fixing to do and they led him to that that precipice am I going to kill him but the father give him that something and the Bible says he passed right among them just turned and walked away how did he do that by faith in his position cannot you have faith in who you are I'm a Christian I'm an heir to Healing I'm an heir to Deliverance well brother Donnie I've got my mistakes and my faults you're always going to have that that is nothing to do with your new birth and your inheritance both of my daughters made mistakes and I had to correct them and had to deal with them they were still my daughters even when they didn't did what I want them to do they were still my daughters even whenever I had had to correct them and you'll always be a son or daughter of God if you're born of his presence can we stand our feet praise the Lord Jesus I love this in Ephesians 1:1 I know you know it Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the Saints which are at Ephesus and to the faithful am in Christ Jesus that's me that's you Grace be to you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ Ephesians 2:6 hath raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus verse 10 for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God has before ordained that we should walk in them a predestinated seed will have a predestinated walk and this is it right here good works and the
