like to have one of those silver skin a little bit harder to find as you know oh I'm is expecting today praise the Lord I think avoid these times what a great thing it is in my mind I wonder sometimes I think how would brother Branham love to have walked out who preached in a message Church as you realize he got to preach in his Tabernacle and then there's a group out in Sarah vest and a little small group here and there brother Branham never actually got to go to message churches can you imagine how he would have acted if he would have been here this week with us I've been able to preach what God placed on his heart but thank God there's men of God that are getting into that message that he brought and bringing us what we need for the hour God bless you we love you so much we thank you for for participating the services and which one just have Brother David to come and let's just open her heart I heard this thing about the goodness of God started for us let's just sing this before Brother David comes [Music] I'm sure all of us can say this together the mercy never fails me you know my name Hallelujah I have Lord Jesus from the moment that I wait Ed yes of God everybody

mean those it's the truth all my life with every breath that I am [Music] who I will see of the goodness of God [Music] and he's thankful for his goodness Lord didn't the Lord show up here last night you know when God shows up he usually shows out if God could give us Vision into that other room and you could see demons being dragged out of this building they've been beaten they've been whooped they've been punched in the face we left her rejoicing thanking God shouting giving Lord to God aren't you thankful for what the Lord has done for us amen we're so honored to be here today with you and one of the greatest honors of our life to be able to come and to be able to celebrate this time with you and just such a beautiful beautiful place Moses could make the Tabernacle beautiful but God makes it glorious and God has made this glorious not the building his people amen praise God such an honor to be here with you today I'd like to go to the Book of Esther chapter 2 today if we could turn our attention to the word this morning certainly appreciate all the wonderful singing everything that's been done for us appreciate brother Donna giving us this opportunity amen now he's come to have church today Esther chapter 2 verse 5. I'd like to speak to you on the mystery of the Book of Esther Esther chapter 2 verse 5. now in shoesome the palace there was a certain Jew whose name was Mordecai the son of jair the son of shemiah the son of Kisha Benjamin who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the Captivity which had been carried away with jokanai king of Judah whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away and he brought up hadessa that is Esther his uncle's daughter first she had neither father nor mother and the maid was spare and beautiful whom bordecai when her father and mother were dead took for his own daughter and it came to pass when the king's commandment and his decree Was Heard and when many maidens were gathered together to shushen the Palace to the custody of hagai that Esther was brought also into the King's house to the custody of haggai Keeper of the women and the Maiden pleased him and she obtained kindness of him and he speedily gave her things for purification with such things as belonged to her seven maidens which for me to be given her out of the King's house and he preferred her and her mates unto the best place of the House of the women brought down to verse 16. so Esther was taken into the king of hazarus into his house Royal in the tenth month which is the month of Tibet in the seventh year of his reign and the King loved Esther above all the women Hallelujah and she obtained Grace and favor in the sight more than all the versions so that he set the Royal Crown upon her head and made her Queen instead of ashtime let's just buy a horse today and ask the Lord just to help us Heavenly Father we are so thankful to be gathered together together Lord that you have given us this moment in time to be able to Lord come and see one another fellowship visit with one another the Lord the greatest attraction Among Us is the thing that we all have in common and it's this great message that you've sent and father we just asked that this morning that you would just help us may the anointing come Lord and may you just help us to move aside help this congregation Lord we've seen you do so many things Lord last night and we want to tell you how thankful that you are we want to be careful to give you thanks lord it's so important that we approach you with Thanksgiving in our heart and Lord we believe that you've done wonderful things and we believe that you'll continue to do things Lord as we leave this place Lord and heal and virtue we'll go with us Lord in your people's lives no doubt they have been changed we thank you for it today fathers we look into your word take the word of God break it to us we ask now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and everybody said amen God bless you today you can be seated we know that our God is all-knowing is is infinite that he knows the beginning from the end veteran makes a statement and I want to build from this today if the Lord will help us as we look into this out of the power of God 1955 Abraham said predestination looks back to foreknowledge and foreknowledge looks on to destination and in order to be God he know the end from the beginning so he could predict it and set things in order to happen that he could order certain things for certain ages aren't you glad you're living in the right age again the resurrection of Jesus he said it's been well stated that predestination looks back to foreknowledge and foreknowledge looks on to Destiny and God in the beginning could see all the things the way it would happen therefore he could tell it to be this way or to be that obey so God could foretell he knows exactly every person that would be born in this day therefore you're not living in this day by chance but you're living in this day because God allocated your Dave then this is the time that he's called you to be alive and we know that God's of course whenever he destined something he destineds it by election and we know that of election looks back to foreknowledge foreknowledge looks on to the end so whenever you come into this day that God would choose you to be able to live at this time that God has foreordained a destiny he has placed a purpose in your life and God has has called you as an individual to be able to fulfill his part of the word in this day now we know that that's something that God has always done he projects into the future what's going to take place he projects in the future what's going to happen you'll remember whenever Jesus was upon Mount olives and he was fixing to ride into Jerusalem remember it had already been prophesied by Zechariah that Jesus was going to come riding into Jerusalem it had already been written in the script it had already been written in the word and nothing can change what God had already prophesied in his word that God had already foretold he was going to come writing into Jerusalem whenever Zechariah says it in Zechariah Zechariah 99 the Bible said Rejoice greatly o Daughter of Zion and Shout o daughter of Jerusalem that Behold thy King cometh unto thee he is just having salvation he's going to come lowly riding upon an ass and upon a cult the fold of an ass so Jesus come to fulfill that part of the word that Zechariah have prophesied and we know that somebody had to fulfill it but not just anybody but it was there for the king to fulfill that part of the word now we know that there not only does Jesus got to fulfill his part but the Bible said Rejoice greatly o Daughters of Zion and then he tells us to shout o daughter of Jerusalem so if Jesus is going to fulfill his part I've come riding into Jerusalem somebody's got to fulfill the other part somebody's got to Rejoice somebody's got to shout somebody's got to fulfill what Zechariah has already said and let me say this they could not just sit and observe the king coming into Jerusalem they could not just come and see it all Let Me Tell we've had plenty of Sinners around the message oh yes we've had plenty of Spectators that has come around the message but God don't want just spectators but God wants some participators today amen not only does Jesus got to do his part but I want to tell you you've got to do your part you'll remember in The Book of Mark chapter 11 that Jesus tells the disciples he said I want you to go down to a certain Village and when you go there you're going to find a cult that is tied up and what I want you to do is I want you to take and I want you to loose that coat and I want you to bring that cult to me and if any man would ask you why are you loosing the cloth you just tell him his master has need of him amen now know this notice that Jesus foretells them exactly what's going to happen and listen to me he not only foretold them what was going to take place he told them that that donkey was going to be there so when they go there the word has already been spoken the word has already been declared and now here is the call that is there and tied up they begin to lose sin and as they lose him here comes a man and he says why are you loosing the call oh his master has need of him I want to tell you not only did Jesus have a part but even that donkey had a part to fulfill you realize his life had a purpose the day that he was born he was destined to pack the word back into Jerusalem it had already been prophesied and not just any donkey can't fulfill this but it takes the right one born at the right season that his birth had to be born at the right time that when they went there he would be of the right age in the right time and the right moment and when they go there there he is because it's already been written in the word and I want to say this he was the one that was going to fulfill that part of the word that Zechariah had already prophesied about he was elected to pack the king back into Jerusalem he was not born just to pack beans he was not born just to pack weed out of the field but he was born to carry the words it was his Destiny to pack the word back into Jerusalem all my he was called in that moment to fulfill a 500 year old Prophecy of the Messiah coming into Jerusalem and then we come to this little Book of Esther and let me say this nobody else could fulfill this part of becoming the queen Now esther is a type of the bride and the church said amen now catch this it was during this time that the King was showcasing his kingdom before all the princes of the lamb in other words there was a gathering that was going on and seven days had been allocated for the feast to come and for six days he would show them pieces and parts of this Kingdom but on the last day which is the seventh day [Applause] he wants his Queen to be showcased for six days he give them pieces and parts but on the last day the king is wanting his Queen to come and be shown amongst the princes of the lamb and I want to say this in the last day he wants her to be seen he does not want her to be hid away but he wants her to come to the Forefront he wanted to present her before the people of the land but during this time Queen vashti she was holding her own little denominational Gathering huh she had her own little Council of churches that was going on and whenever the king orders her to come and stand beside him she refused to come before the king and bearish the king because he had set this whole Feast up to make her the thing that everyone would see at the last day of the feast but she refused to come under the headship of the word and when he did the king put that Highway we know that that is a top we understand that the king turned down vashti because of her refusal to go on with the word of the king the king put her away and when she refused the king he had no choice and the prophet says it like this a marriage and divorce he said you'll remember in the Bible when the King married Esther listen to this you'll remember in the Bible when the King married Esther because the queen refused he got him another one and what happened when she refused to come out with the King and Obey him I want you to notice mother Brown brings a parallel from that event of the Old Testament and he brings a parallel of that event right to the day that we're living in now and he said she refused to come out to the king to obey him and he did it he proved it in the days of Luther Wesley and Pentecost when they refuse to become a father part of him by having a spiritual sexual Affair to become pregnant with a further part of the word you understand she refused and the Lutheran Church refused for Christ to have many more Desire with her Luther refuse it and so is it it today with every one of them they fail to take that word so he's telling us the king is looking for somebody to take the fullness of the word of God he's looking for somebody and Luther's age didn't do it and Wesley's age didn't do it even the Pentecostals organized themselves and they refused to do it oh but let me tell you there he is again in the land today Hallelujah there's another people in the land today who under their messenger it's going to be a final voice to a final age they will not refuse to learn they will not reject the promise they will not reject this message but they'll come out and they'll receive it wholeheartedly so the king puts away those organizations and now there's going to be a search on the last day for a new Queen so the king sends out a decree or a shout Hallelujah and let me say this it is an invitation but it's not just for everybody not just everybody's going to believe this King [Applause] [Music] not just any woman will do just you know person will do but to be the queen you must be elected by the king to be the queen it's not by your choice it's about the king's choice glory to God it just so happens to be at this time in the history of Jewish scripture that just so happens to be oh we would say oh maybe by chance we believe it's more than that there happens to be a little Jewish Girl by the name of Esther she's living near the palace she's never been in the inner court yet oh my she's not in the palace she's living in the outer courts of it she's never come in yet she's still living on the outside but her Destiny is about to change Hallelujah now her cousin at this time that had took her in Mordecai Mordecai had a position in the palace and he had found oh how can I say it he had found favor with the King he had a position in the body he had a position of favor he'd been elevated into the kingdom and he found favor during the time that Vestal was refused Here Comes Mordecai upon the sink and during that time that Luther and Wesley and Pentecost had been rejected here's a man that's got favor in the Kingdom I said here's a man that's got a position he knows what the king wants he knows what the king desires he knows what the king is looking for in this day and since Esther was a virgin preach with me somebody she's Justified to go into the presence of the king now listen in order to come before the king whenever they come in there's got to be a time of purification in other words the king don't want to see something that's unclean he don't want to see something that's not not pure so he gives them a time of purification there's a process of redemption that they have to go through there's a time of cleansing and justification and sanctification you realize they would go through 12 months of cleansing before they come before the king think about that 12 months of cleansing which tells us that the king wants somebody that's clean he wants somebody can I say it that ain't got spot or blemish that ain't got the dirt of the world [Music] [Applause] another reason why is 12 months would go by it would guarantee that the woman coming in has not been with another man it would guarantee that she's not carrying another man's seed or another king or you hear me she's not carrying another King's seed she's not carrying another kingdom seed but she's pure and they give her the time to make sure that she's caring no other life in her I said he wants no other life's hitter so they go through a time of cleansing the Bible says in Esther 2 and 8 it came to pass when the king's commandment and his decree was heard when knitting maidens were gathered together in the shoes in the palace he said that Esther was brought to the King's house to the custody of The Keeper of the women aren't you glad you got to keep her and the Maiden pleased him don't you love that she didn't just find favor with the King but she finds favor with everybody she comes in contacts with Hallelujah in other words she's got character there there's something about her that whenever people meet her she's different than the rest of the women she's different than the rest of the churches [Applause] the maiden pleased him she obtained kindness of him and he speedily gave her things for purification such things as belong to her I love that she just walks in and all sudden she's got one gift after another after another and he says these belong to you what I do to earn it you didn't earn it what did I do to deserve it you don't deserve it but I'm going to give these to you seven mates out of the King's house and he preferred her and her mates into the Blessed place of the House of the women and Esther watch Esther had not showed her people nor her Kindred which means lettuce for Mordecai her charged her that she should not show it so here is Esther and Mordecai tells her you keep your DNA a mystery keep your lineage a mystery where you come from keep it a mystery I want you to keep this a secret so it's going to remain a secret for so long Hallelujah don't you tell it's a mystery and let me say this I want the revelation of who you are to remain a mystery so keep it silent history now no doubt there was a lot of women that come that wanted to have a claim upon the king they wanted to have a claim upon his kingdom they claimed they was his type they claimed they know what he wanted they claim they know but pleased him there's a lot of people that's getting ready there's a lot of people that's reading this and believing that but I want to say this Esther was the only one that had a prophet that was getting her ready to meet the king brother there's been churches churches Brides brides Church of Brothers coming one and let me say this we don't have to wonder if we know what the king wants we've got a message that has told us what the king desires today that's why we're not ashamed of this message because it takes Malachi 4's message to dress the bride in this day if God want an organization he would have took Luther he would have took Wesley he would have took last time [Applause] this message is the only thing that the king is going to recognize [Applause] not Sensations not just emotions not just gathering in the building not just sitting on a Pew he's going to recognize the word of this day [Applause] Hallelujah Mordecai knows about this ideal will not please the king he knows that a Creed will not please the king Darkness ideals beliefs from man it'll never please the king he knows it'll take the unfiling body word of the son of man to bring the right woman into the presence of the king he don't want something that's been mixed he don't want man's ideas he wants the unadulterated word for this day somebody that's not ashamed of his spirit a people that's not afraid to rejoice and to worship and to lift their hands and to give glory to God somebody help me now he wants somebody who'll believe the word for this day they're not ashamed of the message and they're not ashamed of the messenger too many people are on our message what a classical Holy Ghost and God don't give classical Holy Ghost you realize the number one word that brother Brown used to describe a new birth you know what it was a mess [Applause] I said it's a mess our New Birth has got to be a mess not preachers religion got to be a mess no matter where birth happens at it's a mess not some dried confession not something that's made up or put on something genuine [Applause] she's got to be dressed right and let me say this she can't dress the way she wants to [Applause] she's got to please the king so it takes a special dress to be able to catch the king's eye and the prophet tells his presence thank you my Ministry I hope he'll Crown my Ministry with this of letting me take the clothes of the word and dress his pride in the clothes of the word for his righteousness I'm glad he didn't say it's mine aren't you glad he didn't say it's yours but it's the king's righteousness that he's looking at today again in the evening messenger The Messengers hunting the bride trying to find character if that man has come and messing to the last day he's trying to find a bride for Christ he'll not look for denominational membership he will look for a character that's willing that's the messenger of the last days the evening light Hallelujah he said he'll find that church where they'll believe the message and I want to say he found it he ain't looking for it no more he's found it he's not searching for it no more he has found it he's not looking for a bride he's found her he said she'll just stand still long enough to tell her how the bride's got to redress she's got to be closed stand still so Mordecai told Esther all the things that she needed to be ready to meet the king I said he told you everything you need to find favor in the presence of the king and Elijah has provided everything that we need by this word to be able to obtain the blessing in the last days he's provided everything that we have need of friends if you don't have the blessing it's not brother Venom's fault it's not the ministry's fault the fault belongs to me and you he's given us everything we need to obtain it if you need healing it's in there if you need Deliverance it's in there if you need Victory it's in there if you need the Holy Ghost that's in there if you need Joy it's in there everything that we have need of legs in the word for this day but brother tell me what I got to do put it on I said Put it on put that word on put the put the word on of God upon you and allow that glory to be seen upon your life [Applause] [Music] and the Bible says in verse 16. that Esther was taken to the king of Hazards into his house Royal in the 10th month of the seventh year 10 and said she didn't go in under 10. listen she went in under 10 7. on the 10th day of the seventh month and the last time all of this is happening under 10 7. the bride is being dressed under ten seven the bride is making herself ready under ten seven under ten seven she's found Grace under ten seven she's found Mercy under ten seven she's got the blessing where'd it come from under ten seven in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sell the mystery of Esther under 10-7 and the seventh Church age there's going to be a people come out of that age not another day to come not another age to come she's the final voice to the final age [Applause] so 10 7. brings her into the presence of the king and verse 17 says and the King he ain't just infatuated with her this ain't just something we can visit but the king fed head over heels in love isn't that incredible you can plan when you buy a house you can plan when you go to college but when it comes to love you fall [Applause] and there's been a lot of women that's come by the king but then this woman dressed in the king's desire when she comes in the king's not looking past her he's not looking for another people he's not looking for another church he's not looking for another preach with me somebody he looks at her and the Bible said the king loved Esther above all the churches a woman in the Bible represents the church he loves her above every church every denomination Catholicism cannot receive it denominationalism can't receive it but in the presence of the king she found love and favor [Applause] and we found favor and I'm not talking about a love that's going to end tomorrow or a love that's going to end next month or love that's going to end next year but this love is eternal love it's an agape love that once you've got the heart of God God can't lose you [Applause] feel my preacher coming home [Applause] be good brother David it's dedication let's just forget that half the church she obtained Grace and favor more than all the virgins come on I said there was more than just one virgin but this version this virtue was the elect virtue and the King didn't have to think about it from us but the Bible says he set the Royal Crown up on her head and he made her Queen instead of Luther Wesley Pentecost denominationalism can you imagine no doubt she had living near the palace she'd seen royalty she'd watch them as they would come in and out being a little girl no doubt she would think about what would it be like to be able to be one of the Royals of the House of the king to be able to wear those type of dresses to be able to look like that and be cared for and taken care of that everything that they would have need of what would it be like to be that person she'd see how beautiful the queen was she seen how wonderful they was treated oh my no doubt she would go to bed at night dreaming about being royalty but what she didn't know like that little donkey she was destined she was destined to become the queen it could not even Be Imagined in her mind I hope you're hearing me she cannot even imagine her mind that the king would want somebody like her oh can I say it for him we Feel So Unworthy sometimes so unlovable sometimes we look at our humanity and the faults and the failures of our humanity and it's so hard to comprehend that the king would desire Someone Like Us [Applause] and no politics involved nothing under the table no Shady thing done but God ordains her to this position she's destined to be the queen but the only thing that she needs she needs the revelation this is my message today she needs the revelation of what God has predestinated her to be and has destined her to become so he set the crown upon her now notice she's not a part of the Harem she's not just she's not another concubine he didn't make her a concubine he made her the queen She's Not Just Another church it's not just another age it's not just another people she's the elected Queen she's the choice of the king [Applause] somebody are to say man right there but there's somebody else in this age and his name is Haman and Haman he wants things done his way Haman had become elevated among the princes of the land he had one favor among them and Haman is a descendant of agac he's from the amalekites and the amalekats descended from the lineage of Esau whom God hated come on so remember it was agak that fought against Israel that Saul should have killed it was agag that come against the Jews and you'll remember in the scripture Israel actually captured the King by captured haygoch and the Bible said that whenever a God come before Samuel the Bible says that the king that Samuel took the sword and he hacked to Pieces agag their King in the presence of the Lord and Haman knows this I said Haman knows this Haman knows let me give you a shouting point Haman knows his whole lineage has been defeated by this people Heyman knows that the lineage of Israel has overcome the amalekites he had overcome his family his great great grandfather his great-great-great-grandfather they've overcome one one attack after another after another they defeated their malachites Moses defeated them just for defeating them steps and defeated every Son of God has been an a gag and a Malachi killer the whole lineage of Israel had one Overcomer after another there's a lineage a lineage of conquerors [Applause] and Haman knows this so Haman he wants to do something about this and he hates Mordecai can I say that and again he don't like Mordecai Mordecai refuses to stroke his ego come on Church Mordecai refuses to bow down before him and here Haman has become elevated in this Kingdom he thinks he's the bomb.com so Haman says I know what I'm going to do I'm on a hatch out a plan and I'm going to make brother random I mean Mordecai look as bad as I can I'm going to try to get people to lose confidence in him I'm going to try to get people to quit following his message I'm going to kill his everything that I can do I'm going to try to kill his influence I'm going to start websites I want to produce you two videos I'm going to Tweet some tweets I'm going to grab some grams I'm going to take the talk come on young people I want to snap I want to chat I want to snitch I'm going to be real I'm going to sow some discords the fossils in the room what's he talking about I'm going to try to get everybody I can to lose confidence in this message so he wants to be elevated he wants to be lifted he wants to be hiring in order to do that he's got to bring Mordecai down so he can step on him to go higher so he brings this plan before the king and let me say this he tells the king how terrible these people are so here is the accuser of the brethren telling the king how awful you are how many mistakes you make how many shortcomings that you preach somebody so he brings accusation after accusation look at this Haman is used and deception haman's using the law and whenever he did the king instituted the law and it's the law that's been instituted and the King says well if they're trying to overthrow my kingdom but what Haman doesn't know is when he hatches this plan out and this law oh can I say it this law of sin and death comes into effect that every Jew is going to die on a certain day but what that devil don't know is this there's a mystery I said there's a mystery that's been abiding among them there's a mystery she's been hidden back for a long time she's been pulled back for a long time but the hour of silence is over the hour of sitting back is done the hour just watching and spectating that hour is done it's time for the bride it's time for the queen it's time for Esther to come to her place come to her position [Applause] you see Mordecai told her to keep a secret so Esther is the mystery of the hour lineage is a mystery her seed line is a mystery oh where'd she come from is a mystery where she's going is a mystery but it's come time for every mystery that's going to be finished in this day [Applause] now when a king makes a decree he cannot change his word is that right he cannot change his mind about his word so when the king makes a law that law cannot be altered that law cannot be changed that law cannot just be an old it must come to pass exactly the way the king said it let the mystery come for us and Mordecai hears what Haman has done and he knows that Haman has used deception against the people of God and now there's been a law that's been instituted do you see the top today the what the devil do in the garden slipped underneath the garden gate and when he did he used deception against God's people and whenever they fail the law was instituted the law a sin and death was instituted the days there are that day thou shall surely and God can't take that promise back so Mordecai against the fast before God because he knows something's got to happen if something don't take place these people are going to perish Now esther hadn't been before the king some 30 days so she's uh she's been sealed away she's been sealed away so Mordecai begins to send Esther message after message he sent her some letters he sent her some books he sent her some tapes he sent her some CDs he sent her some MP3s Oh my he sends her letters letters like recognizing your day and this message letters like the invisible Union of the bride of Christ message is like cross the mystery of God reveal the seed is not there with the shark modern events be made clear by prophecy Hallelujah he's telling her as she reads these letters Esther it's manifesting time it's seek time it's bright time it's lifetime Esther this is what you've got to do you've got to approach the king Esther you got to do something you must take your stand you've got to do your part you've got to come to your position you cannot just sit around you've got something to do around this message [Applause] the Bible says if thou all together Hold Us thy peace at this time then shall a large be delivered to rise from using another place but you your father's house you're going to be destroyed and who knoweth whether Thou Art come to the kingdom for such a time as this I love the way the Amplified says it listen to this if you keep silent at this time so the days of Silence has come and gone it's time that she finds her voice it's time that she finds her place it fine she finds her position in the Kingdom that she's been elected to if you keep silence at your time or literature shall come arise from Jews elsewhere but you your father's house will perish and who knows listen who knows that you've come to the kingdom hmm for such a time as this for this for this very occasional in other words this is why you're here this is what you've been called to do this listen that's what this word has been doing Among Us the prophet of God has been honing the mind of Esther to let her know she had something that she has to do and I want to tell you you're not safe just being around the message you're not safe just going to a message Church you're not safe just sitting on a message for you it's not safe just to have 1100 servants you've been called into this word to do something we've been called to intercede we've been called to stand for the message and stand for our god-given rights the purpose of your existence is for this moment God puts you here in this spot and this hour this is your opportunity this is your Divine appointment my almighty God he elected you to be in this day at this time at this hour for this very occasion [Applause] has brother Brown moved from the first pool to the second pool he was building to this moment of the word and the last part of his ministry was announced to the elected lady who she is and what she's been called to do and what she's called to fulfill listen the third pull is the time of recognition among the elect that's why the mighty Angel come down that's why he come now he come down looking for his body he come down looking for his Queen listen he's come to announce the position of the queen Among Us that's why the book has come open that's why seven Thunders has uttered their voices look friends Mordecai done his part Luther done his part Wesley done his part but Ram's done his part and now you got to do your part she will be a modern event that's being made clear by prophecy by prophetics in other words the scripture has been pointing to this time every shadow from the Old Testament but remember said the shadows and the times they're coming to light in the day that we're living in now and I want to say this this is the day every age has been waiting for this is the age that every person has been waiting for and you've got the privilege to be alive and remade and this day [Music] you're going to carry the work you're gonna pack the word you're going to carry the king [Applause] destined to fulfill this part you believe that what time is it then Throne Room time I said it's Intervale time she cannot just remain on the outside but according to the word she's got to go into the presence of the king she's going to walk where no other person would be allowed to walk why it would be debt to approach the king and announce but I want to say this she's not just any person in the Kingdom She's Not Just Another Woman She's elected she's the king's Queen [Applause] God's been building this elected Church down to the ages and he started the feet he's been coming ahead and now he's coming to the climax which is the finishing of the church and so much that The Headstone has descended down and this hour to cap off the pride in the end time well I'm going to tell you we're not living at the bottom of this pyramid you believe this don't you we're not living at the bottom of the pyramid we're living in the closing moments The Headstone has come and it's not coming crying law it's not cried law it's come crying Grace Grace why for this occasion for such a time is this [Applause] Esther's taking these words in something's happening to her she starts running with a message Hallelujah she starts crying Grace do you realize that the Book of Esther is one of the most debated books in the Old Testament do you realize many theologians they debate because they say that Esther the Book of Esther don't even belong in the Bible they say that the Book of Esther has no value to it because it never mentions the name of God it never mentions Jehovah it never mentions his name never he'll compound that it only mentions fasting and prayer but I want to tell you theologians may not see a value in it theologians may have not seen the mystery of it but I want to tell you in the eyes of God this book has value to it that's what they say about us that we're not a real church we don't have a headquarters we don't belong to denomination we don't got no right but I want to tell you in the eyes of God you've got some value in the eyes of almighty God you're not just another people but God loves you and God has elected you and God has called you for such a time as this for this very occasion do you realize even the placing of the Book of Esther it's placed in the Bible in a perfect spot it is because it's right after the book of Nehemiah and it's right before the Book of Job and Nehemiah come on somebody Nehemiah represents the Jews going back to their Homeland and the Book of Job represents the resurrection so after the Jews go back to their Homeland and just before the resurrection here's a queen Hallelujah here's a queen that's coming to her place here's a queen that's coming to her position after the Jews has went back and just before the resurrection here's a bride recognizing who she is for such a time as this she's seeing our place why is the word of God just before the resurrection here's you and I coming under our Capstone Ministry Congress thank you bortock has been sending these letters to these servants for quite some time now and the scripture says listen she says and the King servants and the people the king's Providence know whether it's a man or woman comes into the king into the inner Court who's not called so if you're not called you ain't got no rights in there and there is one law of his that's to put him to death except Hallelujah I feel like preaching a breach right now except except God throws a breach in except such to whom the king would hold out his golden scepter that he may live but I've not been called to come into His presence now for these 30 days so the law is in effect are you hear me the law of sin and death is still an effect the law bound her and tried to limit her from approaching the king so the law of synonym it kept her listen it kept her out of his presence come on somebody I said it was death to go behind that inner Veil but the message said he was born for this purpose the message says you was born for this you're destined to do this look what he's doing he's telling you you are not just anybody you're called to go into his presence you've got favor in the side of the king oh can I tell you you got favor in the side of the king you think you're in this building by chance you think you're in this meeting by chance you think you come to this message by accident you are here in this day for this purpose to escape death you are here to go behind the Intervale you were here to be the word of God made flesh in this day that's the reason we refuse to give the devil our children we're not giving him our young people we're not giving him our family I'd stand on my god-given rights and intercede in this hour safety take your hands over God's Property you should never give up on your children I don't care what they've done I don't care where they're at I don't care what Barstool they're on how much they're hung up on drugs never never give up on your rights as a mother as a father as a Son of God claim your god-given rocks something happens to this woman she becomes awakened she's been shook by the word and all of a sudden the word catches hold now she's going to put the word into action not just quote it not just tabletop books not something left on a bookshelf not something else to draw dust let me put this word into action she what's her what's her come to go before he's telling her he's telling her and now she finds her voice and he says she says go gather together Jews that are present fast for me neither need or drink through three days and I my Mains will fast like lies and I'm going to go into the king which is not according to the law if I perish if I perish let me perish if I die let me die in the army of the Lord if I burn all friends if I go down let me go down proclaiming the message of the king if that's the way we go show me it but if I'm going to go down I'm going down underneath the word of God for this day this third Paul is nothing to play with it's serious it's life or death [Applause] the only thing that could save her is if the king takes a scepter his golden scepter and he extends it to her so she needed something between her and the King in order to go into his presence without death taking her over she needed to go between she needed a mediator she needed the scepter which is Jesus Christ he's a mediator between the two he went between a king who was obligated to destroy us because of his claw here is a queen whom he loved and the only way to save her is she must have a go-between and that's what Jesus Christ did for you and I he stepped between us and the law I said he stands between you and the law think about Jesus was our goal between he was our mediator that stands between you and the god look at it here he is standing there look at that scepter the scepter was a rod with a symbol on the top of it the scepter was common wood I said common word but overlaid with gold common wood overlaid with deity that's my savior that's my king he was coming flesh and ball born like you and I but the difference is he's overlaid with deity [Applause] let me hurry I can imagine she's coming down through the courts the guard standing outside the door they're ready to cut her down they're there to kill her she comes if I die I die no doubt no doubt she's rehearsing I'm called for this I'm anointed for this I'm chosen for this one footprint after another one step after another I'm called for this I'm ordained for this she goes to quoting that message she goes to quoting her position what is it she knows who she is and whenever the doors open up steps inside the law the law wants to cut her down but the king extended cross Hallelujah he extended the scepter she comes before the king and she touches the head of that staff I said she touched the head of that Kingdom all just like the worshiper in the Old Testament we're taking laya's hands upon the head of that laugh here she is laying her hands up on the head I think came down and by doing that the law had no effect upon Esther and I'm going to say this not only is she standing there she's gotta find her voice she's got a right to articulate words she's got a right to say something or you hearing me what can she do she can cry out to the king oh King I got a need oh Haman has done this and the devil's done that and the enemy's trying to do this and he's trying to rob this but I'm coming before the king [Applause] and the Bible says it came to pass on the third day that Esther put on her royal apparel she ain't coming in dressed with the rags of her own ideas but she's wearing the gifts that the king Giver she's wearing what pleases the king she knows it's got his attention it's found favor she goes because she's been dressed right I love it because the king sees her he says Esther what do you want I'll give whatever you want whatever you ask him whatever you want say it whatever you ask in my name it'll be given she said O King Haman there he is I want you to look who's pulling the veil off of the enemy in the last days Haman has come against my family Haman has come against my church Haman has come against my loved ones Haman through deception and lie that he's going to kill every person that he cans and the King says but Esther you know once I make a decree I can't change my word it's my old it's my word it's my decree and I can't change it and the King says but let me tell you what I'll do I can't undo my word but I'll make a new testament a new covenant I said I'll make a higher law I'll make a higher order I'll make a new testament I'll make a new decree that the day before you are to be killed every Jew that knows that his enemy is going to kill him the day before he can slay his enemy before they slay him and may I tell you because the veil has come off of the enemy you've got a right to cast out that in before he takes you before he comes against you you've got a right to tear the veil off of that enemy and take your god-diven rights and slay your enemies thank you the hard word has to know the death sentence off of your life Hallelujah let me say this Jesus Christ under this New Covenant has took your sins and your iniquity and he nailed him to the tree and now you're a new creation old things are passed away behold all things has become new the Judgment seat was your mercy seat the king the king took this assault as though it was assault against himself anybody hear me right there I said he took his assault that he was going to Haman was going to try to destroy Esther he took it as though he's trying to destroy me and Haman got hung on The Gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai and may I tell you that Satan has been trying to ascend to the highest place he can get but who stops the final Ascension a queen a queen coming to her place stopped Satan from he listen she stops his plan did in the tracks I want to tell you we're the people that stop Satan in this hour you're the people that puts him under your feet in this day so our musicians come Hallelujah stand your feet with us if you hurt you realize every year the Jews hold a feast of pure and the word Purim comes from the word Lots it means it's a feast of lots and the Feast of lots it's a time of Celebration it's a time of rejoicing the Jews hold this Feast to remind the people what has been done to him somebody help me right now I said they must be reminded they've got to be reminded that Haman has no authority over them they like to be reminded that Haman has been murdered he has been killed he has been hung and he cannot touch you no more he cannot come against you no more so they hold a feast to remind them that Haman has lost his rights it's a time of Celebration it's a time to rejoice I said let's have a little Feast right now during the Feast of pyramid they take and they make pastries and all types of food they make pastries in pyramid shapes and it's during that time of the feast I said it's during that time of the celebration they took the Book of Esther the Book of Esther is called the scroll and they take the scroll and they wait till the evening time to open the scroll Hallelujah and in the evening time they opened the scroll and when the book comes open they begin to celebrate because the books come open they don't listen friends the open book in Esther the Rejoice they begin to celebrate because they know they not the mystery the book has been revealed the mystery of Esther has been unveiled they know that Haman is going to come against us but they know what his end is so in the evening time they opened the book and they begin to read from the open book Hallelujah and as I read from the book what they do is they take chalk and they write the name Haman on the bottom of their shoes and every time in the book of The Scroll that haman's name is mentioned the people begin to celebrate and they begin to stuff their feet they begin to stop there they don't see it they participate they ain't there to spectate but they stomp their feet every time the name of Haman is mentioned they begin to stomp their feet I say today there are going to be a people under the open book that the strollers come open we can stomp our feet hallelujah hallelujah and by the time you come to the end of the book the name of Haman has been erased from the bottom of your feet in 1963 they had come down but if he's the head tell me who the body is and if you're the body whose feet is he using whose feet is he using to put Haman under he uses your feet he uses my feet thank you tell all enemies is put under his feet you think we're excited now [Applause] wait till these preachers get a glorified body I think we get excited now wait till we become glorified wait till you become glorified there's going to be some singing there's going to be some shouting there's going to be some rejoicing there's going to be singing on The Hills of Glory there's going to be shout on the Hills of Glory there's going to be some feathers sound there's going to be some young people shouting there's going to be some mobs and there that's going to be some rejoicing and I say we ain't got to wait we don't have to wait it's already been written it's already been prophesied you're the mystery of the scroll the whole thing's been pointing to you and to this day and Satan can't stand it [Applause] he can't stand it when you stand on your god-given rights can you imagine what hell if he could have been allowed to stop that line last night and stop you

coming for you kids there's a God movement there's a bride movement every movement the world comes up with every move will never stop the move of the Bride will never stop bringing your kids up here to get baptized so as he was saying last night you claim your kids you give them to God like there's comes to a point they make that choice she's made that choice she told me last night she wanted to get baptized because she wanted God to have control of her life so well just as we baptize her just we're going to pray over and believe and believe that God take control of our life we all need that we all need your Humanity your humanity is is what what as we've seen it needs to be setting sins of your Humanity God takes control of your life it's as simple as that how do you young man ask me last night how do I know I got the Holy Ghost I went to the prayer line I told him I said Satan was waiting the very end of that prayer line when you come out he's sitting there telling you you didn't get it tell him you didn't get healed if he Satan is a liar so if he's talking to you he's probably not telling the truth so let's pray over our sister Heavenly Father Lord what a wonderful beautiful thing Lord when a member of the Bride finds her place When Heaven reached down and touches his soul and places her in the body where she's supposed to be Lord getting us ready for the last one she might be the last one Lord how glorious that would be but Lord we're praying and believing father Lord as their name is Phoenix Lord What a Wonderful Name Lord if she could rise up out of the ashes of humanity Lord and take on the fire of Heaven Lord as she Rises and finds her place as a daughter of God I know and believe with all my hearts you're going to do that for Lord we're all believing that for Lord and she comes out May she seek the Holy Ghost Lord and it's a free gift Lord she don't have to beg for it she don't have to plead for it you said it's a free gift it's freely given I pray that you would touch my sister as we baptize her like before or Phoenix as commissioned by the word I baptize you in the name of Jesus Christ thank you Lord so so appreciate you being here this weekend with us you have honored us to come we've got a couple more praise the Lord this is a little Maca priest he wants to we had a little talk while ago and he understands just like his daddy when he gives his life to to God when this is a symbolism of going down a bad boy and coming up a good boy that's how he understands it so God reveals it to us in simpler ways than than others so let's let's pray over the Micah Heavenly Father Lord the tender heart of the child Lord that's what we all need when you speak to us Lord and we receive you as children of God and over us that's what he's
