hard for tonight and y'all just okay praise the Lord I think when we come together in God's presence it's the most awesome thing in our life isn't it yes it's it really is such a privilege for us um Lord willing be having our youth service next next week starting Wednesday night and brother Josh Bennett will be be taking the Wednesday night service and then between him and brother Andrew Spencer on the I've been thinking about it and I know for the Youth Camp in Louisiana even though it's a youth camp yet for several years they've been having the adults also to come to the service and um I preached that camp for many many years and it always is a help in pulling and so on so I'm not sure exactly how many youth will'll have I think we have about 190 that are registered for the banquet um but I just like to open up the service for everybody that wants to come but would life for the Youth to have the front part and all you all people okay my goodness you ought to be so happy to be here if you had to set out in a four year you'd be fine with amen so we just look forward to that what the Lord's going to do and just um just be in prayer with us that God would just visit us in a in a very special way no doubt some of these youths some com in from different provinces in Canada different states and all over the states and we're just looking for a great time in the Lord no doubt some of them need the Holy Ghost some of them might need healing in their body some of them need encouragement just never know what they'll need but we're just looking to see what the Lord will do we know that whenever we come with expectation it it always brings wonderful things to pass so now you won't be able to be at the banquet because that has to be reservation and all that sort of thing but as far as the regular Services here in the sanctuary everybody is welcome you just have to forfeit your seat Sister Janet and won't be able to set up and sister Carol you'll have to move back too and brother Rob and Sister Sarah but I think it'll be worth it don't you yes amen let's turn if you would tonight Revelation 10 verse 1 what a great hour that we're living signs and the skies earthquakes in diverse places yes all different types of things that are happening all around us our nation started already turning its back on Israel right and we know that inevitably all the nations of the earth will God prophesied through the lips of Jeremiah in the Old Testament and said that he would make Jerusalem a stone a heavy Stone and it would be a Troublesome thing all the nations of the Earth would go against Jerusalem so you can see that we're already headed in that way just this week in Michigan people that were protesting our government supporting and sending missiles and so on and for those that are ignorant enough to believe that the Palestinians love you you know what they were saying when they were marching in Dearborn Michigan on Monday death to Israel and death to America now these are American citizens yeah and it has to come what are they doing getting together the anointing is already here amen don't you understand when the bride is gone Satan does not have a decade he does not have 20 years he's only got a short time all this stuff is going on behind the scene tonight when the bride's gone that day he will start assuring his position on the Earth right oh I'm glad I'm getting ready for another thing amen besides that sort of thing amen now let's read Revelation 101 and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow upon his head and his face as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of Fire so he is clothed with a cloud rainbow upon his head his face as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the earth now remember Footprints means possession and cried with a loud voice as when a lion Roth and when he had cried seven Thunders uttered their voices and when the seven Thunders had uttered their voices I was about to write and remember John was hearing something that actually wasn't in the Old Testament or the new and he was fixing to write it down that's what he was told to do the things you see and hear write them down so he picks up his pen to write on the parchment and he says when the seven Thunders had uttered their voices I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven Thunders uttered and write them not so John did not write him so what was it now on the a of patmas that heard the voice voice of the seven Thunders was it a pastor was it a teacher an evangelist a pope no a priest no a prophet amen so a prophet heard what the seven Thunders said and he was told seal it up don't write it so what office do you believe that it will require in the last days to be able to point us in the direction of what the seventh under are it's not going to be a pastor it's not going to be an evangelist it's not going to be a teacher what's it going to be answer me it's going to be a prophet because that's what God Reveals His secrets to his servants the prophets now he said and the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein are and the earth and the things that therein are and the Sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer and remember it's not tick tock tick tock tick tock that there ain't going to be no more time there'll be time even in the Millennium but the time for the denominational ages is run out time no longer verse seven but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel am when he shall begin to sound list now it's not a group it's one it's one when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants notice the office again not the pastors not the Evangelist not the teachers but the prophets why the word of the Lord comes to the prophets for those of you that wasn't with us last night I am not made nor is any other of the fivefold ministry other than a pastor to where I can receive an infallable word in from the fourth dimension in the form of a vision the way a prophet can it might be right and it might be wrong you see that's the thing with gifts it's amazing how gifts are I saw them in Pentecost and there'd be people that would call you out and tell you things it was 100% accurate the next person they call out May Miss at a th000 miles I was in a meeting one night and a man called a woman out I won't him tell you what he done cuz just wasn't decent actually he called her out he called me out and told me what I had prayed that day the words the very words I said to God come to find out the man had girlfriends all over places his traveling but you see that's the way those gifts can be so God cannot commit revealing of his word to that type of a gift hit Miss hit Miss hit Miss so he picked an infallible way which is prophets so he can Inspire them in such a way and give them the the power of infallibility now remember every word that comes out of their mouths is not infallible because they're human beings but when that infallibility is there we better listen amen amen God bless you how many has a need tonight before the Lord before we pray amen me too brother Frank Williams had a request for a prayer cost tonight we want to remember that as well also brother Ron Spencer he's doing doing very well he had U three stance put in and and um he's still weak um I've been in touch with him every day multiple times during the day just checking on him and uh wanted us to remember him of course in prayer that the Lord just continue to strengthen him U his cardiologist I want him to do some therapy and things like that where he can be able to get his strength back we believe the Lord can help take care of that too don't we yes we do amen heavenly father it's such a privilege for us to be gathered here tonight Lord once again we thank you dear God for the end time Gathering we thank you for the events that we can see happening upon the Earth many of them Lord because we're in that negative cycle or so sad right now we see such Darkness upon the face of the Earth we see Lord Jesus that men are groping in darkness and Isaiah said that it would be this way but because we're living under the law of contrast he said Gross Darkness would be upon the Earth the darkness on the earth and then the gross Darkness upon the people and then he said but for us us to arise and shine for our light has come so it shows us it'll be a time of great contrast the light of God will be so bright and shining in such a tremendous way and yet the world will be groping in total darkness Lord Jesus we're so grateful tonight for the light that you've given to us we pray that You' be mindful of us in this service father you see this prayer call this request of brother Frank has sent in father in the name name of Jesus would you grant it hundreds of people raise their hands here tonight Lord with different needs in their home their body their finances whatever it is would you meet that need Lord I pray tonight father that you'd help me I'm so needy Lord God to stand before your people and try to bring the word of God help me Father shut my mouth to anything that would be displeasing to you anoint me anoint the people may you receive glory to yourself we ask in Jesus name and the Saints said amen amen God bless you you may be seated elik was similar to Adam once he crossed the chasm he could not redeem his inheritance and we've been looking at Revelation 10 and Ruth chapter 4 four because it's a parallel from the Old Testament to the new and Ruth being a gentile one that was needing a redeemer a kinsman redeemer elik which had backslid left his land of inheritance because there was a famine and we see that many of God's people down to the age has done very similar when times get hard and things are difficult and their faith is being tried instead of standing where they should stand on the promise they do like Abraham did like Isaac did like many of the people did elik did exactly the same thing so instead of sticking it out and waiting for God to bring a Deliverance of bread what did they do they went to the country which God called his wash pot Moab is my wash pot in other words that's where God washed his hands and washed his feet remember it's a symbolism so God said that this is a place of dirt and filth this is a place of filthy wash water it's not a very good place to live is it so elik lost faith and when he lost faith he left the place that God had ordained for him to stay I don't know what God would have done I don't know what God would have done in the days of Abraham or in the days of Isaac but I believe with all of my heart if we stay where God has put us God will move and none of his promises that he ever made will ever fall to the ground and not come to pass you believe that so God no doubt would have moved for Abraham he would have moved for Isaac he would have moved for elik he did for others others stayed in the land they stayed there they waited on God they waited on the promise of God they didn't starve they didn't die they waited it out and God moved for them but there's always been that type of around the move of God and when times get hard they just can't take it so they go to looking for the easier way the way that is not really the way of face but the way of reasoning and the way of understanding and the way of the intellect well it just makes sense you know I I've already believe it'd be easier and wouldn't be near as hard if we'd go this way and do this and that which is exactly what elik did but by going there little did he know he would never return back to that land little did he know by doing this neither him nor his two sons would ever return back to the promised land similar in The Stance as Adam was in the Garden of Eden that once Adam listened to his wife's reasoning instead of God's word he probably didn't know that he'd never be able to redeem himself once he crossed that Chasm he himself needed Redemption so a person needing Redemption cannot act a part of a redeemer so elik cross the chasm and leaves the land of Judah and goes into a wash pot a place of fils a place to where they offer their children to Kos where they will worship Heen idle Gods oh you say brother Donnie what about Ruth God had to work that out God would have got Ruth over there if he had to send a lone donkey over there and go to Ruth's house and pack her back God would have got Ruth don't you think well I back I back slid so this can happen don't you go to bringing that tray to me God don't never lead one of his kids to backslide come on somebody God don't never make you backslide or you or anyone else so that you can have a testimony what kind of testimony is that if we will stay where God wants us to be I guarantee you that'll be one of the greatest testimonies we can ever have in our entire life but once elik crossed that line and he himself now stands in the need of a redeemer there was a breach between him and his land so it's not like that he can just walk back okay okay you know what I made a mistake I'm very sorry I realize it now and I'll just go back to where I come from no you see once he crossed that breach he could never get back I've often wondered what Adam must have thought no doubt he didn't think it totally through what he must have thought and and we know what should have happened actually in the Garden of Eden that Adam should have never taken Eve back to himself oh no the prophet declares it to us that once she did such a thing her and the serpent should have been burnt right he should have never went back to her again she should have been burnt with the serpent amen but you see God knew that Adam would do this and yeah he's acting out Grace and he's acting out in the timee but yet he still stepped over the word by doing it so now he himself finds himself in the need of a redeemer so he stands there in that place and he actually saves his wife he saves his wife because if he had not taken her to himself then God would have killed her but because the seed of Adam had been sown in her God would not kill her she is now a mother and he steps out and for gives up everything forsakes his sunship forsakes his godship forsakes everything that he had in order to save his wife but by Saving her he lost himself don't you understand what reconciliation in the garden of Gethsemane was doing to reconcile what Adam did in the Garden of Eden the first Adam walked out with his wife and the second Adam had to forsake his sunship In The Garden of Gethsemane oh my I want you to listen to this now the breach Adam could not meet the requirements of redemption after he found he lost it he had sinned and it separated him himself from God and was on this side of the chasm so he could not redeem it he just couldn't do it because he needed Redemption himself so he could not do it so a person that needed Redemption could not fully redeem and bring back what he had forfeited Moses couldn't do it Jeremiah couldn't do it no Priest No prophet and here is the Dilemma of God being on the other side of the chasm man being now on this side of the chasm and every human being that would be born by natural sex Asar would be born automatically on this side of the chasm how is God ever going to produce a Kinsman that does not need Redemption himself how will God ever bring such a creation into the earth when every man that is born of a woman is born of the woman tree which is the tree of death there were two trees there in the Garden of Eden the tree of life and the tree of death and the woman was the tree of death that's why the prophet said when you see a naval attached to a human being what do you see a renegade sir a renegade come on now a renegade so how is God than ever you know the devil must have scratched his head for years trying to understand how is God ever going to bring this back and then God himself was the first prophesier of the Messianic scriptures in the Garden of Eden and he be to let out different parts of the Messianic prophecies but God never said it in such a way where you could just link it one two 3 4 five six seven but he would say it in such a way describing two different comings or advents of the Messiah and say it in such a way well that spiritual understanding You' never be able to see it you can see why the Jews picked Messianic scriptures and Messianic prophecies that they believed with all of their heart and when they put it together they had a son of David a conqueror a mighty king they could not understand a virgin conceiving they could not understand him becoming a curse in the eyes of God they had quotes as we would say they had quotes from The Prophet's messages but yet they put it together under their understanding and they had a general coming not a baby they had a mighty conquering general not a baby that was going to be born a baby that would be born and live and grow up and die and become a curse and hang on a cross there's no way that was not in what they had it put together that did not represent their ideology I'll tell your friends if we're not careful we'll do the same thing may God help us you can see why a man misses so much the revelation of God because God says it in such a way and he will say it in such a way that it looks as if though this application could be right and it looks as if though this application could be right and both of them are using prophetic statements and yet they both are right but they had them wrong dispensation one prophet's quotes did not go contrary to the other but they could not lace it together and make it fit the way the spirit of God did well who did brother Donnie the elect of God the elect of God because they had special Insight by the very power of God that's what it's going to take for us in the last day now when Adam then heeds notice what he says here again when Adam sinned by heeding his wife's reasoning instead of holding to God's word that's what made Adam sin so he listened to his wife's reasoning instead of holding to God's word and that's what made Adam sin his wife reason with Satan and then produced the product to Adam and Adam turned loose the word and sold out he lost also his inheritance when he lost his fellowship and right to life remember the day you eat thereof that day you die when he lost his life he also lost his inheritance in life because he had completely Supreme control of the earth now listen at what our first father was on the Earth Earth he was a god of the earth God's the god of the universe everywhere but his son had this Earth under his own control now I want you to listen to me carefully so you don't misunderstand me before Jesus ever became the Son of God in flesh Adam was the first one now remember in the beginning was the word which was the logos so before Jesus became Jesus the man he was the logos which was the word so God burst out of the Eternal essence of his being something in time that could bear His Image something in time that could be tangible you follow me God thought of himself as being a human being he was invisible we know that and Jesus even said it in St John 4 God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth and then Paul comes in Timothy and says now unto the king Eternal Immortal invisible the only wise God be dominion and power forever so he is invisible and yet he wanted to have a visibility about his image so he separates from himself the thought of himself becoming tangible he wanted to become a man but he did not now Express Jesus as we know him in the Garden of Eden think of it if Jesus would have been in the Garden of Eden there would have been no fault he would have never done what Adam did but God allowed Adam Adam which is the Hebrew word which means actually read because he was taken from the dust of the earth so God allowed him in that Spirit form when Adam was in the image of God and remember in the image of God created he them male and female created he them so when you would have looked you would have saw one image walking around in the Garden of Eden it would have been one yet plural one yet plural God created them and God called their name Adam so there was no Eve by separate name till actually she committed adultery actually she committed adultery then she gets her own name now in the spirit form the man in Genesis one now there's a man in Genesis 1 there's another man in Genesis 2 there's another man in Genesis 3 which is the prophecy of Christ of course and the man in Genesis 1 became the same man in Genesis 2 put in the dust of the Earth the man in Genesis 1 as long as he remained in that form he could not fall he could only fall once he was placed in chapter two when that man was put in dust well I hope you're hearing me tonight it's actually the same way with you and I if we would have never been put in dust and we would have come straight from the mind of God then we could have never fallen either preach with me now but once we come from the mind of God and then we were put in this dust it broke us down don't you understand what a dust body does you understand the Lord Jesus himself being the logos which could appear disappear theophonic form of course and he would pick up a body like he did in Genesis 18 he would appear step into that body com complete a portion of his work for Abraham in that day and then go right back into that Andis ability again the body fall right back down to the dust of the earth he never had a permanent flesh body until it was conceived of a virgin because this is what he wanted but once a man takes on flesh the logos the Lord Jesus the Christos of God once he took on flesh he actually become weak once he took on flesh he could fight battles the way what is that there's something about this it even brought the Son of God to a state that the prophet said he was tempted by women he was tempted by drinking he was tempted in all points like as we are yet without sin is that right you see the Son of God which preexisted in that theophonic form as the logos but once he stepped into flesh it made him sub to The Domain and the desires and the Dominion of humanity and had it not been of who he was there's no way that he could have ever been the Redeemer just by the flesh itself that's why the prophet said it stumbles people in the message that he said even the Flesh of Jesus could not glory in the presence of God well I'm sorry some of y'all didn't know that even the Flesh of Jesus could not Glory now remember he was not called Lord Jesus Christ in the four gospels the angel did not say thou shalt call his name Lord Jesus Christ but the angel said Thou shalt call his name Jesus ah Jesus Jus did not say Lord Jesus Christ when do we find him getting the name Name Lord Jesus Christ in the book of Acts after his Ascension after he appears before the elders in the gate and he performs the ceremony of the shoe he performs the ceremony of the shoe now watch the prophet goes on to say about Adam Adam turned loose the word and so loud so he lost his inheritance and he lost his inheritance in life and he lost his fellowship and right to life remember the day you eat thereof that day you will die so he was a God now think of what he forfeited he forfeited being a God to become a sinner he forfeited the ability to speak to trees and if he didn't like it over here he would simply look at it and speak to it by the word and say be thou removed from there and set out over here cuz I think you would look better I just got my own little opinion about that I wonder myself if it wouldn't after Eve come along and Sons of God's been moving furniture ever since oh yeah but you realize that he had all of the Earth was under his domain this is what God wanted his sons to be heir of he wanted them to be Gods you see even for the theologians the plurality of the word Elohim confuses them they don't understand it because Elohim can be expressed and it's a feminist form of eloh Elo Elohim and then they look at and say well if if it's if it's plural then there must be three up there actually there's more than three Welly that woke you up didn't it now listen to me there's more attributes of deity than just father son Holy Ghost every elect member of God's family is part of his godhead I know it's going to choke you to death tonight but you might as well just go ahead and go cuz we're this is the way we're going we are part of his godhead that's exactly right now what stumbles us so much of course is this right here and and this is what we focus on this is what we look at I told you years ago one of the greatest things that is going to be in the last days for the people of God is to believe what the word says about you versus what you know about yourself and your own humanity and we live in this so stinking thing every day of our life and it causes us all kind of battles and ups and downs and ins and outs and all that and if we're not careful we will begin to believe this is who we are this is not who you are if you are a son or daughter of God this is not who you are don't you understand Jesus Christ when he was on the earth as a man he would only be in that sense and that exact image of that Humanity for 33 and a half years or third whatever it was and once he raised up from the dead that body would be closed with immortality it would look like he did he would have the same eyes and hair and all of that but he would only bear that particular image for 30 years that was not who he was him being tempted of the devil that's not who he was that's what he become to make you who you were he wanted to get you here but he had to do that in order to cross the chasm he could not stay on that side of the chasm and say come on over children come on over children we say we can't do it Jesus we're lost we can't get over there and he knew he couldn't so what' he do he come down and laid himself as the bridge Oh Glory to God in between deity and humanity and he touched Humanity on one side and spread his arms on the other side and said I am the way the truth and the life no man can come to the father but by me so he was the Bri Hallelujah in order to become the breach he had to forsake his sunship and die the death of a sinner I know this chokes people to death D you you're making him that low how didn't make him that low he made himself that low I'm just telling you how low he went he was not only the Lamb of God but he become a goat the scapegoat for your sins can't you see why people that turn that down they deserve to go to hell all he went through and all the price he paid for us and we turn that down we're not fit to walk down streets of go well praise the Lord so as Adam for forfeited so much of his domain so he walks in the Garden of Eden that morning as a God as a God don't you see there's something about man he still wants to be a god even lost man he wants to be God of his life he wants to be God of his home he wants a Dominion he wants a domain it'll never be returned if it don't come back through Jesus am remember Satan offered it to him said ye shall be as Gods knowing good and evil what were they before yeah they were Gods Not by knowledge but by birth Hallelujah creation of God Adam could say let this mountain be moved over here and it would do it Adam could say let this tree be plucked up and planted over there it would do it for he had complete Supreme control as a minor God under God our father because he was a Son of God so in the Lamb's Book of Life the first name written at the top would have been the Lord Jesus and the next next one would have been Adam you didn't know the prophet said that what do y'all read all the time you didn't know he said the Lamb's name was in that book oh yes the Lamb's name was there and he said he spoke your name when he spoke his he spoke your name brother Paul and placed it in that book and wrote it indoubly was the word that he used in the blood of Jesus Christ my name was put on on that book before there's ever any Devils your name was put on that book before there's ever any sin any adultery and a line you tell me how Satan will ever keep one of those out of that book he can't do [Applause] it so God had this personal diry I'm not sure exactly what it called it it could have been called a lot of things Lamb's Book of Life The Diary of the Gods for I am the Eternal I am over the universe okay let's go back to it again now you help me dogs give birth to dogs cats give birth toat cows give birth to and if God was to ever give birth Hallelujah would God give birth to Sinners would God give birth to Lost no good rotten no count for nothing there ain't no way in the world you make God rotten if you do that so don't you understand when you look in the mirror don't you understand your eyes cannot see but if God is living inside your soul there is a part of deity inside of you Church oh Hallelujah that's what the Rapture is for it's the Gathering Together of deity don't you understand what the resurrection and the Rapture is that we're waiting on hallelujah it's the Gathering Together of [Applause] deity notice this in page 8 83 paragraph So you see Adam lost his inheritance the earth now it passed from his hand to the one he sold out to so on this day Adam walks in the Garden of Eden and he walks in there as God of the earth he walks out a sinner he walked in with Dominion power of the spoken word and he walks out with a piece of sheep skin wrapped around him hitting his legs and the blood running down his legs little Eve with her blonde hair and her blue eyes tears falling out of her eyes now leing over on Adam's chest his tears coming down mixing with hers running down mixing in with the blood and he walks out not a God not a god lost not his soul now but he lost his domain he lost his power the spoken word left his mouth the image of God went from him he woke up that morning refreshed what must I do today Papa what do you want me to do I'm your son what do you want me to do not knowing by the end of the day he would begin to feel an emotion that he had never felt before he began to watch as the evening Shadows come and he knew it was God's custom to go to church so he went and hid in the trees and papa come down at church time but Adam wasn't at church so the prophet said one of the sadest scriptures in the Bible God running up and down through the garden Adam Adam Adam where are you he knew exactly where he was at but he was giv him a chance to come out and repent like he does US finally Adam spoke up I I hid myself I heard your voice and I was afraid the first time that word is mentioned out of a human's mouth we've experienced fear and Trauma I dare say there's not a one of us that had it in the scope that he had it that's all we've known all of our Liv life is it not fear in one form or another some of y'all remember your first one it was when Daddy heading at you with a belt or mama with her hand spread open like this and you knew you was in for it and it was still that fear we were born not too long after we were born people began to understand and they would raiseed their voice and it instill something in us but here's a grown man that had lived maybe thousands or t thousands of years on the earth he had never felt this emotion he had never never been afraid of God and now he hears God's voice Walking In The Garden in the cool of the day and he's paranoid he's fearful he's shaking he's trembling maybe sweat breaking out on his face and all of a sudden God's voice seems so so harsh and so straightforward he never heard God talk like that I don't know if you understand it or not but do do you relate to it in this way that the way you live and where you are in God will dictate how a preacher has to preach and you say wonder wonder why sometimes them preachers get so Stern wonder why that they're preaching hard sometimes cuz there's somebody that needs to hear that voice of God in a Stern way yeah you see God didn't come to oh oh that that's fine Adam no no no no don't don't worry about no problem at all I mean I'll tell you what I'll just Overlook the whole thing y'all can just stay here the rest of your life that's fine no big deal God is a God of Justice and when God's word is broken it must be administered according to the promise and the promise was death amen dear God therefore his eternal life is right to the truth of Life his right to the Earth belonged to him and he forfeit every bit of it to the hands of Satan so Satan crawls underneath the garden gate the prophet terms it that way that morning thinking what can I do today I want this place so bad that's the way you'll do your home that's the way he'll do your life that's the way he'll do our church but I say we stand and rally together and say this is our church this is our home this is my life you're not getting it devil this is my wife and my children this is the way we live this is our message you're not getting my eternal life you're not getting my victory you're not stealing my joy it's mine [Applause] Satan so Satan crawls underneath the garden gate that morning but he walks out the gates that night with the keys you know I'm sure by reading the book of Genesis Adam was not actually brought from the dust of the Garden of Eden you see there was a place called called Eden so Eden was a territory or was said like this a state so Adam was actually pulled out of the dust in the state of Tennessee we'll say and then God took him the Bible says God took him and placed him placed him adoption in the Garden of Eden wow in the garden ofen God knew this was a probationary period had he come from the dust of the Garden of Eden it would have been more personal claim had I come from the spoken word of God my Humanity oh Hallelujah sin could have never got a hold of me it could never got a hold of you but I was placed Hallelujah don't you understand if you're Eng graced today you were placed there if you're in the Holy Spirit you were placed there yes sir remember there was a great probationary period that it went on in heaven before Adam was ever placed on the earth he knew nothing about it myriads of angels had been created by the Eternal and many of them were placed on probation as well you see Paul mentions about out an elect angels of God in other words they couldn't fall there were some angels that were created and they could fall there were other angels that came out of the essence of the Eternal you see this is why the prophet could say that you never was saved on any certain day you always was saved now there's a part of you that never began oh you remember he tells us what was up there 1957 he said for those of us that stays with that word we were a part of those angels that never fell before the foundation of the world that's right and somebody said amen So Adam is now in his probation Supreme control who would ever thought you could lose Supreme control how s but I don't mind telling you I bring it down to our modern day when I find a son or a daughter of God and God Saves them and gives them a nice little family and they go to living for the Lord and another woman will move into the scene or another man will move into the scene or whirlin will move into the scene and they go to you know get doing things they wouldn't initially do and they don't love the Lord like they used to and they don't go to church like they used to and they've got this and that and the other oh don't you see what you're doing you're another Adam and Eve you're another Adam and Eve and you're walking away from God's provided place for you I say to you tonight Adam and your Eve we need to stand our ground that devil will try to come sliding underneath our garden gate remember he is a serpent he is a Wy serpent that will try to get you and your family and your children but you can stand your ground and say Satan you are a liar this is our property this is our inheritance we will not forfeit [Applause] it he forfeited every bit to the hands of Satan he passed it from his hands to Satan you said that's awful how could he do that same way you do some many people you and I know do how many people do we know that have sat in our midst shouted dance said they believe the word of the hour now they make fun of it ridicule life at it whatever used to get drunk on the Holy Ghost used to shout under the blessing of God now they're drinking liquor yeah come on somebody preach with me they used to get in Heavenly places oh they got high right in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus but now they got to have a shot or they got to have a pill why they let their life go into the hands of the devil oh my can't you see why God had to have a law of innocent substitution that there would be a law of substitutionary value that one which was innocent could be accepted as a substitute for one who was emphatically proven guilty watch's this again in the breach but God's law received of substitute now what if God had not offered to take a substitute oh I love this but love constrained him to do it love constrained him to do it that man was without a way back there's no way for him to get back he was gone but the grace of God met this kinsman redeemer in the person of Jesus Christ law required it Grace met its requirements praise praise God I want you to notice now law demanded it but law could not meet it let me tell you some friend we will never be able to please God by legalism I know there's a great delicate balance and finding that between the contrast of legalism and liberalism and trying to find well where's the balance but if you got the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost will lead you right down the middle of the road I want to be legal when legalism was required come on somebody I believe in Holiness don't you I believe there's dos and don'ts in the Bible but to me if you fall in love with the author them dos and don'ts ain't near as bad as what the devil tries to make you look like they are anyway because it's not oh I hate to do this I wish I didn't have to do that your problem is your love life that's what's wrong with a lot of message folks it's their love life they love the devil they love the flesh they love the things of the world more than they love God but if you fall in love with the Lord Jesus then I'll guarantee you one thing whatever he wants you to do and you're in love with him oh my it is such an honor to serve him it's such an honor to give up anything that he wants oh my law required it Grace met its requirements Oh Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound he says notice law required a kinsman redeemer to redeem a lost substance Grace met this requirement in the person of Jesus Christ a Kinsman must be born of the human race now what the contrast between Boaz and Ruth so Boaz not under the law but also under grace you see law would have kept Ruth out because an ammonite or a moabit could not come to the Lord for 10 Generations 400 years which also meant King David couldn't that's right since he was kin to Ruth the more about us that's right amen it's just something about us Gentiles we love that music and not dancing oh I know some of you still Baptist and some of it's your Church of Christ I'm hoping some of y'all find you dance before we Le in the Rapture all right I don't mind telling you one thing me and little David's going to dance in heaven where're some of the resue sat there and look at us if you want to but I figure we going to have a time but I don't want to wait till I get to heaven to have a time I like having a time right now the way I look at it if people can get out of here and carry on the way they do for the devil and all of his nonsense and here we are saved by the grace of God when we was on our way to hell we was wretched we was blind we was miserable we was naked and he saved us and we sat around oh my goodness with a mully grubs and we're so sad I think we need a good dose of the Holy Ghost and joy unspeakable and full of Glory if they can jump up at a ball game what's wrong with saints of God clapping their hands and saying Amen brother preach the word that's right brother why because we realize where we come from and where we're [Applause] going oh Hallelujah notice the Virgin birth produced our kinsman redeemer not other but the almighty God become Emmanuel one of us Emmanuel the kinsman redeemer was M you see how God makes a requirement and there's nothing we can do but then Grace steps in Oh Glory to God grace steps in and overshadows the law and produces the product I hope you understand what I just read to you I read to you the con of the body change don't think you'll ever get to a spot oh oh brother Donnie it'll be at least 30 days it'll be at least 60 days I'll walk a perfect walk before God I will be absolutely perfect I'll make no mistake it'll be a month or two months or my as good as I am it might be a year you never know as good as I am you know I just live so good and so holy and I'm everything I'll probably be just as sinless and perfect as I can be if Grace don't overshadow us Stone won't even be a Rapture what does the bible tell us in the Old Testament when that headstone would come crying what's he going to cry what's it going to cry oh how good you are how right you are what's that headstone come crying Grace Grace Grace Grace why we still need it brother I'm going to need it right the very morning of the body chain you're going to need at the very morning of a body chain because I am captured in this old Humanity it is my enemy it is your enemy but God demands Perfection and God said I will produce it myself how will you do it God even the Rapture will say Grace Grace Grace [Applause] Grace but you see Boaz and Jesus Christ both wanted the same thing an irrefutable legal possession now Boaz did not want a woman that he could take her to himself and know her and then to or someone else have a claim two years three years 5 years down the road and say she's she was with me 3 weeks after y all got married he wanted a legal possession the Lord Jesus don't just want saved people on now listen there'll be lots of Saved people that will be exactly that saved people but Jesus is not going to get just saved people pregnated with his word right come on somebody the Lord Jesus Christ will not send the pregnation of his word in an individual's heart until he is assured that they are a legal possession of his their days of boyfriend hunting are over wo glory to God God their days of looking for another man are over they're not looking for another boyfriend they're not looking for another lover come on somebody they're not looking to be conceived with child by another man them days are over why because the Lord Jesus has done this work so complete that the seat of God is already in there and the womb is already closed up and the oh Hallelujah the devil not so his seed of corruption she belongs to [Applause] him Ruth 4:7 now this was the manner in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing redeeming and changing Ching that's what I'm interested in redeeming and changing you follow me for to confirm all things a man plucked off his shoe and gave it to his neighbor and this was a testimony in Israel therefore the Kinsman said unto Boaz buy it for thee notice he says it not her once he found out she was a morius he wouldn't even lower himself to recognize her you honestly think the devil would want me you imagine him wanting to take me to hell he'd be sick on a horse in about three hours no probably wouldn't take that long I'd be shouting all over down I say come on get saved come on get out of this place let the devil let him burn in hell come on out of here cuz you see even if he was able to get me down there I'm still a Son of God when he took Jesus down there what Jesus do kicked the whole side of Hell in and shut the door shut and Jesus come right out of there preaching come on children don't you think it's your location that makes you of the devil if the devil got you down in hell he wouldn't want you there very long you sister to that long hair and them long dresses on and the Holy Ghost go to hitting you down there he said I'll not leave your soul in hell and I'll not leave my Holy One to seek corruption why when the devil had you out there in them hell ho hold you didn't really fit you never was part of them even though you was drinking you smoking there dope you was living the way they live and acting the way they acted but there was a predestinated seat of God down inside of your soul always was there because it come from the Eternal himself all you needed was a burst all you needed was a spirit of God hallelujah to Quicken you and bring you out of that mess [Applause] so this is called the ceremony of the shoe so walking on this possession with your shoe meant it was yours so each step was an investment in your property so a transaction would made sometimes it would be the seller sometimes it would be both seller and buyer but it is required of the seller the the seller would take off one shoe and he would give that shoe to the buyer he is instead of investing he divesting so he said no more I give you not my word but my shoe I give you my shoe I will never tread upon this ground again it is yours amen I'll tell you one thing friends I get so fighting mad I get so sick of that devil robbing us I get so sick of that devil stealing a lot of our stuff and he ain't even got no right to be on our property he ain't got no right to be on our property brother Jack and we just give him free course and let him come in and do whatever he wants to do don't you understand the Lord Jesus has already paid the price and he's already give you the promised Footprints means possession but you'll fight for every inch of the ground that you get in God now actually this is not only in scripture but it's also in his history as well now the removal of the shoe the Hebrew ritual that was called by this is H h a l i t z a h halit and it means to draw off one the ancient text says when someone sells his property he looses permanently or temporary his legal right to it and lifts up his foot from it and places on it the foot of the new owner thus by removing his shoe he is divesting himself of property ownership therefore the Kinsman said unto Boaz now we see what to does buy it for thee so it's repeated twice to prove that it's a double Covenant you ever wonder why Jesus in the New Testament say verily verily verily verily double verily verily now he's not just repeating himself because he said her Jesus was a stutterer it is a double verification listen close now notice so he drew off his shoe so this was not just a purchase of a piece of land but to the spiritual mind it was a marriage ceremony watch this When sin had been confessed and fallen into the blood of Jesus Christ it gives an abstract right straight back to the Creator again you become a Son of God Abstract title deed is held in the hand of the almighty think of it he had your Abstract title deed he's had it all these years what's he waiting on brother Donnie he's waiting on you to claim it you can't claim it by belonging into a church you can't claim up and say I believe God sent a prophet that ain't the way you get it everything that was ever against you has to be stricken off oh my it gives an abstract strip back to the Creator again and you become a Son of God Abstract title deed is held in the hand of almighty God it's Redemption means all legal possession to all that was lost by Adam and Eve see how far we're living from our privileges tonight oh what that ought to do to a born again Christian it's legal possession to the abstract title deed of eternal life means that you possess everything Adam and Eve lost brother tnie how can that be so because we have it in seed form I'm waiting on the full manifestation but the prophet gave a very simple illustration he said if I was hungry and someone saw me and they felt sorry for me and they would say how much how much would a loaf of bread cost you you say 25 cents well inflation's really went up since then eh so 25 cents now he said if they would reach in their pocket and give me that 25 cents I could go on my way just as happy with that 25 cents as if I had that loaf of bread under my arm now he said I'm on my way I'm going to the store to buy that loaf of bread I might have to go through some briers I might have to go through some low spots but I'm happy because I've got the purchase price in my hand oh praise God I don't have perfect health yet but I've got the 20 5 cents it says I'm fixing to get it amen I've got gray hairs and I've got wrinkles in my face but I ain't what I'm looking at I'm looking at the down payment that I got in my hand cuz it says I'm fixing to be made a young man again after a while if I live in a few months I'll be 68 years old but who knows I might turn 20 and never turn 68 now it depends you see on the will of God and if we realize that it would help with the confusion of people say well you're saying we got all this stuff we got all this stuff where in the world is it you've got the deposit inside of your soul and you've got to stand right there and let God give you how much ever he wants you to have now I don't want to get it all after while in the Millennium I want the Earthly part now and the Millennium part [Applause] later RS 410 and we'll close here sometime moreover Ruth the moas now I want you to notice Boaz the Redeemer he does not care to call her by her old identity because he's fixing to change her name moreover Ruth of moabitas the wife of meon have I purchased to be my wife look at the word purchased to get acquire create by possess creating redeeming his people I have purchased to be my wife to raise up the name of the Dead upon his inheritance that the name of the Dead be not cut off from among his Brethren now remember this is called the lever the lever right now in this state with to whenever to would have refused to redeemed her the law gave her the right after he moved his shoe to walk right up in his face and spit in his face and say so be it to the man will not raise up seed to his brother now some of y'all need to get your fear brought where it needs to be you need to be afraid of God and not afraid of Old Toad and you need to get up some gospel gumption and walk up in that Devil's face and say you long tongue ly loow Down Rotten conniving cheating stealing and whatever adjective that I can come together with you have stole from me you have robbed me yeah I I I was taught into marrying you whenever I was born it was a shotgun wedding I didn't have no chance but I heard about a redeemer and you proved your colors and he proved his you proved you was a coward you proved you was a poor devil you proved you couldn't redeem me you proved you didn't have no Heaven you ain't got no Deliverance you ain't got no happiness and I'll tell you what I'm fixing to do I'm fixing to spit right in your [Applause] F oh but of course some of you walk up and now no Mr devil I don't want to make you mad or anything but I I I'm married to Jesus now and uh but just in case it don't work out I mean I thought I thought that I could leave you on good terms and that way if I want to come back if I want to come back I can right because I'm not getting rid of all my rock and roll music and I'm keeping my tight Brites in the closet and you may keep your shorts of course and goad and keep all your go necklaces and all that sort of just in case it don't work out with you and Jesus well I'll tell you right now it probably won't because you ain't got born again yet you're still holding on to the world you're hanging on to the world and you're trying to hold on to Jesus cuz you don't want to go to hell but if you ever fall in love with him deep enough you get rid of your bres sisters you will get rid of your little old shorts you men sissified things you will get rid of your beer you will get rid of your alcohol you will get rid of I wish somebody would preach with me tonight you'll get rid of your P mail you'll get rid of your ex-rated moving you'll get rid of all that nonsense and you'll say Lord Jesus let's go away let's go away I'll never go back to that old [Applause] husband notice how Boaz now finish it here that the name of the Dead be not cut off from among his Brethren and from the Gate of his place you see he didn't go over to the gate of Ephraim he didn't go to the gate of isachar zebulin nephal Reuben Gad Boaz bought her in the gate of praise and he said here's where I buy her here her son will be raised here in a house of Praise amen hallelujah I am going to raise up seed in this gate ye are witnesses this day acts 2028 take heed therefore un yourselves and to all the flock here Luke is writing to the preachers now writing down Paul's words of course and the others in the book of Acts over which the Holy Ghost has made you overseers to feed the Church of God which he has purchased with his own blood this is why friends that we believe and preach we are not our own if you believe you belong to you you're believing error you belong to Jesus Christ if he bought you now if he didn't buy you then you belong to hell and you belong to the devil and you belong to whoever else but if you're a child of God and you you were bought by him guess what he owned you and believe it or not he considers his bride his greatest possession let me just share with you my heart as I close as a pastor one of the greatest things that God has entrusted me with and given to me besides my salvation my Holy Ghost is my sheep the people that he's entrusted me with it's an awesome responsibility I don't mind telling you scares me to death they mind I will invite a minister to come you know what I'm doing I'm sharing part of the greatest gift next to my eternal life that God entrusted with me ever associate minister of our church I'm sharing part of what God gave me and if time goes on I'll die if we don't all get changed first and somebody else will step in then it will be his responsibility I don't look at you as being a number I don't look at you as being someone that just feels a spot and you don't really matter I look at you as being a gift from almighty God that I'm to preach to and feed and let me just make sure you understand you are not here to serve me I'm here to serve you what good would a preacher's gift do if there wasn't anybody for him to preach to Oh but you said brother Donnie these Great Men these Great Men Great Men great men and where would any of these Great Men be if it wasn't for great people of God to preach to them and I know I know it's hard to Fathom but the Lord Jesus had spanned this universe of trillions of stars and all the great things that he has and yet he looks at you and considers his redeemed the greatest of his possessions let stand stand together let's read this scripture together if you would Ephesians 113 in whom you also trusted after that you heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation and whom also after that you believed you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of Promise so you see just because you believed don't mean you got the Holy Ghost you get the Holy Ghost after you believe yes which is the earnest of our inheritance look at the word earnest the first installment paid as a pledge that the rest of the purchased inheritance will follow a portion of the purchase money paid as earnest amen which is the earnest of our inheritance until the Redemption of the purchased possession you see this is where we are this is where Ruth had to wait she had to wait for Boaz to do the finale she had to rest amen we're waiting on our Boaz to complete think of it a young person may come next week to these meetings maybe they've sit in a message churches would say cut their teeth in a message Pew they've never been born again they may come on one of the brothers is preaching they may come up to the front they may not they may bow their head where they're sitting there and the spirit of God will Strack our heart we came together we sang We worshiped we had great meetings and little did we realize the last one whose name was on the book got saved in that meeting in a few weeks or a few months that one will grow oh my goodness they will explode in growth and they'll come to every required revelation of what they need brother Daryl will keep evangelizing these other brothers that go out and preach we'll keep right on preaching singing doing all that we're doing and one morning we'll get up thinking we're going to go right on like we've been doing and it'll all be over and we'll look in our house and there'll be your mother your grandmother your father whoever it is and you'll know it won't be long amen praise be to God you mean it could be that close brother Donnie it could be that close my brother sister let's bow it together if you don't have the Holy Ghost tonight my friend you have not yet receive the pledge the earnest money the deposit that your rapture assure but I read books I listen tapes that's wonderful please do that please do that but make sure you've got the Holy Ghost do reading books is wonderful you should do it but it's not just by reading books or quoting the prophet or quoting even the Bible but it's your deposit in your soul it'll change you it'll Quicken you it'll make you a different person and then in the morning of the Rapture you may be standing in front of your mirror combing what few hairs you have left running your comb through the gray and all of a sudden sudden someone appears in your room I've mentioned it to you several times but since I've been here as a pastor of this church I've buried over 144 people that's a lot of that's a lot of funerals I've walked in front of many a casket so I plan on having a great big gathering at my house on the resurrection morning I don't figure that my little darling daughter will come to my house first I'm sure she's going to stop down at 101 Quail Run first but after that she'll be up to see Mom and Daddy brother Daniel Nunley will walk in a young man brother Calvin Ward sister Naomi daily on and on and on and on Hallelujah Hallelujah then I'll know it won't be long I'm going to be changed where their heads about tonight is there anyone here tonight no one looking please that you're just not sure you love the Lord but all of your heart but you're just not sure if that earnest money is been paid to you or not you love the Lord you go to church you read your Bible but maybe there's just a little question there would you just raise your hand to the Lord Lord would you settle that for me tonight father bless you Saints God bless you young and old God bless you with this token comes an assurance it's not a guessing a maybe so or perhaps but God wants you to know that you know that you know praise the Lord heavenly father thank you for coming to this earth and doing this great work of redemption father I don't think we can ever be over what you did for us no no doubt we see it even now so vaguely we say salvation is free and it is free to us but oh the price you had to pay it was so high oh Jesus I pray tonight may you move across this place you that streaming tonight father that couldn't be here maybe those that go back and archive it from around the world wherever they're they're hearing it at Lord God oh Jesus Hallelujah maybe that little family there in Scotland Lord in Norway up in Iceland wherever they are maybe there's one heard their name being called tonight Lord wasn't me calling it but it's the son of man Christ anointing his people people oh Jesus speak your word call your last ones in Lord so we can leave this wicked sinful Place father every day it's becoming a more unfitted place for us to live come Lord Jesus take us away take us away Lord Lord as we just experienced a great phenomen of this week of the eclipse and the moon getting front of the sun hearing them talk about it scientifically that the sun is 400 times larger than the moon and yet 400 times farther away than the moon and I heard this commentator on the news saying it shows an intelligent design of a being that would place them in the orbit that they are in the same distance and there was explaining how if the moon was closer to us it wouldn't be that way or if it was farther away there wouldn't even be an eclipse but you made them the right size and you put them in the right place Lord Jesus you made us the right size too and you put us in the right place but the moon and the sun's unlike us we want to be bigger than you made us or little than you made us and we want this man's place and that man's place and I heard the prophet read it yesterday rather he was saying when God called me he said to be an evangelist and he said I wanted to be a pastor I just thought it'd be just nice to stay at home I thought my goodness I just kind of smiled and chuckled I thought is that something even brother brandham wanted to be something different than what God called him to be help us Lord to be able to find our rotation around you and your word the church will we need to go to the ministry that we need to set under the people that we need to witness to just just the things that we need to be Lord help us to find our spot and it'll all come together to make the Divine constellation of the Rapture constellation of the end time we know you wrote your first Bible there in the Stars we know them constellations are there and they tell stories when you come to job you begin to quote to job the Bible that he knew you mention to him the pleades and the Orion Urus cuz that was the Bible that job knew it declared a story in the heavens oh Jesus cleanse us father help us to be more like you Lord I pray oh we worship you tonight father thank you Lord Jesus can we just raise our hands now in the presence of the Lord now he's ministered To Us by his word let us now in turn minister to him with our praise and our love and our adoration remember the prophet said that Rebecca she didn't realize that when she was packing that water down there to them camels them camels would be the very ones that would pack her to her bridegroom she went back and forth and back and forth and back and forth I think about 50 50 or 60 trips something like that the amount of gallons that each one of them camels could drink so you imagine going back and forth and back and forth and back and forth and back and forth 50 or 60 times to water them camels but boy when she rode them things back home she must have thought it was worth every trip amen Oh Glory to God you imagine all this singing and all the praying and everything that you do and whenever our change comes we'll say praise God it was worth every mou it was worth everything I ever went through what's this to be compared to what I went through oh praise the lordess Hey sing something can we just worship him a little for we go if you need to go go on but those of you that want to say let's just say for a little bit and just worship him a little let's just Minister back to him now just to let him know how we feel about him how we love him we shouldn't have to have the band you know been able to beat the drums and everything going wide open for us to be able to make love to our lord Jesus we should be able to do it from our heart it should not be us accompanying the music it should be the music and accompaniment to us he dwells and loves in the Praises of his people we worship you Lord God we bless your name tonight
