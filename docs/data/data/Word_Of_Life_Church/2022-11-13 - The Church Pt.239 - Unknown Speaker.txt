falling Souls [Music] thank you Lord we're so grateful for that today God bless you let's just see each one of you today the presence of the Lord let's turn to the Book of Joshua if you would Joshua chapter 5. I must forgot to pay that electric bill again didn't they Joshua chapter 5 verse 13. be having the youth youth service tomorrow night what we've been having it there question answers Rob said 6 30 I think so that would be the desire to come for that service Joshua chapter 5 verse 13. and it came to pass when Joshua thank you it was by Jericho that he lifted up his eyes and looked and behold there stood a man behold there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand and Joshua went unto him and said unto him art thou for us or for our adversaries and he said nay but as the captain of the host of the Lord am I now come Joshua fell on his face to the Earth and did worship and said unto him what saith my Lord unto his servant and the captain of the Lord's host said unto Joshua loose thy shoe from off thy foot for the place whereon thou standest is Holy and Joshua did so so I wonder what made that place holy it was the presence of this being whoever it was that had made it holy then when this being left the place wasn't whole anymore what Sanctified that place it was his presence you know what makes this these rooms in here sanctified a couple times a week Holiday Inn is Holy rest the time I'm not so sure about but this same man right here is what makes it holy and when that man appears and his people come together their presence consecrates wherever they are amen and makes it holy then when he goes back up his people disperse it goes right back to being whatever it was before we're truly blessed so then I ask you what if this man right here this verse I'm one was to come down and get in our souls and live in US 24 7. wouldn't we be a walking Temple of God well there you go service dismissed if you can grasp that it's been a great day I may like to be remembered as we pray today this is power hits together if you would Jesus we thank you so much and we can be together again Lord how we love church we already knew it but I think it's becoming more real to us that church is not necessarily the building where we are but it's where us and you are gathered together your angels your presence for that purpose we've come again today Lord we're asking you that you would speak to us help us if we can recognize your presence in our midst all of our troubles all the difficulties that we're going through they may not be totally dissipated away from us but we will realize they will never conquer us because your presence is here help us now fathers we look into your word in the name of the Lord Jesus we ask it and the Saints said amen God bless you you may be seated how many notes who this man was Christ and a theophonic appearance you know I like the way that Joshua went about this the first step toward victory is to acknowledge that we are second in command it took him a few minutes but it didn't take all day thankfully but he wasn't sure exactly who this person was who the being was that as the writer of the Book of Joshua said a man appeared before him most of us looking at a man it would be hard to know was it an angelic appearance was it a supernatural one was it just a human element but we find by what happened here that it was definitely more than a man I love the appearances of the Lord on the Earth I love the way that he custom fits those appearances according to the particular needs of his people Joshua was facing a great battle Jericho is the foremost City in the southern part of where they're going into and Joshua cannot go around it and say well we'll go north we'll go east we'll go west and then we'll come back and take this but Joshua knew it was necessary to take this first then God would give them the rest of the land but it was a city that was a great Conquest these people had thought some but they were mainly Masons they were householders they were slaves they were people that were not many of them professional Soldiers by any means and yet he's looking at a city that as far as we know historically had not yet been conquered so how do you take a city whose walls wind up being 20 feet thick how do you take a city that's so far historically no armies had yet been able to conquer no doubt different people had different ideas some would have said well I have read that what you do in a situation like this is you build a rampart and you go to climbing up with mounds of dirt and then you take Timbers and you make big wheels and you start rolling up that ramp until you're able to put your men over the top of the wall no doubt someone else would have said that's too much labor why don't we just camp out around this city and we'll starve them out because the Bible tells us that the city will shut up and I love the way brother Branham said it when he read that scripture in Joshua 6 1 when he read that the Bible said the city of Jericho was shut up brother Branham said it like this it was like a turtle in a shell so all you got to know is how to hunt and cook turtle so it depends on how you look at your circumstances now Joshua we have no record that Joshua asks for any input but this appearance was so custom fit for their situation I don't want to find amazing is we have no more spiritual occurrences that Christ himself ever appeared just like this again you know I think that where we are today and our time frame that the Lord Jesus knows exactly how to appear to us too there may be a time that he will appear in a bush or in a cloud or in a pillar of fire but he knows exactly what each of us need what do you need today you know I found so many times myself I don't even know how I need him I might pray Lord would you do this Lord would you do that father I need you to come this way or that way and yet he would show up in a way that was so different than the way I prayed and so different than the way of my anticipation that I was completely overwhelmed and yet it was the right way now we know that God had already appeared in different theophonic appearances prior to this in the Book of Genesis in the book of Exodus turn with me if you would you'd like to read with me in Genesis chapter 18 verse 1 and the Lord appeared to him this is Abram and the plains of mamory and he sat in the tent Door In the Heat of the day and he lift up his eyes and looked and lo three men stood by him and when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself toward the ground now the Bible does not declare to us that he appeared to Abram as the commander of the host of the Lord the Bible does not declare to us that he appeared to him as a pillar of fire but he appeared to him as a man now what's amazing was there were three men now you know I find it I find it overwhelming because the trinitarian theologians who try to look in the Bible to prove that there's three Gods this is one of the places that they go to so they try to make Father Son and Holy Ghost but of course we know there is no such a thing as three Gods there's only one but by a prophetic understanding we know that this was Jehovah and two of his mighty angels just down the road a great Supernatural saying had happened the prophet tells us is there anything too hard for the Lord in Tulsa in 1960 he said let's just imagine that it had been a pretty bad day so Sarah was in a very bad mood and the title were running short of food and they were running short of water and Sarah had told Abraham that Miss lot she had heard from her and she had moved down to the land of Sodom and she'd got all the latest fashions and everything was going so good seemingly for lot and his family since they had left the message that's always the way the devil will do you once he pulls you away from the word he'll convince you that you're so much better off until he gets you moved into Sodom and then when he get once he gets you moved into Sodom you're pretty much a goner so everything wasn't going real good lot had more grass lot had more water lot had more convenience and now a lot was a city man and he was also the judge or the mayor of the city so it seemed like since he left the message everything was going so good but I want you to notice one thing when the Lord God come down to make a special visit on the earth he never visited lot he visited Abraham so for me and my house I'll stay under the Oak in memory I may not have the water I may not have the popularity I may not have this and that and the other but I'd rather stay right here under the oak on half of the occasional visit from almighty God than to wind up being burned up by the sodomites amen but God did not appear to Abram in the same Supernatural way that he appeared to Joshua but yet this was exactly what Abraham needed you know God has has the ability to appear and manifest himself in so many ways I believe he's going to do it right here for us today notice here in verse 33 of the 18th chapter and the Lord went his way now we know that prior to this and the verses prior to this that to the of the two angels they went on toward the land of Sodom and God never went to the cities of Sodom and gomara but the Lord stayed with Abraham and Abraham as a mediator had intervened for lot's sake the only reason that lot was even spared was not because he was a good man not because he was a righteous man but because the man with the Covenant intervened and asked God for Mercy don't give up on your children don't give up on your lost loved ones that's exactly right God may hear your prayer and Spares them not because they're worthy not because they are deserved living but because God was merciful to you but when the Lord had heard Abram's prayer notice in verse 33 and the Lord went his way and as soon as it left communing with Abraham and Abraham returned unto his place but Abraham did not need a strategist to be able to lay out the battles of War because Abraham was not in that type of a battle but what Abraham did need was God that would appear in the form of a man and be able to have communion with Abraham that's what Abraham needed that's what Abraham got notice if you look with me also in Genesis 32 24 that the same Christ now appears to another man by the name of Jacob and Jacob was left alone and the Wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day notice he is not a commander he is not a pillar of Fire he has not allowed a light rather or a cloud but he is a man and he looks so human and he could wrestle he could feel strain on his muscles and no doubt Jacob grabbed a hold of him and he might have put a little bit of herd on him who knows he must have really put up a fight and this time he appears in a weaker similarly seem like form so it was not great light of rays of life is emanating from his body it was not great Shekinah Glory but it looked like an ordinary man and it might have seemed as if though that Jacob was really doing a good job then he kept holding on and holding on and holding on to me what I'll see is the great hand of God in the display of condescension you understand that God would allow himself in this human looking form to seemingly he almost be overcome by a mortal notice in verse 29 and Jacob asked him and said tell me I praise thee thy name and he said wherefore is it that thou just ask after my name and he blessed him there and Jacob called the name of the place to deal for I have seen God face to face my life is preserved so the angel of Jehovah is not a created angel it is not a created being separate from the deity of God but it is actually Jehovah himself in the form of self-manifestation the invisible becomes visible and he reveals himself now there can be no doubt I don't think any Bible reader to know that the angel of the Lord is the Lord himself Exodus 3 7 and the Lord said I have surely seemed the Affliction of my people which are in Egypt and have heard their Cry by reason of their taskmasters God's speaking to Moses for I know their sorrows and I am come down now you know God has appeared in so many different ways and dispensations but it's on the rare occasion that God actually uses these words and said that I have come down now what God had done he had come down and he was going to send Moses so I count Our Generation a very blessed bunch of people since the Lord has come down again now it's not in every generation that God comes down but it is a special time a special significance and remember the last time we spoke on this it was during the time of the Harlot Rahab which was a gentile that the commander of the Lord's host came down it is during the time of the bride's Omega Revival that the Lord himself appears again in the last days I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large until a land flowing with milk and honey unto the plant place of the Canaanites the Hittites the amorites the parasites the highlights and the jebusites notice in chapter 23 verse 20 behold I send an angel before thee now God again speaking to Moses but now this time it's going to be a different manifestation of the same Christ watch this you know the Bible tells us that Moses chose to Bear the reproach of Christ rather than enjoy the pleasures than the treasures that was down in Egypt but the Bible doesn't say that Moses chose to Bear the reproach of Jesus because Jesus was the human body that Christ the amorphe of God lived in but Christ pre-existed Jesus the human part you understand just like you as an attribute of God pre-existed before your natural birth not as a mortal noun not as a soul we don't believe in pre-existence of souls or transmigration of souls but we existed in the mind of God as a thought then from there we come to become tangible on the earth so God came down but now notice what he tells Moses in this verse behold I send an angel before thee to keep thee in the way and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared beware of him and obey his voice provoke him not for he will not pardon your transgressions for my name is in him now notice God telling Moses I have come down to see you I have come into special manifestation to reveal myself to you but I will send my angel my personal Angel what is God's angel a physical manifestation of the invisible God and he calls it mine Angel and he says my name is in him but if Thou shalt indeed obey his voice and do all that I speak and I will be an enemy unto thine enemies and an adversary unto thine adversaries brother sister you can ask for nothing no better than that notice in verse 23 for mine angel now this is going to be the angel of God do you know every elect person on the earth has an angel Jesus says do not harm these little ones for their Angels always behold the face of my father so you have an angel it hung around your mother before you were ever born amen some of y'all looking at me funny now notice he says mine Angels shall go before thee and bring thee and then he repeats again of course all the tribes that he's going to run out before them so this is Jehovah himself and a temporary descent to visibility for a special purpose so we know that the Bible says that God is invisible and we know that the Bible goes on to tell us that Moses saw him who was invisible well that's totally impossible unless God would take on a visible form so we know then that God has done this in previous times notice again in Exodus chapter 3 verse 2. and the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of the Bush and he looked and behold the bush burned with fire but the Bush was not consumed same God different manifestation you know the great thing about it is the elect of God no matter what form God chooses to reveal himself you cannot hide God from the elect but you sure can't hide him from the foolish virgin because they'll look out at him and call him three every time they'll look right at him and not know who he is if you know who he is today you're a very blessed person now even though he will appear in one form and then change his mask and go into another and change his mask and go into another the elect of God have always recognized him so we don't want to put God in a mold and say well last Sunday the service went this way and that way and now we're looking for it to go the same way today nope today we have different needs we're fighting different battles is that right so what do we want today exactly what we need for today and then Wednesday night we want what we need for Wednesday night is that right now what you notice is I found the scripture the other day was down in South Carolina taking some days off resting with our family and I found the scripture I thought it's so beautiful Isaiah 63 8 and he said surely they are my people children that will not lie so he was their savior in all their Affliction he was afflicted and the angel of his presence saved them now notice again this is Christ and it'll see often in appearance and he calls him the angel of his presence in his love and in his pity he redeemed them and bears them and carried them all the days of old so now I went through all that to come back to the time in the dispensation of Joshua so here Joshua is now facing Jericho and he doesn't know which way to go he doesn't know what to do and no Daddy has as an opinion Joshua was a great General as a matter of fact the prophet tells us he was the greatest General that ever lived so he was a great great gender you understand the Napoleon studied part of Joshua's strategy you understand that part of the English Generals in World War one and also World War II that they also studied part of the strategy of Joshua and it was a great great thing but now this would not be a strategy that would really make any human sense because you've got this gigantic City and you've got walls that has an outer wall and an inner wall put both of them together they're 20 feet thick you've got houses that are spreaded across the top of the walls you've got them built out of great gigantic tremendous Stones which they've actually excavated excavated and found some of the stones still there laying in the dirt they've also found ancient Timbers to where that they fell down in the ground so looking at it was just a mind a carnal mind you say how in the world are we ever going to get in this place how are they going to to take this but this commanding officer by whom Joshua was submitted himself to worship now notice it tells you who this was this was not just an angel remember when John had this angel that appeared to him and made known to him the entire Book of Revelation and John fell down to worship the angel and he said see thou do it not I am one of thy fellow servants the prophets remember so had this been just a created angel that created angel would have stopped Joshua from worshiping him but whoever this was allowed Joshua to worship him and not only that he encouraged it so he tells him take your shoes off let me tell you something friend there will be no public victory until there is private worship I don't know about you I don't just worship God publicly before everybody else I don't want to just be a worshiper where I come to the house of God and I worship him I worship him every day of my life every day of my life I worship my king I give him praise for the air I breathe I give him praise for the water that I drank for the food that I have to eat I give him praise for you I give him praise from my friends I even give him praise for the trials today I go through because I know that he's doing it for my good you're saying God must to praise him for you need to open your eyes and look around you have got so much to praise him for oh Hallelujah you see reflecting in the behavior of what Joshua is now fixing to do the commanding officer let him know that I have given Jericho and the king and all of its Mighty soldiers I have already given it to you but now Joshua needs the strategy so what do I do you know all of us is the people of God when we Face different things of life we know that one strategy that maybe worked in this trial doesn't work in that trial I find it amazing looking at the life of the Lord Jesus among the scribes and the Pharisees would come out of time and whenever before the end of his ministry come he would rebuke them I mean he humiliated them he would call them all kinds of sarcastic names that would seem and rebuke them before the people but yet when it come to the time of the crucifixion the Bible says he held his peace and open not his mouth why you know that's really hard for some of us sometimes isn't it because sometimes the Lord will commission us to rebuke the devil and scream at him and holler at him and everything else and then there's other times to where you just hold your peace what is that it's a change of strategy but the thing of it is I'm afraid sometimes that we become so confident in the way we won the last battle or the last war that we signed well I'll just do this and this and this it works lifetime instead of us saying Lord how should I face this one I really don't know I've never been this way before father I don't know what to do should I scream should I holler said I shout or should I hold my peace this round well praise the Lord anybody know what I'm talking about but you see he's showing him the significance of God being able to be in control no matter what the battle is now he says back to Joshua 5 14 as captain of the host of the Lord I am now Khan and Joshua fell on his face to the Earth and in worship and said unto him what saith my Lord to his servant oh my so Israel's host is now accepting the real leader now Joshua of course is the natural Captain but he's putting himself in the perspective of where God wants him to be and Joshua recognizes he's second in command I wonder how many of us have done the same thing or do we still feel like we're number one command we're number one in the battles we're number one in the victories and we're number one in all of that nope the sooner we get to where we realize I can't even walk without you holding my hand that's the better part of the victory now the real character of the person that we're looking at is displayed about receiving and encouraging worship from Joshua so this gives Joshua that consolation to know who he's talking to because if this battle goes wrong then Joshua is going to be a complete failure so he's never seen this being before he's never heard this voice before there's no record that anyone ever appeared to Moses like this we have no record back to the Old Testament that anyone appeared to Abraham like this or Jacob or Isaac so this is the first appearance that God chose to come in this way how is he going to to know that it's God and not a demon oh my how is it going to know that it's the spirit of God and it's not the wrong thing we got a question on that from the use of maybe I'll get to tomorrow night well one thing that we can always know the spirit of God will never lead any of us contrary to his word when people say I feel led to do this and I feel led to do that I don't know who gets blamed the most for a lot of things that folks do God or the devil of course if people say well God led me to do it then if it's wrong of course it ain't your fault it's God's fault are you crazy God don't never make no mistakes and if they say well the devil made me a deal why don't you just go and accept the fact that you've done it yourself well praise the Lord now Joshua he's convinced that this voice this being the representation of what he sees and the voice that's coming from this being harmonizes was what Moses has already said so he feels like I have no choice but to follow this is him this is the commander this is him I will fall and I notice Joshua 6 1 and now Jericho will straightly shut up because of the children of Israel now they ain't even done anything yet and yet the city is all locked down all my other occult here they come and they're coming into our city oh my goodness what in the world is going to do so they figure the best thing to do is just shut her down I've been there before have you all ever been there where they shut you down and the Lord said unto Joshua see I have given into thine hand Jericho and the King thereof and the Mighty Men of Valor and you shall come past the city all you Men of War and go around about the city once and thou shalt do this six days okay so we're going to get up early in the morning and we're all going to go around the city one time for six days we're not going to say anything we're not going to whisper we're not going to talk we're going to go around the city and then go back to our tents and this is the strategy to defeat this place now let me revert back with you now if we were under the ministry of Joshua and it was us that heard this I wonder what some of you would say I wonder if some of y'all would say I'm wondering about brother Joshua I'll tell you one time I mean I have never heard I've been looking for quotes all day I've been looking for some reference that I can I can't find no reference to this that it's ever been done this way before or we shall we can trust this man now friends will sit there and look at me like you all a bunch angels people are the same they're the same then as they are today now they might not have said anything when they walked around the city but can you imagine when they go back to their tent can you believe this Lord have mercy we're learned we are learned I mean there's no hope for us Lord have mercy I never heard such a strategy in my entire life you've got to be kidding me and you were trusting this man to lead us to the promised land now notice in verse 4 and 7 priests shall bear before the ark seven Trumpets on Ram's horns but here they go seven priests and they have the Rams horns and their total mutes so whether they packed it by their side or whether they did like this we don't know but whatever they did the position that they had the horn not one sound came out of the horn it was almost as if God was trying to humiliate his people and make them look like they were a bunch of idiots ever been there and done that oh my on the Sabbath day you shall come past the city seven times and the priest shall blow with the trumpets and it shall come to pass on the make a long bless with the Rams Horn when you shall hear the sound of the trumpet all the people shall Shout with a great shout on the wall of the city shall fall down flat ah gotcha so we trample our feet and we Shout on a 20 foot thick wall is going to collapse you got that you got that you got that boy what about assistant you got that you're good with that it would have took a lot of faith to believe such a thing there was no quotes to refer back to there was no reference in their history oh I remember that yeah that happened before this had never happened before the message preachers that are called and anointed of God are preaching something to their congregations around the world today that has never happened before a mass Exodus of people coming up missing on the earth at one time they are preaching a phenomenal that old people will be setting like this or some of them will be at Walmart some will be at a restaurant some of them will be taken an afternoon Siesta until they eat their lunch and all of a sudden a sweep will come over the Earth and all of them will be changed back to 18 years old in a moment in a twinkling of an eye praise the Lord is there any reference to where this has happened globally before and yet you believe this God bless you me too oh notice verse 6 I'm Joshua the son of none called the priest and said to them take up the Ark of the Covenant let seven priests bear seven trumpets of Ram's horns notice how meticulous God is with his numerics and he said unto the people pass on and can pass the city and let them that his arm pass on before the Ark of the Lord and it came to pass when Joshua had spoken unto the people that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of Ram's horns passed on before the Lord notice this is the seventh day now and blue with the trumpets on the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord followed them so here we have the priests the preachers that are going out first it ain't no wonder the devil's trying to stop the preachers from preaching well praise the Lord but let him try let him do what he wants say let him say what he will God call man ain't never going to stop preaching the gospel um that's right and the armed men went before the priest that blew with the trumpets and the re-reward came out to the ark and the priests going on and blowing the trumpets and Joshua had commanded the people saying ye shall not shout nor make any noise with your voice neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth until the day I bid you shout that sounds like a controlling sort of an individual don't it y'all don't say a word until I tell you to imagine someone going back home oh he's a dominating thing ain't he who know the world as he think he is Joshua second in command that's who he knows he is so the Ark of the Lord come past the city going about it once they came into the camp enlarged praise the lord we got the victory Hallelujah that wasn't even dust fell down from between the mortar on the walls though and nothing happened day one zero results day two zero results day three day four day five day six zero results no sign a victory but the Seed of Abraham count those things that are not as though they are oh praise the Lord notice in verse 12 when Joshua Rose early in the morning the priests took up the Ark of the Lord notice verse 15 and it came to pass in the seventh churches or the seventh day they rose up early about the dawning of the day or as we would say at the rising of the Sun amen and Compass the city out to the same manner seven times only on that day amen only on that day they can pass the city seven times you imagine all them people of their life and and hollering and making fun of them out to the first stage you know they probably was in shock after the verse they said what in the world I ain't never seen nothing like this in my life so they get all their cameras and they go to posting YouTube videos as we'd say and they'll say look this is what's going on over there can you imagine that nothing happened nothing moved no sound they didn't say a word that's a miracle within itself that's some of the biggest long-term men and women ever lived in that group of people and they did not say one word this is part of their Victory following orders praise the Lord how many wants victory how many can follow orders of the world ah mama and it came to pass at the seventh time when the priests blew with the trumpets Joshua said unto the people shall oh so after this theophonic appearance came a shocked a voice and a trumpet Oh Glory I shout a voice and a trumpet all three of these appear remember the prophet said in Rapture all three of these happen when he's when he's when he's just send him praise the Lord Shout for the Lord has given you the city and the city shall be accursed even if all that are therein to the Lord oh Lord rehab have the Harlot shall live so the shout the voice and the trumpet and a gentile bride's name is called during the time of the shout the voice and the trumpet Hallelujah Oh Glory to God can you imagine how unworthy she must have felt that the mighty commander of the army of Israel is calling her name only Rey have the heart it shall live she and all that are with her in the house because she had on a long dress because she let her hair grow out because she quit wearing makeup because she hid The Messengers that we sent you mean her salvation was identified not only with that Court but because she give the true men of God a place of shelter that's not mine anointed and do my prophets no harm stand with God's anointed and when you get in trouble the anointing will stand with you stand again God's anointing and you're sinning against God this is what your Bible says right because she hid The Messengers that we sent so here they are now in day seven verse 20. so the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets and it came to pass when the people heard the sound of the trumpet so the trumpet sounded and there was a response among the people and the people shouted we've been changed we've been changed I'm standing there pulling my hair what a little better had left and it was gray and I was fixing to put my contacts in and I started right toward my album my contacts and all of a sudden I didn't need my contact no more and I got a new body and I got new hair and I got new strength and I got a new revelation we have been changed when the trumpet sounded the people began to shout out Hallelujah the Victory Is Ours [Applause] and the people shouted with a great Shout that the wall fell down flat wow I got this headline for you LSU fans create two Baton Rouge earthquakes and when over Alabama now this is true this happens yes what was it last week when LSU won the ball football right so what it is I trapped you didn't it yeah someone LSU won over Alabama the people started shouting and screaming and hollering and the Earth the earth started shaking can you imagine glory to God when the saints of God started going around that place and Joshua said now now and all of a sudden all around that whole city they started shouting they started worshiping they started praising God you imagine that old land around Jericho oh Hallelujah and the land begin to shake and Tremors went through the earth and the city began to shout around and the Bible sells the walls fell down flat why because the people of God needed a victory in their life [Applause] praise the Lord [Applause] ah praise and listen you know there's some of the excavations that they've done around the city there of Jericho they said it looks like a gigantic earthquake Hallelujah except it was not because that plate shifted under that plate and the great seismic graph of pressure down so and so and so it was simply the trumpets being blowed and they was following the direction of a god-ordained man of God and the saints of God started shouting they didn't shout because they felt like it they didn't shout because they felt more Victory they shouted because they were tall as Shout amen sometimes we need to clap our hands because we're told to clap them we need to say praise the Lord because we're told to clap them who knows your wall may come down who knows that sickness may leave your body amen [Applause] and they utterly destroyed all that was in the city find this amazing all these people living on the wall all these people in the city and it don't sound like hardly any of them died God done his part man wants them to do theirs you all ready look out devil here we come foreign but Joshua had said unto the two men that had spied out the country going to the harlot's house notice he didn't send him into the harlots Rubble they didn't have to send dogs to find her her house had floated down like a feather so here she's built between these two walls and these two walls are coming down crashing but my how in the world did they ever get that elevator underneath her house it's like it's settling down smoother than this Holiday Inn elevator going to first for the floor five and four six and four seven and all of a sudden you know she's saying mama don't worry Daddy don't worry brother don't worry child don't worry they gave me a promise and who them two men were they were two preachers I'll let you think on that what says the prophet said a lot to make mention of one woman here that I think of in the Bible she was bad to begin with rotten young beautiful woman by the name of Rahab she was a heathen a prostitute she heard there was a God not an idol that set down with the Declaration of Creeds but a God who lived among his people and anointed them with signs and wonders following let's think she was raised in a home that was real poor she become ill-famed she's a beautiful young woman she went into the streets to make her crippled mother and father a living no way to work only sell the morals of her body but I can imagine all the time she knew that was wrong there was something in her that told her glory to God this is not right and she knew it wasn't right but one day she heard there was a God moving and her heart began to tremble Oh Glory aren't you glad you can relate to the same experience notice this it goes on to say but all of a sudden a little preacher enters the city and said there's a God that lives Oh my he lived yesterday and he's the same yesterday today and forever he does the same works and when he did he was here on Earth his agents on the road now Rahab the Harlot was known as a hornet she was a type of the believer today the real believer she didn't say now if I can see Joshua do science because he's the successor of Moses and if I could see those signs I'll believe it he didn't have to absolutely show no signs at all because she believed it anyhow right have the heart we're all familiar with her young girl turned out on the street thy Heathen father and mother she was put there to bring an income to them from prostitution yet down in that immoral girl she had heard there was a god who answered prayer what was done in her well believe it or not same thing that was done inside of you and yours drinking smoking running around lying committing adultery doing all kinds of things what was it the dispersal of the seed of God notice verse 23 I'm the young man that were spies went in and brought out Rahab and their father and her mother and her Brethren and all that she had and they brought out all her kindred and left them without the camp of Israel and Joshua yahshua you remember what Jesus means in the New Testament Jehovah savior same thing Joshua means in the Hebrew of the Old Testament and Joshua saved Rahab the heart hell alive and her father's household and all that she had and she dwelleth in Israel even unto this day because she hid The Messengers now what I find amazing is she had already died by the time this was written but she still lived in Israel why it's part of who they were why is this story mean so much to us believe it or not it's still alive among us today while we can see our own lives portraying this one thing that I've noticed in this last time as I've been going through these five women in the lineage of the Lord Jesus typifying the church and the reconciliation of the Bride I found just in looking that have come to recognition to see that God wrote the life stories of these women into the very types of being the bride it's come from the back bad bad bad bad bad bad background from a very terrible situation prostitution whoredom all kinds of saying why God was writing the Kaleidoscope of who his people would be some of them would come from the dark regions of Africa others would come from the dark regions of the Church of God others would come from the dark regions of The Madness of the dark reasons of the Church of Christ and them's really dark regions but yet God would shine upon them and the predestinated seed would jump to Life One Day by the word and they would recognize who they are [Applause] let me close the prophet says it this way and why little Bethlehem and when she got the first message speaking about Rahab from them two preachers huh wow now wait a minute I thought brother Graham said that they were tape boys one and the same so the true tape boys are preachers either that or you got the prophet saying two different things which makes him a liar now you do what you want to it he said right here are the two preachers and then he said she had the tape boys so real true preachers are tape boys why they say what's the type say well praise the lord they're saying what the tapes say brother Branham did not say play what the tapes play but say what the tapes say come on now let's say it if we believe it say what the tapes say you can't say it if you don't open your mouth [Applause] so she got the message first from them two preachers that went over and quick because she accepted both all of her heart there was a scarlet cord bound at her wind I forgot my scarlet cord this morning because the last time I preached it brother Joel Brown wanted to you have it notice a scarlet cord bound at her window for a protection I'm so glad my hope it's not in a red wave let the Republicans is going to take over everything and they're going to make everything better well I imagine some of you are so sad my hope is not in politics I read it just this morning I knew news flies from Yahoo that said because the Democrats now have control of the Senate they will now be able to appoint more liberal judges and more liberal this and liberal that'll throw you out just exactly no doubt what they're supposed to do I'm not sure what you've done before the election but I prayed and prayed and prayed and said Lord whoever needs to be in there to bring the consummation the Rapture Let It Be come on children I'm not interested in a red wave today I'm interested in the red blood of the Lord Jesus Christ I'm not tied to a Republican party or a Democrat Party I've got my cord hanging out my window I want to be protected from laodicea oh the prophet said God look down when the rash fell and the trumpets began to blow God seemed the scarlet cord hanging there as a memorial it's always pleasing to pass over the blood when I see the blood I'll pass over you when the shaking and the Holy Spirit rumbled the Earth shook down them walls some 20 feet thick not one rock fell where that Court shows the protection of a true God to a True Believer you say A True Believer can look at life in battles this way it tricks the will of God for me to be going through a tremendous trial and battle and test so sickness maybe disease has struck her body you're just as safe in that trial as you would be out of it with all the skies blue and the sunlight coming around you why you're in the will of God as a matter of fact one of our great generals who followed the type of Joshua said he was just as safe on the battlefield as he was at home in his bed a listen boy I could understand that this day and time you know you ain't safe nowhere are you but can you imagine bullets flying by you your enemy looking nice you got their scope on you washing for you but you're just as safe if that's the will of God for you is if you are in your home head down in your basement somewhere let me just tell you if it's the will of God for you to go through a test go through a trial go through a sickness or a disease and God will bring you out on the other side you're just as safe in that trial but you say brother Donnie it's a tumor it's this out of the other but the hand of God if it's the hand of God that has allowed you to be that don't you know the hand of God will bring you out on the other side you're just as safe as long as you're in God's will praise the Lord praise the Lord and we know that Rahab marries one of these spies according to the Jewish tradition and the law of what they say whose name was cell Moon who became the founder of of the place called Beth aleham the house of God's bread to what a gentile whose past was horrible no doubt she remembered and reminisced just like some of us have done of our failures and our shortcomings before God but you know what it proves to me we do not have to be ruled by our past and the dictates of those things which are behind us don't never my friends underestimate the power of Amazing Grace who would have ever thought God could have taken a woman like this a woman like Tamar a woman like Bathsheba and be able to interwove them in the very human genealogy of our Lord Jesus if you understood the writings of the genealogies you know that when a woman was a foul woman they would not even allow her name to be written associated with a clean man if her father was a righteous man her name was not absolutely forbidden to be wrote in connection with him because her reproach would bang shame upon his name you don't see what the grace of God is when you read the book of Matthew in the Book of Luke when you read the name Tamar you read the name of ruse or Hallelujah and Rahab and in Matthew he doesn't even record the name Bathsheba but her which was the wife of Uriah you don't realize what Grace you're reading because according to their genealogy they should not even be identified in the records of the law but the grace of God reached down to them not only put them in the records of the law but allowed them to be written in the genealogy of the Lord Jesus himself I don't know about you there's a few folks in my family I wouldn't want you all to look up you think my face has seen a lot on on YouTube well there's a few folks in my family oh I know I'm sure the only one that's got them everyone else got Angels the rest your family right oh I see you see in my family's bank robbers and liars and all that sort of thing they chummed up at some of your family oh but the grace of God reached to us beyond our DNA our maternal side our paternal side and reach to the seed of God which was down in our oh Jesus how we thank you today for your mercy we thank you for your grace to us father oh what a great great thing you have down down Through the Ages we love you today Father we know it's the slowly unfolded mystery of God sometimes it was written right out plain where people would be able to see it other times it was hidden and the lives of people that were very unlikely candidates to receive such Glory which of us would have ever picked a woman like Tamar to address as a prostitute to Allure her father-in-law into an illicit relationship but she didn't do it for The Thirst of lust had it not been for her the seed of Judah would have died there was not another alive to carry on or as it went on in time the only genealogy left would come to her so we find that the very human genealogy of our Lord Jesus when God pronounced there will be none of this side of David of this particular son's reign none of them shall ever set on the throne again and yet the line is the line of the tribe of Judah I'm not sure if they understand Lord both Joseph and Mary are from David it would have been a failure through the one side but you always have a safety net an absolute that will prevent Satan from stopping your plan Lord I love you today I'm so thankful for sovereignty we would have messed up so many times we would have totally ruined the program of God but whenever we mess up so bad you reserve that little space of sovereignty where you can step in and say get out of the way let me fix your mess thank you Lord God thank you Lord God we love you Jesus but any of us have ever chose Ruth would have any of us ever chose Rahab Bathsheba through that Union yet Lord God he was projecting salvation grace and mercy in the Old Testament written thousands of years ago thank you Lord Jesus and now here we are we have people in our assembly who believe this word had come for the background from Rahab some of the background like Ruth some of the background like Tamar Canaanites heathens idolaters but Lord God today saved by the grace of God saved by your mercy Lord hallelujah hallelujah and we are so saved that we are the crowning success of calvary as they were the crowning success of the Old Testament Matthew wrote of one genealogy Luke wrote of the other bringing most of them together and the human embodiment of Our Lord it was the Fulfillment and the protection of the Lion of the tribe of Judah Lord God today we are your she brought and your word is written in our lives is your name is written in our hearts Lord God we bring our needs before you today Father I know we got a lot of things going on a lot of sickness viruses all kinds of different things Lord I pray you'd move among the people father some fat and Terrible Things some with very very serious things going on in their lives Lord Jesus help us to be patient and wait on you help us to know sometimes you want us to shout other times you want us to listen sometimes you want us to March and say not a word day one day two day three up to day six and then on day seven we go to heaven a Time Hallelujah help us to be sensitive to your leadership Lord Jesus help me as the leader of your people father that I can be sensitive to following your presence Lord o Lamb of God teach me how to fight teach me Lord God I said battle changes from one scenario to another from one Battlefield to another teach me may I always be able to be taught Lord may I always be able to learn father there are times that we cry all out and spare not and then there's times that we hold our peace and let you fight for us it's so hard for us sometimes or we don't know which way to go we don't know what to do but help us great champion of the host we bring ourselves before you today is Joshua of old and we say speak my Lord tell me what you want me to do Hallelujah Hallelujah and but he's facing a battle today maybe a test you need some direction you need some answer to prayer in your life some leadership of the Lord just just raise your hand to him now not to me of course but to him Lord I need help I need to know which way to go how do I do this how do I do that Lord I don't know help me father father we agree together right now in the name of the Lord Jesus we believe we've heard them preachers too praise the Lord they come up telling us he ain't dead but he's alive he's the same yesterday today and forever he still heals the sick saves the loss baptize us with the Holy Ghost oh Jesus we bless your name today Father We Worship You Lord we want to

way right out of that Valley Oh Glory to God lord Jesus we worship you today Father we want to be like Joshua we want to worship you while the walls are still standing we don't want to be the type of

and that going on we're going to go ahead and praise you like the walls are laying flat down and we're already set free because with the Seed of Abraham we speak with prophetic understanding calling
