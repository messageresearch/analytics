And today is another day, Lord, for you to mold us and shape us. pray you'd help us forgive us of any things that's in that's besetting us, Lord, and just help us to lay aside all the thoughts and cares of this time of season where everybody's hustling and bustling.

[applause] &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; When the Lord called Moses, [music] he thought [singing] he wasn't able. &gt;&gt; My God came through. &gt;&gt; [music and singing] &gt;&gt; In faith, he went to Egypt.

Think of this. $1 million is 11 days of seconds. $1 billion is 32 years of seconds. And that won't touch it. Billions upon billions. It's so valuable to him &gt;&gt; that you're sitting here this morning. &gt;&gt; G. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Give our king a praise offering, would you? [applause] I'm going to sing one song &gt;&gt; and I wouldn't sing that if he wouldn't leave me alone &gt;&gt; cuz I've got a lot to say today. [applause] You can be seated. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; one song and then I'm going to get to preaching cuz I got some good stuff y'all. Y'all probably know this in uh it's an older song [music] but it'll go with what I want to say today. Try see from strength to strength. [music] We sometimes [singing] go, but then again, we're [music] sinking low in the shadow of the mountain, looming high [music] above our heads. We need not fear [music and singing] what lies ahead. For the [singing] word has clearly said that our faith [music] would be sufficient to make [singing] the mountain deappear. [singing and music] Speak to the mountain. Do not [music and singing] triumph over me. [music] Be thou [singing] removed. From here to yonder, [music] disappear into [singing] the sea. Speak to the mountain. Oh, [music] speak with authority [music and singing] and the mountain [singing] [music] will move and you shall claim victory. [music] In the midst [music] of the battle when the [singing] foe is gaining ground, [music] blue look up. See the mighty hand of [music] God [singing] just reaching down. Oh, [music and singing] speak God's name. Satan trembles. Speak [music] his [singing] word and watch him flee. Oh, [music] once again, our God delivers [music] the mountain and your feet. [singing] Speak [music] to the mountain. You're not trying [music] over me. Be thou removed [music] from here to [singing] yonder. Disappear into the sea. [singing] Speak [music] to the mountain. Oh, speak with [music and singing] authority and the mountain [singing] and you shall claim me to re speak to the mountain. [music] You're not trying over me. [music] Be thou [singing] removed from here yonder. [music] Disappear into the sea. Speak [music] to the mountain. [singing] Oh, speak with the glory. [singing and music] And the mountain [music] will move and you shall claim victory [singing] [music] and that mountain [singing] will move [music] and you shall claim me to reach. &gt;&gt; [singing] [music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Can we sing this old one that we like so well? Out on the water, storms [singing] raging high. The waters around them [singing and music] were troubled that night. Fear filled their hearts. [music] They thought they would die, but they failed [music] to remember that the master [singing] was nine. Oh, he [music] spoke the words and the winds all stood still. [music] Even the waters they oyed his will. He calmed their storms [music] like he will yours and mine if I'll just remember. He lives inside. [music] So why should we wary? Oh why should we fear? Very saint [music] Jesus stays so [singing] near. He lives in my heart [music] and he hears me [singing] when I cry. I'm going to call [music] on his name till the storm passes by. [music] We read [singing] in the Bible where he [music] walked within he brought light to the darkness when the way [music] seems so dim. Oh, but how great it would be have his footsteps in mine. [music] Walk with the master [singing] all the time. And when trials come [music] and [singing] see, oh, let's call on the master, he'll be there on time. [music] And when [singing] sickness comes and our body heals in [music] pain, all we got to do is call on his name. [music] So why should we wear church? Why should we fear when the very [music] same Jesus said he stays always dear? [singing] He lives in my heart. And he hears me when I [singing and music] cry. Let's call on his name when [music] the storm passes [singing] by. [music] I said I read in that old Bible how he walked with him. He brought light to the darkness when the [music] way seemed so dim. How [singing] great it would be to have his footsteps in mind, [singing and music] to walk with the master all the time. [music and singing] And when trials come [singing and music] and it seems so nice, call on the master. He'll be there [singing] on time. [music] When sickness comes and [music] your body heals [singing] in pain, church, all you got to do is call on his name. So why should we wear? [music] Why should we fear [singing] when the very same Jesus stays [music] so near? He lives in my arms [singing] and he [music] hears me when I cry. Call on his name till the stor passes by. Why should we wary? [music] Why should I fear? Very same Jesus said he stays so near. lives in my heart and he [music] hears [singing] me when I cry. I'll call on his name [music] till the storm passes by. [singing] [music] I'm going to call on his name. [music] Church, let's call on his name. Let's call on his name [singing] [music] till the storm passes by. Oh, it's so good to be in church today. &gt;&gt; We're so grateful to be to be able to stand here today before the body of Jesus Christ. Appreciate you making your way out to the service today. Don't worry, I'm not going to say all this so y'all can see my notes. When they on them iPads, you don't know how much they got. I've prayed and prayed and prayed this week and this is what he gave me. I have preached half of this at my church. The rest I just got Thursday and Friday and last night. So, hi for this I have not even spoke. Hi, for this I have. But I want to look at a subject today. Let's stand together just for a moment. Could we sing the course again? I'm going to make it. And G G as we get ready because he's already said I could. Oh, I'm going to make it. [music] He's already said that I would. [music] I'll keep on trusting. Oh, that he's working [music] everything for my good. He [music] walks beside [singing] me. [music] Heaven. [singing] [music] Oh, hallelujah. [singing] Hallelujah. [music] Despite of myself, I'm going to make it. Oh. [singing] [music] [singing] Oh, yes I am. [music] M [music and singing] I'm going to keep on trusting all that he's working [music] everything for my good [singing] and he [music] walks beside me. [singing] He arms in my view. [music] I know I'm going to make [music] it through and the church can say &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, give him a hand clap of praise now. [applause] Hallelujah. Heavenly Father, what a critical hour we're standing in today. Oh, but what a glorious hour. The world's not falling apart. She's fell apart. We hear the prophet say these things many times. Flesh and red light of his coming. The God of this evil age. So many messages, Father, that he's be to speak. and now the fulfillment of all those great things that were said here before us today. But Lord, we're not worried about it because we're in you today. We're in Christ and Christ is in us. And we're so thankful for that. I pray, Father, that you would help me to say the right words today. Shut my mouth, Lord, when it needs to be shut. May every ear be open to hear because I believe with all my heart what a powerful subject that this is today. If we've sinned or failed you or any thoughts that's not right, forgive us, Lord. If we've said anything that's not right, forgive us. There's anything within these walls and this roof and this floor of this service today that would hinder the spirit of God, we ask for mercy and grace. We love you and we thank you for each one that's made their way. The musicians, the singers, every person. We're grateful for it today. Now bless your word and open it to our hearts. We ask these things in thy precious name. Amen. And amen. We start the service today. My subject title would be listen very carefully to the words. My subject title would be the power of kingdom life. Listen very carefully. The power of kingdom life. I preach constantly on the kingdom because that's the only thing that's going to be left cuz everything is going to fail but the kingdom. &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; I want you to turn to Psalms 81 for me. But in the meantime, I'm going to quote a scripture. Genesis 1:26. We know that he's creating everything upon the earth. The first six days, we find him creating man. We find him taking his rest. We he tells us in in Genesis 1:26 to have dominionship. Let them have dominion over everything, the land, the sea, everything. That's the way it was created. &gt;&gt; We find out that God owns the earth. I'll let you be seated in just a moment. Just bear with me, please. God owns the earth. He says, "I'm in the heavens." He said, "Adam, I want you to have dominion over this earth." In other words, he's telling Adam, "I want you to run it." &gt;&gt; Now, if I say things today that maybe seem out of the way, don't toss me out yet. &gt;&gt; Just please hear me out &gt;&gt; because I look at the scriptures and I look deeper into them than I used to. So he tells Adam, "I want you. I own it, but I'm going to let you run it." &gt;&gt; We understand sin comes in, takes Adam out of his position. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; So somehow he's got to get the people back to their position. That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, we know if we jump down the road thousands of years, we find Calvary comes, we find the resurrection, the third day. Now, he's on the road to restore, to renew, to refresh, to bring a reborn back upon the earth. We find out when Jesus was on the earth one time, just please bear with me. I was going to make this a one service, but I can't do that. And then he added all this to me last night. So, I'm going to have to see if I can get a part two down the road. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; He starts his work and I want you to remember how Jesus comes and Jesus makes the statement says you must be born with water and spirit. You remember that? And the Bible says Jesus breathes on them and says receive ye the Holy Ghost. You remember that he didn't say here take the Holy Ghost. He didn't say he didn't say he said receive. Notice the word receive because it's very very striking in this this word. He sith unto them receive ye the Holy Spirit is what he actually says. The word see c i v actually means to have or to possess. The word see c i ve means to possess. The prefix of re actually means again. So he's telling them again. Why? Because one time they had it. In the mind of God, we had it. &gt;&gt; Sin cometh throwed us out. He says, "But sooner or later, one day, I'll bring you back." Amen. &gt;&gt; So if Adam had dominionship in the garden, then the body of Christ today must have dominionship. &gt;&gt; If the church of Jesus Christ does not come back and receive dominion, you'll not go in a rapture &gt;&gt; because you got to overcome this. &gt;&gt; You've got to be able to speak to the mountain or speak to this your need, whatever you need. What are you doing? He's placing dominion back on the earth where it's supposed to be. So in other words, he says, I want you to take possession of the Holy Ghost again. Hallelujah. I want you to take possession of it again because they had it. Now, let me allow me to say this and I'm going to read Psalms 8. Jesus was born during a Roman Empire. Actually, the Roman Empire was the closest setting of the way the kingdom of God would actually run. There's a reason that he was born at this time. The Roman Empire would actually begin to expand their territory and they usually would bring people in from exile if you look the history up and see it. But in this case, they didn't do that. They would conquer you and allow you to live. Listen now. They would conquer you this community, this city of this part of this town of this country. And they would allow you to live in your native land. But here's what they would do. Oh my. I had one of those shouting hissy fits last night on this. But what they would do was actually let you live in your native land, but they would send a colony of Romans to colonize you [sighs] with the Roman culture. So they wanted you to forget your history and they wanted to teach you new history, which is the very same thing that's going on now. Just bear with me. It's okay. It's all right to get out of your box every now and then. &gt;&gt; So, in the the most powerful person that would be in this colony would be what we would call today the governor. Oh my. He would actually re-educate the people away from their old pway into a new kingdom that they had set up the Roman Empire. Oh my. But now when you come to Jesus, let's call him the governor. What's his desire? To break your old habits. He wants to set you up in this new kingdom. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He wants to set you up in this kingdom. I preach hundreds of services on the kingdom. I just can't get away from it. So now as you're saved and you get born again, you're now in the new kingdom. So you can't accomplish any listen very carefully. You cannot accomplish everything God wants in the new kingdom when you got your head stuck in the old kingdom. &gt;&gt; I can't accomplish what God wants me to accomplish here with my mind [screaming] in the old kingdom. So our governor, our Lord, our Savior, our deliverer, he now is re-educating us. &gt;&gt; It started when a prophet came on the scene. &gt;&gt; Now he's placed men of God around the world to bring [screaming] a re-education that will pull us from this kingdom that we actually live in and place our mindset in the other kingdom. Why? Because [screaming] in that kingdom there's power. In that kingdom there's power. In that there's a kingdom. Oh, glory to God. In that kingdom there's a life. [screaming] &gt;&gt; So the spirit is the governor of the kingdom. So he has power to execute God's way of life in this difficult and evil kingdom. Paul says, "I beseech you therefore by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is a reasonable service." So he's basically Paul was passionately saying and urging them to listen. And look what he says then. And be not conformed to this world, but you be you transformed by the renewing of your mind. This is just extra. Just hold on. This is you ain't got to pay for this. This is extra. This ain't even my message, but it tied in. So, I got to have it that you may prove what is good and acceptable and perfect will of God. So, now the imagery, let your mind's going. I'm fixing to read Psalms 8:1. The imagery that Paul is placing is a is a potter [screaming] with his wheel and he's on the wheel is some clay and he's molding and conforming this this this potter into what he wants it to be. He's shaping he's forming. So the [screaming] world is trying to conform me. The world is trying to conform you every day of your life. He's the world is trying to conform and shape you into their [screaming] image. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Social media, YouTube, news outlets, politicians, entertainment, music, books. Why? Because we're in [screaming] the age of an information age. [snorts] Everything is information. Continually information 24 hours a day. Back in the old days, we didn't have a television back then. We never we never had that. But I would spend a night out with people that they would have television and [screaming] at 11:00 it'd be just lines. Don't act like y'all don't remember that. But now [screaming] every second of the day is something of information. So he says, "Don't let the [screaming] world don't let it form you into their image. &gt;&gt; Let God [screaming] conform you, your mind, into the new kingdom age [snorts] where there's life." [sighs] &gt;&gt; And then Paul said, "Be you transformed by the renewing of your mind." In other words, he says, "Changed our brain." Brother Bram says, "A metapomorphosis by a r." There's that prefix again, renew. Why? Because you've been there before. You've had that before. Your mind's been that way before. And the word prove there means, notice what he says when Paul says that you be transformed. That you may prove. The word prove there actually means that you may allow that you may allow the will of God. [panting] So he's trying to put you back in the kingdom life. Psalms 8:1. Then I want you can be seated. To the chief musician upon Gillith, a psalm of David. Oh Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth who has set thy glory. Now listen carefully. I'm going to make a few statements on the glory. I'm asking you please don't turn me off. [sighs] Let me explain this. How excellent is thy name in all the earth, who has set thy glory above the heavens. Out of thy mouth of babes and sucklings, hast thou ordained strength because of thine enemies, that thou mightest steal the enemy and avenger. When I consider the heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars which thou hast ordained? What is man? Now watching me changes to man. What is man that thou art mindful of man of him? The son of man that thou visitest him for thou hath made him a little lower than the angels. You can be seated. [sighs and gasps] Listen carefully to me today. I won't hold you long. I know I'm not going to finish. I'll find a place to stop to start another day maybe if I'm invited back after today. For thou hath made him a little lower than the angels. Wow, this is so striking. that thou hast made him, he's speaking of man, a little lower than the angels. So if we have lost something, then it would be our job to go back and get it. Right? If you look in the scriptures, you'll find that Jesus spoke on parables continually. Most of all his parables is speaking of the kingdom. The kingdom is a very important thing, friends. Without the kingdom, there'll be no there'll be no rapture. There'll be no heaven. There'll be nothing because it's the only thing that matters. You'll find he talks of the coin, the sheep, the sun. Many things he spoke in parables. But I believe there's something in all of these scriptures that is missing. Have we been speaking on it? I want to look at the word glory for a second and I want to bring that glory back to the church. Notice in verse five, he says, "Thou hast made him a little lower than the angels." Now, I personally wouldn't want the task to interpret the scriptures and put it in all the different languages. What a great task that is. They would have to go around the world continually all over the world and they'd have to learn different languages. Think of this now. They would have to go to the bush to the I mean regions that man don't even live. They'd have to go everywhere, Africa, and they'd learn all of these different languages in order to place the scriptures in another language. But in fact, it's just the facts of it. It's the truth. in these different languages and in these different translations here and there things get left out. There's times that they'll put different words in to make it basically say close to the same thing, but yet really doesn't mean exactly. The scripture here in verse 5 says he made them a little lower than the angels. The translators actually dumbed that down. That's not what it really is. Yeah, this is good. Listen, because if you think about if you would indicate in this passage of scripture as David is saying it, this passage of scripture is so powerful and so great. But if we could take it in the literal form, it would be too much for people. Well, John, it would be too much. I don't know how many people could really handle it. So, the translators dumbed it down, if I could use that terminology, to make it say angels. That's not the original word in in the original. It's actually why the church is in the condition that she's in today. And I mean church in general. So the word there is angels. Actually it the original translation of that is Elohim. So in other words it would say for thou hath made him a little lower than Elohim. &gt;&gt; Very different. But now, what would people think if back then they would read this and David would say this and they would read it and they say, "You're just you're just a you're just a sh you're just a tad lower than God." Oh my god. They'd probably hang you. So, they have to dumb it down. They want to make it close, but we can't go awful close. I've always heard close only works in horseshoes. You've got to be right or not. &gt;&gt; So they would say, you know, [screaming] why thou hast made him a little lower than Elohim, God. Also it means the mighty one also it means to be godlike. &gt;&gt; Now this is what we've got to be in the new kingdom. Oh my, you talking about a powerhouse. Now, God did not make you lower than the angels. In fact, according to the prophet of God for this age, you have [screaming] the ability to command the angels. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; So, if you're able to command the angels, how [screaming] are you lower than the angels? A lot of people talk to me and they tell me, [clears throat] "Why? Why? Why do you why do you why do you get so deep in these words? It really doesn't matter." Oh, yes it does. &gt;&gt; Because I'm not preaching to a church world. &gt;&gt; I'm preaching to somebody that's going to be the kingdom. Amen. &gt;&gt; The church world will never be the kingdom that I'm talking about. They'll be [screaming] a part of that kingdom, no doubt. [sighs] &gt;&gt; So, I have the ability to command the angels. There's no way he made me lower than the one that I have authority over. That's right. &gt;&gt; There's no way, brother Jackie, that I have the ability to command an angel, but yet I'm lower than him. That doesn't even make sense. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; So, I have the ability to command them. I have the ability to have authority over them. So, this verse of scripture actually says, "I made you lower than God himself. &gt;&gt; God is here. You're here. &gt;&gt; The angels is here. &gt;&gt; Now, when you dumb that down, you say, "Well, we're a little lower than the angels." Now, the church world teaches this. You're made lower than the angels. You'll never become in the dominionship that God wants you to become in lower than the angels. &gt;&gt; Now, you just give me the day. I lose my voice all the time. Just give me today. So, you mean to tell me, preacher, that I'm I'm up there? Why does the scripture say you're almost equal with God? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Who thought it was not [screaming] robbery to be equal with him? [sighs] [panting] &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; See what see word of life what we have actually got away from. &gt;&gt; We have actually got away from what the original scripture says. &gt;&gt; That's why I believe we should seek him. his wisdom. [sighs] &gt;&gt; The Bible teaches here is to him that has wisdom. Remember the Bible teaches us and the prophet of God did when he made you, he made his kind. &gt;&gt; The angels is not his kind. [snorts] &gt;&gt; You're his kind. &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; Now, this is very important. Listen carefully. There are 2,251 hits on this. And every one of them, every one of 2,251 hits leads back to Elohim, God himself, the mighty one. So now let me ask you a question. This is where y'all may want to throw me out. And [snorts] that's fine. I'll still love y'all. [laughter] Notice verse six. For thou, let's finish verse five. And hath crowned him. Thou madeth him a little lower than the angels, which the word there is Elohim, God himself, and hath crowned him. Now, who's he talking about? Who did he who David is talking about, man? What is man? &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; And then David picks it up and says, "And hath crowned him with glory." You mean to tell me that the body of Christ is supposed to have some glory? Oh, come on. &gt;&gt; So, he crowned me. He crowned you with a portion of glory. Oh, but Tim, you can't do that. You're blaspheing. You're going to take away from God. &gt;&gt; You you you can't say that, Tim. You can't do that. I can leave now if y'all want me to. I don't care what anybody says. I don't care what any message preacher says. It doesn't matter. God crowned [screaming] him with glory. &gt;&gt; But when sin steps in the garden, I lose my dominion. Adam lost [screaming] his dominionship and Adam lost his glory. Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, but I hear brother Brandham say that God will share his [screaming] glory with no one. Well, why don't you read the rest of them? &gt;&gt; Why don't we read one quote and we stay with that? What you going to do the other five or six? &gt;&gt; Huh? So, so I lost my glory. [sighs] &gt;&gt; Y'all lost y'all's glory. &gt;&gt; Adam lost his glory. Is that right? &gt;&gt; So, you mean God wants me to have glory? &gt;&gt; Verse six says, "Thou madeth him, man, [screaming] to have dominion over the works of thy hands. Thou hast put all things under his feet." So you mean to tell me I have dominion? Who? Me? Now if I don't want to use it, that's not God's fault. &gt;&gt; If we want to stay in the same boat and row in the boat with everybody else, [screaming] that's not God's fault. [sighs] &gt;&gt; Don't take me wrong here. Please don't take me wrong. [sighs] You promise you're not going to take me wrong. &gt;&gt; I want to hear everybody. You promise you're not going to take me wrong. [sighs] &gt;&gt; I don't know how to ask this question because it's so awkward asking this question because people don't understand it. No, God owns it, but I want you to rule it. &gt;&gt; God owns it, but I want you, brother Robert, to run it. &gt;&gt; Now, that puts God in control of everything. &gt;&gt; Is it? Do you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Then why do we always make a statement? I'm just scared to say it, Janet. I don't know what to do &gt;&gt; because I don't have a lot of people in my church and they looked at me so bugeyed they didn't know what to think. And I don't really want to look at no 500 bug eyes. But I will Why do we say all the time God's got listen before you don't don't say nothing. We say all the time, God has [screaming] everything in control. &gt;&gt; Just think now, just think. Here's the way I look at that. If he owns it and he told me to run it, then who's supposed to have it in control? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You want me to continue? You want me to leave? All right. &gt;&gt; Cuz I don't want to say nothing that brother Donniey's got to call me and chew me out. &gt;&gt; Because if I look at this thing right, if God, we know he we know, brother Robert, he has it in control. We We're not We're not We're not stupid, &gt;&gt; and I don't like to use that word on the pull pit, but I'm just being honest with you today. We know that he has it in control. We know that he allowed Adam to run the earth. But then sin comes and it took his glory. It took his honor. It took his dominionship. Now God, that's why brother Bam said that Satan is the God of this evil age. &gt;&gt; So now, who's got this world in control? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Brother B tells us all the time, God allows this. God allows this. God allows this. Now, we all know, brother John, that God I if God actually had it in control, he owns it. Please listen to me. &gt;&gt; I know he owns it. I know it's all in his hands. But I'm just persuaded to believe if God had it in his control, he'd fix this bunch of mess that we in. &gt;&gt; But he says, "I want y'all to run it." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I want y'all to run it. Are you with me this far? &gt;&gt; God's over everything. We know he owns the universe. We under that. But let's read read it for what it says. Now watch this. I believe this is what brother Brham was trying to get us to understand and trying to see because if I read my Bible right, the Bible said that God was in ownership. The Bible says the Lord, the earth is the Lord's and all the fullness thereof. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Now, let me ask you a question. Have you ever rented anything? Have you ever leased anything? [sighs] In a lease, you don't own it. &gt;&gt; In a rent, you don't own it. &gt;&gt; There's another owner. But let me ask you a question. If you're renting your house or you're you're leasing your house, tell me who's in charge of it. As long as you're leasing it, you're in charge of it. As long as you paying that monthly bill, [screaming] you're in charge of that land. &gt;&gt; So now, let me set the record straight. Man is in dominion. [laughter] God is not in control of the earth, but he's in ownership. &gt;&gt; I told you I look at the scriptures a little bit different. God is in ownership. Now, I know that troublesome people. But let me ask you this question. If God was in control like most of the world and most people think, I think he could have his place fixed in about one second. I'm not trying to take anything away from God. I'm placing the scriptures where they're supposed to be placed. I believe the whole thing is in his hand. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Notice verse five. Hath crowned him with glory and honor. Actually glory means has means has surrounded him or hath bestowed [screaming] glory upon him. The word honor means to adorn with. In other words, there has been a glory placed on you to glorify God. It's not you doing it, it's God using you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's nothing in us that wants to glorify God. That's why we become born again. Then everything that's in me wants to give God glory. We come here today to [screaming] give God glory. You didn't come to give man glory. We didn't come just to give musicians glory. We come to give God glory. Why? [screaming] He's the ownership. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; But if we don't take our glory back, if we don't take our honor back, if we don't take our dominionship back, what's going to happen? [sighs] [panting] The word adorn is the same word that's used in the scriptures for a woman to adorn herself in the right apparel. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; So in other words, you put upon yourself, you adorn yourself with the right word, which is the clothing of God. Same thing there as God crowns and honors. Think of it, he he crowns and honors upon you. Brother Brown said he would go to Calvary for one person. &gt;&gt; So tell me you're not valuable. &gt;&gt; Tell me you're not you're not important. &gt;&gt; The word honor here is also a glory that is placed upon you. Now watch David. He goes straight into the sixth verse and brings dominion in. Thou hath [screaming] madeth him to have dominion. Oh my. So there's more to it than me just living upon this earth and letting the devil whoop me real good every day of my life. &gt;&gt; Thou hath notice thou madeth him man to have dominion over the works of thy hands. Listen, keep in mind the works of thy hands. Thou [screaming] ma thou hast put all things under his feet. Not Christ's feet, your feet. &gt;&gt; They ain't [screaming] one sick person and one problem should leave here today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; After this kind of subject there, there should be much power upon the kingdom life. So who has dominion? I'm asking y'all can speak now. I'm asking y'all the question. Who has dominion? &gt;&gt; That's about five people out of 500. What about the other 490? What y'all got? &gt;&gt; Who has dominion? &gt;&gt; We do. &gt;&gt; That's about 15. Maybe if I go on a few more minutes on it, maybe all of y'all have dominion. Do you understand what God has given you? &gt;&gt; Let me ask you a question this way then. When a storm takes and hits a tornado, the Helen come through Irwin as I looked at it when I come down through this morning. Let me ask you a question. Did God do that? &gt;&gt; He allowed it. Did God send ISIS out there to do kill three almost 3,000 people in 2001? &gt;&gt; He allows it, but he didn't do it. &gt;&gt; The Bible tells me in Romans 8:22 that it tells me that this earth is subject to toils and groanings and travailing. Why? It's wanting a new body. And the only way this earth is going to get a new body, [screaming] a new house, a new habitation is for you &gt;&gt; to realize you have dominionship. To realize [screaming] there's a glory that's supposed to be placed upon you. &gt;&gt; Quit thinking you're taking something from [screaming] God. &gt;&gt; That's the problem with people in the message today. Well, I can't say nothing, but you know, I might be taking something from brother Brown. Come on, church. Brother Brand, I'm only trying to get us to understand [screaming] what God laid upon you and the value that lays in you people. &gt;&gt; It says it's in pain. It's rocking back and forth. There's flood ranged. Don't you understand what's happening there? It's it's travailing. [screaming] It's wanting it's wanting a new earth. Hebrews tells us that they cannot be perfect without us. &gt;&gt; Then how you if you don't ever come to that, how you going to get them to it? &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Somehow we've got to come to this. Well, I don't know about that. You know, you ain't read a quote yet. &gt;&gt; [sighs] &gt;&gt; Brother Brown said it was restored back to man through Christ. He says in the days of Abraham and then Orient the way they made a covenant. I'll read a quote so y'all know I'm still in the message. And they killed and split it in two just like you see a Abraham doing for God's covenant. They split the covenant in two. Then they write out their agreement. Then they take that and tear it apart. Give it one to this one and one to the other. And they take an oath over their dead this dead body. If they break this covenant, let them be as dead as the dead beast is. What an oath. And this this only way this covenant can be manifested is for both men to bring both pieces of paper. [panting and sighs] And they have to dovetail perfectly together just like that. And it confirms the oath. [screaming] Now what was God doing? He was showing Abraham how he was going to be the father of nations through Isaac and would come through Christ. And at Calvary, Jehovah God the Father taken his own son to Calvary, laid him upon it with sins and sickness of the world, tore him apart, took the body and the glory, and sent the Holy Ghost back down to the church. And when the resurrection comes, the same spirit that was in Jesus doing the same things that Jesus did when he was on earth has to be in the [screaming] church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. The same spirit that was in Jesus doing the same things that Jesus did has to be in the [screaming] church. That's the covenant church. And when they come together, the same signs and same wonders that he did will have to compare with the body of Christ to be the bride. [screaming] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I'll read another just to convince you I'm still in the message. There is God's covenant. The light that was in Jesus was torn out of him and sent back to the church. And the light that was in Christ being in you, then Jesus, his word which he raised from the dead is living among us tonight doing the same things you did. Oh, but brother Tim, brother Brandon was on the earth then. That's why God can't do nothing for so many messes churches because they're waiting on brother Brown to come back and do it. &gt;&gt; Come on. [sighs] &gt;&gt; Then here's the way I see that. If we're having to wait on Brother Bam to come at what we have in church for, what we what we pray for the sick for, God ain't going to listen to our prayers anyway. &gt;&gt; Yeah, [sighs] &gt;&gt; it's a bunch of hogwash. &gt;&gt; That is not the kingdom life. God didn't give the kingdom life to one man. &gt;&gt; I know the quote you thinking about and people's going to hear it and I probably get emails from it, but [screaming] brother Banner said God could only use one man. &gt;&gt; I don't have time to preach on that today. [sighs] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad that Jesus said, "If you abide in me and my words in you, you can ask what you will and I'll give it to you." He said, "He that believeth in me, though he were dead, is yet shall he live. Whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die." He said, "That was the eternal purpose to the church. The works that I do shall you do, greater than this you do, cuz I go unto my father." That is the promise of God. &gt;&gt; Brother Ba makes a statement that is so critical. I don't know what I done with it. But I want okay brother said first is to express himself completely God in Christ. He said secondly he wants to have preements in the church which is his bride. &gt;&gt; Thirdly he wants to restore the kingdom to you. &gt;&gt; Now that should settle it right there. &gt;&gt; We shouldn't have to feud and fight over it no more. That right there should settle it. Thirdly, he wants to restore the kingdom to its [screaming] rightfully place where they fail by sin. God didn't fall from sin, Adam did. &gt;&gt; So, I'm the one that's going to get the kingdom life back. &gt;&gt; You're the one that's going to get the kingdom life back. There's power in the kingdom life. He said, "Oh, back to where he walked in the [screaming] cool of the evening and talked and fellowship with Adam." How many knows what the word cool means there? &gt;&gt; Y'all want me to tell you? &gt;&gt; Spirit don't mean cool like don't mean that the word actually means ruach spirit of God. What did brother Bam tell us the book of Joshua was for or Ephesians was? We know Joshua was placed in the Old Testament. He said Ephesians is doing the same identical thing taking the people back to what they had originally. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Is that what he said? &gt;&gt; Then the kingdom that I or the dominion that I lost or the domain that I lost and the glory that I lost and the honor that I lost. You mean to tell me I've got all [screaming] that stuff? &gt;&gt; [panting] &gt;&gt; It's mine. He gave it to me. &gt;&gt; I just got to get [screaming] it back. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's God's covenant life, church. Don't say life tabernacle. Oh, I know we're not used to this kind of stuff, but it'll be all right. Notice thou madeth him to have dominion over the works of thy hands. The works of thy hands. Thou hast put all things under his feet. All sheep, oxen, yay, the beast of the field, the fowl of the air, the fish of the sea, whatsoever passes through the path of the ocean. Oh Lord our Lord, [screaming] how excellent is thy name in the earth. Notice Hebrews 2:10. For it became him who whom all are all things by whom are all things in bringing many sons unto glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings. [sighs] When God created the heavens and the earth, God never intended for the earth to God never intended for the earth to run separate from heaven. &gt;&gt; Jesus, listen friends, Jesus preaches about the kingdom continually. It must be a pretty important subject. He never intended for [screaming] the earth to operate separate from heaven. He intended for the earth to be governed like the heaven was governed. &gt;&gt; Read Matthew 6. Don't let this confuse you because I'm going to say it fast and don't ask me say it again because I can't. [sighs] God made an invisible realm for an invisible God. Invisible does not pertain to the object. It pertains to the subject. &gt;&gt; Listen carefully. It does not mean that the object is there. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; It just means that your or it does not mean that the object is not there. It means that your eyes can't see it. &gt;&gt; That's why brother Brown can make a statement. There's planes and trains and all kind of things and cars going right through this building. Now, I preached a funeral the other day, and I hadn't had a there hasn't been a funeral preached in my church since 1992, cuz normally it's at the uh funeral home, but this particular one wanted it. He had got with me years ago and said, "If when the Lord takes me," cuz he had cancer, was in bad shape. He said, "When the Lord takes me, if he don't heal me," he said, "I want the funeral to be in the church." That's where he's been all his life. I said, "Okay, we'll do that." So, we had [clears throat] it in the church and he all his friends are there, his family's there. I mean, it's something else. It was packed probably 150 to 160, 70 people in the church. We was packed inside, outside the vestibu down the halls. They were packed on the pool pit. They were packed everywhere. And I made that statement right there. Boy, did I get some looks. But I wasn't preaching to all them people I knew that didn't believe nothing. &gt;&gt; I was preaching to the ones that go to my church. &gt;&gt; I can't help it. The rest of them would just to be sitting there. They had no idea because they they can't get out of the realm that they're actually in. They don't know how to get in the realm of God. &gt;&gt; And that's what's happened to the church world. They don't know how to get in the realm out of this world. They don't know how to step from here. They go to church and all this and they sat there. I had the privilege, first time in my life, y'all gonna laugh at me when I tell you I went to mass Wednesday morning. &gt;&gt; Okay. [snorts] &gt;&gt; I can't believe I did it either. &gt;&gt; [sighs and gasps] &gt;&gt; I'm working on this church. Well, I got one more day on it. It's humongous. I was showing brother brother uh uh Scott the pictures and what we was doing to it. And the late the assistant principal, it's a big school, big church. The church itself to the ceilings is 110 foot probably. I'm using 135 ft boom lift to get me up there to what I've got to do. So I had to go in to the vestibu and the church was up with the church door was closed. Normally it's open and I'd go in the vestibu there this particular morning which was Wednesday morning. I it wasn't open. So the lady down there she opened the door for me because she knew I've been working there and she let me in. We talked a few minutes and I said what's going on? I just curious. She said we having mass. You want to go in? Wow. is different. Put this way, I don't think I'll ever become Catholic. They can't get out of the realm that they're in. They can't step. They can't understand how can trains and planes and cars and all this be going through this. You would be surprised that message churches that don't understand this because they don't understand that faster dimension. So I made that statement the other day in my church one at a funeral and they says &gt;&gt; and everybody's just looking like they're looking for the planes. They was looking for the trains. They was ducking hoping they weren't going to hit them. Why? Because they don't understand it's in a quicker a faster dimension. You're not able to see it. So the invisible the object doesn't mean that it's invisible. It's just invisible to me and you. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; God's not invisible. He's invisible with this. But if you can get into the spirit of God [screaming] and climb into that realm, there's life in that kingdom. [sighs] &gt;&gt; The Bible tells us that the invisible world is a is is the apparent world. The apparent world is the subject world. &gt;&gt; [panting] &gt;&gt; Let me say it in another way if I can. [laughter] The things that has been made was made out of things not seen. &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. I'm going home in a minute. [sighs and gasps] In other words, the things that you can't see is more real than the pew that you're sitting [laughter] on. The things that your eye can't see is more real than you sitting on that blue seat. You say, "But Tim, I know this seat's real." I do, too. I see that seat. But the things that's invisible, that's more realer than that. Because that'll burn one day. That'll be done away with one day. That'll fade one day. But what I'm talking about will never fade. It's the object that this eyes can't see. But it's something that's really there. If we could climb out of this realm and climb into that realm, we would say, "Oh my goodness, I can't believe this is here. I can't believe the power of God that's here. I can't believe the life of the kingdom." &gt;&gt; But we come to church over and over and over and over &gt;&gt; and never climb into that kingdom. &gt;&gt; Why are we doing this? &gt;&gt; [sighs] &gt;&gt; Brother Brown teaches [screaming] us there's a world that's just only feet from us. &gt;&gt; He said, "I was caught up and I'm looking down no more than 8 foot upon my body." [sighs] &gt;&gt; He's caught up in that other kingdom world. [sighs] Oh, hallelujah. [gasps] This eye can't pick up the image. [sighs] &gt;&gt; Oh, but it's [screaming] there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you look at the scriptures, you'll find out. [panting and sighs] &gt;&gt; My goodness. Turn that clock back. &gt;&gt; [sighs and gasps] &gt;&gt; If you watch the scriptures in the Bible, brother, sister, God, every now on him would allow the man of God to see that realm. Didn't happen often. Remember the scripture there? My mind goes straightly to to Elisha and Gahhesa. And Gahesa makes a statement, there's more of us [screaming] than there are them. &gt;&gt; What if it had been me? I'd have said, Elisha, you crazy. &gt;&gt; [sighs and panting] &gt;&gt; There's more here [screaming] than they are with there's more with me and you than there are with them. And Jesus says, "What are you talking about, man?" And God and And Elisha says, "Lord, open the boy's eyes." &gt;&gt; Oh, if God could [screaming] come and walk every pew and open our eyes, [panting and sighs] &gt;&gt; we would see things we've never seen. Amen. &gt;&gt; We would walk out this church different than we've ever walked out before. &gt;&gt; Amen. [panting and sighs] &gt;&gt; Why? There's power in kingdom life. And that kingdom life is in the body of Jesus Christ. Open his eyes. So God made the invisible realm for the invisible God. [sighs] [gasps] The Bible says, "The heavens is for God. The earth is for the sons of men." So God made the earth a visible expression of an invisible heaven. [sighs] Then he made man an invisible a visible expression of an invisible God. &gt;&gt; And he placed him in church. He placed him on this earth that we could return back to what we had before. You mean to tell me one time I had glory? One time I had honor, one time I had dominionship. Yes, sir. We did. And then sin come and we lost it. But brother Brown tried [screaming] over and over and over for 50s something years to get the people to understand who they was. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Not just to go to church, not just to sit on a pew, but to know who they are. [screaming] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. [sighs] [panting] &gt;&gt; Brother Brown actually makes a statement here and he says, "God wanted [snorts] God wanted [screaming] to share his glory with man." [sighs] That'll bust your bubble, won't it? [snorts] Why? because he wanted the earth to be governed like the heavens was governed. &gt;&gt; What did he say in his prayer in s in Matthew 6:33? [panting] He placed Adam upon the earth and he said, "Adam, I'm going to give you this glory." Man, Adam's walking around with the glory of God upon him. He's walking around the garden of Eden with honor. He's walking around with dominion. Brother Mam said, "Adam could say tree be plugged up and I want you to be over here and a tree would jump by the ground, go over there and dig a hole and put itself in it." You say, "That's crazy." That's God. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Our Father, which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done. in earth as it is in heaven. &gt;&gt; So now he wants the visible to be like the invisible. &gt;&gt; He wants the visible church of God to be like the invisible God. God don't show himself just to anybody. &gt;&gt; God's not going to come down and show himself to the world. God don't show [screaming] off for people. &gt;&gt; He comes when you come through the door. this building there. There's nothing in this building until you come. Don't you get that, church? &gt;&gt; It's just a beautiful building. I mean, it's just magnificent. But God's not here until you come. &gt;&gt; Amen. [sighs] &gt;&gt; You think God sits on the pew here or gets in brother Donniey's seat back there and sets with his feet up on the table and says, "Well, I'm going to wait till Wednesday night till they get back. &gt;&gt; [panting and sighs] &gt;&gt; One day this building if when the Lord comes back one day this is going to be burnt all up. This beautiful place will be gone and burnt. &gt;&gt; But you won't be you'll be gone. All right. [panting] &gt;&gt; You won't you won't you won't be burnt like I'm talking about. You'll be burnt with the Holy Ghost. He'll come down and light a [screaming] fire and set something inside of you that you say, "Wow, what happened?" &gt;&gt; That's what the church of the living God needs today. Why? Because the power of the kingdom life is still upon the earth. It's still in man. We've just lost our way. [screaming] [sighs and gasps] &gt;&gt; He places Adam on the earth and crowns him with the only thing. What's he doing? He crowns Adam with the only thing he's got, his glory. [gasps] God didn't have four or five houses to give him. He didn't give him three or four Cadillacs. He didn't say, "I got a thousand acres of land over. Adam, that's yours." God didn't do all that. God gave him what he had, and that was his glory. and said, "Now, Adam, operate it." Brother Brown said, "Adam could be walking through and Eve would be cold after a little wind chill would come through." And he said, Adam would say, "When be still now, Eve's a little chilly today." &gt;&gt; Why? He's operating it like God was operating the heaven. &gt;&gt; That was a kingdom there. This was a kingdom here. This kingdom was made off of that kingdom. How you think Moses built the the ark of the the the the the tabernacle in the wilderness from what he saw in heaven? He saw it there, brother John, and then come down here and made it. He wanted that kingdom down here. And God said, "Ooperate the kingdom." And then sin came into the garden and now Adam cannot operate nothing. He says, "Peace be still." And the wind still blows. He says, "Don't rain today. We want to take a little evening stroll through the cool of the garden." And the spirit of God not there anymore. And Adam says, "Oh my, [screaming] what's happened?" And God says, "Adam, Adam, where art thou? What have you done?" &gt;&gt; I was reading last night. Brother B says, "And Adam, God used to take Adam arm in arm and walk through the cool, [sighs and gasps] walk in the spirit of fellowship." He said, "But now Adam stands there and none of this is happening. He's not able to operate it anymore. He's wondering what has happened. [sighs and gasps] He runs him out to the garden gate and actually God goes out the gate with him. Brother said he was in a part of his rest from the seventh day. The Bible says he rested which is a part of the millennial reign. And now God opens the gate and runs out of them out. And God goes out with him and puts the millennium on hold. Why? Why? Because the church has got to get back the kingdom. &gt;&gt; Amen. God's just waiting on me and you. [panting] We're not waiting on God, Brother Freddy. God's waiting on us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, if I can get them to understand, he says, if I can get them to see that the kingdom life has power in it, if I can get them to see that this and this and this, [sighs] don't you realize when Jesus dies, St. John 6 there, the Bible says he less, who do men say I am? Well, some say thou art this and some say thou art this and some says you're this and some says you. He said, 'I'm not concerned about who everybody thinks I am. I want to know what you think about me, Peter. &gt;&gt; Peter says, "Well, [panting] I believe thou art the son of the living God." &gt;&gt; Would it? Peter, flesh and blood didn't reveal this, but my father which was in heaven. Why? He's setting up his kingdom. He's now started his kingdom. Jesus, when he went to Calvary, he died. [panting and sighs] He was put in a grave. He did not have the keys. &gt;&gt; He only had the keys to death and hell because he give the keys to Peter. He gave the keys to Peter. All he had was the keys to the to to death and hell. &gt;&gt; But now Peter [screaming] has the ability to unlock it. &gt;&gt; The revelation has now come to Peter. You mean I'm part of the kingdom? &gt;&gt; So Peter now is carrying around the kingdom life upon the earth. &gt;&gt; Why? God is restoring the kingdom life. Then &gt;&gt; yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [screaming] God's restoring it. What's he been doing for 2,000 years? Restoring the kingdom life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Restoring the kingdom life. [sighs] I told brother Scott this morning, I said, I don't I don't understand God sometimes. Sometimes I pray and pray and pray and can't get a prayer off the ground. [sighs] My wife's been through. [gasps] [snorts] She's been through hell on earth since September the second. Two strokes, [panting and sighs] [gasps] my beautiful queen. Two strokes. [sighs] [panting and gasps] Now, she stepped off of a little step stool the other day, two weeks ago, and fell and really jammed her leg up through. Now, for two weeks, she has had a nerve problem down through here. She can't even get out of bed. She can't move. She can't move her body. She can't go to work. She can't even go to church. I have laid hands on her I don't know how many times. I prayed for her I don't know how many times. [sighs and gasps] And I said, "God, I don't know what to do anymore." And I'm behind the pull pit preaching the kingdom life and the the dominion ship and the glory and honor. [panting and sighs] I know just barely a glimpse of what brother Ram was talking about when the devil come to him about his little daughter and his wife. I don't understand everything that Brother Ram understood. I'm not claiming to know and don't pretend to know. I'm saying I can barely just see a little glimpse where you preaching and preaching and preaching, preaching, preaching, preaching, preaching and it seems like you can't get a prayer through. But yet somebody else will call and say, "Hey, can you pray for this?" And God will move like that. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Had a lady call me the other day. She said, "Brother Tim, she said, "I I really got faith in your prayer. I need you to pray for my daughter-in-law. She's got twins." And said, uh, said, "I [snorts] need you to really pray." She's not even asking her church to pray. Now, somebody else may. She didn't. I said, "I'd be more than happy to, sis." She said, "One of the twins, their intestines is so tight and so small that the baby's going to die. One of them's going to live, one's going to die." She said, "So, the doctors is trying to get my daughter-in-law to let them go up, go in her with a laser and kill the one baby that's going to die so it don't kill the other baby or harm the la the mother." says, and that's what we're battling with. Said the baby can't live. Said there's something with his intestines that's all has been out of shape and it ain't going to make it. So, she called me and I said, "I'll be glad to pray." So, I go before God and praying, just praying and praying and praying. [panting] And I got the call two weeks ago and said, "The baby's fine living good." And I said, [applause] "That's nothing I did. I just don't understand. God, why don't you touch my wife?" &gt;&gt; I'm watching her suffer every day. I watch her can't get out of bed. I watch her. She can't walk through the house. I watch her can't go to church. She can't go to work. She can't go to the store. She can't go out and eat. She can't do nothing. And I've laid h hands on her I don't know how many times. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And it's like it's dry, brother. I mean, I can't even hear him. I'm wondering if he's hearing me. &gt;&gt; I can't explain it. &gt;&gt; I can't explain it. [panting and gasps] But I'm still preaching the kingdom. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [screaming] Hallelujah. I'm still going to preach that I've got dominion. &gt;&gt; I'm still going to preach there's a glory upon the body of Christ's head. There's an [screaming] honor upon them. I'm still going to preach it hard as I've ever preached it. &gt;&gt; I don't understand it. Yeah. [sighs and gasps] &gt;&gt; He puts his glory on Adam. And it what it means is when Adam would speak to the earth, it would have the same effect &gt;&gt; as if God spoke. Oh, church, we ain't getting it. Adam would speak to the earth and it would listen to him and have the same effect as if God stood there and said it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Oh, why can't we see it? [gasps] [sighs] Let me find a place to close. [sighs and panting] [snorts] I do want to say I sure do want to come back and finish this though. Wow, man. This is so good. Let me say this right here. So, what Adam would say, because I'm going to show you something just for a second. Just give me how many give me five minutes. &gt;&gt; 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40. So, y'all just gave me to 130. [panting] That's an old Pentecostal trick. Brother Donnie knows about that trick. So, what Adam would say when he would speak to the earth, this is so deep, friends. I would I'm going to tell you, this is so deep. It's so powerful. And I knew I couldn't finish it. But Adam would speak to the earth. Cuz what Adam would say, listen to this, had weight. Wii Ght. W E I G H. Is that how you spell wait? W E I G HT. When Adam spoke, let there be. I want this here. When be still. The earth listened to Adam's voice. Because what Adam said had weight. Do you know why it had weight? &gt;&gt; Cuz the word glory in the book of Genesis means weight. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; So God put [screaming] weight on Adam. And why why you think brother Brown made a statement that policeman can stand out there and they'll run all over him. But if he'll just pull that coat back and show that badge, [screaming] they'll have a 100 car pileup wreck stopping. Why? Cuz he's got weight behind him. &gt;&gt; All he's got to do is hold the hand up, show the badge, and blow the whistle. and everybody's [screaming] coming to a screeching halt. &gt;&gt; It's the same thing with God. God put weight upon Adam. When Adam spoke, he would get godly results. Though he was a man [screaming] on earth, [sighs and gasps] he was crowned. The word means he was crowned with weight. In other words, when Adam would speak, God would get behind what he said [screaming] and make it happen. It wasn't Adam doing it. It was God [screaming] making it happen because there was weight behind Adam's words. There's weights behind your words. There's weights behind Word of Life's words if you will believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause] [panting] &gt;&gt; Notice in closing musicians come I'll prove I'm closing. &gt;&gt; [sighs] [snorts] &gt;&gt; Notice Adam stood there and Adam called it what he wanted to call it. I want you to be a oak tree. I want you to be a pine tree. I want you to be a lion. I want you to be a tiger. You a deer. You a buck. You a dough. You this. Why? Because he's got weight behind what he's saying. God's put a glory upon him. And now he's speaking that glory. And God said, "Yep, that's the same thing I was thinking." Adam would say, "Oh, [snorts] I want that to be a horse. I want that to be a palamina. I want that to be this. I want this to be." And God says, "Yep. Same thing I was going to call him." &gt;&gt; Why? He's speaking God's language. I'm fixing to run. He's speaking God's language. What do we have to do? Speak God's language. If we don't learn to speak God's language, it ain't going to happen. [sighs] [panting] &gt;&gt; We've got to speak his language. Waits behind what brother John says. When you speak his language, God says that's my son. and all he does is not it works. Children, every one of you can do this. Every one of y'all have the ability to do this. &gt;&gt; It's up to y'all. Or do we just want to continue to come to church for the next hundred years till we all die? &gt;&gt; We just want to continue coming to life tabernacle, Word of Life, all these other churches until we all fade off and die. Then our kids is here and our grandkids is here and our great grandkids is here and we're gone. No. I want the rapture to finish &gt;&gt; because it's already in progress. &gt;&gt; Brother Ram said the bottom of the page, Christ the mission of God. He said when the church and the people realize, he said, [screaming] when the bride realizes her position, the rapture will leave. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's not coming. Why? Because it's it's already [screaming] in here. &gt;&gt; Do you realize the rapture is in this church this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. But it takes y'all to speak it. &gt;&gt; Let's stand together. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; [sighs and gasps] [snorts] &gt;&gt; When he spoke, he was crowned with a weight. Adam would speak [sighs] and God would stand behind him and make it come to pass just like that because he's crowned. The word glory in the Old Testament means weight. He's crowned him with weight. Don't you understand what y'all have now? Don't Don't you see why you're so valuable? But that the devil will get up on one shoulder, little angel get on the other shoulder. Ain't that how we always see it, ain't it? And the devil's whispers in the ear. Well, you ain't no good. [panting] You did this a long time ago. And the angel on this on his shoulder says, I don't pay no attention to him. Then this little devil on his shoulder come back and say, I remember when you did this 40 years ago. You made a mistake 40 years ago. And then we'll get to feeling sorry for oursel. I can't believe I did that 40 years ago. You're worried about something 40 years ago and you claiming to be saved and born again this morning. What's wrong with y'all? &gt;&gt; God looks at you and says, "What? What?" 40 years ago [panting] &gt;&gt; you're crowned with weight. &gt;&gt; Word of life, you are crowned with weight. Young people, you are crowned with weight. If you claim salvation and born again and converted and have the Holy Ghost, you are crowned with weight. &gt;&gt; You have a glory about you. [sighs] I wish I had three more hours. I'll be walking this in about two hours. You're crowned. You have dominionship. I've got quotes. I've got everything on it. [gasps] [sighs] Whatever Adam called it is what it was. &gt;&gt; [sighs] &gt;&gt; Let me you let me say this before I go because this is so good. [sighs] God never meant for his word to be used to just communicate. Let that sink in very, very slowly. Now listen to me. God never meant for his word to just be used to just communicate. God uses words to create. &gt;&gt; Example, when God came on the earth in the form of Jesus Christ, of course, what did Jesus start doing? He didn't start working with his hands. I know you thought, well, he was a carpenter. Get that out of your mind. Look at the bigger picture. What did he start doing? Speaking. Everything he did, he spoke it. We could go through, I don't know how many instances in the Bible, everything he done, brother Harry, he spake it. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; the one man trying to get into the pool of Bethesda. So many people's gathered he can't even get nowhere near it. So he goes gets four buddies of his. They take him down there and they said, "We can't get in the door." So they climb up on top of the house. They must have been roofers. Thank God I'm a roofer now. They climb on top of the house and take some of the panels off and let the man down. And Jesus just happens to walk by. Jesus didn't touch him. Jesus didn't do nothing. Jesus said, "Take up your bed and walk." Why? He's now not just communicating with his disciples. He's now creating with his words. Why? He is the glory. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He is the one that has the weight. He can give it to me and give it to you if he wants to. We just want to use words to talk. But we've got to think like God. [sighs] Faith calls things as though they were [sighs and gasps] as though they are. Faith don't look at it like I look at it. Faith don't look at it like y'all look at it. I can see here, but faith looks behind that. That's the weight y'all carry. Now, you can leave today and you can go outside and take that weight off. It doesn't matter. It's up to y'all. I can go out that back door today, get in my car, take that weight off. I can say, "I ain't preaching no more. I'm done. I'm done. I can't get a prayer through. My wife ain't getting better. this ain't getting better. I can do that. I have the ability to do that if I want to do that. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Y'all have the ability to walk out and say, "Forget it." Or you can walk out and say, "You know what he said is in the Bible. It's in the message." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I've got weight with me. &gt;&gt; I come to church with it. I'm leaving with it. I'm going to work in the morning with it. I'm going wherever I got to go to Walmart or Kmart or whatever. I'm taking my weight with me. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's there's this book and this guy wrote this book. I can't [clears throat] think of his name at the moment. And he sees it basically. You would think he's a message believer. I mean, he just believes God for what he says. This guy just believes the Bible for what it says. He don't believe in a prophet. Don't know about a prophet. Don't know anything. But he just simply believes what the Bible says. Period. Claims Christianity, claims to be born again. [crying] If he's in a restaurant, if it don't matter where he is, he has if he feels a little leading coming on him, he'll just walk up to this person and say, "How you feel today, sir? Do you know Jesus?" And they'll start a conversation. and he'll say, "You feel okay?" And the guy, one instant says, "I've been having trouble in my back for weeks." He said, "Well, do you mind if I pray for you?" So, he'll pull him in close and pray for him. He gets through. He steps back. He says, "Now, he don't claim to be a prophet anything now. He's just a Christian." He says, "Do you feel any different?" And the guy says, "No." He says, "Let's pray again." He'll pray. He don't care how many times he'll stand there and pray &gt;&gt; till he gets results. I'll get the name of the book and send it to somebody and y'all can get it. This book is powerful. He don't claim he don't believe he don't claim to believe in a prophet. He just simply believes the Bible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, if he can do that, why can't y'all do that? &gt;&gt; Why can't I do that? Because we complicate it. &gt;&gt; We complicate that. We're standing on the streets of the courthouse the other day. We got a big courthouse, a brand new one here. Then we got our old courthouse over here. It's 150 years old. That's the job I've been on for two years doing all kind of work, copper work, crazy stuff. So I'm I'm hearing this music, this young girl sing, and I'm on the back of the courthouse and I'm on the ground and I'm by myself and I'm watching all these guys work that I've got helping me and I'm hearing this gossip. I said, "Where's that coming from?" So, I walk around this side, go up Benson Street, and I walk and I see this little young girl. She's over just singing away. And I see another lady, older lady and another guy, and they're just witnesses and talking to people. I said, "Let's just see what happens." I'm nosy, I guess. So, I walk up there and cross the street and I said, "Well, I'll just act like I'm walking by looking at my work." And the guys is up there working. And I walk over and I stand back and I'm just looking. Man, it's pretty looking good. And this lady makes her way. I seen her coming out of the corner of my eye. She makes her way over to where I'm at. Hello, sir. I says, well, how are you doing, ma'am? She says, "You doing all right?" I said, "Yes, ma'am." She says, "What are you looking at?" I said, "All that work, that copper up there." She says, "Oh." She says, "Do you like it?" I says, "I did that. She said, "Oh, this is you." I said, "Yes." She said, "Oh, okay. That's beautiful." She said, "You need anything today?" I said, "Yeah, I need actually quite a lot." She said, "Do you mind me praying for you?" I said, "Nah, pray all you want to." Now, I know that ain't gonna go over with a lot of messes, folks. Well, now she's a woman. She can't pray. Oh, y'all goodness. Yeah. Yeah. Going to make me so mad. I said, "Pray away. &gt;&gt; Pray away. I need whatever I can get." &gt;&gt; That's right. So all of a sudden this man makes his way over and it was her husband. So me and her get him get to talking. He says, "You from around here?" I said, "Yes, sir." "All my life." He says, I said, "Where you from?" He said, "I'm from Rhode Island." I said, 'Wh in the world are you doing down here in a little town called Anderson?' He said, 'We down here praying for people? Any of y'all ever went on the street and prayed for people? Well, Brother Tim, that's not the time for that. We don't believe in that no more. See, that's the problem. &gt;&gt; We don't know how to be led of God anymore. Come on. &gt;&gt; I stood there two and a half hours witnessing and talking to people. That's something I don't do. Now, I love to talk, but I'm not going to go on the streets and do it. But that day, I stood there two and a half hours talking to these people that's coming by. Me and him's just a talking and I just kind of watching out of corner. She comes up to another couple, lays hands on them. Another couple, she lays hands on them. She's laying hands on everybody. And that guy looks at me again. He says, [clears throat] "Tell me what you think the problem is today." I says, "How long you got?" He said, "I feel like we need a revival in the church. I feel like we need a revival. We need this in the church." I says, "Ho ho ho ho ho ho ho. I said, 'You asked, so I'm going to tell you. I stood there another hour. I don't know what he thought about it, but we walked away shaking hands, so it couldn't have been too bad. But I'm thinking, that's what the world needs. They want to see something they don't see. &gt;&gt; They don't see it nowhere. But y'all can show it to them. &gt;&gt; If you're just led by the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; if you're just led, I was in the store the other day and I was sitting there eating and this young boy come up, comes up to me and I noticed I'm watching and I thought, does he know me or what? Cuz I didn't have I was out of town. I know he didn't know me. And he's looking at me. He's sitting in a booth. He comes over at me. He said, "Hey, sir." I said, "Hey, man." And I stood up. When I stood up, there's something different about you. And I just stand there. I throw my hand out and go to shake his hand. I don't know who in the world he was. He says, "I just feel like I need to hug you." Now, I'm I'm picky about people hugging me. I don't want people hugging me. I'll hug you. [laughter] I don't want strangers hugging me. And I'm sitting and I didn't know what to do. It caught me off guard. He says, "I'd love to hug you." And I says, I didn't know. I said, "Are you you know you [laughter] whoa now? Wo meal wo meal." He said, "I just feel like I need to hug you." And I says, "Me and him just embraced young boy." And he turn around, he says, "Thank you for that. &gt;&gt; I don't know what he needed, but the world's hunting something." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And they don't know where to get it. &gt;&gt; Yes. Cuz the church, they can't get it. Cuz what the church has ain't changing them. &gt;&gt; And it's not going to change their bodies. &gt;&gt; But what y'all got is very valuable. &gt;&gt; What all y'all got is very, very valuable. Hold on dear to it. &gt;&gt; Give me a G, Brother Harry. Let's sing Brother Donny's old song. I was on the mountain. I was wondering from the fountain. If I can get it out. When I heard my savior speak to me, [music] he said, [singing] "Won't come to me relenting." And [music] of your sins repented. Listen now. And I will lead [music] you out so you can see. Sing it now. Well, and I'm [music] so glad he [singing] found. Oh yes, I am. Oh, he bound me. He put his arms around me and he led me to the shelter. [singing] [music] Now I'm one of his own. [music] Aren't you glad that you're hes [music and singing] with my heart of glory? [music] Someday I'm going [singing] to my home. [music] Home of glory. [music] I'm going to walk on streets paid paint paid with gold. [music and singing] He said now I will love him [music and singing] ever. I'm going to stray from him. No, never. Because he's [music and singing] the dearest friend that I ever knew. [music] He said, "Now when I see him yonder, my [music and singing] love, still go fonder in that happy [singing] home beyond the blue. And I'm [singing] [music] so glad he found." Oh yes, I am. I love he found me. [music] He put his arms [singing] around me and said [music] he led me to the shelter. M. [music] Now I'm one of [singing] his. Oh, I know [singing] the joy [music] I'm knowing in my heart of glowing. Someday [music] I am going [singing] to my home. [music] Home [singing] up in glory. I'm going to walk on streets, baby. Yes, I am [music] with gold. [singing] Brother Brown said, "God, now this is so powerful." He said, "God is depending on you." Amen. &gt;&gt; The creator &gt;&gt; is depending on y'all. &gt;&gt; Do we understand the depth of that? Do we understand the value of that? God is depending. The God of heaven, the God of the universe, the God of glory is depending on me. Little old me. &gt;&gt; He's depending on y'all. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, if we could ever catch that. If we could ever catch that. [sighs] Almighty God, Lord Jesus, help us today. Lord, I've delivered what I felt that you laid there on my heart this week. [snorts] studied every night. I've delivered for the only way I know how. I'm I'm not smart. [snorts] I'm not educated, but I do believe his word. [snorts] Lord, take these words today, Lord. I pray that you'll place them in every heart. Take what was said Lord and may they accept it Lord and receive it. The word receive is possessed. Possessing, take possession. Re is the prefix which is again God let them receive what they have need of today. Jesus breathe on them and they received. God breathe on this church this morning. And may they receive what they need. If there's any here sick, Lord, if there's any here with problems and needing this or that, whatever, God, would you help them to receive what they need today? Would you hear me today, Lord? Almighty God, [sighs] as we stand here today, Lord, [snorts] I'm going to ask each person just to lay their hands up on someone close to them, their wife or another brother, sister to sister. I want to I want this church today to pray for my wife. I want them to pray for the needs of the people in this church today. I want each one here today to pray for someone else in this church. And I'm putting my wife in the mix today. Father, Lord, we've spoke thy word today. Lord, I didn't come up with this. I didn't write the promises. I didn't write the scriptures. [snorts] I didn't put the weight on Adam. I didn't put the glory on Adam and the dominionship. I didn't have nothing to do with that. But the creator of heavens and earth did that. And he said, "I'm going to let them operate this earth. I want them to operate this earth the way heaven is operated." And Lord, we stand with arm in arm, hand in hand today as children and sons and daughters of God. [snorts] And Lord, every need in this church today, God, I'm asking, Lord, they would receive what they have need of, if they're sick, Lord, may the Holy Spirit be mindful of them, God. [snorts] What if they have problems with this and the other and issues with this and whatever it is, it doesn't matter. Help this church to operate it. Help this church to operate this kingdom. The power of kingdom life in you, the church. [sighs] [snorts] Help us to operate it. Lord, I pray Lord for my wife today. I ask you, God, that the Holy Spirit would be mindful this morning that you would go to her wherever she would be lay in her standing right now. Father, as sons and daughters of God, we rebuke the devil. We rebuke his tactics. We rebuke the enemy. And God, we as children of God, we are going to operate the kingdom life now. Move in a mighty way upon every person, Lord. Every young person, whatever they need. I know those that's in school go through battles that I don't face. Per people go through battles that different people face. God, you know what they face. May we operate it this morning according to the word of God. It's not me doing it. It's not them doing it. It's Jesus Christ in the people doing it. I claim it this morning and they claim it this morning. Would you grant it, Father? Lord, there's people I know that's sick, Lord, in my hometown. In the name of Jesus, would you go meet with them, Lord? Father, may the Holy Spirit be mindful of them today. May we leave this place today closer to you, Lord. Lord, let us leave today a little closer to you. May we leave today learning a little bit more how to operate the kingdom life. Hallelujah. We thank you and appreciate you for the service that we've had today. Thank you for the people that's made their way. Lord, if they need anything today, may they believe it right now where they're sitting. If they need prayer, we'll do that. If they need hands laid on, whatever they need, I'm giving to the opportunity now. But if they just believe now, they can receive it where they stand that's operating the kingdom life. May you grant it, Lord, and hear the prayer of these people today. May you walk the aisles, Lord, in every pew in this church today. And may God you supply every need in the name of Jesus Christ, the son of God. And the church says, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; Oh, let's say it again. And the church says, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; Give him a hand clap of praise if you would. [applause] Let's sing this little chorus. Let's try C.
