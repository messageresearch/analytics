rising up New Testament Church [Music] well as I look at across the land and I see God's Mighty hell the bride of Christ adorned in a wedding gown oh just like in the days of old they stood in Courage bowl and they turn that old pin rising up but there's a New Testament Church rise enough rising up there's a New Testament Church Rising enough now the Bible mainly tells and how the whole Eagles fell signs and wonders were done by the apostles hands demon Spirits were cast out you know they sing and shout while surrounded by God's holy angel bad for rising up rising up we're a New Testament Church

he's not looking for perfect worship he's looking for you he had Angels worshiping him perfectly and he wanted you because it's a sacrifice do your best today pull on the gift of God today build on the service that we had last night okay build your experience right get something from the Lord today he wants that expectation let's welcome brother Aaron brother if you continue singing that song all right what a beautiful song about us please well as I look out across the land and I see God's Mighty head oh the bride of Christ adorning her wedding girl yeah just like in the days of old days [Music] enough and I do a Testament Church we're rising up [Music] we're a New Testament Church right Hallelujah [Music] I believe that I'm looking at a part of that new testament church tonight that's rising up hey man is that your testimony is that who you are you know we look around and so many people want to put things off in the past and the Miracles off in the past and the testimonies off in the past but as we've said those testimonies are just to let us know what he wants to do today those testimonies are what he can do in your life tonight and I believe that with with my whole heart and I'm so thankful to be a part of that new testament church amen amen I love the worship unto the Lord I love what our brother said you know he he had angels that could worship Him perfectly but he loves that when his redeemed worship him when when you come together and make a sacrifice of praise amen and we're thankful for the to the Lord for what he did last night and how he spoke but but we're looking for him to speak once again tonight amen how many can be honest before God and say Lord I have a need Lord in my life I know I need more of you tonight and I believe that each and every one of us can say that so before we go to the word and let's just go ahead and bow our heads and speak to the author of it tonight Heavenly Father Lord how we love you Lord and how how grateful how thankful we are Lord as we sit here and look at this Gathering of young people Lord most of them from right here but many visitors in our midst as well and Lord we're just reminded once again how little we are Lord as we stand before this group of people recognizing that there's nothing that we could say Lord Lord that would help them but Lord in this dark eye where it takes you and we're just asking you to come and speak and you to come and encourage and and you Lord God to issue forth the Lord the challenge that we need to meet another day and give us the strength we need to meet that challenge father Lord I ask you to come and take over this vessel now and Speak Lord that you would have freedom Lord in my life right now to to move me out the way Lord and allow you to take control and speak to each and every need as Lord as our brother said last night only you can take one sermon and speak to a hundred needs in a hundred different ways and Lord I pray you'll do that tonight Lord as we set ourselves aside and our thinking aside now and just Lord let you take control I pray you'll bless the word as we read it and all the words that are spoken Lord that you'll shut my mouth in any place you don't want me to speak Lord and just allow me the freedom to speak plainly where you'd have me to speak Lord just take control now bless every heart that's gathered in Jesus name we pray amen amen thank you musicians wonderful singing tonight if you have your Bibles with you when we want to get straight into the word and look to the book of Jude the first chapter Jude the first chapter in the third verse and pray tonight our desire tonight is just to encourage you and strengthen you and the Lord that something would be said that would help us depress the battle for another day and and recognize our position and what we're called to be in this hour amen Jude 1 and verse 3. we're going to read one verse there and it says beloved when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the Saints and then also I want to read one verse out of Psalms the 60th chapter Psalm 60 and verse 4. and it says thou has given a banner to them that feare thee that it may be displayed because of the truth Selah amen I pray that the Lord will add His blessings to the reading of this word as you have your seats I'd like to speak to you tonight for for a little for a little while on the topic of raising the standard raising the standard brother Branham says and and as we read this quote I want you to just take each and every portion of it and apply it to yourself and and think about yourself and think about this these young people and how that we can take this there's so much he says here he says God grant it tonight everything has went by May that still Small Voice attract the people tonight to a real Sanctified life a life that will stand by their God that'll stand by their Church that'll stand by their Pastor that'll stand by the cause of Christ that will hold up a banner that'll live act dress go and Associate and live in the environment that'll be so salty that it'll cause others to thirst to be like them amen early on we see there in the in the book of Jude early on that that Jude is having to write and to encourage the Believers to contend for the faith which was once delivered and if you look into the dates this is literally only a few years removed from the original outpouring there of the baptism of the Holy Ghost there there in the upper room at Pentecost and already what they had been given is already under attack and I want you to know that there has been a word revealed in this day and restored back to the original and yet I want you to know that it's under attack and the devil would love nothing more than to take from you what God has given you what is rightfully yours but tonight somebody is called to raise the standard there is a group of people called to stand and defend what has been returned to you and make sure that no man takes that away from you you understand it is yours you can have it you can have exactly what they had in the book of Acts you can have exactly what your parents parents got what your grandparents got brother Branham taught us that every generation has an opportunity at Revival so let no man steal your Revival it is for you to have but you're going to have to be willing to fight for it you're going to have to be willing to go to battle and what Jude is talking about here is that men had already crept in and began changing ideas and saying what they needed and didn't need and how they could act and how they couldn't worship and that's always the problem once man gets involved once man gets his ideas in it but we have something we have a we can look to it's a standard and this is our standard that we look to we know what the Holy Ghost does we know how the Holy Ghost acts we know the life that the Holy Ghost will cause you to live and we can look to that tonight as our standard and man began to come in and change things and begin to Rob what it was that belonged to the people and Jude is calling on people here in this moment he's calling them to contend he's saying you're going to have to fight for what was once given in other words it's already changing but if you want it the way it was originally you're gonna have to contend for it you're going to have to fight for it and he's saying it's up to you he says Brothers earnestly contend this isn't going to be an easy battle this isn't going to be something like well that's my he's saying it you're gonna have to be Earnest about it you're going to have to take hold of it you're going to have to be willing to stand and today there is another call that has gone out and saying was there someone in this day that will stand for the truth yes a messenger came yes the seals were broken off yes the word is available to you but are you willing to contend for it are you willing to stand for it are you willing to be one that's not ashamed to say I've had my heart turned back to the original I'm going to stand on it because I know this is what's going to take us in a Rapture and I will let no man rob it from me I will let no cold formal worship come in and take over our services but we're going to be on fire for God this bride will by no means be a lukewarm broad she'll be on fire she'll be going forward as Onward Christian Soldier but somebody's got to stand and contend for it in this day okay Hallelujah someone who will fight for the truth that has been restored back and not only defend but to take steps to take more not only defend what you've already taken but to take steps to take all that God has given us in this day and as I think about the ranks of the people that we might would refer to as message Believers and I think of our youth and I I think of each and every one of us we have an obligation an obligation to fight and to defend what God has to fight for and defend what God has done in this day and not just in the sense of defending the message the message does a good job of Defending itself because it's truth but also but defending what God has done for us personally defending our experience defending our rights what it is that God has done for us and not allow the devil to come in and Rob what God has given you because young people God has given you more than we could ever stand here and say here he has delivered as he has healed us he has given us the Salvation he has given us the Holy Ghost he has brought us from place to Victory to Victory to Victory and yet if you allow the devil will come in and and give you a woe as me and I'm a failure and I haven't done much but you've got to look back to each and every Victory and every time you have a victory young people drive down a stake right there drive down a stake right there and don't ever go behind that stake ever again you may struggle to go forward but after that step put down another state and then after that step put down another state and never go beyond that last state never back off your testimony never begin to speak what the devil says but I am a Son of God I am Blood Bought I am Blood Washed I do have the Holy Ghost I am an overcomer let that be your testimony from this day forward [Applause] and defend what God has given you as individuals we have to be fortified and make sure we stay behind and stay clothed in the whole armor of the word tucked away behind his word and we have to not just for us but even as we spoke last night rebuild the walls around our families rebuild the walls around our loved ones and and push back to the landmarks that many have been driven away from things that are promised there in the word that that people haven't haven't reached to in so long we've got to begin to push back and take back the land that belongs to us in this day use the word to rebuild areas in our life that may be there they're weaker than other areas we all have strengths and weaknesses fortify your weaknesses in the word focus on those things and fortify them and build up areas that maybe you have neglected many times we have neglected areas in our life and we need to find those areas and cover them with the Holy Ghost keep them covered in the word don't allow yourself in your weaknesses to be exposed to the enemy build those areas back up and we must take time to nurture our experience into true relationship think about that we believe and we teach and experience you must have the experience of meeting God for yourself but then we have to nurture that experience into relationship because if it's a one-time experience then you don't have relationship if I meet you one time and then I never speak to you again I never commune you with you again I never talk to you we don't call we don't text we don't visit we don't have a relationship even though we had an encounter but I will tell you once you encounter this Pillar of Fire you will want to have a relationship with it it is something that you will want more of and more of and more of listen if you don't have a desire for more I question whether you ever encountered it to begin with because once you come into the presence of this Pillar of Fire your heart will yearn for more amen Hallelujah our experience isn't to be a a one and done thing but we are to walk with him daily going from experience to experience ever growing Ever Changing ever contending ever being willing to be molded continually putting this Stone upon this Stone and this Stone upon this Stone and allow Allowing God to mold out this weakness Allowing God to strengthen Us in this area and allowing him to change Us in that area never getting to the place to where we feel like we've arrived I'm there I'm a message believer I met God I'm good that's not a place you want to get into young people but praying Lord shake me again tonight Lord shake me to my very core once again tonight Lord show me where I need you tonight because every one of us have need of him but Lord show me where it is show me where I need to grow show me what you're trying to tell pour out yourself more into my life Lord Jesus prophet of God would say it like this he says God we're not so anxious tonight to see the building shook now listen I love it when the power of God sweeps sweeps through a place and it almost feels like you can feel the building breathing it's just so alive with the power of God but listen we're not so interested or anxious tonight to see the building shook but we would like for you to shake us Lord Shake our understanding Shake our being our emotion our hearts of understanding that we might leave here tonight more determined than ever to serve you that we might feel the presence of a new Fresh Pentecost of a holy spirit pouring out upon us afreshing a new like down in these woods and hills in Arkansas 50 years ago when the forefathers come through here in horses and wagons preaching this gospel dear Lord may we the bearers of this great worthy cause that you sent through here may we not be ashamed of this great thing but may we walk in the footsteps of those who went before us Lord packing the banner of the Lord Jesus raising the standard packing the banner of the Lord Jesus we've got to come to the place young people to where we are solid yet seeking to where we're solid yet seeking to where we are examples and yet teachable to where we are leaders and yet we're willing to be changed to the to the place to where listen these two things are not exclusive you can be a solid Christian who recognizes I need more of God you can be a leader who recognizes I need to be molded you can be a Godly overcoming Christian and need more from God as a matter of fact that's exactly where you should be at tonight Lord I'm saved I'm sealed I'm filled with the Holy Ghost but Lord I need more of you tonight pour out more of yourself in my life tonight I can't go another day without more of you yes I'm overcoming yes I'm walking in Victory and yet I need more of you tonight Lord good but see this is where the Devil comes in and he begins to try to rob you when we acknowledge our need of more of God than he says yep see you didn't have it yep see you didn't have what you thought you had but that's not the truth there isn't there has to be an acknowledgment when he comes in and points to your weaknesses listen don't ever let him Rob your praise because of your failures don't let him Rob your praise because of your failures he points to your weaknesses he points to your failures he accuses you day and night that's what he does he's the accuser of the Brethren he accuses you and he points out your flaws brother Aaron you don't know the the what he says about me listen I do because he says the same things about me he tells me the same lies he's telling you he comes and he tells you you're not good enough you're not going to make it you listen he wouldn't be telling you those things if he had you but he's telling you those things because he don't have you and he's trying to get you to stop you are an overcomer you are a son of God you are a daughter of God that's who you are tonight to quit listening to the devil when he speaks and definitely don't give voice to the devil's thoughts amen he comes in and he accuses you and that's not the time young people to back off the promise that's not the time to say well you know what you're right yeah I've been having these struggles I've been having these issues I've been having those battles but those are the times that I like to point him to the victories in my life those those that I like to point him to Calvary that's what I point to him to a changed life to a changed attitude to my victories I point him to where I defeated you here I defeated you there I defeated you on this point I'm overcoming in this area I'm overcoming in this area so you just keep running your mouth but I'm overcoming I'm gaining ground I'm attaining victories Hallelujah pointing to the victories in your life pointing to the overcoming in your life and quit focusing on what he points you to point him to a changed life you know there's been changes in your heart you know there's new desires pointing to that point the enemy there and yet that doesn't mean that I don't need more that doesn't mean that I don't recognize that that the Lord's still working on me that I have walls that I need to build up that there is areas in my life that I need to mature in it's okay to recognize those things and hold to your testimony hold to where you're where you're standing what I know young people is that I'm not finished I'm not perfect but I know that he is the author and the finisher I know that the one that started the work in your life is going to finish the work in your life the Devil comes and he says oh you're not going to progress you're not going to make it I would like to remind him devil I didn't start this work I'm not the one that did this but something drew me something called me something pulled me there's a sea Gene of God down on the inside and he that has started this work is going to finish it listen it wasn't just about coming out of Egypt there was a coming out but there was also a going in and I'm telling you we hadn't just come out to wonder and die in the desert but we've been called out to go through and go in wherever you're at tonight keep walking the promised land is just in sight oh but there's trials there's hunger there's tribulations there's serpents keep walking the promised land is just in sight don't give up your call to it you're called for it you're chosen you are the people that's going to see The Rapture in this day Hallelujah I need more God I need a greater experience God but I'm praising you for what you've already done for me God Hallelujah amen why does he want to put it off why does he want to put you down why does he want to put you to these things because who is it that's going to be the final serpent bruisers who is it that's going to be the last ones the final voice to the final age to stomp this serpent underneath their feet who is going to be the last one standing here in Satan's Eden ruining his perfect Eden it's you you're who it is and he's trying to keep you from from coming to that so do not allow your eyes to get caught on your shortcomings because church we have them I have them how many of you have shortcomings yes sir and it does us no good to stand here and point them out and focus on them and let that be but tonight I want to point you back to the blood I want to point you back to what the word says you are we spend so much time on what the devil says we are but the word has spoken about what we are he says I will have a church without spot or wrinkle listen I don't know how he's going to do it I look at my own life and I go I feel like I alone mess that scripture up I feel like I alone mess that up but I'm not the one who made the promise I'm not the one who's got to get us out of here I'm not the one who says I'm going to have it without spotter wrinkle he said it so if he said it it's up to him to fulfill it so just turn your eyes on him turn your eyes on his promise tonight raise the standard say this is what I'm looking to this is what I'm holding to these are my promises tonight Hallelujah you are called in

quit and the bell rings ding ding and somebody stands up out the corner says I'm answering the Bell I'm here for another round I'm here to stand Toe to Toe with the Enemy that's you tonight you were in the championship rounds and I believe that the enemy I believe with all my heart is on the verge of going down we're about to deliver the knockout Blow The Rapture of the church is just at hand you can feel Time and Eternity beginning to blend you see it all around us as listen you can see the evil blending in from that from that other dimension brother Branham says we talk so much about how bad the world's getting them how evil the world's getting he says yet we fail to see how strong the church is getting all the time I'm telling you you're stronger than the devil's been telling you you're stronger than he's been saying but if you look to the word if you'll feed him the word you'll find that you're a mighty Army you're an invincible Army that you're Overcomers that you are the victors in this day it's time to look back to the standard Hallelujah foreign what did the chief Captain think of you he thought so much of you that he's called you to be a standard Bearer in this day someone who would carry the standard someone who would see this thing through to the end someone who would lift up the word of God in the most evil day that's ever been he chose you Prophet says like this he says but in every generation God has always had his agents it's got down sometimes to merely one but God always had somebody in every generation that he could lay his finger on some people that he could put his finger on and say this is my people and they'll do as I tell them to do he looks around he says I need a young people who won't bow down to the pressures of the age I need believers who will proclaim the truths of the word I need somebody in the worst conditions that's ever been that would be willing to stand and willing to fight when they're completely surrounded when there's absolutely no hope when there's absolutely total darkness when others are caving to the pressures of the age when others are turning and walking away when others is going to quit who's he going to pick they all know when God looks down through time and could have picked anyone could have placed anybody here knowing all things knowing who could take it he said who are my very best who can I trust who am I going to let run the last leg maybe in in carnal terms who are my Navy Seals who are my Army Rangers who's the ones that I can send in for the final battle and he looks all down through Eternal eternity and he says I Choose You I Choose You that's a little different from what the devil's been telling you God looked at you and you said you're the very best of God you're the ones I'm going to hand the Baton to for the close of the race you're the ones I've got faith that I know will stand that I know will contend and he looks down Through the Ages and the devil says you're no good you're nobody you're worthless and God says I Choose You I Choose You Tonight it's time that we begin to Echo the testimony of our God and say he chose me he chose me he chose me for this age and I'm not going to let the standard fall it's not going to go to the ground in my day but I'm going to raise it up he chose me Hallelujah who can I give the colors to for the final charge into eternity think about that responsibility but think about the confidence that he has in you Hallelujah sure there's people falling away there's people letting down the standards people are allowing ancient landmarks to be moved allowing ancient landmarks to be overrun people sit by with breeches in the wall they don't rebuild the wall they don't repair it they see breeches in the holes in the wall and they just they just leave them uncared for and the gaps in the walls through the years have allowed the standards to go out and then be replaced by the ideas of man you see not only to do broken down walls allow the enemy in but allow things out notice it's hard for the evil to get in if the standard is there the evil can't get in if it's filled with the standard but when standards go out evils come in who's going to build the wall who's going to get back on the wall what that's our first instinct somebody somebody probably Brother Joseph that's trained probably some preachers sure we have our part well probably the great singers and the deacons man that who's going to rebuild the wall you're gonna do it but you don't understand brother and I'm just a young person what can I do I'm just a young person let's look at Nehemiah 3 28 I love this he says from above the horse gate repaired the priest everyone over against his house after them repaired zadok the son of Amber over against his house after him repaired also shamaya the son of Shekinah The Keeper of the East Gate in verse 30 after him repaired hananiah the son of shalimaya and Hanan the sixth son of zelath another piece after him repaired mashulum the son of barakaya sorry over against his chamber now notice down through every one of these verses it said the son of the son of the son of and then it gets to verse 30 and it says the sixth son it's very specific here it didn't matter that the five Elder Brothers didn't want to put their hand to the word it didn't matter that the five older ones didn't want to do it it didn't matter that they were okay with gaps in the wall it didn't matter that the five older ones were okay with cold formal Worship in the church it didn't matter if the old head sat on their hands when the worship went forth oh come on it's okay it didn't matter the young one the young person said hey it's okay I see something that needs to be done I'll step up I'll build I'll fill it in I'll worship God when the service is going on I'll create an atmosphere I don't care if you do I don't care if you do I don't care if you do but I'll create an atmosphere I'll worship my king I'll worship my God I got a part to play I may be the sixth son I may be 12 13 14. but I can do my part to rebuild the wall to create an atmosphere where others receive the Holy Ghost where others get blessed I'm gonna hold up a standard you have a part to play I'll uphold the standards it doesn't matter how young I am I'll do it others may not put their hands to the work listen let no man despise thy youth don't worry about if you're 12 15 16. you have just as much apart to play in the services here as anyone as a matter of fact I can only speak for my church but I'll say when our youth are gone to like a youth camp or something it's sad the worship service is just different you want to be careful you'll be disrespectful to the elders and such I'm just saying when they're gone we know it you have a huge part to play well what can I do I'm not a preacher you are the creator of atmospheres you have the opportunity to welcome the King of Kings into this place as he's moving through this sanctuary and do your part listen I think about Lazarus and then when he was raised from the tune and Jesus told them that the sisters to go roll the stone away he could have easily just rolled it away listen it may not be your service it may not be the day that you're risen from the dead you may be feeling just fine you may be where you need to be but somebody's got to be willing to push on the stone because that dead person sitting next to you it may be their day to be raised it may be their day to be delivered and somebody's got to be willing to go hey I don't care if anybody notices I don't care if I get an award that ain't what it's about but I'm gonna push on this Stone I'm Gonna Worship I'm gonna do my part I'm gonna make sure that if somebody needs something from God today there's no hindrance between them there's no atmosphere of cold formalness but in here our God can move he can deliver I'm Gonna Roll the stones away from my brother and sister there's a part you can play this quote says his five Elder Brothers it seems laid not their hand to the work but he did in doing that which is good we don't have to wait to see our elders go before us you don't got to wait to see if Mama worships if mama won't leave him daddy don't have family altar you can have family altered you can do what is good it says if they decline it it doesn't mean we have to thus the younger brother if he be the better man and does God and His generation better service is indeed the better gentleman you can tell this was written in the 1800s those are most honorable that are most useful listen they can turn things down they don't have to take it all but there is a generation of people who's going to take everything that's going to claim everything that God has given them listen the older ones wouldn't kill Goliath brother Joe the older ones hit in their tent the older ones just said you know be careful the old ones sat there all day in their tent comparing quotes I decided not to be careful just all day comparing quotes and and comparing this and there was a giant out there taking their property there was a giant out there robbing their Joy there was a giant out there saying you can't have your kids back you can't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost you can't have the gifts moving in the service you can't have freedom of worship well this quote says is he still out there yep let's look up some more but there was a young person brother Brown said I love the way he said it he said his boast fell on the wrong set of ears and I'm telling you there may be others that want to go around and around the mountain there may be others I just want to read quotes and read quotes and I love quotes as much as everybody else but there's a generation of people that says I'm gonna take that quote and I'm gonna put it in action and I'm gonna put it in my slingshot and I'm gonna go out there to this giant that's been robbing my joy robbing my peace robbing my freedom and I'm going out there to take his head off I'm taking the land I'm taking the Rapture that's my Valley that's my property and I will no longer sit by in the tent and let him March around on the Promises of God but there is a young people today saying that's mine get off my land get off my property oh come on there's a lot of people got the got the rock in the sling and they've done this too long it's time to turn and lose today let the rock go to its Target let it take the Giant in your life down Hallelujah brother Brown says no wonder Christianity can't even lift up a standard he said it's not because Christ is not able but because people won't do it he said the message is ready the power of God is sufficient men and women are scared to break out yonder into those spheres before God and dare to trust him and take his word there's a people called to trust him to take his word and to hold up the standard of the word listen you can't give an inch you cannot be willing to give an inch we're not called to be compromisers we're not called to be blenders we're called to be separators we're called to be Defenders we can't expect to be Victorious and continue to be wishy-washy about things every little bit of it matters every little bit of your property matters I mean think about it your dad gets up and the alarm goes off and he looks out in the backyard and there's an intruder out there sneaking around with a ski mask on and he said I don't worry about it he's just in the yard he's not even at the door he's daddy's getting closer yeah I'm not even sure his gun's loaded all right y'all just rest don't worry about it that would be insanity why we want to wait till he's inside the house why you want to wait till he's taking taking everything from you listen you see him stick a foot on your property it's time to deal with it right then sir you have no right to be here you have no rights on in my life every right you ever had was stripped from you that day on Calvary you've got to go and if you don't go I'm going to call the authority on you you've got to get out of my life take your depression take your anxiety take your lies and your fears and get out of my life this is my property it's vote it's paid for the deed has been searched it belongs to me he has no rights deal with it right now because if you give an edge you open yourself up to the bottomless pit it is a bottomless pit and when you give in to that the world presents us a very dangerous situation it's a very dangerous attitude of just be willing to compromise a little just be willing to say things a little softer just be willing to baby things a little bit for the sake of getting along and once you give an inch once you compromise a little bit before you know it you're completely overtaken listen you should thank God that you have the opportunity to come to a place we're a pastor is not afraid to speak the truth who isn't afraid of offending someone for the sake of for the sake of Truth a place where truth is spoken and held up where the standard is held high and we're not going to back up we're not going to Cave to the pressures we're not going to Cave to to the thought that we have to you know not offend anyone listen we're going to speak the truth we are going to say the truth I I can't help if it hurts your feelings there's the saying that that the truth don't care about your feelings the truth is just the truth and I'm thankful for men of God that are still willing to stand and isn't afraid to say how it is and call right right and wrong wrong 1996 I'm fixing to date myself again we had a president by the name of Bill Clinton at the time and he was considered the liberal of liberals he would almost be a conservative today but he was considered the liberal of liberals like man this wasn't good Bill Clinton is the president let me tell you how much things have changed if you keep up with politics at all I know you probably don't but here's a quick lesson Bill Clinton signed the defense Marriage Act brother Joe saying that marriage was between a man and a woman this was what the Liberals were passing when I was your age marriage has to be between a man and a woman and for years they cried oh we just we treated the same we just want to be we just want to love each other like everybody else we don't want to bother nobody you know the liberal rallying cry love love love we just want to get married like everybody else and you won't hear from us anymore see what it was is there was a standard in their way that kept them from being able to fully manifest the full extent of wickedness that was to come it was the standard of marriage they always want to move the standard they want to overrun the landmarks they want to make a mockery of anything that is an institution of God so in 2015 more up to your speed the Supreme Court overruled the marriage protection act giving these people the right to marry and from that time on has that been all they wanted no it's been a constant flood from the pits of Hell a flood an absolute unraveling of the standards of society that was once one nation under God how far I don't mean to gross you out but I'm just gonna I'm gonna give you some honesty right here here's where we're at as a society there is now a movement to no longer use the term pedophile to describe those people who want sexual activity with children brother Joe because in using that term you may offend them I'm not making this up in the academic world especially in the liberal universities there's a very big push to no longer use the word pedophile because it creates a negative stigma around them we now are supposed to call them map that's capital m capital a capital P which stands for minor attracted persons um I want you to let that set settle for just a minute brother Aaron why are y'all so hard on this why you preach so hard against these things why do you preach against the the worldly entertainment why do you preach why are you so hard why can't you just give a little bit why can't you just budge a little why is everything I be so cut and dry because when you give a little bit it opens you up to a bottomless pit toward the smoke of Hell's coming out and get listen young people you don't want to give a little bit you don't want to back up even a little but raise the standards that won't move I won't bow I won't break that's not coming in my home that's not coming for my children no sir but we stand on the standard of the word of God whoever it may offend whoever it may upset there's a standard and I will raise it huh Hallelujah you can't give even a little bit [Applause] changing standards leads to no standards we look to this one and that one we think this is cool and that's cool or this movie star and this athlete everybody wants to match up with somebody or copy somebody brother Branham said I don't care if my coat matches my trousers or my tie matches anything as long as my experience matches this word you want to blend with something you want to match something you want to be like somebody find it right here make sure you match this make sure you line up to this this is what matters young people this is what we must emulate this is the standard that we must look to we must begin to we have to allow it to manifest in our lives to where that word begins to take on flesh to where you become that standard Taurus no longer just on paper it's no longer Just Books and tapes it has to begin to take on a living form a breathing form a bride walking not a bride in books but the standard begins to take on flesh because we're called to uphold the standard a standard against sin and if things need to be addressed they get addressed if things need to be preached on they get preached on come on now we're getting soft we're getting to the place to where oh he's going to offend my kitty he's going to hurt my little boy he was preaching right to my family thank God thank you Jesus quit letting that standard be dropped you can't be a standard Bearer and be afraid of Correction brother Brown says judgment begins at the house of God hears where we are judged and isn't it a pity that when we see that we're wrong and doing wrong thing living wrong kind of Life Associated wrong and everything that we're not big enough to walk up and say God I'm sorry I'm the one that's wrong you're right and I'm wrong and you forgive me and help me to do better next time if we just be real about ourselves but we don't no I'll tell you what we do is we decided Well there's a church within driving distance I get my feelings hurt here I'm gonna go over there and then I get my feelings hurt there and it's been long it's been about a year since I got my feelings heard over there so I'm coming back where I used to be and we turn into a bunch of church hoppers I don't know why we're here but here we are and then we never learned to deal with adversity we never learned to deal with correction we never sit in a place long enough to change and everybody's against us and everybody's hurting our feelings and we run here and run there listen to me the standard is that the house of God is the beginning of instruction it is the place of Correction when he comes I say Lord if you got to step on my toes step on them if you got to hurt my feelings hurt my feelings judge me here lord judge me now but whatever it takes I just want to be ready I just want to be corrected I don't want to stand before judgment there Lord if you got to preach a whole sermon on me if you got to call my name if you gotta offend me whatever you got to do Lord I just want to be ready get our attitude where we come and we don't always got to be preached happy we don't always got to be able to hear things that make us excited sometimes we hear things that hurt sometimes there's things in our lives that ain't even sinful but they need to be hit so you'll bring them back in balance it's hard sometimes but whatever Lord I want to receive my judgment here being a standard barrier on people comes with great responsibility it also comes with great Danger because the standard Bearer in a battle the one who carries the flag that was sometimes caught carrying the colors they're the ones that lead the charge they have the colors of the flag and in an ancient times it was called the standard or the banner and and it shows the other soldiers Where We Are it shows the other soldiers what ground we have taken it shows the other soldiers where we're standing at where we are fighting at some may have got hurt some may have got wounded some may have got disillusioned in the battle they're still our brothers and they have to be able to look around through the smoke and the fog and the hurt and the wounds and they gotta be able to find where's the standard where's the banner where's the battle raging and I began to look for the flag of their unit says if in the course of a fight you were separated from your unit one looked around until you saw the standard and then you tried to get back as close to it as possible the standard bear hint of battle is in the center of the front lines so the following troops know where to go but it also shows the enemy where to shoot every gun in hell is trained on you but the Lord said I've Got Confidence every gun in hell is trained in you listen this isn't for the faint-hearted young people this ain't for those that are going to turn and run when the bullets start flying this ain't for the weak that's why I called you that's what I'm trying to get you to understand is that you're more courageous than you will ever realize you know most people will never realize how courageous they are until they have to be and I'm telling you we're at the point where there's no turning back there's no running you have to be it is time that you have to stand that's why he called you when the bullets start flying days of Miracles has passed you don't have to get the Holy Ghost like that anymore who are you going to turn and run it don't matter what kind of clothes we wear sure don't matter what stuff you're watching and feeding on it don't matter what kind of Clips you're sending to your friends we don't need all that emotion in the house of God anymore we don't need all that worshiping and dancing and all that fanaticism somebody says I ain't moving I ain't backing up off what God has given me as a matter of fact I'm going to take more matter of fact I'm gonna take another step I know I can have it just like that I know it matters it's in the word I know I can have an upper room experience I know I can have that backside of the dancer burning bush experience just like Moses had I know I can have those things I know I can have freedom to worship I'm not backing up off of what God has given me if it cost me friends if it cost me popularity I don't care it matters and I'm called to raise the standard and say I'll stand right here no matter what I'm going to raise the standard of the whole gospel I'm going to display the truth of the whole gospel and as ministers we need to preach the whole gospel because the message preached exactly the way it was delivered will produce exactly what it promised to produce think about it so many times we water it down leave off parts and then act like it's the fault of the message that things didn't come out the way it said it would you got to preach it the whole way brother Bram says I believe there's got to be some kind of a standard that God will judge the church by or the world there's got to be some standard it cannot be the church organization because they differ Who would know what to do but there is a standard and that's his word I believe that God watches over his word I believe that the word is punctuated exactly the way God wants it the Bible it's God's word to the people there's where reason I believe in that word and I believe the word is a seed and if that seed is sowed in the right ground and watered by the Holy Spirit it'll bring forth of its kind any promise that God made God will do it but not if we're only standing on half of it he's going to bring forth what it is you're willing to stand for and I want to encourage you once again that we have to stand for the whole thing the entire thing back to our opening scripture Psalm 16 4 thou has given a banner to them that fear thee that it may be displayed because of the truth sayla it's got to be displayed so that you can rally to the colors rally to the truth when you've been wounded rally to the standard when you get separated what is the standard brother Aaron the standard is this word and the word preached in its entirety will produce what it said it will produce there will be Acts 2 experiences come on now there will be dancing and shouting in the house of God there will be the gift that manifest there will be healings in the house of God and let's bring it on down there will be overcoming lives to go along with that matter of fact that's the most important thing there will be those things if we preach it if we hold it if we stand on it there will be Overcomers in this day saying it works the anchor holds the token works but you gotta stand and say it's the truth and stand on that in this day quit changing the standards well maybe we can let our young people do a little bit of this maybe a little bit of that maybe we shouldn't be so hard I don't know I'll let you tell me but I believe I'm looking at a group of young people that like it preach just the way it is they want the truth give to them because they say I want to leave this world I don't want to be crushed under the rubble I want to take a Rapture preach it to us truth preach it to us straight tell us all of it don't leave off even a little bit Hallelujah I'm thankful to be associated with people that like it that way there was a standard Bearer in the Civil War in the time of battle when his company was charging up a hill against an enemy position and he was going ahead of the troops charging up this hill that was going to be difficult to take listen young people in this last day these last strongholds they're going to be difficult to take we're gonna face some tough battles you might as well just buckle down and prepare and get ready to go into battle because it's coming if you ain't in it now it's coming and he's leading this charge up this hill towards a fortified position and he's carrying the flag and the enemy fire is strong and the company is basically being shot to pieces they're being Torn to Pieces but the standard bear is gaining ground he's getting closer and he's separating himself further and further and he's taken every little step and the officer in charge he deems the battle a lost cause and he decides that the this battle is too difficult and he wants to call his men back there's too many of them officers in the pulpit he says this was a little bit too hard maybe we need to back off this battle so he calls the standard Bearer and he orders him to bring back the flag he says come back the standard Bearer turns and looks at him he says I will not give up ground that I have gained I will not return the standard how about you and the men come up I say we're not giving up any ground tonight how about you bring the men up how about you bring the men up to the standard of the word we don't got to drop the standards to make people feel better we don't got to give up what's been given to us I say bring up the men bring up the truth we can take the Fortress we can take the Rapture oh it's difficult the battle's hard but I'm not giving up ground I'm not going back where I came from I've come this far come on up come on up further take more ground tonight bring up the men rally to The Standard hallelujah what is the standard well just accept God sent a prophet I just make sure you're at church be a good boy be a good girl no the standard is you must be born again the standard is you must be born again you must have the Holy Ghost I'm talking about the real deal fire of God that fell on the day of Pentecost that fell in the upper room it will fall again it will fall for you it said the promise is unto them and as many as them that are far off hey it's been a long time since then but here we are far off and I'm saying Lord Fall Again fall in my life follow my children fall in my home I believe for that is the standard you must be born again we can't lower that standard just so we can say our little boy's doing good we must be born again and the results of that will be the same standard it will be a Victorious Life Hallelujah too much moving of the landmarks too much lowering of the standards instead of rising up to what the word declares brother Branham would say we got too many people preaching the gospel that ought to be cutting corn he said preaching a watered down head knowledge of a gospel he says what we need it's not juvenile delinquency it's parent delinquency it's because that the parents has neglected and then he takes it a step further and a whole lot of it is the way the church never preached it what's the matter Brethren get back to the gospel preach old time Holiness and get it into the church again we must have a standard young people calling on you to raise the standard I'm calling on you to raise listen there is a standard of modesty I say wave it proudly there is a standard of Bible Holiness I say wave it proudly we have standards of conversation that we are to have rise to that standards there are standards of conduct and I'll tell you one there is a standard of worship as a matter of fact the standard is that it is to be in spirit and in truth I say raise the standard for all of them to see they may not want to worship with you in spirit and truth but I say hey here's the standard here's how you do it here's how you praise the Lord when he begins to move through the house of God Hey listen y'all about to show up to Louisiana you can't I'm gonna challenge y'all a little bit y'all about to show up to Louisiana you came and I love my young people so I'm gonna brag on them for a little bit they love to worship they love to create an atmosphere as a matter of fact the first year they rolled up to the Ohio camp on the bus the some of the people checking on me and said uh oh the Holy Roller showed up they love to worship I'm telling when you get down to Louisiana Youth Camp I want you to raise a stand and say hey here at Word of Life we ain't gonna be out worships we know how to worship we know how to pull on the word of God we know how to raise the standard we've been set free we've been delivered we know what we've got to thank you for I'm not ashamed to praise him you ain't gonna shout us under a Pew we're going to raise the standard this is how we worship this is how we fight our battles we know what to do when that King comes in there's a shout of the king and the camp we have a standard of worship somebody's gonna raise that standard we know how to enter in we know what's to be done it's not just a Louisiana thing it's not just a grown-up thing there's a standard of worship we're not afraid to raise that standard High never take for granted the freedom you have to worship Freedom's just like territory that which is not defended is lost that which is not defended is lost I say worship with all you got you worship with everything that's within you listen others may not understand Others May sit there quiet and as the master passes by it may not make much sense to them if I say raise the standard for them to see raise the standard I say praise him till the walls fall down you know they tried to tell Bartimaeus to be quiet they would have rather him set in church and stay blind and quiet they may not understand why you shout they may not understand why you dance but they didn't also they also didn't go through the battles you went through they hadn't gone through the wars you've gone through maybe if they saw the tears on your pill at night maybe if they saw the chains of anxiety maybe if they saw the way you've been Afflicted they'd understand when you cried out thank you Jesus hallelujah praise the Lord I'm free I'm the leopard they may not understand but let them know I've got something to thank him for oh Hallelujah if you've been set free or something you got something to praise him for tonight you've been delivered you got a reason to praise him tonight there's nobody that can praise the Lord like a young person who's walked out of the jail cell who's been set free who's been loose who knows I was bound for hell but now I'm saved now I'm delivered now I've got the Holy Ghost that's nobody that can praise him like you can Praise Him raise the standard of Praise In The House of God hallelujah Hallelujah people want to sit back and criticize whoo get out of the seat of the scornful had a young person tell me one time and prayer said this is the only place I don't hurt you want to Rob them of their praise and their Worship in a world that's trying to consume them in a world that's trying to destroy them in a world full of pressure and they step into the presence of almighty God you won't just sit there and be quiet and put their worship back in a denominational box I say be free in the house of God you've got something to praise him about you got something to worship him about like no other people ever before you are the people about to step from time into eternity into a new body where no demon can ever torment you again no fear can ever attack you again you're right on the verge of it and this people knows how to raise a standard of Praise weighs a standard of worship Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord Hallelujah oh my are we about to close we're about to bring this down because I do want to hit this point I don't believe in being hypocritical In Worship yeah if you've got things in your life need to be dealt with and the spirit of God needs to move you need to run to the altar not run the aisles I believe that I do believe we need to deal with sin but also believe that those that struggle the hardest and have the hardest battles in the hardest troubles they worship the freest when they get a taste of victory they let loose so you're sitting there well I know the struggle they've been in and look at that kind of attitude is that it ought to be when you see them get loose it ought to make you so happy that you get right there next to him and show them how it's done oh this Young Person's been fighting this Young Person's been battling they've been drugged through the mud the devil's attacked them the devil's brought all kind of Lies over them but now they're free now they're loose now they're in the presence of almighty God get right there with them and say fill them Lord make an eternal drop down in their hearts forever

always loved this quote Patrick Henry I was listening the colonies seem to face an insurmountable odds as the greatest army on Earth was on the shores of America and there were so many people trying to talk to Patriots out of fighting you don't stand a chance but there was people called to the battle he says they tell us sir that we are weak unable to cope was so formidable and adversary but when shall we be stronger oh I love that will it be next week or next year will it be when we were totally disarmed and when a British guard shall be stationed in every house shall We Gather strength by inaction sir we are not weak if we make a proper use of those means which god of nature hath placed in our power besides sir we shall not fight our battles alone there is a just God who presides over the Destinies of Nations and who will raise up friends to fight our battles for us look around God has raised up a youth group here [Music] for no reason they're raised up to fight battles with you they're raised up to overcome with you they're raised up to stand with you in this evil day hoping I'm surrounded it seems formidable look around there's been an entire nation raised up to stand with you the battle sir is not to the strong alone it is to the Vigilant the active the brave there is no retreat in submission in slavery our chains are forged their clanking may be heard on the plains of Boston the war is inevitable and let it come I repeat sir let it come gentlemen May Cry peace peace there is no peace the war has already begun our Brethren are already in the field why stand we hear idle what is it that gentlemen wish what would they have is life so dear or peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains in slavery forbidden almighty God I know not what course others may take but as for me brother Daryl Give me liberty or give me death oh is there a young people tonight that say I don't know what others are going to do but I will not be bound in Chains I will not be
