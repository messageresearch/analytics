miracle we're so thankful that we've been given these few days together in the presence of the Lord and there's something about the saints of God coming together each one of us that have the Holy Ghost at that little lick of fire and when we come together it's just amazing and I think what will it be like that day when we all gather around his throne we have no time clock we have no big ones no little ones everybody just there before the Throne of God for eternity that'll be a time on it amen we so enjoyed the ministry of the word and all the effort that's been put forth by everyone the

the Lord just wanted to get him some new blood in that heart so he can push that cancer out so so so amen he certainly sends his greetings to you this morning let's just let's just go to the Lord here let's read his word this morning Revelations chap 10 and verse one and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were of the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the earth and cried with a loud voice as when a lion Roth and when and he had cried seven Thunders had uttered their voices let's go down to verse 7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as Heath declared to his servants the prophets and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said said unto me take it and eat it and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up notice there's things that the word does to you but notice where the word is it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I'd eaten my my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and Nations and tongues also du to onomy Chapter 30 and verse 11 I'm sorry to keep you standing and but I'll be standing just a minute here this morning I'm sure love hearing hearing the pages of those Bibles amen verse 11 for this commandment which I command thee this day is not hidden from the neither is it far off it is not in heaven that thou should as say who shall go up for us to heaven and bring it unto us that we may hear it and do it neither is it beyond the sea that thou should us say who shall go over for us over the sea for us and bring it unto us that we may hear it and do it but the word is very nigh unto thee in thy mouth and in thy heart that thou mayest do it amen I'll let you be seated just just this morning also I'd like to read from Ephesians chapter 2 and verse 5 even when we were dead in sins hath he quickened us you want this don't you oh well he just wants my jacket even when we were dead in sins hath he quickened us together with Christ by grace are you saved and hath raised us up together and made us to sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus I would like to take a thought this morning from this context that we've just read here this morning on positionally placed by the mighty Angel positionally placed by the mighty Angel we realize where we are living at here in the closing hours of the Church of the Living God we realize that we're in very pivotable moments when we begin to watch the scenes of the demographics of the the the politics of the world and then you begin to watch the wars that are happening in in Israel and Iran and then you begin to watch the wars between Russia Russia and Ukraine and we recognize that it's demon powers that are aligning themselves and they're getting themselves imp position and we recognize that when when brother Brandon would come and he would preach the recognizing day in its message he said now National Force did not National Force he said it put Israel in her Homeland he said National Force will put the put the church in the world Council of churches he said but it'll be the power of God that will put the people in The Bride he said the world for forces this way and the world forces that way he said but God forces upward he said the spirit of God which is the word of God my word is spirit and life will put the bride in her place cuz she'll recognize her position in the word then she's in Christ will put her in place and that's exactly what the message of the hour has done for us as a Church of the Living God we recognize that it has it has placed us in a position that only the word of God would do when brother Brandon would tell us in Christ The Mystery of God reveal he said this whole thing he said the whole thing is a revelation to God to take Eve back to her right position again with her husband and to think the things that you have seen and the things that you have handled that you recognize that this has been about placing you in the hour of adoption that he has placed you as Sons and Daughters of God he's placed you in the economy of God he's placed you right here he's not given you a close book but he's given you an open book and that book that is open it has the power to defeat anything that the word of God comes up against and I'm so thankful to know that we're not facing an enemy today with a closed book but we are facing an enemy with every every shackle and every every tradition and everything broke off the word of God so that we can recognize that we are a body move that is fully liberated by the very power of almighty God he didn't just come and give liberation to William brandom but he came and gave a liberating power to the Church of the Living God so that she would recognize her position in him because we recognize without him that we are absolutely nothing is that right we're nothing here this morning without the King of Kings and the Lord of lords but I believe that it's one of the most key and pivotable things that that the message has done that it it it one of the key features is that it has placed a bride in her position I also believe that it's one of the Great tactics that the enemy has against the Church of the Living God is to take away her identity of recognizing who she is in Christ Jesus and we recognize that it's it's God's greatest thing but it's Satan's greatest thing is that he's wanting to steal away the identity from the Church of the Living God to allow spiritual Amnesia to fall upon Sons and Daughters of God that they'll fail to recognize who they are in the body move because it's not just about a preacher it's not just about deacons it's not just about the daddies and The Mamas it's about young boys and young girls and I believe that if we're going to stand for anything we ought to stand for what the message has given unto us in this generation now we recognize that if Satan's going to steal our identity then it's one thing that we ought to stand up for is our identity in Jesus Christ because we recognize that is exactly what Satan or what the enemy did to Legion when he came unto him what did he do he stole his identity away from him what did it do it displaced him it robbed him of his dress wear and you watch what is happening today that is the same thing that Satan is trying to do to the church he's trying to rob her of Ephesians 4 And1 he's trying to rob her of her dress wear and what did he do Satan scarred him but what did the word of God do when it came when it came past legion's way it placed him back in a position and the next spot you see Legion one spot you see him chained one spot you see him in this condition but the next spot you see him standing before the word of God Unchained dressed in his righte ropes and I'll tell you that's one thing that the chief mechanic has done in this generation he designed a body that sets itself under the word of God he knows what it's going to take to put a church in rapturing order because he designed it that way he can provide himself a church because he still Jehovah Gyra he can provide himself a body because he's still Jehovah Shalom he will provide himself a body that will be without spot that will be without wrinkles she'll be a glorious bride she'll be a super Church a super seed a bride without a spot a bride without wrinkle a body that knows who she is a body that knows what she's called for Hallelujah you know what you called for it's just like when Joshua was placed under his Commission to stand there and go in there and possess all the land that he was promised we recognize that it was Moses's it was Moses's commission to preach the word but it was Joshua's commission to go in there and to divide to divide the inheritance that was laying there and all of Joshua's commission was hinging upon believing what the message said yeah Joshua's going to have some battles yes Joshua was going to have some struggles but brother baram would say it in the absolute that Joshua was tied to an absolute and it brought about a paradox and I know that there's a lot of things that don't make sense to you how God is going to work out the details of it but we recognize that it didn't make a whole lot of sense to Joshua how we would cross the Jordan River it didn't make a whole lot of sense to him how he was going to go in there and tear down Jericho it didn't make a whole lot of sense when he stood there and he told the son to stand still but that's the thing about a Son of God he's got another sense that don't make sense to the rest of the world and it's a key of faith that opens every door and William brandham would say this he said everything that God has for you if you'll lay a hold of it it's God's giv promise to you it's God's giv promise to you he said every place that The Souls of your foot shall tread upon that have I given unto you and it don't make a whole lot of sense why you would believe in a body change but it don't have to make sense to you because God's got a perfect sense he's got a perfect word that'll put you in a perfect rapturing order in a condition that only Sons and Daughters of God can know about it didn't make a whole lot of sense because Joshua had a revelation because the Bible said in Deuteronomy 29 and 29 the secret things belong unto the Lord but the things which are revealed belong unto us so what are you talking about brother angrew I'm talking about your belongings I'm talking about something that person belongs to you that the devil can't steal from you because Joshua wasn't just looking over there and seeing Giants in that land he wasn't just looking over there and seeing walls in that land or rivers to cross or natural things but Joshua was looking by a natural or a supernatural sense and he looked over there and he saw miracles in that land he saw blessings in that land he saw Deliverance in that land he saw young people that would be born in that land and would grow up under the citizenship of a Joshua commission I'll tell you this it's more than just Giants in our way it's more than just troubles in our way there's a future home for the Church of the Living God there's leadership there's an invisible Union there's modern events made clear by prophecy and somebody's going to lay a hold of it there may be a whole lot of this generation that don't want to rise up and accept but I'll say that everything that the seven and church ages have longed for is within the graps of the Church of the Living God we're right here on the cusp of a body change and I believe that if we're going to do anything we have to lay a hold of all of the word of God hallelujah what is it Faith's going to unlock the door to let you into it now we recognize this that this message that we we follow aren't you thankful to be following the message we know that this message that we're following it didn't come from the mind of a hillbilly Ki and that had poor grammar that only had a seventh grade education and I'm not just pointing out the lack of of William brandom's education to belittle the man but you know that if you study the message this didn't come from a William brandom that had a seventh grade education but this literally came from a higher intelligence one that could sit there and could Point him to the scriptures and could take him and direct him through the word because you know that if you study out the seals that William Brandon would say he said now if it wasn't for the angel of the Lord that would come in my room about midday today he said I would have made a horrible mistake so there was somebody that was standing close to our Prophet that was literally leading him through the scriptures and pointing out Revelations he was pointing out the borders for Joshua so that he could understand that's why when William brandham comes and preach the Feast of the trumpets what does he do to the Church of the Living God he literally lines out the board ERS for the Bride of Jesus Christ what is it it's exactly what William Brandon would preach in the spoken word is the Original Seed he would stand there and he would tell us he would tell us he said now he said that germ life has got to come through the body it's got to come through the body he said but the angel was directing Phillip down there to that unic but the germ of Life couldn't come through that angel it had to come through the body of Jesus Christ we recognize that there was an Angelic being that was standing at the pulpit night after night telling people their diseases that would give them their addresses and tell them of their past but it would also foretell them of their future when William Bram is standing there across Seas he's standing there and you remember when brother brandom he starts talking about that that man that was cross-eyed and the doctor came to him and said you performed hypnotism on him he said oh no I didn't he said if that's the case he said then you doctors need to start performing hypnotism he said all I can tell you is that there was a being that was standing between me and the crosy boy and when he touched that or that being touched that boy his eyes come cross they come completely straight that's what's happening to the Church of the Living God she don't have her eyes on Le osia and her eyes on the word but she's had her eyes fixed by the angel of the Covenant and he's here to make sure that he gotes you through the land he guides you through the property he can take you through Isaiah 53 he can take you through Joel 28 he can take you through it all and he ain't going to lead you wrong but he'll lead you right to your position that's what William Brandon would say he said a word born bride what is it he said that end time prophecies will repeat I believe as the first Forerunner come from the Wilderness and cried Behold the Lamb of God he said the second Forerunner will probably do the same by pointing the people to a word born bride he said the Bride of Jesus will be pointed towards the skies at the appearing of Jesus Christ ain't it wonderful to know that there's been an angel that stood in this generation he didn't point you to defeat he didn't point you to troubles he didn't point you to L osia but he pointed you towards the sky Hallelujah we believe and know that God any of us who study the Bible we recognize that God has has got Legions of angels and that God throughout the span of time has allowed men to be able to fellowship with angels been there to stand there and see them so I I believe that you're message people here so you understand what exactly what I'm talking about is that there there were angels and men were allowed to see them men were allowed to feel the effect and influence of that Heavenly realm and but when you see an angel in the Bible it shows us that it's a sign that there's a junction at hand and every time that you would watch when your brother William Randon would preach on on the junction of time he would stand there he said things happen when when at a junction he said it's a Crossroads Angels appear prophets arise and the miraculous is done at a junction of time so when we watched in this generation when an angel would come here and lead us through the Scriptures it was a sign to us that the miraculous is at hand well brother Andrew are you talking that we're all going to walk out of here you're going to discern our life and you're going to make us all miraculously whole absolutely not I ain't got anything to do with that but I believe that that same angel that would stand there by William brandom has accompanied the body of Jesus Christ he's not left her he didn't die in 1965 but I believe with all of my heart that there's a healing angel that is still with the Church of the Living God you feel the influence of them every once in a while what is it when you begin to worship and break into a praise that doesn't make sense to you what is it William Brandon would say you're bumping into an angs you'll start crying you'll start rejoicing you'll start weeping you don't understand what it is but you're bumping in to another world I don't want to just shout I don't want to just scream I don't just want to enjoy myself here but I want to bump into an angel that changes my body I want to bump into an angel that has the power to rid Ron Spencer of all of his problems and you of your problems and I believe if you can praise the Living God there's an angel in this place this morning and his name is Jesus Christ he's here to lead the Church of the Living [Applause] God what is it it's a sign that when an angel appears that he's coming to position his Believers at that time or in that season in a position just like when he would come to Samson's mom manoah when he would come to her and speak to her you watch it you know what happened he would begin to tell her about a child that she had not had yet but he was born to be a deliverer and the angel positioned Samson's mom and dad in a position that they would recognize that the supernatural was getting ready to take place and brother Ram would say in the message expectations and what love is he said now father may you just take over from right now and anoint the building he said we dedicate it to you just now he said May the angels of heaven come down through the ladder off the ladder of Jacob and take their positions now as soldiers at their post of Duty setting every place every corner every place and take their right positions and may they not leave this building until this revival is over I pray that you not leave your position I pray that you not get out of your position because God has got Angels at their position and I pray that you young people don't leave here without your deliverance don't leave here without your breakthrough don't leave here without an assurance knowing that you're going to make it because angels are at their position and it's a sign to you that you have to come to your position and rise to it because there are angels of God that are in the room and they are here what is it they are here with a purpose in mind to draw you into his presence now you watch when William Brandon would talk about he would talk about demonology and he would talk about he would you would hear him on tape on time he would talk about how that there was somebody that was getting ready to get a blessing and all of a sudden they stood up and went to the bathroom he said it was an evil spirit that led them out now if an evil spirit can make you do that how much more can a holy spirit how much more can a god of mercy and Grace come leading a word of God by your way if an evil spirit's got the power to make you rise up out of your position and walk out of the word surely there's a power here that would anoint you to come run to your position and take your position it's just like when when the angel appeared to Zacharias when he was there he was a just man he was a holy man but yet he was up there and he'd been praying about having a son all of his days he'd got got up there in his older in his older youth at that time and he got up there and he was he was without child but he'd been praying for it and the Bible declares to us that the angel Gabriel came and appeared before him and there he be to deny what he had been praying for he couldn't believe that it was going to happen when he had all of them examples throughout the Old Testament and how God did it but yet he began to begin to doubt what the angel was talking to him I want you to notice what brother maram said here he said now notice he prayed all this time and God was answering his prayer and he said I say this here he said God will answer every sincere pray prayer in his own way it may not come the way that you expect it but he will answer every sincere prayer in the in his own way what was it John the Baptist's parents they were literally being placed by the angel Gabriel into a position that they would recognize that there was a prophet on the scene it was a signal every single time that you see the angel Gabriel show up it's a signal to Israel and it's a signal to the Believers that God is is getting ready to do the miraculous and brother Brandon would say in Jehovah of Miracles he said if you want angels to appear to you keep your mind on God and off of the things of the world he said go about your business go to your church go to your washing of your dishes wherever you are keep your mind on him all day all night all day then God would do something he said you're drawing close to him you've got the world shut out just you and he in there together that's exactly what Mary was doing that morning when when she was out there walking she had done been talking to Joseph about the scriptures and there she was she had her mind on God she was thinking about God and then the angel appears to her what did it do it placed Mary in a position to produce the supernatural let me tell you this was more than a man that met her while she was walking down the street this was an Angelic being that placed her in position and I I want to announce to you that the angel is here to put you in position for the supernatural every time that an angel is shown up in the Bible when you look at it at the brass serpent when Moses would would he would he would build the brass serpent what did it do when the people would come there when they had been bitten by those snakes all they had to do was look on that brass Serpent and they looked and live but it wasn't nothing to do with a brass serpent it wasn't nothing to do their healing did not come from that brass serpent it represented judgment but there the Bible is is very clear on this is that there was an angel that was on that brass Serpent and when they looked on that angel they received their healing just like when they were there at the pool of Bethesda and they said if we'll go by if we're the very first one in the water at a certain season when the angel troubles the water then I'm made whole at that time and men after years after years had tried to get into the water but there laid a man there there laid a man there for 30 8 years with an infirmity in his life and nobody to put him in in the water and he had all kinds of excuses I couldn't get to church on time my hair wasn't done just right nobody was there to get me into church nobody and he blamed it on everybody else but when you have all of your excuses then Jesus shows up to show that he's the god that'll come by a hospital room and put you in the water I'll tell you this church you are in the season you are in the season where the angel of the Lord is troubling the waters all I've got to say to you is get in the water get in the water what is troubling Waters it's the church in her position it's a sign when you see the troubling of waters that's why that's why these meetings have such great significance because it's a sign unto us that the angel is here who draw you here it wasn't just come on it wasn't an invitation it was a holy power that led you here it was not your mama's doings it was not your church is doing there's a power that is drawing you to the power that'll change your [Applause] life what is it you're led by a supernatural being just like when elaser was looking for a wife for his son for Abraham's son Isaac brother random said that when elaser had the assurance that the angel was going before him he said then he could decide he said because he had something to back him up I'll tell you this you got something to back you up you're ambassadors of almighty God the all of Heaven is behind you and if you know this this morning if you'll reach out into a realm and just believe that all things are possible don't you get worried about if it's going to happen don't you get concerned if I raise my hand and I begin to believe on something that that that I that God will let me down God will never let you down it may not come in the way that you're expecting it but I believe that if you can reach into that realm just now where the Supernatural is you can pull out blessings you can pull out deliverances you can pull out breakthroughs you can pull out a body change you can pull out rapsure ready you can pull out a paradox you can pull out things of leadership and things of God that only you what it do brother I love this brother bam said that when eler when elaser was going down there to her kin folk what did he do he loaded up a camel for loads of blessings not for another church age not for another lady but he literally loaded up those camels for that woman do you recognize that all of this Bible has been loaded up for you every Power that you need everything you have need of all the way from Genesis all the way to Revelations he's not holding them back for another church age he's not saying that that should have been done in Luther's day he's not saying that that should have been done in Wesley's day he's not saying that that only happened in the restoration of the gifts of the body but I'm saying this unto you that you're living in the hour where the son of man and he said I'm telling you there's an angel that has gone before you these are your blessings Brothers let me tell you William brandom said every Minister has got a camel full load of blessings and we're not going to hold it back why would I stand there when I watch young girls fighting fear fighting anxiety allow them to stay in that position when I know what they have need of is right here on the camel [Applause] power it's okay this morning okay now brother random would take in 1959 question and answers he now which is it he said an angel is a servant he said' we're Sons and Daughters of God he said which is the most thought of your servant or your son or daughter his Oh my he said prayer from a saint will go a million times higher than any Angel he said because he's a son he didn't come here to place you as a servant he placed you as a son and when you can begin to recognize your position as a Son of God that your prayer goes goes higher than any angel in heaven could ever go I want you to know that when you're in that spot of prayer there are things that the angel Gabriel there are things that warmwood and all of the legions of angels have no clue about because there is something that is happening that can only happen between a son and his father and when you're in that special spot of prayer all of a sudden things begin to transform you don't Hallelujah it don't bring God down to you but it brings you up to God by the power of Prayer and I'll say exactly like William brandham said he said who's got more power an archangel in heaven or a son of God he said a Son of God has got more power than any Angel there is in heaven we seen an angel roll a stone away and we watch it AB obliterate a stone that morning on Easter morning but as Sons and Daughters of God begin to arise to their possession and in their position as manifested Sons and Daughters of God William Brandon would say in the adoption series tell me Brothers has there ever been a time like this time of manifesting Sons and Daughters of God it's time that nature see that you're a Son of God it's time that critics see that you're a Son of God it's time that all the world see that you're a Son of God I'm not telling you something that's far off in some other land it's right here for you he sees you he's elected you he's called you and you're not going to go down in defeat you're Rising we didn't come here to stay seated we come here to stand up like the mighty angel in Daniel 12 and in Revelations 10 what was it Michael standing up and I think it's time that we match the position of the Angel if politics can take their spot if the world leaders can take their spot how much more as sons and daughters of God when the pillar of fire has not left the Church of the Living God but is right here amongst us how much more as Sons and Daughters of God should we rise to our position and personally accept everything that God's given unto us it wasn't just for Georgie Carter it wasn't just for a little fishy but it's for you as the Church of the Living God how in the world did you get in your position when you was in the of the earth when you was in a drought when it didn't look like anybody was coming by your way but an angel with a a strong hand of Mercy reached down and grabbed a hold of you and said that's not your world that's not your position that's not your place you don't have nothing to do with Le osia but you have everything to do with [Applause] heaven when Jesus was speaking with pilate before his crucifixion in John 18:36 he said my kingdom is not of this world he said if my kingdom were of this world then would my servants fight brother Bron picks that up 1949 and deity of Jesus Christ he said if my kingdom is of this world I could call many Legions of angels but my kingdom is not of this world he said but my kingdom is in heaven now notice what he says to you Church and he said the kingdom of God will be within you so therefore the legions and the powers of the backing up of the Holy Angels Allelujah is in you what Born Into You the deity of Jesus Christ by the baptism of the Holy Ghost yes sir ain't no wonder the devil in hell is so worried about you ain't no wonder he's so scared about you there's sometimes there's sometimes that you'll just get on an elevator with somebody that you don't know but there an angel a messenger that is led by God to come and bring Deliverance by your way you'll never know who you're talking to but I think it's amazing today to recognize that's the reason why all of hell is scared of your position because all of Heaven is backing me up I'm going to need some scriptures and quotes for it I'm here for you today because we recognize that when Elijah was standing up up there with his servant Gaza and Gaza was All Shook Up about the armies of Co and the armies of leosia he was shook up about all the enemies that he was seeing out there he be to look and say certain things and Elijah said Lord open up his eyes that he might see that there's more with us than there is against us and Elijah didn't see it with his own eyes but he knew Hallelujah he knew that what David had said in Psalms 34 that the angel of the Lord encampeth about them that fear him he knew what it said in Psalms 91 that I will give my angels charge over thee to keep thee in the way whether you see them today or not we just want to say welcome Holy Angels I know there's more with me I know there's more with me than there is against me and it ought to give you courage I'll give you courage I'll give you courage and I give you an gumption down on the inside of your soul like buddy Robins would say Lord give me courage like the size of a log let let me stand there and let me live that kind of a life I believe that ought to give you encouragement this morning to know that the God that was with Paul is the god that is with you the God that was with William Bram is the god that is with you and he didn't send you down here so that you could fall under the demise of Satan's plans he desired find you for a Rapture and a Rapture is all you're going to take you say brother Andrew I'm I'd give myself over to this message but I'm afraid I'm afraid that it'll rob me of a good time it'll rob me of of my friends it'll rob me of my it'll rob me of my of my prestige in life I'll tell you what this message will do it'll rob you from a tribulation [Applause] it'll rob you from the Judgment it'll rob you from waking up in the middle of the night having a bad old headache wondering where you are strung out on drugs I tell you what this message will do it'll put you in a position that maybe the world might walk away from you but my God the King of Kings the Lord of lords the god that is mighty in battle he won't leave you he won't forsake you oh wave that flag brother it's a sign that the angels of God are in this room come on Tommy run it's yours everything that God has for the church it's given under your hands so let's arise and possess every inheritance he didn't just give it to Andrew Spencer he didn't just give it to Donnie Reagan let's take this message right on into the coming of the Lord Hallelujah somebody stand up and give God praise there's more for you than there is against you he didn't come here just to leave you in your position leave you in your chaos he come to Rob he come to rob you away from Satan the one that he thought had you almighty God is here to deliver boo devil there's more for us brother Arwood than there is against us he's the answer to every problem watch why watch watch Abraham you can be seated if you want to watch Abraham one encounter with MDC was enough was enough what is it one acquaintance one time with MDC and it completely changed the Dilemma that Abraham was in what did he do when he talked to him in Genesis chapter 17 he began to come to him and place him in his rightful position he said now Abram walk before me the all almighty God he said walk before me and be thou perfect and what did he do he changed his name from Abraham five letters to Abraham of seven letters which is a sign what did it do after he changed his name what did it do it matched what God was he departed a part or deposited a part of himself on the inside of Abraham that everywhere Abraham went even though he was in with it before but then he had imparted a part of himself on the inside of Abraham it put him in position for the supernatural when he put the letter H on the inside of Abraham's name he deposited a part of himself so he couldn't leave him when troubles arise he couldn't lose him when Sarah was Miffy he could not lose him because God had imparted a part of himself on the inside of Abraham but I want you to know he didn't leave Sarah without it he imparted a part of her so that she would have the same Revelation that Abraham would have and after he changed Abraham's name when MDC come walking down that old dusty road there was three that was walking down there but William Brandon would say watch the effect of the vision that it had upon Abraham he said when there was three out there he said what did he do he said my Lord he he said he didn't see three he didn't say three he said but my Lord but watch those two angels go down their gr and oh Roberts go down there to Le osia and he said lot said my lords because the Revelation that was deposited to Abraham was matching the vision that he was the all-sufficient Elohim and William Brandon would say that Abraham's seed is to receive the same thing in this generation you can't see three gods if you wanted to because God has imparted a part of himself on the inside of the Church of the Living God what was it Abraham matched MDC Every Breath You Take expresses love to Yahweh when an atheist breathes he's breathing breath and he's breathing out the name Yahweh it has been studied out in the Jewish language that the breath that comes from you spells out of Y wa so if an atheist breathes a breath they're praising God you can't tell me there is no Jehovah he is my Yahweh he is Jehovah savior he is Jehovah tisu he is Jehovah Shalom he is Jehovah Rafa he is Jehovah ra my shepherd He is Jehovah madim he is yah way and he's all powerful he's omnipotent what did he do to Abraham he imparted his breath on the inside of Abraham because Abram could not do it on his own he could not bring worth a baby on his own he tried in his natural birth to have a holy ghost sensation without having God on his side so he produced it in the carnal by his wife Hagar but when MDC came he breathed into him the very life what was it it wasn't God it wasn't just Abraham but it was God and Abraham having a relationship and It produced a life that would testify that there's a greater Isaac that's coming it changed his name to match the character of who he was he changed Abram to Abraham he changed Sarah to Sarah he changed Jacob to Israel because Jacob's nature would never match what God had for him in his Destiny as Jacob as a Shyer as a liar as a troublemaker so he had a destiny that was in front of him so he had to change his name to match his nature he CH he changed Saul to Paul because he had a destiny in front of him so that it would match the destiny that was in front of him brother Joe that it would line up with what he had on the inside of him hallelujah hallelujah what did he do in this generation what did he do to you he said I'll no longer call you church because you can't match my inspiration you can't match my message message as a church therefore I will no longer call you church but I'll call you bride why because I've got to have a woman that is on this Earth that will match my inspiration that'll match who I am somebody that'll love me somebody that'll be there for me what did he do in this generation when William brandom when his great-grandfather was back there and was running from the law they changed his name from brandham to Branham in this generation because we know that it had to be thus and thus because never before time until Billy Graham come upon the scene has God ever had a messenger with the last word of ham it's since Abraham but Graham as we know is six letters but what did he do in this generation he was telling us he was pointing to us that Billy Graham did not have the power to match the rapturing message but there had to be a seventh angel that had had a name change that would match the destiny that's for the Church of the Living God so he wrote his name as an eternal sign before William brandom or any of us was here on Earth he gave him an eternal sign out there in the west he called out his ministry when he's standing there and standing in the Gap he told us he said if I could have had my own will I would have been a Trapper I'd have been no good I was going to leave and go up in the mountains and only be a Trapper and I'd come down out of the mountains and I'd preach when God would give me a visitation but then God be to show William brandom if you do that you'll lose your friends you'll lose your wife I'm so thankful that William brandham told told that because it showed us that even Prophet wanted his own will and there has been countless times in your life when you wanted your own will and if you'd have had your own will you'd have been in some Honky Tonk you'd have been in somebody else's arms you'd have been out there in the world strung out on different things maybe had a religious spirit on you but now because you didn't choose your will because there was a destiny that was over your life you had to line up with what God had already saw before you can't run away from this predestination you can run with everything you want to but you'll never get away from it because there's a call there's an election I feel good I feel good you can't get away from it you can't hide me from it you can try to shove me in a dungeon but I still believe this message you can try to shut me up but I still believe this message I feel good to know that God didn't send me a message a message of defeat a message of disgrace but he sent me a message of Grace to put me in position that will line up with what he thought of me before men had their ideas of me before men criticized me almighty God had a thought of me what was it he said Billy didn't know what was happening in the car he said but the angel was talking to me the angel was talking to me said if You' have went on your your plans he said but look over there to the mountains he said I don't see nothing I don't see nothing and he made him stop he said how many mountain peaks are on that he said seven he said it matches your name before before Noah got on a boat there was a mountain that spelled out an eternal sign William Mary and Brandon what did it do it didn't just tell him his name but it told him that you were in there I done listen to that tape 100 times brother Andrew and I ain't heard my name I heard it a 100 thousand times because he told me that that that last mountain peak was my third pole and I saw myself brother Matthew I saw myself right there that I'm a part of that third pole people that there I am there I am even though Satan might war against me he might try to rob me he try he might try to do all kinds of things but there as an eternal sign I am matched up you can't separate me from the messenger I am the message come on now brother Andrew surely you don't believe it if you don't believe that you're a part of this message then you ought to run to this altar but you cannot separate me from William brandom he's my Prophet messenger but you can't separate me from Jesus because he is my message blessed be the name of the Lord Satan may come trials may come but I have failed my position it has been been announced unto me by a mighty angel you're not here on your own [Applause] accord hallelujah it's a signal to all of Hell there's an abstract title minded people here on Earth that knows what he wants done with the word there's a Harmony between her there's a hidden power that's laying on the inside of her and there's an angel that is here that has accompanied the Church of the Living God that is constantly vindicating the word what are you doing you're constantly expressing what he had on the inside of him what did he do what did he do when you see him in Revelations chapter 10 we saw a mighty Angel but do you see your position as pillars of fire standing over the land and the Sea if Satan is out from underneath your feet he's out of his position it's time it's time that the Church of the Living God put Satan right back in his right position he's been reigning over you reigning over your life he's been trying to rob your family he's been trying to rob your joy it's time that he finds his position back under your feet and if he ain't under your feet get him back underneath of your position as a son and daughter of God robed in the robes as a Son of God hallelujah walking with the message believing the message living the message live such a holy life that the devil will never be able to put a fingerprint upon your hand I believe that we ought to be able to live the message talk the message show the message so that every devil in hell knows that where I life young people it's time you take back everything the devil stole from you he took away your joy take it back he took away your peace take it back he took away your influence take it back blessed be the name of the Lord God it's not just for preachers it's for housewives William Brandon would say give me a man give me a woman that'll so completely serve God and I'll show you a man that the devil don't know what to do with him get out of here devil get out of my mind get out of my home get out of my church get out of my [Applause] family you're in it you're right here where he saw you you're right here in the final climax where God saw you elected you for this position what is it you're elected to this seat you're elected to this position come on somebody this ain't God standing up and saying any many mighty mo catch a tiger by his toe I choose this one but he elected you he called you and you are seen there in Revelations chapter 3 and 21 that we will be sitting with him in his throne what is his throne it's a domain it's a kingdom from this eternity that at that eternity there's a gene seat of God that is pushing you towards the matching of the message now surely if he can do it for a little insignificant fish and you're a third pole people and you have an eternal sign over you how much more is your little insignificant need sister Dorothy how much more is it that he could look out there and make it be accomplished if it was enough if if had had enough power that she could attach herself to a third pole Ministry and prodal would fall to their feet how about prodical when did we stop applying the token to our house it ain't just some tape it's a life so if hat rght had the power to say the right thing and you're a third pole people how much more should you be able to align yourself with a third pole Ministry and say I'm taking back my prodal I tell you make room for them make room for them and if you don't want to serve God God will bring a prodal back to the house of God that's not ashamed to worship that's not ashamed to testify that's not ashamed to tell there is a God that works at Word of Life you're a third po people pull the sword live this [Applause] message if it was speak storms out of existence just for a few guys on a mountain how about your Mountain how about your troubles why don't you take this message in your position not out of your emotion not out of your feelings not because you need it to happen but as your position that's why when I come to this Altar and I pray over you I never pray over you as just Andrew Spencer but I recognize that you have came to an office an office that was set up before I was ever here I take it very personal and I believe that you ought to recognize the office that God has put you in as the Bride of Jesus Christ you recognize your position if he could speak storms out of existence and he could start taking a walk with King theophany how much more can you start taking a walk with your theophany that one of these days you'll take a step half a way this way and they'll take a half a step that way and in a moment what is it you're aware you're aware that this ain't just some preaching you're aware of it it's in the room you feel it you're acquainted with this presence it comes here on Wednesdays it comes here Sundays he meets you in your car you're aware that it's more than a man you're here you feel his anointing what is it it's a sign to you that you have a power to reach out and touch him and maybe you're like that little woman that had a blood issue she didn't need to touch his hand she didn't need just to touch his head all she needed was Touch The Fringe of His Garment maybe that's your condition right here I'm coming to you maybe that's your condition where all you feel like you got enough strength is to reach through the crowd and Touch the Hem of His Garment but he's here for you you got more power than you think science tells us that when we get to the end of our strength when we think we can't go no more we

run they have to walk then they go and do all these pull-ups when they get to their end of their Reserve there's somebody there to tell them you got 30% left when you think you can't go no more when you think you can't handle it no more you still got 30% left that's just in your natural but I want to remind you who's standing behind you you ain't just got 30% you got 100% of all of Heaven that is standing behind you why don't you go ahead and claim everything that you have need of claim the Holy Ghost claim the baptism of the spirit claim you're a son and daughter of God claim your position

can a third pole people call for Ron Spencer and tumors dissolve how much more for your situation he didn't bring you here to manifest your power just to set you down in some Corner we got to roll a thumb around here back up back up because there's power here there's an anointing here there's a power here Satan knows that something's happening you're beginning to recognize that faith is beginning to rise in this place you're beginning to you're watching it It's Beginning to rise in this place and faith is grabbing a hold of you you can live the message you can live this message you can't live this message young people God didn't raise you up just to see you fall in De feet you can live this message if he could create squirrels with a third pole Ministry what about you creating yourself such an atmosphere where you live such a life that only you and God are there it's for you it's for your household it's for your life it's for your testimony it's for your family it's for your church it's for this time it ain't another age coming but it's for this time and you're going to live it I got some news for you I got some news from home you're going to make it you're going to make it brother Jason we're going to make it we going to be there we went through some trials we went through some tough times but we going to make it the message is true the Angel's still here he's an awesome God and he sees you he saw [Applause] you I had a man I'm closing I'm closing I had a man working on my house one time he's I'm not very much of a builder I'm the kind of guy that can build a chicken coop and watch it fall down I have that much uh Contracting skills on the inside of me I'm a real blessing if you want want demolition you call the Spencers if you want somebody to build something you call brother Donnie Reagan but there is something that we have in common we are very good at tearing down straight Satan strongholds we work as a pretty good team together but I had this I had this man that was how y'all doing up here I'm sorry I missed you I've been preaching these people down here all day and I didn't know y'all was God bless y'all I bless you I'm glad God didn't miss you cuz I did I had this I had this man that was working on my house one time and he was he's a pretty good contractor and uh he was telling me that he went and worked for he went and worked for he went and work for an ambassador that was up there living in Washington DC and he was building a certain certain case that was for him he was building such things that he needed on his property and he said I had to sign all kinds of things he said when I went under when I went into his position and his driveway and all these things I've never seen so many Secret Service people and all these things just going around my going around my car and he said he's going around with mirrors and everything checking everything out underneath of me and he said I went in there and he said he said when I got in there he said when I got in there he said he said I found out that I was no longer he was an ambassador from from a a country across across the seas and he said when I found out he said when I stood there on that property even though I was still in the United States he said I found out he said I was no longer on the United States because it was his Turf then he said he was there as a jurisdiction of that country and I was on his Turf then do you hear me do you hear me this ain't his domain this is your domain you're an ambassador from another kingdom every demon has to Bow every depression every anxiety even all the way all the way when you go all the way back home young people remind the devil you're not on my you're not on your turf you're on my turf I have power I have an anointing and when the anointing oil was rolled off of David he positionally placed him as a king but he went back to being a Shepherd but there was something in him always to be a king you're Sons and Daughters of God and if it's one thing that we ought to recognize we didn't make oursel this he hath made us Kings and Priests somebody give the Lord a hand clap of praise Hallelujah ain't it good to recognize that you didn't put yourself here but the mighty Angel stood in this generation and placed you musicians won't you come hallelujah what an awesome God God he sees you he knows you you're not too far from him he's right here in this place to reach out and touch your life how mean he has a need my Lord hallelujah almighty God Lover of My Soul Giver of every good gift the one that handed us this book for we could recognize our name was written on the Lamb's Book of Life before the world was created we were seen with that lamb father these hands that are lifted up in this place oh God I know many of them are Desiring the baptism of the Holy Ghost many of them are seeking Deliverance oh God lord we feel the pull of their needs upon us just this morning and we invite you Lord God just now to come move across this congregation and have your own way in their life may they recognize that it's not some far off distant but it's right there by them and they can bump right into a world that can completely Chang their situation father into your hands we commit these needs just now brother to a brother sister to a sister all over I want you to lay your hands over on one another just now God sees you and he's not left you here without a witness but right now he can take Shing go and remove them out of this place he can take heart disease and move it out of his place he can cause kidney failures to completely dry up he's a God that sees family matters when maybe they won't even come to the house of God but he sees your witness that you could he deposits something on the inside of you that would cause an attraction to the manifestation of who he is Father God hands are laid on one another throughout this building just now Lord I don't have the power or the ability to pray for every one of them but the same power that is laying here upon the bosom of my soul is laid out across this congregation science even tells us and is a witness to us that when we lay our hands over on one another that a light is transferred oh God I pray in this place just now father that there would be demonstrations of the acts of your word not just something that we read about but I pray that there would be a significant impression of the Holy Ghost that would be placed upon the brother and sister's lives that their hand is laid upon I ask father that you would come and demonstrate your power Lord if angels would come and put Samuel's parents in their position zachariah's parents in their position to watch the messenger come father you have came this day this hour this scripture is fulfilled and we recognize that you have come and you have placed the Church of the Living God back in her rightful position I call for healing through these bodies I call for a Deliverance of those that are bound just now father May Satan take his dirty hands off of God's Property and may sons that are bound and daughters that are bound with fear may they run out of this place completely made whole say and take your leave just now you are no longer welcome in our mind in our spirit in our soul you're not welcome and we dismiss you in the name of Jesus Christ and father we invite you to bring healing to our body to restore our mind you have not given us the spirit of fear but of love and of a sound mind father to do thy will I pray that you'd have your way in this place just now father God according to the grace of God May these things be done that it was spoken and now it is finished I've been struggling with it a long time brother Andrew is it for me William Brandon would say in the seventh seal that it is a sign of the end of all struggling you are in a generation where you can recognize that you don't have to struggle with it no more you can have it you can accept it and it's yours hallelujah how many wants to give witness hallu I you and I know your kind of spirit I know what kind of people that you are that if I would give you a gift I know what kind of spirit that you got on you that You' turn around and thank me for it wouldn't you that you kind of spirit that you have on you so if I was you I'd turn around and thank God for it what were them Apostles and disciples doing up there in the upper room before ever they ever got it they were thanking God for it why why don't you before you see your Miracle come in the room why don't you thank him for it
