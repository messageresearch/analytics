All the wealth I want worldly baby. Good still. I wouldn't take nothing from my journey now. [Applause] I started out traveling for the Lord many years ago. I've had a lot of heartache, had a lot of grief and war. But when I would stumble, then I would all die. I'd say nothing for my journey now. I wouldn't take nothing for my journey now. I got to make it to heaven somehow. Oh, the devil just be tries to turn me around. He's offered everything that's God and ain't the wealth I want and worldly fame. If I could still, I wouldn't take nothing for my journey now. There's nothing in the world that could ever take the place of God's love. All the silver and gold can ever find my love. When my soul is healing, I begin to feel his power. I can say thank the Lord for my journey now. Take nothing to heaven somehow tries to turn me around. He's all got all the world still on my journey now. I wouldn't change nothing for my journey. Now I got to make it to heaven somehow. Though the devil tempts me, tries to turn me around. He's offered everything that's God and a wealth I want and worldly fame. If I could still, it would take nothing for my journey now. Now I started out traveling for the Lord many years ago. [Music] I've had a lot of heartache, had a lot of troubles and war, but when I would stumble, then I would humble down. &gt;&gt; I would say thank the Lord for my journey now. I wouldn't take nothing from my journey now. I got to make it to heaven somehow. Though the devil tips me, tries to turn me around.

And we may go just a little bit over in preliminaries this morning, but I think we'll be all right. We're fixing to hear from the Lord here just in a little bit. I believe God's going to give give us exactly what we have need of in this service today. Amen. I want to got a special real special song for you. Sister Burns and her daughter.

Give him one more good hand clap of praise this morning if you love him. A new singer. We're glad. We're glad of it, aren't we? &gt;&gt; Appreciate them. Give him a good hand this morning if you would. [Music] Well, blue skies and hillsides feel so far away. And I wrote in my notebook that I've seen better days than the ones as of late. I can't bear the weight. The rain won't stop pouring out my window pane. And I haven't left my bedroom in 76 days. I wish something would change cuz I'm losing faith. So I brought it up in a desperate prayer. Lord, why are you keeping me here? Then he said to me, child, I'm planting seeds cuz I'm a good God and I have a good plan. So trust that I'm holding a watering can. And someday you'll see that flowers grown in the valley. So whatever the reason, I'm barely getting by. I'll trust it's a season knowing that you're by my side every step of the way. And I'll be okay cuz I brought it up in a desperate prayer. Lord, why are you keeping me here? Then he said to me, "Child, I'm planting seeds cuz I'm a good God and I have a good plan. So trust that I'm holding a watering game. And someday you'll see that flowers grow in the valley [Music] when I'm on the mountain and looking down below. I'll see a valley of flowers that need a time to grow. And I'll thank you for the rain. The hurting days of pain. And I'll bring it up in a grateful prayer. Thank you, Jesus, for keeping me there. You know just what I need. And you've planted seeds cuz you're a good God with a real good plan. And you hold my world and a watering can so I can have peace. Cuz flowers grow in the valley.

And praise uses to the great I am. Oh, we will live in the light of the risen lamb. [Music] You see all around all the nations bow down to sing. The only sound is the praises to Christ our king. Slowly the names from the book are read. I know the king. So there's no need, no need to dread. Oh, no more night, no more pain. Oh, no more tears. Never crying again. and praise uses to the great I am. Oh, we will live in the light of the rich sun. You see over there, there's a body and it's prepared just for me where we will live with our Savior eternally. No more night. There'll be no no more pain. There'll be no more tears. Never crying again. and praise to the great I am. Oh, we will live. [Music] We're going to live. Oh, we will live in the light of the rich. Hey, risen life. [Music] [Applause] [Music] We had two that left us this week. Precious people. Brother Steve, Sister Patty. If somebody had walked up to them and said, "If you'll stay here, we're going to give you all the money you could ever spend. We're going to give you all the property that you could ever enjoy. They wouldn't trade that for what I believe they heard. Welcome home. That's our goal is to hear him say, "Welcome home." Is that your desire today? This song, hope we can sing it for you this this morning. Most of all, I want to look upon the master. [Music] Things of earth no longer matter on that morning when the skies are split. and saints are called away. &gt;&gt; Oh, that's right. &gt;&gt; Most of all, I want to be among that number, the bride of Christ set aart in wide. [Music] Most of all, I want to look upon the master and sing praises when at last small. I want to know I run the race. Hear Jesus say I'll help you. And most of all, I ought to hear you say, "Well done. [Music] Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Now everything down here will dim and lose its value. &gt;&gt; We compare with all the glory we'll behold. But most of all, just to look upon my savior, it'll make you heaven. If there were no streets of closely the same with most of all I want to look upon the master and sing praises when at last the battle won. I want to know I've run the race. Hear Jesus say and most of all I want to hear well done. I want you to know I've run the race. Here Jesus say the faith. And most of all, I want to hear well done. [Music] [Applause] I don't hear that. My goodness. But if I do hear that, won't that be awesome &gt;&gt; to me? There's nothing greater that we could hear than for the King of Kings to look at us that day and say, "Well done." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then if you done all kinds of things, you know, if you just uh you were wealthiest person in the world, rich, famous, important, celebrity, and all that sort of thing. and to hear him say, "Depart from me. I never knew you." What good would all that do you in life? &gt;&gt; Then if you was religious and a churchgoer and you'd given up a lot of things for what you thought was Christianity and you still hear him say that. To me, that would be even worse. That makeeliever person is the one that's really the bad one. &gt;&gt; But we don't have to be that today. &gt;&gt; No. Aren't you glad you are a believer? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We welcome you today. We certainly appreciate the opportunity that we can be together again. And brother Louie has already expressed about brother Steve Newsome gone to his reward and sister Patty. And as I've said it before, we're getting more and more and more on the other side. I believe we're getting closer and closer with every one of them. Don't you? &gt;&gt; Yes. Let's read about today and talk about what will help us to get there and when we stand before him that day that we won't have to be disappointed. Apparently, the prophet preached that sermon before they maybe before they started recording his sermons. I'm not sure exactly, but he referred back to it uh several different times through the years. And he said, "Many of you old-timers remember that I preached a sermon on disappointed people at the judgment." Then he goes to listing different people, the prostitute, the drunk, the liar, you know, lots of those people is that they won't be disappointed, but it's a person who feels like that they were right with God and that they were going to church and all that and they'll be the ones that'll be disappointed. I'm afraid that looking at some of these things that we've been looking at in the scripture, it's going to be some of the folks that's going to miss this mark right here that's going to be the most disappointed. There's going to be folks around this message that'll feel like because they play tapes or because they dress a certain way or do a certain thing that they're definitely going to be there. They're going to be bride. But you see, if we miss the requirement of the bridegroom himself, we won't be there. &gt;&gt; Friends, we don't get a second chance. It's not like let us see a church age be played back over again. If you miss it, get a second try. This is your one try, your one chance. So, we want to make the best of it, don't we? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; By the grace of God. &gt;&gt; Second Peter chapter 1 verse two. And if you all be patient with me today, we might get done with patience. &gt;&gt; All right. Of &gt;&gt; course, then we're going to godliness. So, I'm not sure if you're any better off or not. &gt;&gt; I've been enjoying it. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Sort of. &gt;&gt; Sort of. &gt;&gt; I've never heard so many comments about anything I've ever preached as patients. &gt;&gt; But it's been people praying that I'd hurry. and they're hoping and praying to God that I don't make a series out of this one word, I think. &gt;&gt; But if we need it, I say, Lord, grant it to us. &gt;&gt; Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord, according as his divine power hath given unto us all things, I love that, that pertain unto life and godliness. Godliness, you know what it means? To be like God comes from the root Greek word theos which means God which is the same word we get our word theophony from theos to be like God through the knowledge of him that hath called us unto glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be protected makers of the divine nature, having es escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue, and to virtue knowledge, and to knowledge temperance, and to temperance patience, and to patience godliness, and to godliness brotherly kindness, and to brotherly kindness, charity. I may like to be remembered today as we pray. Amen. Me, too. Heavenly Father, we have been blessed just to be here already this morning, hearing these songs and sensing your presence here. And we believe that you're here to do some wonderful things for us today. Dear God, we've not come just as uh a lot of folks would come to church on Sunday morning to show off their clothes or meet with one another and talk about our business deals or this or that, but we've come to worship, to pray, to praise, oh God. We've come to see one another, sure, but we've come mainly to hear from you. I pray you'd help us today, Lord. One of these days, if we go by the way of the grave, each of us are going to face what our brother Steve Newsome faced and what our sister Patty faced. Dear God, we want to be ready. When they go there, I won't be able to go with them. They'll take no money. They'll take none of their clothes. They'll take none of their possessions. They'll only take with them their character. So, Father, then if that's all we're going to take when we face man's greatest fear, then we believe our character is the most important thing that we could be preparing for. So, help us today, Lord, as we look into your word. We commit the service, the speakers, the hearers to you. speak to us, Father, in the name of the Lord Jesus. And the saints said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You may be seated. Let me read to you again the meaning of the word patience. And who knows, it might be the last time for a while that I've read it to you. You just never know about the Lord what he's going to do. Though I may think I'm done with it, and he'll tell me to come back again the next time I'm going to preach and say, "Take a 27 months series on it." And I'll say, "All right, Lord. I'll do it if that's what you want me to do. cuz I've found out a long time ago that he knows more about church than I do. &gt;&gt; He knows more about me than what I do. And he knows more about you than what you do. &gt;&gt; Uh Peter in using this word. Now remember Peter started out as a man that was ignorant and unlearned. And every time I read his epistles, I marvel because it does not sound like a man that was ignorant or unlearned at all. It sounds like the man that you would think had a great education and not a lot of understanding and using Greek words that were so precise for the epistle that he was going to read. You would think this was a guy that knew all the pneumatics and all the dip thongs and all the things that's Greek language that he knew all of that so perfectly and that he studied him. You know what I see that it was the spirit of God taking that man and using him. But now remember he was not just writing words. That was not a reality. But Peter had experienced these things on his own. And the word patience is enduring patient continuence, patient waiting, steadfastness. In the New Testament, the characteristic of a man who is not swerved from his deliberate purpose and his loyalty to faith and piety by even the greatest trials and sufferings patiently and steadfastly. Now, we know that people can read the Bible and and we be honest today that there are people that are greater theologians than most of us will ne ever be, including me. Now, I've studied the Bible for a long time. Read the Bible. I do all kinds of studying, looking at all different sorts of dictionaries and this and that and the other. But there are theologians that would just make me feel like I was probably a kindergarten student and they would be able to say great big old long words and I wouldn't even know what they was talking about. I've got a few message brothers that do that. And whenever they'll send me a text every now and then, I'll have to get my phone out and type in on the dictionary what they're even saying. I'm not sure why they're saying that cuz they know know I'm dumber than a coal bucket anyway. But I guess they just want to impress me somehow. But you know, there's people that would outdo us as far as wit and would outdo us maybe as far as understanding great big words. But when I read this, this is what I like to keep in mind. This is the very man who wrote this by the spirit of God. And he wrote this scripture. But he not only wrote it as a man of understanding, but he wrote it as a man of experience. Now, we all know that understanding is a great thing and we have to have it. But there's something about experience that is such a teacher. Many of you have went through tremendous times in your life and trials and tests. And maybe before you had a particular trial, someone else would have gone through something similar and you would have heard them talk about it and you'd have give them scripture to encourage them and you would have tried to set a word of encouragement to help them because you love them. But when that thing turns around and hits you and then you go to experiencing what they went through, isn't it amazing how it illuminates you and how it illuminates me and illuminates us as the people of God? And we go to realizing that just the letter of the word never gave us the full understanding of that situation. Can anybody say amen? Now, there were people who lost husbands and wives and children and things like that to disease or by an automobile accident. And you went to their their viewing and maybe to their funeral and you walked up there and you said, "I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry for your loss. May God help you." And you were doing the best that you knew. But when that same situation happened to you, it brought you into a place of understanding that you never knew. You thought, you knew, and you might have even ventured to say, "I know what you're going through." But once it happened to you, you realize you didn't have a clue what they were going through. You were just trying to say some nice consoling words. And you were saying that those words from something that you meant, something you were sincere about, but you were not saying it from experience. But there's something about experience. Now remember God is the fountain of all pure knowledge, pure wisdom, pure understanding, pure logos of God. And he himself had to experience sickness, death, suffering, loneliness, people treating you wrong, people being mean to you in order for he himself to understand it. That's one of the reasons that he come to the earth so that he could become a high priest. He could have become a high priest by nosis, by knowledge, just by saying, "Okay, I'm God. I I I relate to a degree to what they're going through. They're mortals. They've fallen. They're humans, but they can't be like me." But he knew that would not be sufficient. So he had to allow himself to feel like a man being tempted to do something wrong. He had to allow himself the feeling when he was carried up to the pinnacle of the temple and the devil showed him the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time and when the prophet referred to that in the seal book and he said what a creature. Can you imagine? Satan carried him ahead in the future and showed him Germany. He showed him Europe. He showed him the UK. He showed him all the continent of Africa. He showed him the United States of America. Carried him forth from that time frame around, you know, 30 AD, something like that, all the way up through the 15th, 16th, 17th, 18, 21st century, 22nd, however far it'll go. Showed him every kingdom of the world that would ever be in a moment of time. And Jesus allowed himself as a man to feel the desire to want all of those kingdoms and want all of those thrones and want all of those crowns and show him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time. And remember done no good now unless the Lord Jesus would have allowed himself to feel similar to the way you and I feel when we're tempted. either tempted to go away, tempted to rely on our own understanding, tempted to do whatever it is that we're tempted to do wrong by. And once he allowed himself to feel that, then he could step into the office truly of high priest, not Melzdc. Now remember Melazdc is not the office of the mediatorial work. Melchazdc pre-existed the Arenaic priesthood. it it will outlast any priesthood upon the earth. But this is not the reason that he come. Melzdc appeared to Abraham in Genesis 18. So that was not necessary for another reappearing of Melzdc to come in that form. But it must be in the form of a priesthood which could relate to human beings. Melchazdc cannot relate to the temptation of a woman. Melchazdc could not relate to the temptation of a man being tempted to drink alcohol or a woman to dress indecent or ungodly. No way he could. He was not a human. But yet God wanted to become a man that he would be able to feel how we feel. He wanted to feel the embarrassment of temptation, the shame of temptation, the humiliation of living in a body which is unbecoming. you feel humiliated as especially as we get older and we lose our ability to recall and we lose our ability to not remember this and remember that and you get down on your knees and you can't hardly get up again and you old people can say amen if you know what amen is you still remember amen you old folks all right and then these young folks are just sitting here looking at us and smiling like I don't know what don't smile long honey you'll be where we are before long but you see what is that it's a tabernacle of humiliation. You remember, I used to run. I used to be able to do this and that and the other, but now this old body and your mind, you still think you can till you get down there and can't get back up. And then you say, "Well, somebody help me, please." And you realize that your mind and your body, you've still got both of them pretty much, but but the body still just can't do what it used to do. There's a humiliation in that, is there not older people? There's a humiliation in having to ask people to help you do this and help you do that. Used to, brother D. We could do it on our own. Now, can you imagine God entering into the humiliation of this tabernacle called the tabernacle of humiliation? And why did he do it? For your sake. So that he would be able to experience it in the way you do. So he must allow himself to feel it when people would try him. And when the disciples would argue and fuss back and forth who's going to be the greatest, he had to feel that let down and that disappointment. Are you kidding? Am I wasting my time? Am I wasting my time trying to live for these guys and trying to preach to them the truth and they go ahead and do whatever they want to? Anyway, he had to feel that element of humiliation. Now remember this man who God used to write this was one of the greatest examples of weakness that we have in any of the apostles. So he himself had come through the building stage now where he is here in second Peter that he would allow the spirit of God to mature this patience in him. So Peter wasn't just writing some good theological terms, but Peter had allowed this to happen in his own life. God had added one virtue to another to another. I can follow that kind of a man. &gt;&gt; I don't mind telling you friends, I can't I can't take correction from a man I ain't got no confidence in. I just can't do it. No, I cannot do it because preachers is going to have to preach correction. And there will be times they won't have no quote or no scripture to back it up. And if I ain't got confidence in the way that man lives himself, I can't take correction from it. I want to see a man that lives. I want to see a man that lives what he preaches. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. Well, you know, God understood exactly the same thing. So now, let's look at this man then. What he was before he himself got built up into the image of the living God. by what he has become here in second Peter. Now watch him in Matthew chapter 18 21. Then came Peter to him. That would do you good when you get time to read this entire 18th chapter because this question comes from the precedent that the Lord Jesus had been talking about about forgiveness and harmony in the body and all that. Now he knew at the time of course the disciples could not do this. This is only only applicable to those who have eternal life. and he knew they could not do it yet, but he's setting forth the seed. So, Peter hears it. And it seems as if though that Jesus is saying so much about forgiveness and and just, you know, forgiving those that do whatever they do to you that Peter took it. Now, watch this question. It was this as if though that Peter took it, oh my goodness, th this is going to be greatly abused. Th this is going to be abused. So he he takes it on himself to try to help the Lord Jesus to clarify this. So you read the entire chapter, you'll see what I'm saying. So notice then came Peter to him and said, "Lord, how oft shall I shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him?" Now notice Peter's question has been set in such a way to help clarify all the forgiveness and all the love and all the mercy that Jesus is talking about. So Peter's going to ask him to help Jesus to to clarify. You know, well, we've got people the same way today, of course, and they feel like that they need to help bring clarity to the word because the word isn't clear enough, but it's clear enough. But you know what Peter actually done? He opened the door more a little more so Jesus could burn his hide a little bit more than he already done. That's what I found out. We have to be kind of careful in the questions that we're asking cuz he'll really send you if you just keep on going. So sometimes you're better off to sit there and act like you're done. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now what? So Peter came and said, "Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me?" How often? Now notice the key word oft. So he's asking, "So how frequent shall my brother sin against me and me forgive?" Now this sounds kind of odd, but yet remember Peter was taught by the Jews. This was their teaching in this time frame that you were to forgive your brothers and your sisters at least three times but not four. &gt;&gt; So Peter actually doubled this. Now he is stretching himself I mean big time. So no doubt he could have pounded his chest and think man alive Jesus is going to be so proud of me. I'm going to go beyond the teaching of the Pharisees, the Sadducees, the Essenes, the Herodians, cuz this was the common belief among the majority of the Jews at this time frame that you forgive people three times. But when they sin against you the fourth time, you are not obligated to forgive them at all. &gt;&gt; Wow. Some of us ain't even Jews and we do that. Oh &gt;&gt; well, praise the Lord. Help us, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Now, notice how often times now double what he's taught is the standard. Double. So, he's going beyond it. Now, Jesus is merciful and Jesus is grace. So he thinks and is thinking no doubt he is going way up here beyond what the Pharisees believe. I I found this meaning of forgive and I thought it was absolutely awesome and I want to share it with you. To forgive is to treat as though the offense &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; was not committed. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Wow. to declare that we will not harbor malice or treat unkindly, but that the matter shall be buried and forgotten. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, y'all want me to close now or go on a little farther? &gt;&gt; Now, look how different that forgiveness really is in compared to what people think that it is. So now Peter says,"Lord, shall I forgive my brother then till seven times?" So the Jews then being around him and no doubt hearing this and they're saying, "Boy, Peter has really Peter has really grown since I know him, man." Yeah. I mean, this message has really done something for Peter. Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee until seven times, but until 70* 7. Now, revenge is natural to the natural man. It's something that can come in a natural way to human beings because unconverted man is a vindictive get even being. &gt;&gt; Now, some more than others, but some will hold grudges for years. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. And yet claim to be Christians and even claim to have the Holy Ghost. and they will hold a grudge and become vindictive. They won't speak to you. They won't smile at you. They won't shake your hand and claim they're filled with the Holy Ghost. So why? Because it is natural by man's fallen nature to be vindictive. So it's very difficult for human beings most of them to be able to forgive people of the injuries that they placed upon them. Now whether they've done a bad business deal or they've hurt their feelings and they've maybe embarrassed them or you know whatever it can be it can it can involve many many things. And you're the Lord Jesus. I I I would love to have seen Peter's face when the Lord Jesus says no Peter but I say unto you unto 70 times of course which is 490 times but actually when you understand the Jewish language Jesus wasn't just limiting it to 490 times you see the sevens come into completion which rolls right back out into unfathomable ends. So in other words, you never stop forgiving them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So some of you thought seven was bad and you thought 490 was worse. Let me give you a worse scenario. If you like grudges, &gt;&gt; there is no end to forgiveness. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm only talking, of course, to people that's born again, &gt;&gt; not just Christians, not just message people and church people, that sort of thing. They can never do that. Totally impossible. &gt;&gt; Totally impossible. So, seven sevens, 70* 7 490 times. So seven being the completion 490 of course added to that. So in other words Peter it absolutely once you get born again it will never stop. You will actually break into a realm of forgiveness that you cannot even comprehend. So 490 times in one day. Now remember Jesus sets it forth in the right angle that if the brother comes to you and he states it in Luke how that if the man comes to you and said forgive me brother I've trespassed against you. I'm sorry. And then Jesus says then you must forgive the man. So how often are we to forgive till we get up to 490 times? Any of y'all got a tablet on your phone or you got a thing that brother Donny sinned against me 398 times. I'll tell you one thing. He's treading on my mercy. He's treading on my forgiveness. Boy, a few more times. I'll never have to forgive him again. He looked right at me when he said that. Who am I supposed to look at when I'm preaching? Y'all want me to start preaching to the baptistry and you see the back of my head all the time? I reckon I got to preach to human beings. You showed up today. Oh my. Well, the deacon spoke to my son. I'll tell you one thing. That's 395 times. They better not do that again. I'm running out of patience. But you know, when you really get the Holy Ghost and you're filled with the spirit of God, one of the first things you'll do is throw away that pen and paper keeping up a record of the trespasses and the faults of your brothers and sisters because you have broke into a sphere. This is why I say, friends, I've said it for years. I'm going to keep on saying it. One of the biggest lacks in the ranks of this message is people that are truly born again and filled with the Holy Ghost. It's evident. It's evident by the way we argue and fuss and debate and you get among preachers and they're some of the worst ones you ever seen in your life. You think you're this preacher's best friend and that one's best friend and that one's best friend until you cross them on their theology. Uh-huh. And then when you cross them on their theology and you no longer believe exactly what they believe on this or that, you know what they'll do? They'll cut you off. Every move that's been around this message has done exactly that. You know what? We're not short on all kinds of new fang dangled ideas and doctrines. But I'll tell you where, we're short on the stature of perfect men and women of God. We're short on forgiveness. We're short on being godly like God wants us to be. How easy we will ride off our friends and our brothers and ride off churches and this and that because we disagree and we move right on with our little so-called revival and we won't even speak to people. Preach, Brother Donnie. &gt;&gt; And we treat them as if though they're going to hell. Who gave you the idea or me the ability to say, "This one's bride. This one ain't. This one's bride." Ain't none of us got no right to say that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, you imagine now as Peter stands there dumbfounded, trying to comprehend 490 times and measuring no doubt where he was presently was what Jesus spoke about. out of future tense. Now, I believe with all of my heart that the Lord Jesus in using these numbers of sevens that he was setting forth a time when individuals would arise to the sevens in their life. Now remember, whenever you start out with f with faith, that's on virtual or level one. You're climbing level two, three, four, five, six, seven, and you come to the seventh. Then you're right at the very top to where that eight, which is a new beginning or eternity. Remember when we read these things, there's actually eight of them, not seven. There's eight. And what is the eighth one? It's himself. So it rolls us right back into eternity. So where are some of you today? 2 3 4 5 6 7 Where are you? You know, this is why we need to pray, God, help me to see where I am. I believe the Lord Jesus in speaking of the perfect sevens was pointing to a time to when the seventh will arrive. I believe we're here. I think that's why Satan is fighting every one of us like never before. I've never in my life seen the children of God going through so much as they are. Can anybody witness it that today? And your life every way you turn so much difficulty but be encouraged child of God. The hour is fastly approaching when seventh will be completed and the eighth will set down on the top and we will leave this world in a body change. &gt;&gt; I believe it. Don't you? Now 70* 7. Let's read if you would in Ephesians 4:2. Now watch Paul coming from a little bit different perspective there. And he said, "With all loneliness and meekness with longsuffering for bearing one another in love." Look at this word different word of course than what Peter used. Suffer to bear with, to endure, to hold up, to hold oneself erect and firm. to sustain, to bear, to endure. Now, remember, I'm preaching to you this morning on patience with one another. When we move to that level that we can have patience with God and trust him, and then we're moving into it a little bit deeper to where we can have patience with one another and be able to endure one another's faults and the way we as Christians rub one another the wrong way. Now, it's okay for y'all to say, "Man, I'm not scared of them." It's okay if you can smile a little bit, you know, and all that sort of thing. It's all right for you to say, "Oh, God, help me. I can see you." You know, you're grimacing on your face and all that. But I do believe we want to get ready for a rapture here at Word of Life, right? &gt;&gt; So, watch. Then, we're talking about us being able to be patient with one another and our shortcomings and our failures. Now watch as as Paul writes this with all loneliness and meekness and longsuffering forbearing one another in love endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace. Now this is the same man that in another passage of scripture calls it the bond of perfectness. So it was a bond by which the body was bound together. And you say how in the world is that ever going to happen? That ain't up to me. That's up to God. God's the one who wrote this in his word and we believe he will bring it to pass. &gt;&gt; Endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace. So just keep in your mind anyone who tries to to sow discord and division and and intentionally trying to break up the body, whether it's a preacher, whoever it is, just remember they are not working in the spirit of unity or in the bond of peace. They're anointed of the devil. And Paul warned about it in Acts. He said that men would come in and they would try to draw people out after themselves. And we've had it all down through the ages. But they're not working in the spirit of unity, but trying to divide. Colossians 3:12. Put on therefore as the elect of God. Okay, now we're moving into bride material. We're not talking about foolish virgin. We're not talking about just church people. We're talking about the elect of God. Put on therefore as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering, forbearing one another, forgiving one another. If any man have a quarrel, a quarrel, you mean children of God can quarrel? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. If any man have a quarrel against any, even as Christ forgave you, so do oh my also do ye. So how does Christ forgive us? He forgives us and then holds a grudge, right? &gt;&gt; Really? &gt;&gt; Well, how do we figure we're forgiving and being like Christ when we forgive and hold grudges? &gt;&gt; So, when you ask the Lord Jesus to forgive you, even though you ask and said, "Okay, I'm forgiving you." And then the next time you go to pray, he reminds you of what he already forgave you of. But that's the way we do. Now, I've done forgive you, brother Jack, for saying that. Do I have to keep on forgiving you? And then we remind them over and over again. &gt;&gt; So, when you husbands and wives get into arguments, do you bring up what you've already forgive your husband for or your wife for? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Now, remember, and I don't forgive you of this 387 times, and you're doing it again. Now, you expect me to forgive you again? Is that what you tell Harry Karen? &gt;&gt; But we're supposed to forgive now. Only the elect. Only the elect. So, will there be five out of this church? 10, 15, I don't know. But I'm speaking this this morning as unto the elect. I don't expect the rest of you to do this. I don't expect the rest of Christianity around the world to only the elect of God. This has the Brad's name on it. &gt;&gt; As the elect of God, forbearing one another and forgiving one another. If any man have a quarrel against any, even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye. So to forbear, I found the meaning of this word was awesome. to forbearest not freely to forgive but meet halfway with an extended hand. &gt;&gt; So even though you have been the one trespassed against cuz what you find is a lot of people that are Christians they have the office time ever was saying these two words &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then these two other words, forgive me. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And then these other two words, I'm wrong. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; But again, I'm just preaching to elect. All the rest of you just take whatever you want and cut and splice and do whatever you want to with it. But I I'm speaking this morning to the elect. I'm one of them. &gt;&gt; Anybody else in your elect of God? &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, Brother Donnie, no, no, no. This sermon's for me." Well, good. Take it. &gt;&gt; Take it. But just don't take it up here. Take it in here. &gt;&gt; And become what this word says. Cuz this is one of the scriptures that plainly identifies itself as elect only. &gt;&gt; Oh my. So whenever then, let me read this again to to forbear is not just to freely forgive, but to meet halfway with an extended hand and forgiving one another all trespasses and offenses so far as committed against themsel. Oh my. Notice again Jesus in Matthew 6:12 and then this beautiful awesome prayer. and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors. You mean so if I don't forgive people who trespass against me, God doesn't forgive me. &gt;&gt; These words are not up for debate. &gt;&gt; It's the master himself who said them. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you mean if I hold something in my heart from 13 years ago and somebody said something to me, told a lie on me or whatever it was they done and I meet that person and boy, I see them from time to time and I said, "I'll not forgive them. Bless God, I'll tell you one thing. So all the shortcomings, all the failures, all the mistakes that I've done for the last 13 years are still on my account. &gt;&gt; Why? Cuz I haven't forgiven. Oh, I want God's mercy. Don't you all? I want God to forgive me. Oh yes, absolutely. We all want that. But Jesus said it. Whenever you stand praying, our father which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven. You remember the prayer. It's beautiful how he goes into it. And then he incorporates into this about we help us to forgive our neighbors their trespasses and you forgive us as we forgive them. Surely he don't mean it literally that way that I'm supposed to forgive and if I don't forgive then that is against me. Well, I'm afraid he does. You see, God's forgiveness is complete and final. It's not conditional or partial. &gt;&gt; Okay. Well, I forgive you for this and this and this, but this one right here, no way there. I mean, there Oh my. Colossians chapter 3:14. And above all these things, put on charity. &gt;&gt; Above all these things. Above all these things. Above. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Above what? Faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, all these things. Right at the very top. &gt;&gt; Charity. which is the bond of perfectness. So when the sister has the dream and the prophet tells us about it invites Femius names and she sees a man up on the mountain and there was a rock box upon the mountain and the man was pouring water in the box and water was flooding out of the box and running down the sides of the mountain. And then honey started being poured into the box. I I find this awesome. And as the honey started going into the box, it changed the consistency. Of course, you know what honey is? It's sticky. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. &gt;&gt; Sticky. Our church needs some more stickiness. Not sticky to the world. We got too much of that. But sticky to one another. &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to notice that a prophet has the ability to resee a dream. And he did. He resaw this sister's dream. And he he interprets it. So the man on the top was pouring the water into the box. And he said that man was the messenger of the age. Now can you imagine the prophet sees himself in that in that dream which interpreted turned around was a vision. So he sees himself pouring the water in the box and the water was flooding out. Now the spirit of God can do that the waters of life and it can come down and just go down the sides and flow everywhere. But sometimes you need more than that in order to bring the body to the unification that God requires for the resurrection. So then the contents was changed coming from where from under the oposes of the same messenger. But it was the contents of what was being poured into the box the second time that would start coming out and running all over it. And what was it doing? It was cementing it all together cuz water will not cement the levels. But honey is sticky. So the honey coming into the box and it held inside of there and the spirit of God going down the side, that's you, friends. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's you. It's our church. It's our age. The spirit of God cementing us together. I'm afraid that some of us have the wrong idea of what the bride will be in the last days. That every church in the message and every preacher will be dotting their eyes exactly the same and crossing their tees. I I I just do not believe that's scriptural. I do not believe that's the message. I believe that we will agree on the things required for the rapture and the body change. And there will be personal individual things about us that will differ from our church to the other church to the other church. If we would all sit down and go to talking about the message on election, serpent seed, predestination, and you might have one idea different than mine and me have one different than you. Is everybody around the world going to come into agreement with your idea? The thing of it is we want to come into agreement with God. &gt;&gt; Whatever God requires, that's what I want. Is you? Not so much you. I'm not trying to build you all where you all come into saying everything brother Donnie says that ain't nothing but a yes man. God wants you to be a yes man to himself, not to preachers. &gt;&gt; And you don't He don't want us to be yes people to you. But what does God want? He wants that spirit of God being there. We'll get into it on brotherly kindness that the prophet said that if something happens between you and a brother and then you you know the brother maybe the brother is taken out of the earth and he said you hear about it and you feel so bad in your heart because something come between you and that brother and you never was able to get to him and make that right. He said what is it brotherly kindness? He said it sticks. It sticks. It holds it there. Now, the human differences will always be there. There's probably not a preacher in this church that agrees with every view that I have. Every deacon in the church probably don't agree with every view that I have. That don't mean we're not brothers. That don't mean that we're not going in the rapture and the chains of the body. Come on, somebody. Don't you see what Satan has done? He's warped our our understanding of what unity is. And we're thinking, look at Peter and Paul and James. My goodness. You imagine Paul whenever him and Barnabas had a disagreement and they could not reconcile that thing and Barnabas went one direction and Paul went another. Barnabas is never mentioned again in the scripture. Never mentioned again. I cannot believe in my heart that those men never made that thing right between one another. Come on somebody. But whatever it was that come between them and they just felt it would be the best if they didn't work together no more. What did Paul do? He took Silas. Oh, Silas. I don't know if he had second regrets or not. You know, he's beat and thrown in jail. He might not have been, but you never know. But you look at great men like that and they had their differences and the water run all out. But what hell the honey between them? What is it that'll help tie us one to another? This is why that we must have the baptism of the Holy Ghost permeating our entire being. If all we have is bubble dancing and jumping and shouting and the move of the spirit of God, the least little thing come up among us and we'll divide ways. Well, we'll start another church. We'll go down the road and start another group. Well, we're not separate. We're not fellowshipping with them no more. You know what? That's a sign of water running all down the sides of the pyramid. But what we need is a good baptism of honey. Boy, can you imagine be baptized in honey and you barely can get up, move around. Glory to God. You're so sticky. And you get around one another and say, "I'm going for lunch." Or, "I'm going with you cuz I can't let go." Well, hallelujah. I'm going through that trial. I'm going with you cuz I'm stuck. We're too watery. We need to be a little bit more sticky one to another to try to reach out to one another, pray for one another, bear one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ. And the church said, &gt;&gt; notice when John wrote this in 1 John chapter 2:6, and he said, "He that saith, he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk even as he walked." Now listen, this is overwhelming, friends. John introduced this amazing truth that the incarnation, the work of incarnation of deity has not ended. He that saith, notice this, that he abideth in him ought himself also, so to walk, even as he walks. So a person who truly received the baptism of the Holy Ghost in their soul, they are the incarnation of the living God in bride form. This is the living tabernacle of the living God. Not just people that just oh my live like the world and act like the world and God's a million miles from them. That's not a work of incarnation. It's the same Jesus in bride form. You see Jesus perfectly expressed the reality of God in a human form. The reality of God in a human form. A God that could love. A God that could forgive. and yet not a God that compromised and let everything go. That's what the bride's going to be when she leaves this world. Notice Jesus says it this way in St. John 13:34. A new commandment I give unto you that you love one another as your daddy said you're supposed to do or as your mama said or as your uncle. &gt;&gt; This is your example and mine. A new commandment I give unto you, that you love one another, as I have loved you, &gt;&gt; as I have loved you. Praise God. That you also love one another. By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples. If you have tongues, interpretation, prophecy, big church, big ministry, &gt;&gt; no. &gt;&gt; No. By this shall all men know that you are my disciples, not Christians by name, but disciples, people that are disciplined by the spirit of God. By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples. Oh my. If you have love one to another. 1 John 3:14. We know that we have passed from death unto life. Because our sisters quit cutting their hair and they wear long dresses and the men no longer will do this and that and the other. All that comes with it. But that's not the way you know you're born again. &gt;&gt; Because we love the brethren. Now, why is that such a marvel? Because we've got brethren that aren't very lovable. And we've got sisters that aren't very lovable. And sometimes they got preachers that ain't very lovable. But the love of God loves those who aren't lovable. And let's just face the fact. Some folks are more lovable than others. But the spirit of God can look at them and love them in such a way that you look beyond their faults. Sure, you know they're there. Their difficulties are there. But the love of God in you will make you love me as if though I was perfect. Right. &gt;&gt; Whoa. Did I say a mouthful? Where in the world did that come from? &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. &gt;&gt; The love of God in us will make us love one another as if though we have arrived. [Music] &gt;&gt; We know that we have passed from death unto life because we love the brethren. He that loveth not his brother lives abideth in death. Oh my goodness. Friends, your long-haired sisters, you dress your brothers, you got your clean cut, you know, you don't dress like the world, act like the world. But if you don't love your brother, you live in death. you abide in death. Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer. &gt;&gt; And you know that no murderer as eternal life abiding in him. Although all Christianity knows John 3:16, but how many of them knows first John 3:16? &gt;&gt; Let's read it. here power perceive we the love of God because he laid down his life for us. This could not be said when Jesus quoted John 3:16. This part could only be said after Acts 2. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us, and we ought to lay down our lives. Help us, Jesus. So, somebody walked in the back door this morning with an AK-47 and said, "I'm going to kill somebody in this church today." And since the preacher's up on the platform, I said, "Go do him cuz he's the biggest troublemaker probably." And many of you would stand up say, "No, don't take him. Take me. He reaches more people than I do." And he helps more people than I do. Take me. Take me. But what would be our first reaction? The human part. &gt;&gt; Hide. &gt;&gt; Fear. Right. &gt;&gt; So somebody walked in the door and it would be your first reaction to get down the seat. Hide. How many would think about me standing up here? A wide open target. Not many. Because fear would dominate. So you think when we truly receive God's love in the measure that the Lord wants us to that we would look at it in such a way and and say I wasn't up here say it was another brother preaching that he just happens to be not one of your favorites &gt;&gt; oh brother Dona I would do it for you brother I'd do it for you well thank you but what that what about that brother in the church that you really don't like hearing ing as much. &gt;&gt; Well, glory to God. Maybe the Lord's going to get him out of the way every time he preaches. I don't like hearing him know how. &gt;&gt; Take him out, Jesus. Take him to his reward. &gt;&gt; Or what if it was a deacon brother that got on your little girl before church or Sunday school teacher or something like that? &gt;&gt; Hereby perceive we the love of God, for he laid down his life for us. Therefore, if we have the love of God in us, then we ought to lay down our lives. Lay down, not just pull money out of your wallet or out of your purse. Here, brother, go buy you some lunch here, brother. This is to help with your electric bill and think, "Boy, I've done my religion." No, you haven't, Brother Donnie. Would I ever be called to do that? Most of us will not. It's not like that. God will demand each of you that you're going to be in a scenario similar what I described. and each of you will be faced with death. But he just wants to know you'd be willing to do it. &gt;&gt; You see, Abraham didn't have to offer Isaac, but just being willing to do it just meant so much to Almighty God. &gt;&gt; It's not that he will demand some of these requirements that others will have to give their life. There's still martyrs, you know, that's giving their life for Christianity. Not even necessarily the message, but just to be a Christian. And it don't mean that all of us will be faced with that. But I imagine what it means to the Lord Jesus whenever we say, "Lord, if you would want me to do it, I would be willing." He said, "That's all I want to hear. That's all I want to hear. And I know your heart well enough to know that if it come right down to it, you would give your life for your brother or your sister. Oh my. But who so hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutth up his bowels of compassion, from him? How dwelleth the love of God in him? My little children, let us not love in word. Ah, here we go. Let us not love in logos alone saying it. I love everybody. Praise God. I love them. I love them. But indeed &gt;&gt; and in truth. And hereby we know that we are of the truth and shall assure our hearts before him. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Can I have a few more minutes? &gt;&gt; Thank you. just a few. Right? If you won't be honest with your brother, you'll never be honest with God. You see, you've got to be honest with one another. And so, you do that and you'll be honest with God. Treat your brother just like you want to treat him. So, you treat your brother just like you want to treat him. Images of Christ. No matter where you are, it makes a new life. It brings a new image. and makes a servant out of you. You want to serve him. Jesus wants us to serve one another. Love one another. Now listen friends. People don't believe this. As we serve one another, &gt;&gt; we serve him. you sisters, the funeral dinners and the things that you do to try to bring comfort to the hearts of people that have lost a loved one. How many of you sisters would have felt so honored 2,000 years ago to be able to cook a meal for Jesus? And remember, Jesus would have been more similar to people that stands on the exit there coming off of Elizabeth and Highway onto University Parkway sitting there with the signs up. I'm hungry. I'm a veteran or whatever they are. You don't know if they are if they ain't remember Jesus more than likely would not have look like me today. Welldressed like you brothers are here today. Jesus only had one garment. So they say he didn't have a house, no horse, no chariot, no way to be transported back and forth. As a matter of fact, we would have categorically placed Jesus in this category today as a homeless person. So Jesus didn't have access to taking a bath maybe every day, dust on his feet, sweat running down his face, and the dust accumulating, and you'd seen dirty spots maybe on Jesus' face and on his hands. I hope you can grasp it. And if you'd have got around him, Jesus might have had a little bit of a human body odor. until he could get his next bath. So would he be the type of individual that a lot of us would have even give the time of day to? Now remember this was not that he didn't have access. He had access to the wealth of eternity. But he laid it aside to come here to be like us. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He bore my stench. Yes. &gt;&gt; He bore my humiliation, my embarrassment. &gt;&gt; Well, brother Donnie, this embarrasses me for you to say this is the way we should be. Well, good. I'm glad it does because this is true Christianity. &gt;&gt; He bore our embarrassment and we willingly bear his. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; How do you don't expect people to do this? I don't. God does. &gt;&gt; God does. &gt;&gt; Notice this. The prophet says, "I realize as I treat the people, I'm treating God. &gt;&gt; Just my attitude toward you is my attitude toward Christ. And your attitude towards me is the same thing." That's right. Toward Christ. Oh my. Again, I remind you this is bride stuff. &gt;&gt; This separates message people from the bride. Remember, we've got a twin. She looks so much like us. She'll quote from the same books. She'll scream and holler and shout. Oh yeah. Sometimes even have miracles among some of them. But when it comes to this type of preaching where the rubber meets the road and your life has to line up, we're deeper than that. We don't need that. Glory to God. We're in this great mystery and this great thing. When we get deeper than this, you're way too deep for me. &gt;&gt; This is what my Jesus come to bring us. &gt;&gt; Let me close here again. He says, "The way I treat you, that's my attitude toward God. I've often wondered what I would do if I had a little charger and I had two drops of the literal blood of Jesus that fell at Calvary. How I would embrace that? How I would hold it close? Now, can you imagine if this little bottle that didn't have body armor in it, but it had the literal blood of the Lord Jesus? And it had been placed in my hands. And y'all saw it brought up here and set down. I said, "Oh, Brother T, be careful. Be careful. That's the blood of the Lord Jesus. Brother Donn, your hand come really close to knocking." And be careful, brother D. That's the blood of the Lord Jesus. I hope you can understand that actually you are worth more than his literal blood. &gt;&gt; You say how can you say that? Because he gave his literal blood &gt;&gt; for you. We'll dismiss it a little bit and y'all will go out to wherever you're going to eat lunch and you'll sit there and look at the menu and you know a t-bone cost this much and a ribe eyes this and chicken tenders and whatever it is and you'll sit there and process and evaluate is that worth that to me. Nah, I don't believe it is. I really like that lobster tail, but man, I ain't going to pay that much tail off that outfit. Ain't no way I'm buying that. I'll do without it this time. I'll forfeit. I really like that cheesecake, but it costs too much. So, what are you doing? You're evaluating your wallet and your balance of your budget to you getting that. And the Lord Jesus looked at his budget and said, "I budget myself. All eternity, all love, all mercy, all kindness, all grace. This is my budget for redemption. I give everything." So he exchanged his blood for you. Faulty. My goodness. How many issues have we caused him? &gt;&gt; Now, many of you like me, you've been serving God a whole lot longer than you live for the devil. I've caused God pain. Oh, no. I I'd hate to even think about it. I'd hate to even think about what I've done to him. And yet he looked at me before the world began and say, "I see these decades of his life. He'll struggle with this and he won't want to preach." And even when he gives into preaching, he won't want to preach that and he won't want to preach that. And oh boy, if it'd been people that said, "Forget it." But the thing of it is, he looked at every one of us and saw, I see their issues. I see this. I see that. I see that. But what I see is when time wraps up and is folded and this little hickey down at the bottom called the loop of time. When this little hickey falls back into eternity and the little hickey is &gt;&gt; pulled back up into the circle, &gt;&gt; I see they will be with me through the ceaseless ages. The mortality, their issues, their problems &gt;&gt; will be all gone. &gt;&gt; And this is my budget. I give it all. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Bham said, "Do you know in the sight of God, he's talking about the blood now, how I would embrace that, how close I would walk with it that I didn't drop it or anything. Do you know on the side of God, I've got a greater than that before me tonight? I've got the purchase of his blood. So when you buy your car, you consider the value, your foods, your house, all that you buy and barter and trade, all that you buy. You consider it and you look at you saying, "It's worth it to me. It's worth it. I It's worth it to me to pay more to to drive a Cadillac. I mean, you know, you can drive a little whatever more, but it's worth it to me to have a little bit more room. It's worth it to me to have a push button window and a push button this and a push button that. It's worth it. And people look up say, "Wow, what a nice car, man. Wow. Wow. Boy, you must be really doing good. Wow, what a nice car." Say, "It's worth it to me to have power windows. It's worth it to me to have an air conditioner. It's worth it to me." And Jesus looked at each one of us and said, "It's worth it to me &gt;&gt; to deal with John's shortcomings. &gt;&gt; I see what he'll be. It's worth it to me to deal with Ry's failures, Harry's and Lances, Dows, my daughters. It's worth it to me to deal with Malachi cuz I see what I can make out of him." So, do you understand what I have before me today? I have a value that I have preached to today, which the Lord Jesus says, "Donnie, handle them with my love." &gt;&gt; Yep. You're going to have to correct him. He may have to say things even be sharp, but keep the purchase price before you. Keep the way I value. When you have to rebuke them, rebuke them with my love, not anxiety, not anger, not frustration. Treat them as a shepherd with his sheep. And there'll be times, Donnie, you'll have to take them up in your arms and you'll have to break the legs and it will break your heart when you do. But be sure after you break it to take it up into your arms and love on it. Cuz Donnie, the way I look at it, to me they were worse more than my blood. I screamed. I cried. I felt the agony. And I would have done it for just one of them. Hallelujah. He loved you more than he loved his own life. He gave his life for you. So, how must I handle you? I must be honest and sincere. Think about that. The next time you go to say something to the brothers and sisters you go to church with, The next time somebody wrongs you, I'm going to give them a piece of my mind, you might ought to think about that. &gt;&gt; And remember, you're talking to the purchase of the blood of the Lord Jesus. And as you're giving them a piece of your mind, just remember as you're talking to them, Jesus takes it personally. And your attitude toward them is your attitude toward the Lord Jesus. So, you might as well walk up before the throne of God and just go ahead and give Jesus a piece of your mind &gt;&gt; cuz that's the way he looks at it. &gt;&gt; Let me close. After all, I'd rather have the love of God sealed into my heart than all the gifts there is in the Bible. Now, this doesn't replace gifts, but it just puts it in the proper value. I thought of that here a few nights ago. My little girl called me and I told her she wanted me to come home to her. She loves me. And I said, "Oh, I I told her I sent her a little doll, but she didn't want the doll." She said, "I want you, daddy. Not your dog." Well, that's okay. That's That's the way I think about Jesus. I love his gifts and the things to help his people, but I want Jesus. Oh Jesus, forgive us. That's the way I think about Jesus. I love his gifts and things to help his people. But I want Jesus, the love of God, sealed in your heart, pressed in until all the world's pressed out, and you see nothing but the Lord. And as you love one another, you love the Lord. And if you don't love one another, you can't love the Lord. He said so. and God can't move into you. Children, do we realize when we hold on to our grudges and resentments and things that we're hindering God from moving into us in the way he wants to cuz he will not reside in your heart and in your soul with resentment, unforgiving spirit and all that sort of thing. Oh, hallelujah. I wonder how many here today would like to be remembered before the Lord. Lord Jesus, my hands are up. Father, can you just raise your heads for just a moment? Let me show this one more with you. Brothers and sisters, I'm down here to Total Deliverance 1959. And when one member would talk against the other member, you know that's wrong. You're commanded to pray for one another and not talk against one another, but to love one another. And if someone is down, let's pick him up and help him. That makes us a unified group of believers. Now, when we don't do that, when we don't obey God, we displease God. This is one thing that'll make the bride so different than her twin. The trend twin will divide and separate and even use quotes to do it. Build kingdoms and interested in you following this man or that man. But the bride just goes through all of it and holds her head above the fanaticism that followed this revival which had to come and she looks at both sides arguing and fussing and say God be merciful to them and God help me that I don't become contaminated with such you love him with all your heart today. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; How many wants to be a living image of the living God? to stand our feet. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, we worship you, Jesus. We worship you, Jesus. Oh Lord, we love your gifts. We thank you for every gift you've promised in your word. But we've done seen what gifts do without love. Gifts divide. They separate. Your prophet said gifts can bring confusion. We've seen it. I just never thought we'd ever arrive to where we are now. Lord, that what I saw in Pentecost, how gifts divided the people then, I never thought it'd ever return in the message. Gifts are dividing brothers, gifts dividing churches, gifts dividing family members one from the other. How sad. And the prophet never did get the majority of the Pentecostal straightened out in their gifts. And we look at it and think, "You mean to tell me we're living through that same cycle again?" And we wonder why we aren't gone. It's no wonder we aren't gone. We've got to come to where the evening light, which is the fourth light, so shines in our soul that it can put our arms around those who believe in this and we'll argue with the other brother and put our arms around that one and say, "Brothers, we're brothers." That's the spirit the prophet messenger had. Help us, Lord. Oh, Jesus. May such a baptism of love strike our church, strike me, oh God, strike our minister, brothers, every musician. May it not only strike us but every church around the world, oh God, who contains members of your elect. Oh Jesus, we worship you today, Father. Maybe there's someone here today out of fellowship with God. Maybe you've never known him. Or maybe you've backslid and you'd like to be remembered today. Every head bowed, no one looking around. Is there anyone in that state and you'd like to be remembered? Maybe somebody that's backslid, somebody away from the Lord. God bless you up in the mezzanine there. Amen. Another one there. God bless you. I tell you friends, we're living in such a frightening time. Have you noticed in the last few years how rare it is for people to come to God? That sister that come here just the other night after the service, my heart, I I was overwhelmed with such a flood of emotions. I imagine you could probably see it on my face cuz I was trying to stand and recall how long it had been since anybody had even come up and wanted to be saved. We're in that time and people don't want to be saved. The door of mercy is going to be closed before long. Can't you see? It's like it's already gradually closing little by little and people aren't even feeling the drawing power no more. They don't care. They just they don't want it. Oh children, we worship you today, Jesus. Father, you saw there was a few hands that was raised up, Lord. And I'm asking you here today, Father God, you know these individuals and what what their uplifted hand meant, Lord. Maybe they've never known you. Maybe they've known you and got away from you, Lord. Whatever it is, may they be able to sense the love of Jesus Christ in this place today. Whatever they've done and however they've lived, may they realize that you died for them to set them free. Oh Jesus, you knew all of our shortcomings, but you looked beyond all of our fault and you saw our needs. Help me, Lord, that I can love more like you. We bless you today, Jesus. We worship you, Lord. How many of Christians here today been serving God for years and years, but you say, "I want more of his love, Brother Tony. I want to be more like him." Me, too. I do with all my heart. Me, too. Amazing grace will always be my song of praise. [Music] For it was grace that ball my liberty. [Music] I do not know [Music] just why he came.

We got a little brother that wants to be baptized today. We want him to come and just prepare for that. Oh, I'll tell you one thing. We could be the last ones that we're baptizing, giving their hearts to the Lord. God bless you, saints. I love you so much in the Lord. Let the brothers who lead you while we prepare for the baptism.

Thank God for a mom and daddy that love the Lord. This is one of the greatest days of their life. Be able to see their children come be able to take on the name of the Lord Jesus and water baptism. As our brother Cole comes today, of course, we want to pray for him as he begins this new stage of his journey that God would just be with him. As his pastor, I can baptize him in water, but only almighty God can fill every fiber of his being with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. And let's just pray for our brother today. Heavenly Father, as our brother comes to this stage, oh God, we are so grateful to see you still dealing with hearts and pulling on them. Lord, we are thankful. We pray for our brother that you'd just be with him, Lord, and strengthen him and help him. Lord, he said he' been you'd been dealing with his heart and we are so thankful for that, Lord. We just ask you that you'd take his life, Lord, and make it what you've ordained it to be. Fill every fiber of his being full, so full of the Holy Ghost, Lord. Help him to be a living example of the word of God. Take him Lord and use him for your kingdom. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. In obedience to your faith, my brother, I baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. [Music] [Applause] Amen. Let's sing that song, Made for More. Let's sing this this morning.
