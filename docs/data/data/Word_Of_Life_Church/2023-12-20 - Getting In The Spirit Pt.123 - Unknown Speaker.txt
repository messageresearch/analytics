[Music] my control the more that I can humble myself the more you lift me up every day I live Lord I love you more [Music] praise the Lord Matthew chapter 16: 18 we still believe the way up is down right that's backwards of course to the world but we know that's the way it works in the program of God Matthew 16:18 the words of the Lord Jesus and I say also unto thee that thou art Peter which is little Stone Petra little Stone Upon This Rock I will build my church which certainly was not on the little Stone because the little Stone backs sled just a little bit after this but it was on the revelation of who Jesus was Upon This Rock I will build my church and the gates of hell shall not Prevail against it 1 Timothy 3:14 and 15 these things write I unto thee hoping to come unto thee shortly but if i tar long that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God which is the Ecclesia an assembly Gathering of citizens called out from their homes into some public place or an assembly in a Christian sense an assembly of Christians gathered for worship in a religious meeting so this is what the church is which is the Church of the Living God the pillar and ground of the truth and the ground is a stay or a prop or a support So in reality it's no wonder Satan is going to do his best to destroy the church now he will destroy this church not so much this building here but I'm talking about the church that Jesus said he would build as his own but I'll tell you what he'll do on the other hand he will build support multiply strengthen and grow his own church yeah because Satan also has a church they are his wife they are his wife I'm glad we don't belong to that church you see he never had one until the New Testament but once he saw what God was doing he thought that was a great idea then he decided he would make his own church and he has they're called different names and different titles but every one of them that are contrary to God's word belongs to the devil now none of them of course would ever say that they are Satan worshippers none of them would ever draw a pentagram they'd never get goats blood they'd never do all that stuff um but what they do is Jesus said in St Mark 7 how be it in vain do they worship me teaching for doctrines the Commandments of men which is seed of discrepancy okay how may like to be a remember tonight as we pray heavenly father as we bow our heads in your presence it's with gratitude and Thanksgiving Lord that we are here tonight and we're so thankful father for all that you mean to us we love you Jesus so much thank you for the strength that you give us from day to day thank you Lord for healing thank you for the manifestation of your presence among us we thank you Lord for people of God that still want to live right still want to serve you still want to be your people to us that's the greatest and highest honor that any of us could ever have we've assembled here tonight Lord that we might be able to sing pray worship clap our hands turn in prayer request father sing with all of our hearts to you as a group and then as individuals and then his choirs and so on as we've already heard tonight and then we come to this most important part the preaching and the hearing of the word now we believe father that it'll take you to help us it'll help definitely I need your help to help me to get out of the way and help me to say something that'll bless your people they need you too Lord they need you to anoint their ability to hear because we know just because we got ears on the side of our head don't mean that we can hear the voice of God but that's what we want to hear so help us tonight speak to us father may we be better when we leave this place tonight in the name of the Lord Jesus we ask it amen God bless you you may be seated Saints looking at the pattern of what God himself established in making the church now truly if if he's the one that's going to make it then I I think in order for us to be able to judge each and every Church we'd have to be able to do it by what the author said himself now you know that I like antiques both Carol and I both do like them and there's a certain period of antiques that we like and it's called The Victorian period Then the end of the Victorian period was the Italian Renaissance and the Victorian period they used a lot of arches and they used a lot of deep U carvings and Engravings and things like that at the end of that period before Charles G Eastlake began to manufacture furniture they had the end that of the Italian Renaissance so Carol and I wanted a a big bed a big big large bed so I'd seen several of them it's called a half tester and I'd seen several of them and they were multiplied thousands and thousands of dollars so I thought after looking at a bunch of magazines and looking at a bunch of them beds I thought I could make one so I started getting a bunch of pictures and I'd had a bunch of pieces and parts off of organs and Mir and all kinds of things that were handcarved stuff now you can't go to Big Lots or you can't go to Lowe's and buy all that handcarved stuff because it dates back to about 1880 to somewhere around 1910 so I started trying to put this together so I laid it all out and Carol kind of draw me a sketch of something she wanted wanted it to look like so what I had to do was take the parts and the pieces that I had and then try to fill in the other stuff now they also used a lot of burl Walnut anybody know what that is well Burl is where the branches come down and grow off the main part of the trunk and it will cause these figures that will be there also some of the most beautiful Burl uh will be found in the roots of the tree which grows down in the ground then what they'll do they'll take that log and they will soak it day and night 24 hours a day soak it soak it soak it and then they'll take a real sharp blade and then they'll start cutting that that veneer now they'll cut it I've got some that's a 64 of an inch thick some that's a 32th of an inch and you can take that and it'll slice it just like this slice slice slice slice like you're slicing a piece of ham and it'll come off and it replicates itself because that Burl has eyes and has different things inside of it so you take one piece and you lay it down then you take another piece and lay it down another piece like that like that and you put it together put it in a vacuum bag and then you put a little pump on it and they go and it draws all the air out of it and then it glues it down to a substrate then you can make pictures and make faces out of all of that that come off of that veneer but I had to have some sort of image in my mind of something that I wanted because there wasn't anything quite like it at Grand there wasn't anything quite like it at the Ashley store so I had to look back at uh magazines at Carol had and they were Victorian style magazines and since I was building it with a gigantic poster and some of the brothers are in the church actually once I got it built helped me put it together and helped me set it up so what I had to have I had for a lot of it I had to have things that was imp pairs now if I was going to put something on this post I had to have something on this post that would match so if I was going to put an ornate pediment up on the top of it I found a dresser on eBay that was out in San Francisco and I bought it for about $200 and had it shipped out here so I found two pediments anybody know what them are okay I ain't going to explain it to you you going to have to take my word for it so I found a matching pair of pediments one to go on the bed one to go on the dresser and then I embellished it added to it added width added height and so on so that it would look like that it was a hair but now I had to have part of it in my mind but I had to have part of it in substance because I can't carve I can't do any of that but I already had a lot of this in bits and pieces that I had it from all kinds of things that I'd saved over the years so I went to laying it out and I'd lay it out like this and I lay it in the in the basement floor and then I'd go to look at them pictures and then I'd take these pieces and I knew that I could make certain things things I had routers and planers and things like that so I knew there was some things that I could make and I could make the Burl faces and I could make things like that but there was parts of it that I had to have that was already original now I would make that and I would take and lay it down and that was one of the hardest parts was trying to get something in my mind now it stands a little over 10t tall but naturally I couldn't make it 10 fo tall and take it through my bedroom door so I had to make it where it would come apart so and the post or big gigantic post headboards about the footboards about this tall and headboard 10 foot tall so I had to try to make it in such a way in my mind and think how can I make it where it'll come apart and yet come back together and then if anything ever happens to me make it where hopefully my son-in-laws can be able to figure out how to take it apart heart so and in that I see similar to what God wanted to do so God wanted to build something that he had had a type of in the Old Testament which was the church which was Israel entire now it was a type so anything in type is not always the True Image but yet it was a people that was called out a people that was different from the rest of the world and God would designate for them to do certain things eat certain foods act certain way and by doing that the world would look at them and know that they were a separate people that's what God wanted God wanted a people that was separate so he would tell them to wear a certain color now God told them to wear what was called a riband r i BB a n d a riband of blue on the border of their garment now that that was quite unusual but it was the merging together on their Earthly Coes of the Heavenly color which was the skies and then God would tell them that don't eat these types of food don't eat anything with the web foot don't eat anything that doesn't chew the C don't do this don't do that so every day they would go to the market they didn't have deep freezers and refrigerators microwaves and all that so a lot of the country still do the same thing today they go to the market every day to buy the perishables so every day when they would go to the market they were testifying that they were obeying the laws of Yahweh because you never saw a True Believer buying any fish or any type of seafood that did not match the program of the Torah of God now everybody would watch them and they would see the way they would dress they were not allowed to have a garment that would be mixed together with linen and wool they would not be able to plant different types of seed in the same row so their Gardens were different their clothes were different everything about them was different they were not allowed to Mark themselves like people do today the tattoos and all they were not allowed to cut themselves so every time you saw one of them you would know they were a Jew and then of course they had the law of circumcision also another sign so God wanted his people always to be separate now when it come to the New Testament God did not take away the laws of Separation but now he's going to move it where it's going to start inside of their soul no matter how much they done all the outward things in the Old Testament they still never had a true and a converted heart cuz the law couldn't produce it but in the New Testament God is going to come inside of them and start sanctifying or circumcising them from the inside out now they're still going to dress certain ways and they're going to live certain ways and there's certain things they're not going to do of course the world today does not want to hear that they must say Well it don't matter what you look like it don't make no difference to God if you paint your face or cut your hair or wear britches why what difference does it make to God well it still does make a difference to God God don't want the women dressing like men God don't want the men dressing like women God don't want men marrying men God don't want women marrying women somebody say amen that's God's law that's what we believe is that right so whenever God then was going to design this church he is the Builder himself so he never called the apostles together for a general meeting and said now look I'm thinking about building this thing called a church first time has ever used of course the word I'm going to build this thing called a church now now Peter what do you sing that I should build it out of now unlike Carol and myself when we wanted this particular thing in our house and as long as I'm around I mean Carol will always think of this and look at this this bed and she told me a not long ago she said Donnie if something was to ever happen to you I don't know what in the world I would do every room in this house has got antiques in it that you've ever either built or refinished every room I I I would see you everywhere well that's the way God wants to be inside his church so whether it's in the nursery whether it's in the bathroom whether it's in the fellowship hall in the pastor's office in the mezanine God wants us to see him in every room of this building God wants to be the main reason that we come here God don't want it to be well they've got nice basketball goals you need to find another church to go to that's the reason you come here because it should be all about him and our love for him then all the rest these things are just nice things to have around that's not really the reason that we come the church is that right so it should be not like with my house I've got things everywhere and it would be the same with Carol cuz Carol's made curtains in this room and curtains in that room and her her you know just her signature about this and that is all through our house which is the way it should be and it should be then that in God's house that it is not the signature of of a denominational board and we look and see well this was Bishop so and so ideas and this was so and so's idea and they think the church should do this or should not no it should not even be that way at all it should be the signature of God should be in every house of God that truly belongs to God but it's so sad to realize that many churches do not have the signature of God they have the signature of a man a single man or a group of men which lead that church so then if that man behind the pulpit thinks that well you know what uh I don't know that it's necessary anymore to really preach on Holiness I don't know that it's necessary to preach against the things of the world anymore we might do better and we might gain more if we would uh let let off of that and then then in a year or two we'll we'll start preaching on it again and by that long you've lost a whole lot of ground yeah so what did they do then the church will start taking on the image of the man in the Pulpit the image that he is creating by the words that he is saying or the ones he's leaving out so you see it's not just important what a man says but many times I like to know and find out what is he leaving out because sometimes what he's leaving out has much more of an impression on the people than the words that he is actually saying because it is a it is a subtly crafted sermon that preachers will put out especially in this age that will say certain things that are very very good but it is the deadly things which are left out which I absolutely annihilates and separates the people of God from the presence of God because if you preach them they'll get you in trouble well I figure if I ain't get in trouble apparently I ain't making the devil mad so God chose then to build this thing called the church now unlike me if You' ever be able to see my bed that I built and I'd be able to tell you well this come from this was a two pieces of mahogany now I said they got a different grain of course a different density of the wood mahogany does than Walnut and you'll never be able to replicate mahogany quite like like you can Walnut but because they're inch and a quarter and they're very heavy Coral heavy type things and I was able to fool with the stain a little bit in order to make it look like Walnut but you see God don't want to do that in his church God don't want Hypocrites and God don't want make Believers there and God will take a little bit of stain and kind of work on it a little bit to kind of dress it up now these handrails here are made out of w so is this so's this so is this but yet the bottom back here is made out of popper and yet we could not of course be able to afford wall and through the whole thing but I was able to be able to take the same stain and be able to work also on this organ here brother John gon dinner buil this and I was able to take the same stain and make it look like Walnut now Naturally by Nature they're not colored the same way in popper you'll find real white wood you'll find streaks of green there's one of these rails in yours got a streak of green about that wide and about 4 foot long but you won't find it and I am not going to tell you which one it is I was able to take stain and work on it and blend it as they call it and make that green disappear now you got to know what you're doing but what you're doing is H hypocritical in one sense of the word because you're trying to hide one thing to make it blend in with something else now this is Walnut these are popper this is this is birch and you've got a mixture of woods on the library in there that's exactly the same way but if someone knows what they're doing then they can take the finished part of it and actually pull several different types of wood together and make you think every bit of it is from the same tree and that's what Satan does when it comes to a church then he will have this church that church that church oh my we're all going to heaven well I reckon everybody is anything my goodness people can live like a devil you hear hear their funeral preach and you think they're just right next door to Gabriel and Michael I mean they're just walking down streets of gold and you think good Lord you got to be kidding me if they went to heaven my the devil will be there in three weeks there look friend I don't care what a preacher tries to put you in the gates there ain't no preacher that can put you in or keep you out it's your own life that you live before God so God wanted this beautiful beautiful creation called the church God wanted this thing now God knew as soon as he designated this to place it on the earth he knew that Satan would want to replicate it so God gave us an original pattern and we would be able to judge that pattern and look at the pattern and study the pattern and I've told you before there was an older sister down the church in Kentucky and whatever I preached on twins years and years ago down there she came to me after the service and said brother Donnie I've got a nephew and said he works for the federal government and he he works in the treasury Department in studying about counterfeiting and she said I asked him one time about counterfeit and he said many years he'd been there studying studying watching it all out and she said how do you know how do you know when you see a counterfeit Bill he said I've never seen one she said what do you mean you mean you don't study the counterfeit he said no I study the real so much that as soon as I see one it will stick out to me now you know I find that a great truth in that that we can spend so much time studying the false and trying to defend this and that and the other and we absorb a lot of that time when we should be studying the real so how are we going to know if our church or any other church is the like to true and original Church well we look at the pattern that's all we do we look at the pattern now you realize that whenever Things become in short or in shortage that people will fall back and on other things to try to replace them now that I'm speaking about furniture let me go ahead and tell you this a little history tonight at the end of the Victorian periods by the time the victorians got done with the black walnut in America almost all the forest the Trees of the black walnut were nearly destroyed because they even made the drawers out of solid Walnut for years and then they got to a spot that they learned how to veneer it although the Chinese have been doing it since the 14th century and they finally brought it over to America and started doing it here so instead of taking a piece of wood 3/4 of an inch for a drawer that taking 30 second of an inch and they glue it on a piece of substrate and you'd have all them other pieces of wood so by the end of that there wasn't hardly any Walnut left so you know what they started doing they started making at the end of the Victorian period some of the Victorian furniture out of Oak but that was bad because Oak was firewood so you can imagine now you buy a piece of furniture in your house and you're used to having Burl Walnut you're used to having at least mahogany or you're used to having Rosewood y'all know what Rosewood is or some of the black wood from Africa and they would have some of that and then they go because why there was a shortage of Walnut the furniture manufacturer still making Furniture so they had to go to another wood so they had to compromise from this high-end quality of wood to firewood firewood and then they all also for those who would not absolutely refuse to buy any oak furniture then they resorted to buying it out of popper and then they would take tricky guys who knew how to do the stain workor and they would start doing it that way so then you would start seeing the sides of furniture out of popper and the front out of Walnut and a lot of the people didn't even know that it wasn't even solid wers so they started tricking the consumer and the consumer looked at it and thought it was the same thing so several years ago Carol wanted a big table in the house so I built her a big gigantic dining room table she wanted some chairs and we went down to Knoxville found some big heavy heavy chairs down in Knoxville well they were made in chinaa now they looked Walnut but I had a funny feeling that the color was not the right color so I had to strip them off and when I started stripping tripping them off I mean the legs are big old heavy ornate things you know and the the I got the top finish off and it didn't take me long to realize I had made a bad mistake because the brownish red looking color on that wood disappeared and I was stuck with purple purple now they did not stain that wood they dyed it how many's heard a wood dye nobody you're getting a woodworking lesson tonight aren't you well they take purple dye now you know what I've realized that a lot of Christians when you go to skinning them down deep enough they're purple and pink and green and yell and polka dot ain't no telling what in the world you'll find when you get the outside finish off but now God don't want a church that just has a veneer finish you know what a lot of furniture is made out of today sawdust saw dust oh but it looks like wood on the outside but if you get it wet one time mhm and you let it get wet very long you'll find that thing will go to swelling up on you and the moisture gets on the inside and it goes to wrink and some of y'all are smiling you bought some of that nice Iron Furniture ain't you well you see that's the way Satan then decided Well if God wants a church I I want one too but I can't make one that'll look so opposite of God because if I do everybody will know it so I've got to make one that at least initially will have the appearance of his church so it will look like God's original church and of course it didn't take long until that happened now we see then that in the Ephesian Church age they begin to get away from that first love that God gave them which was divine Love by divine nature now we know that the prophet tells us then on the day of Pentecost whenever those folks receive the Holy Ghost but then the Bible goes on to tell us that there was added to the church daily people that kept coming and joining the church and then we find that there were some of them that were phir phes that believe and no doubt some Sadducees that believe and others that begin to believe but the Bible doesn't say anything about them getting the Holy Ghost they just joined up with them and then before long they begin to get some of the rich folks to come in and some of the wealthy people of the cities and so on and they begin to say look now we we don't need this this type of religion we don't need this type where everybody screams and and shouts and hollers and runs and Praises God we don't need that so what did nicolan begin to cry for they begin to cry to get away from those crying shouting jumping screaming acts 238 young ones is that right now why because they now had become unestablished church now in that established church there were also preachers of course and there was going to be Apostles of course and Prophets why well if God used an apostle Satan knew better than to use a monkey if God would use a pastor Satan wouldn't use an elephant if God used a teacher Satan wouldn't use a jth if God's going to have a man in charge of the church called a pastor then Satan said fine then that's what I'll get too so I'll get men called pastors I'll get men called teachers I'll get men called evangelists I'll name them the exact same thing except they will preach my agenda and Satan always looks for men who wants to become something God looks for men who wants to become nothing you see the difference in the way we're going don't you so God has this church and it's going to be constructed by himself nobody else nobody else's opinion nobody else's idea and then he will build it upon the doctrine and the foundation of the Apostles and the prophets inspired by God and God's giving them now the original plan the original format as God gave to David and to Solomon the original plan of the of the temple that was called later Solomon's Temple so it was God that gave them the pattern then we come to the New Testament and God gives them the pattern of what they're going to do now they're going to start it out with with men just going around and trying to be say politicians come on now we've got a new relig religion here y'all want to just live for Jesus and and we'll give everybody so much drop M that was the Roman money of that time we'll give everybody 10 drop if you if you'll give your heart to God and and we we'll do this and we'll make you social this and that and no is that the way they're going to do it is that the way the Lord is going to propagate this church it's got to have the ability to reproduce itself so how is it going to reproduce are we going to reproduce it by handing out tracks or should we have sporting now of course the Romans had already broke into that and they had the Arenas everywhere and they had all different types of coliseums and sporting events because they were really big on that so there's no way the church would need to compare to that how is the church going to propagate how is the church going to survive how is the church going to live how is the church going to be run what it's got to be God that will set all this in order you agree so far it would have to be God right because God's not said AR now what are you all saying God didn't have a whole bunch of people say all right now I'm going to put this to a vote how many things you ought to have preaching well somebody say well yeah I think preaching's a good idea others say preaching what and what we need preaching for God never even asked them God just said this is what it's going to be I'm going to have Apostles prophets evangelists pastors and teachers and then in the church y'all going to need some deacons y'all going to need this and that so this is the way that it's going to be now do you believe this is God's original plan so God then ordained this and here Jesus speaks about it and then it's going to start being founded whenever the Holy Ghost comes back on the day of Pentecost and then God is going to form now remember this is the alpha or the beginning of the church whatever God does originally you can go back to it every time because he cannot change his program so God calls One god-given messenger out of every age and then he will give the word the light of God as we looked at the eye in the horn the horn representing the church the eye representing the messenger of the day through him the light of God begins to penetrate into the church and the church will hear the voice of God they'll know how they should conduct themselves well should we go to church should we assemble remember they never assemble quite like that before now in the Old Testament they'd get together at certain feasts and then they wouldn't see one another from months on in but God said I don't want that to happen in the New Testament as a matter of fact it must have been quite unusual because actually they began together on the first day of the week which was the Lord's day which was of course on Sunday now I realize there's there's a group of el of people in the Gentiles the still are sabit Terian and they want to be able to try to worship on Saturday that's fine they want to do that but that is not the Seal of God but the disciples in the New Testament they begin to start something that was different than the Old Testament in that they were starting to meet on a regular basis wow so they would in the Old Testament maybe go to go to the meeting house and they me there at the temple bring their sacrifice they would stay there together a couple of days and then they wouldn't come back for three or four months until some other type of feast and then they'd come back again but God said no that won't work now I want my people to be in fellowship with each other I want them to be in fellowship with me so I want this to be a regular Gathering together of my people so I can meet with them and then they started singing songs and hymns I remember David did that of course in the Old Testament and they had the coites they had the Levites they had the men that was the musicians and so on and much of the Psalms of course was written to them and they would sing but they'd never quite done it like the New Testament so the first service that they begin to have how unusual it must have been but it was the great great Builder constructing on the on the earth what he wanted to call now his church so the preachers never got up and preached about the next mayor that's going to run and you know there was no politicians standing up there saying all the things that the preacher say in this day and time they weren't standing up there and trying to just please everybody but they preached the gospel they preach salvation they preach water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Jesus Christ they preach the baptism of the Holy Ghost is that right so this is the thing then that God started now you imagine for the first several months and say on up into six months or a year and the devil is just kind of learning as this thing is going he's never seen anything quite like it they're meeting together and they're talking and they're singing and then these one guys get up and they're they're preaching and they call call the meeting to order and they just sing a little and they talk about the goodness of God and and they didn't know exactly how to go about themselves so they would just get up and feel led of the spirit of God to preach and they'd preach a little bit and testify and maybe have some to stand and sing of the glory of God and then they'd go to laying hands on the sick cuz that was in the original commission and they begin to form them church services you imagine as Satan began to look on it and he thought this is amazing this is am amazing I love this idea I want a church too I think I see now what God wants God wants to meet with his people on a regular basis and and and I I can see what it does to them it actually makes them magnetized to his Persona it it does something to them that the law never did it's it's actually helping them love one another better and that they're actually enjoying going to this and they're really enjoying being there so then you know the CH first church and that was in Jerusalem and then it began they begin to spread out so they went one here and there and there and by the time that Paul begins to write that there was a church in Corinth there was a church in Philippi there was a church here there was a church there by the time John began to write in the Book of Revelation there was churches now that have spread abroad in caposa they spread into Spain they spread into Europe so the gospel had begin to spread forth and everywhere they would go they begin to ordain churches I want you to listen now this is something that is totally new even to that world which would have been the modern world at that time they had never seen anything quite like this now the Temple of Diana of course was in several places and they would do something similar but yet it was not like this because there was something alive in these services so they would go and they would sing and they would worship and they would cry and the the difference one of the main differences of course was it was the Fountain of Life and Truth um the the idol worshippers most of them had uh all of these goddesses and Priests and priestesses and all of that and they had horrible horrible things that they did but these people were coming together and they were crying and they were worshiping and they were repenting of their wrong and then they would come up and they would sing and the spirit of God would gather among them and they would just love one another and oh my goodness and Satan thought this is awful this is absolutely horrible I cannot believe I let this happen right in front of me I didn't consider this a threat when I saw this first thing called a Church a that what they're calling it church I I can't believe that I did not recognize what a threat this really was but I can see this is worse than a wildfire this is a contagion it's catching on everywhere these guys go they're giving it's like somehow they've got life in them some way and when they get there it jumps out of them and other people get it and it's like they're becoming almost infected with this no it was actually sealed with it it wasn't an infection it was predestination but you watch him now as he begin to look at this and he he's learning he's learning as the move of God is starting to grow and begin its infancy and another time of course if Paul writes 1 Corinthians 55 ad something like that it is already now the churches are set in order and now you've got many of the Corinthian Church you know I'd like to bring it to you sometime I've studied it several years ago taking each one of the New Testament churches taking the positives and the negatives the drawbacks and the great things they had and the faults they had in each one of them and being able to compare and show you even the then it was exactly as it is today that there were no perfect churches in the New Testament so if you're looking for one let me just save you a lot of waste of time you ain't going to find more anywhere you got a bunch of people coming together you're going to have problems I don't care if it's Walmart Kroger baseball game or the church house you're going to have problems because everybody's opinion is so different and this is why that God had to have a designated plan and he himself was not only the architect the designer but also the Builder he did not just say I will be the architect of the church and then you all can change things if you need to now we changed many things on this building here I think sometimes that the architect only to draw draw it up to give brother Michael something to go by then he can make all the changes from there cuz he made plenty of them that's what I said about Carol whenever we built our house I told Brother L I said look I only ordered these plans and give Carol something to go by and there'll be many changes that'll happen thereafter and they did because she didn't like this and she didn't like that but hey she's the queen to the house I want her to be happy so what God didn't say now look if y'all need to modify chain S they said no no no no no I'm the architect I'm the designer and I am also the Builder but the problem is then that Satan wants to put people in that same church move now he does not want to just make his group totally separate and say well y'all do whatever you want to do we'll leave you alone you leave us alone oh no he realizes in order to try to bring the real move of God under his control he has to infiltrate that move move and try to project his own agenda into that move his own headship which will make it contrary to the headship of the word of God now he will do it by different means depends on the area depends on you know as the prophet said certain things that works in a certain area will go over and he said other areas it won't work at all that not only works in the kingdom of God it also works in the Kingdom of hell but Satan knew that he would have to interject so much of this stuff in there with another headship in mind so you've got a a godall man will say you got godall people that love the Lord and they're a part of that body and Satan begin to interject his own people inside of there with another headship then they begin to question this and question that well I don't understand I don't understand why we have to do that and no doubt some of the women and the Corinthian Church I don't understand why in the world we can't preach cuz some of them thought they were and it must have been very hard of them because many of them were prostitutes of the goddesses and so on that they come out of and they were the leaders in the church worship oh you didn't know that they were Absolut the leaders in idolatry the women were not the men So then whenever they got saved some of them had that same idea well they wanted to come in the church and preach a little bit and Paul said no you women you ain't supposed to do that well you know already Satan wanted to try to interject something into this great plan so Paul had to write of course in Corinthians more than any other church about all these things that was going on why why was this written because the headship of another being is trying to come into the church now I want to ask you Brothers here tonight are there any of your brothers in here that would like to share your wife with another man praise the Lord any brothers like to share your wife with any other man would you be okay with your wife having two heads neither does God neither does God now that's what Satan wanted to do he wanted to interject himself into the church in the way similar way that he interjected himself into the serpent in order to get to Eve's bedding ground then by doing that he can inject himself into the human race by vicariously fathering a child then all of us sitting here tonight are still affected in our flesh by what happened by that one act in the Garden of Eden that's why our flesh can't go to heaven in this form it's got to be changed now I know people don't like you to quote this but I'm going to quote it anyhow the prophet said when you see a naval he said you know it's a sign of a renegade so hello Mr Miss Renegade glad to meet you I'm Mr Renegade too so Satan was able to interject himself into the human race and if we look back into the Garden of Eden would see he repeats the same thing when the New Testament Church is being founded so then the Lord Jesus establishes his church and he gives them everything they're going to need down to the ages and he starts with exactly the same pattern that'll be repeated over and over and over again I mean looked at it in the saman church age and every Church age you have exactly the same pattern that is why the light comes from through God some God s messenger rather in a certain area then from that messenger there spreads the light through the ministry of others who have been Faithfully tall now God never intended then for just Paul one man to be the one that that would have it everybody else would just pass around his tapes or books as it were in that day but there were others that were supposed to come and have received the same life but of course all those who go out don't always learn how necessary it is to speak only now listen speak speak speak well apparently that's preacher in speak speak is a verb sir not press play Speak only what the messenger has spoken remember Paul warned the people to say only what he said wasn't that quite bold no he's given the commission of God to be the master builder remember we read that scripture some weeks ago and Paul said he was a master builder How could a man say that under divine inspiration of God now if it is Christ which is deity inside of him then it should be the same spirit of God inside of us notice the prophet goes on to say then that Paul admonished them to say only what he had said If any man think himself to be a prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge now listen let him acknowledge that the things which I write unto you are the Commandments of the Lord now this is pretty bold and Brazen but this is a man who knows what he's called to be this is God's way of carrying out the original plan by project his thoughts now remember a prophets made different than us he's made so that his subconscious and first conscience lay so close together that God can project himself right into that subconscious by the Supernatural and that's the way the validated thus sayeth the Lord is absolutely perfect now it's not like a man or woman that feels inspired and they speak in tongues or prophesy and it might be right and it about might be wrong but God never never committed the way of thus sayith the Lord to being an iffy situation so a prophet is the special creation of God so God can project to him his thoughts and it is absolutely infallible amen praise the Lord I'm glad myself aren't you now notice they add here they take away there soon the message is no longer pure and the re bival dies down now in order of course for God to be able to perate this church how will the church be able to reproduce itself because the church is in feminist form it is that part of the attribute of God that projected from eternity so how will the female be able to reproduce herself now there's no question in our minds I don't think that churches and America around the world are reproducing but how what kind of seed are they producing it so you know it's all part of every church I don't care what they believe what the foundation of their Doctrine is every Church wants to grow every Church wants to get bigger and get more members they want more people to come to their Church they want more people to have what they have because naturally they think a r or they wouldn't be there right and they want more people people in their Community people in their family so what do they do they begin to tell people oh come to our Church M we we've got this pastor and we've got this you know this this whatever it is so they use these different things and they actually are trained some of them and they are able to go out and knock on doors and be able to hand out little things you know to be able to get people's attention because they want their Church to grow well we do too in one sense of the word we want our church to grow but we we we approach it differently we want our church to grow by the spirit of God being able to deal with people's hearts and bring them to a saving knowledge if they're not saved of what the Lord Jesus did at Calvary is that right and if they are saved and not Sanctified then we want them to grow into that if they're saved and Sanctified and don't have the Holy Ghost we want them to grow into that and then we want them to grow into the revelation of the end time word where that God will be able to be word on top of word on top of word till they'll be able to be changed in a moment and the twinkle of an eye but we don't go through the ball and hand out little cards and we don't go the typical Church way of trying to get people to join our church neither do we try to call people on the phone and say now why don't you come over to our church and and leave your church cuz y y y'all y'all ain't hearing the truth and y'all going to hell and you know no we we don't believe in proelite there ain't going to be no thieves in heaven that includes preacher thieves some of the biggest thieves you'll ever know about are preacher thieves ones that steal sheep uhhuh ones that Ste sheep they done it in the days of Paul and they've done it all down through time that's right but yet we're not interested in that right we're on the same page right we're not interested in and in trying to bring people from somebody else's church just so we can say well we've got a big church and we've got a large and we got to Big this and that and the other I tell you what we got we got a big God we got a big God and we got a big city we're going to and a big Mighty heavenly father that loves us and we want to get our eyes off of anything big about us that's right but we do want everyone that he wants here with us now whoever that is then I trust him and I tell him all the time lord I want only who you want to be a part of our assembly that's all I want and I tell people if people come and talk to me and the are thinking about moving here or coming here from some other state or whatever more I tell them look I want you I told somebody not long ago if if God wants you here I want you here if God don't want you here I don't want you here because you'll come and you won't be happy and you'll make us unhappy while you're unhappy so if God wants you here that's exactly who I want I have never pulled on one person never in my Decades of preaching I have never pulled on one individual I have never offered one individual a position to come here oh that's done all the time oh we'll make you the singer we'll make you the third violinist and we'll make you the 14th backup on the piano and that you're the 27th back up on the bass guitar and you come to find out a lot of folks their main reason for switching churches many times is because they get a position that's right position means more to a lot of folks than eating right some folks will eat out of a garbage can as long as they can get a position and then they sneak and stream other preachers Services well preached brother Donnie now you realize that of course the Lord knew all of this would come now the Lord knew that oh my goodness one of the most horrible things that would be used down through time as far as instruments of Darkness God knew one of the most horrible things that would ever be used by the devil would be preachers good lord it's absolutely unbelievable the instrumentality of preachers and people of influence now whether it's a you know denominational guy or whether it's a Pentecostal guy my look I wonder how many actually that will stand before the Lord that day and say I cast out Devils I heal the sick I done this and that and the other and will wind up being lost and then the thousands or hundreds or whatever more of people that followed them all these TV preachers friends they are as rotten as they can be come on some of them ain't even saved come on now and yet Satan projects them and people get hurt by them and taken advantage of and then what did they do they put all pre in one big pile well don't put me in that pile cuz I don't belong in that pile there's Brothers here in this church that are genuine sincere men of God they don't belong on that pile either there's Brothers all over the world that stand for the truth of the Gospel that do not belong in that Heap that's what call called them they would Heap to themselves teachers having itching ears so the Lord knew that well why didn't he avoid that because that was his choice to use God God called Ministry he knew Satan would impersonate he knew that Satan would impersonate discernment and Satan would impersonate tongues in interpretation I know we don't hear quoted much around the message but in Harvest Time the prophet tells us the devil can hand out them Supernatural gifts by the handfuls by the handfuls the devil can hand them out oh my goodness now what's he going to hand them out to well they'll hand them out to different types of people depending on their influence and what they can do to be able to pull people away from the original church and always Satan's work will be more flowery it'll be more Hollywood it'll be more of a glitter and you know all that sort of thing and acceptable with everybody and loved by everybody nobody has nothing bad to say about him or nothing like that and Satan will always paint his up and he will make God's choice look so so small and so reproached and so misunderstood and so so hated by the world always and yet God says that's my wife that's my people that's who I put my Vindication on right now think if God is going to build this work himself and going to call it as he called it his church then he's going to have to have a Divine protocol by which this thing will be started God must build in it the ability for it to be able to reproduce itself because that's God's original Law of reproduction we can find that in the Book of Genesis where that the seed was in every kind now we know that the seed started out by the spoken word and then the trees begin to come up out of the earth and then God said let every tree bring forth of its kind of its seed which is in itself now it STS out with the seed spoken word then it comes up out of the ground bust up out of the ground for those that produce fruits then where does the seed wind up in the Apple where does it wind up starts in the ground comes through a process and then it winds up in the Apple itself so the Apple contains the seed a multiplication of the seed form that was in the ground that came from the spoken word is that right so then the fruit Bears the seed I it it really bothers me when I hear preachers blasting the fruit of the spirit cuz you think they don't even know what they're talking about they're blow we don't need the fruit of the spirit why the Pharisees had the fruit of the spirit they did not have the Holy Ghost they did not have the token life they could not produce a genuine fruit of the spirit in the same way and measure that a child of God can oh you say well I want the see well if you produce the fruit open up your Apple open up your Peach Your Plum your pear and what do you find inside the fruit the seed so the seed then comes to its fruition once it produces is the fruit this is where we are Mount Treetop in the last day so this is the attraction in the last hour and it's no re no wonder why that Satan is absolutely coming against a church like never before now as you know I'm in contact with many ministers all over the world I've never seen a Time the way it's been the last three or four years that the devil is attacking the ministry if it's not the health of the ministry it will be their family or it will be the church that they preach to or it will be just constant something going on all the time I don't know how many preachers that I know of right now that are dealing with all kinds of trouble either physical or or mental or psychological or problem why Satan attacking them with everything if he can get them leaders down get them depressed get them sad get them weary and then they just study a little bit and give you a little round mouth sermon and say go on back home now little children then what's he going to do you're not going to be strong to be able to meet the challenge in your hour but I'd like to let hell know tonight God has got some men of God that despite sickness despite disappointment despite sorrow despite misunderstanding and all kinds of other things they are anointed to speak the word they're going to not compromise they're not giving into hell they're not giving into sickness they're not giving into the devil they are preaching the word and they are getting abroad ready for the Rapture Hallelujah Brothers Let's jump down to 1 Corinthians chapter 4 verse1 15 we'll jump over a couple of these quotes here now watch the pattern of how a god call man was inspired by the Holy Ghost to write in the first church age 1 Corinthians 4:15 for though you have 10,000 instructors in Christ wow yet have you not many fathers there's a great difference between an instructor and a father oh yeah an instructor may or may not have the power of reproduction or begetting they can make followers after themselves I don't want you to be a reaganite I want you to be a son or daughter of God I'll tell you one thing if that's all you want to be I'm disappointed in you tonight just to be a reaganite no you need to set your goals way higher than me you need to set your goals higher than any man that's ever lived on the earth set them to the Lord Jesus so Paul by now there was already this division that was going on so there were some that did not have the power of begettal in other words they did not pack the seed germ in them now if you don't believe me this and you listen to spoken words Original Seed also end time seed sign in Tiff in Georgia and 1962 you heard the prophet saying the same thing that God was going to plant the way the church was going to grow in the body so the body would pack within itself the ability to reproduce itself so how what is the Greater Works imparting eternal life eternal life now many can study just by the Mind study the Bible study the Greek study the Hebrew study the message and be able to get up and give a good little talk of some sort and I hate to say friend but that's what some of the preachers are on the message they're just intellectual they study and they can talk oh I had one s and talk with me some time ago and and he was coming talking to me asking me for advice and as he sat there and he started telling me that he was called to do this and that and the other and he basically was giving me his resume well I I I went to this company and I turned it around and I went here and I turned this company around and I I done this and I turned this company around I thought called to do something for the Living God what in the world is your success as a businessman got to do with that if we could give Peter a resume now brother Peter we want to give you a resume right here tonight and uh we want you to fill this out uh brother Donnie I can't write my own name would you care to fill it out and I'll put a big X there uh now James what about you well the Bible says they were ignorant and unlearned men but there's one thing they did take note of they had been with Jesus so you could have an instructor oh they could instruct the word and lay the word and lay the word but they don't don't have the ability for Christ to reproduce himself through them but if you'll notice what they do they themselves father the people in their church then you'll watch the church WIll begin to take on the image of that man in the Pulpit why because he is actually the one that is bringing them in that's why they can't sneeze without him anybody preaches in the church they got to look at him say what he says CU they don't know the word themselves they're not be begotten of Father God they have to constantly have the permission from the pastor well come on somebody but you see a man who has the ability to be be bring forth children beget to beget as Paul said I begotten you to Christ he was a father so then that man that can do that all he is is just a carrier of the sea life he is actually a unic himself to where he he cannot interject his own lie to be able to bring forth s in the church so that I'll be like him so what you'll find when you go to them types of churches and you watch them you'll find a diversity of people that are there and they won't all be well if the pastor jer's neck a certain way then you watch those that are under the teaching of a scholar or a lecturer and they will act like him but if that man is simply a pass one that will pass the life of God they will what you'll find is some that'll jump some that'll shout some that'll cry glory to God some that'll sit there and look at them that's crying said man they're emotional L and what is it it's that diversity because the diversification comes from God but like beets like so you watch an instructor as his church begins to grow as we say and the blessing of the Lord is on us and you watch The Offspring and you see is that man producing word burst and how do they feel about the word give them the word test give them the word test now this is what they done in the original church and whenever they come up to them and boy they' go to say them things that Paul hadn't said they would withstand them to their face and call them Liars wow amen and the church said now watch for though you have 10,000 instructors in Christ yet have you not many fathers for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you he said through the gospel wherefore I beseech you be ye followers of me look at this word followers an imitator so Paul baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus and preachers in this day and down to the ages have baptized in the name of father son Holy Ghost they're not imitating Paul Paul said I speak in tongues more than you all but some of our message preachers don't even believe in speaking in tongues they're not an imitator well praise the Lord Paul cast out Devils heal the sick and yet some of our say well we don't need prayer lines no more my Lord we got more sick Fone now we've ever had them that's right well brother d That's a gentile way of believing I say Amen to that but I will also remind you it was the architect and the designer of the church who said these Sons shall follow them that believe and I did not find where he said up in the the last day it will end because you won't need it no more amen now you show me where he said that and I will say Amen but until you do I'm going to go ahead and pray for some right here tonight if they need it because my Lord Jesus was the one who told me to lay hands on the sick Oh Brother D speak the word speak the word speak the word I can do that I can do that yes sir you walk up here and you say brother Donnie I got confident speak the word you don't to lay hands on me I'll quote you the word of God Absolutely I'll say yes brother amen I agree with you I believe the word if that's your faith I believe that but if your faith ain't rose that place yet and you want somebody to lay hands on you here you go I'm here to help you oh but they'll never get high if you don't stop laying hands on them and where is that quote I find the prophet still doing that till he left oh somebody said he quits doing discernment I want you to show me that I want you to show me I don't want surmising I don't want your idea I want you to show me where he stopped laying hands on them I want you to show me where he stop Discerning come on somebody I want you to show me oh he he got H yeah brother Donnie he got away from that Pentecostal thing really well he was in streetport 11 2565 about a month and a half before the Lord took him from this Earth and he was talking about them acts 238 tongu speaking young ones and said that's the only kind that the word can bring forth they got that second Adam oh Hallelujah that second Adam way of acting like they did on the day of [Applause] Pentecost notice Paul says oh my wherefore I beseech you be ye followers of me ah you know everybody is going to follow somebody 1 Corinthians chap 11 verse 1 be ye followers imitators of me even as I also am of Christ come here Brothers de ye imitators of me come up here on the platform don't be scared I'm about you now you're going to imitate me and you're not did you last time or not I don't you didn't okay all right you want to change it up sure he wants to imitate me now tonight now Paul said be you an imitator of me you're not imitating me okay and you are praise the Lord praise the Lord don't you believe me are you in the message or are you in the church I mean Hallelujah Jesus is coming okay now I'm realized I'm a dumb Kian but you tell me which one that's right is imitating me him or him if you choose him you're a n thank you bre now why why because these are the men that were inspired with the original plan but George Smith told me something many years ago brother bram's house out in Tucson when they bought the house there brother Bram wanteded to add this gain room and brother M designed it and laid it all out maybe many of you have been there and he wanted wanted a a place to be able to put his trophies and all so the brother that he was going to get to build it brother Ram told him he said now there'll be all kinds of people that'll come in and see it and they'll have this idea and that idea and they'll want you to do this and that and the other he said now you be courteous but stick with the plan now this is the way we want to do when it comes to the gospel we want to be courteous to those that say you don't need this and you don't need that and you need this and you need that and we look in the plan and we say now the plan don't say that we don't want to get the wrong attitude we don't want to get a bad bad thing about it but we want to just be courteous but stick with the plan do we want a book of Acts Church do we want an Omega Church which reflect the alpha church we'll only get it one way that's by following the original plan let me have a few more minutes and we'll close can I yeah now Paul says in 2 Corinthians again chapter 1 verse or chapter 1 verse 24 not for that we have dominion over your face now notice how he wants to put this in there we're not trying to be your bosses we're not trying to be dictators not that we have dominion of your faith but are helpers of your joy come on now for by faith you stand Philippians 3:17 Brethren be followers imitate ERS together of me and mark them which walk so now Paul knew that he was going to pass he'd have too many years after this was written actually and he said now be followers of me and then I want you also to mark them which walk the way I walk why next generation of ministry Next Generation of ministry keep your eye on them and mark them mark them which walk so as ye have us for an example look at this word example pattern manner in the technical sense the pattern in Conformity to which a thing must you see it this pattern is not a suggestion on amen amen that's right it either is or it ain't you know who's going in the Rapture those who fit the pattern you know who's going to be left those who don't match the pattern now that's not just the churches only that's individuals in the churches oh my notice Philippians 3:18 for many walk of whom I've told you often and now tell you even weeping now listen what he says they are that they are the enemies of the Cross of Christ now watch they had come so close Harry now they were right around the message they were right there among them brother Larry no doubt said we're preaching Christ oh Hallelujah Hallelujah but Paul said I'll tell you what they are they're enemies of the Cross but did you notice this man's attitude toward them for many walk of whom I have told you often and now tell you even weeping oh yes this is the true Spirit which God wants to use to speak to people in an error God will never take an angry human Spirit to correct wrong he don't use that God don't need our human angry Spirit now God has an angry an anger oh yeah he anoints His prophets and his servants to speak that way sometimes but there's a difference between his anger and human anger notice Paul speaking about these men and they had actually become enemies of the Cross of Christ because they were some of the guys that was preaching circumcision these were some of the guys that said you got to keep the law of Moses you've got to do this and you got to do that oh yeah the cross is good the cross is good but you cannot be saved if you don't get circumcised Paul said they are enemies of the Cross yet preaching it yet preaching it but not preaching it in its reality it form and Paul was sitting there as he was in the jail which is where this was written in prison sitting there in prison brother Rob writing this tears running down his face or you see those preachers or men that find pleasure in the fact that others are inconsistent and they rejoice when they hear this man or that man or this church or that church is in trouble or or doing wrong and and they rejoice it does something good to them there's something wrong with their Spirit friends if we know there are people in our church that aren't doing right and we know there are churches in the message that aren't doing right and we do and we would Rejoice because of that it would make us happy because of it we need to pray God will help us it should break our hearts should break our hearts to hear if there's anybody Among Us that's not living the kind of Life they should live it should break our hearts to hear that there's any even on the fringes of our message that are not doing right why brother Donnie the next verse is why who end is destruction whose God is their belly whose glory is in their shame so the very thing they should be ashamed of they're glorying in their glory is in their shame their Glory oh we don't we don't preach that at our church we don't go that way and they glory in it but it's really their shame because they don't preach it yeah then we should grieve and pray God please help them please God help them there's someone in our church that ain't doing right God please help them help them to realize it's dangerous to come and set where the presence of God is and not yield to the spirit of Goden oh my whose glory is in their shame who mind Earthly s things to's stand together can you see tonight why Satan wanted to impersonate himself as the church you realize that's a quote he has deceived the People by impersonating himself as the church yes sir so they sang about the blood they sang songs about the cross they sing about heaven they sing and talk about hell oh he said there's such good people good people good people yeah till you show them them good scriptures yeah and then you'll see a side of them that you had never seen before M yeah believe me as a pastor I get aide of a lot of people that you never see I get a side of a lot of preachers that you never see you see that side they want you to see but I see a different side especially when I give them the word and give them the message uhhuh then you ought to read some of the emails I get from preachers you ought to read some of the texts I get from preachers you'd never believe it so does that make you happy it breaks my heart and I hope and pray to God it always does how many wants to be more like Jesus may God help us excuse me that we will not only want a church like the original church but we will so feel this is what Paul another example that he gave for us preachers so when we hear of someone going off we hear of you know a move over in Africa I just heard a song this evening sent to me by someone a group a message group and they were singing about this certain man I mean just about worship just unbelievable absolutely unbelievable I saw a V video of of a group in another country many thousands of miles here and this preacher was walking up um between them going in to preach and they were bowing down before him when he got up to preach later in the service they were calling him Elohim I've stood in that church and preached God have mercy well brother Donnie you think they're sincere you think they're good people no doubt they are but they got under an evil spirit I don't know how much you pray for the bride around the world but you need to you really realize we cannot go home as a group until every member of this bride gets to her place if there's a little girl or a little boy let me quote it to you from Tampa 1964 but there's a little girl a little boy here born over in Seattle Washington and that book holds their name we will not go home friends he said the church will play along slug along have meetings and so forth until that child is able to receive it do you imagine there might be one little boy that's holding up this whole thing tonight and that little boy's got to get saved and got to get filled with the Holy Ghost and we're just waiting and we're having church on Wednesday and on Sunday and we're just meeting and Gathering people people all over the world doing it but he so loves that bride he'll not call that's thousands or Millions home and leave one behind I'm glad I might be that one a you think of this we need to think not only local but Global Lord your people be merciful Lord I hear there's people off in India and this I hear there's people off in Africa there I'm not interested Lord getting myself involved all that but Lord God bring your children home bring your children home if they got to be removed out from under a false prophet Grant it Lord if they got to be removed out from under a false teacher Grant it Lord do you pray that way brother Donnie I absolutely do sir yes I do I pray that God will bring his people out from under false teaching and error we ain't going by ourself we're going Hallelujah as a group around the world oh sure God's calling individuals we know that but this last group we must all go together and no heaven will not be in sections well we can't have fellowship with them people over there cuz we didn't like them down in life and we didn't like them people over there and then there won't be nobody there with that attitude we've got to love one another we can disagree and still love one another praise the Lord oh Jesus let's just bow our heads if you would wow Lord I must say I am overwhelmed by the way you took this this way tonight oh my goodness I pray that I'll always be sensitive to be able to follow your spirit I had all these wonderful scriptures and quotes laying before me tonight and I didn't hardly get to get to none of them but great architect you're still the designer of sermons amen may always be sensitive to follow your leading Lord Heavenly Father our building would look different than the original Church they didn't have no doubt musical instruments quite like we do no doubt there'd be things that would be different but Lord we would want our Doctrine our principles the foundation of our faith to be the same I've tried among the countries of Latin America and their music there is different than ours the music in Kenya different than the music in Zimbabwe the music there different from India the music there different from China and different places that I've been in the world and you leave it that way but yet Lord you we believe you're going to have your people to be one in Soul one in heart one in principle oh Jesus gather your people together father from around the world men always want to try to gather them under one certain man so they're all listen to his stuff but how carnal that is Lord gather us in Christ Jesus Lord Jesus may your presence so move among us here father that we can lay aside our little pet doctrines and pet ideas and be one like never before we will always disagree on things no doubt but I believe tonight you're getting a group of people together around the world that are coming into that Unison and that Harmony of the new births oh Jesus get us together father get us together so we can leave this place we need you Lord maybe there's one maybe there's a thousand maybe there's 10,000 no way for us to know but we know the Rapture will not go until every member of that bride is in her place maybe a little black boy maybe living on the streets of kinasa maybe a little black girl living on the streets of Nairobi the Congo maybe a little black boy Down in Africa somewhere or Florida or New York little Indian maybe out in the reservations oh God wherever they are would you get them Lord yes Lord this world is getting worse every day it's a more unfit place for us to live come Lord Jesus come Lord Jesus take us away Lord God if there's any here tonight that needs to fix anything in their soul in their walk would you help them may we be able to move Lord into a sphere of love that we've never had before a love of your word love for your people of course first and foremost a a love for you and I'm sure Lord that there'll always be people that maybe will love you a little more as I read it to Carol on Monday where your Prophet said Peter never had that love in his heart that John had that Peter was more of a representative of face but he never quite loved you the way John did and I thought wow so I can't keep from wondering then if there even people that come to the maturity of love if there won't be some that might love you a little more than us so help us to realize we're not trying to match each other but just become mature in all that we can be I'll never be what a lot of Great Men are in many ways but what I want to be is what you want me to be amen I may never have the love for you that brother Ron Spencer has or brother Tim or maybe brother Daryl but Lord I do know this I want to love you as much as I can I may never have the Fai that some of them might have but I want to have all the faith that I can have to match all the things that I am for your purpose and use I just want to be what you want me to be amen I want to love you I want to serve you I want to be everything that I can for your kingdom Lord cuz it isn't about me it isn't about these people it's about us it's about you it's about you living in US Lord I read it yesterday where your Prophet said we're not worshiping a baby and a Manger deity and a Manger but we're worshiping deity in us so that same deity is not laying in Bethlehem but deity is right here
