Grace we always appreciate you coming and just taking your place amen praise the Lord this is home for sister Grace and if you don't know her wedding was the first wedding in this church I just want to put you up to dat amen praise the Lord amen let's take our Bibles tonight to Revelation chapter 5 Revelation chapter 5 something caught my attention in Revelation chapter 5 couple of weeks ago while I was down in uh uh in Tennessee look and not praise the Lord Revelation chapter 5 thank you all for coming many of our students are getting out of school we want to thank the Lord for granting them a SA School Year Praise the Lord keeping them in in in in everything that is happening around the world around the country Revelation chapter 5 we read from verse one tonight and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the back side seal with Seven Seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud Voice who is worthy to open the book and to lose the seals thereof and no man praise the Lord sorry and no man in heaven none in Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look there on and I wept much because no man was found Wy to open and to read the book needed to look there on now you I want us to pay attention to that no man verse five and one of the others said unto me weep that Behold The Lion of the Trap of Judah the root of David have prevailed to open the book and to lose the Seven Seals thereof amen and I beheld and low in the midst of the throne and all the four beasts and in the midst of the other stood a lamb as it have been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the Earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book now this is where where uh I got it really caught me when he have taken the book The Four beasts and and four and two 20 others fell down before the lamb having every one of them HS and golden VES for of others which are the prayers of the Saints praise the Lord the Lord bless you you may have your seat when I read this the other time I I read it again it caught my attention like I said to realize that when he have taken the book when he took the book The sealed book praise the Lord the Bible says the four beasts and the 24 athers they fell down before the lamb but they were having in their hand HS praise the Lord which is an instrument and they were also having VES I I I thought I was going to bring one but that's it's not they were having vowes also that were F of incense and and and and what actually was in the vows were the prayers of the Saints praise the Lord amen at the opening of the seals we get to see and understand what has become of our prayers praise the Lord and I think that is something that this last days church is losing the reality of what it is with all the the you know the the gadgets that we have and and and I mean we we our age is such a busy fast moving age that we really don't have time to pray praise the Lord that we really don't have time to pray but I thought about this and I've been I just been looking through the word I've been looking through the message I I've been say been looking and saying you know what you know I want brother BR wanted to see what brother brandham said on this you know the the the prayers of the saints that are gathered in this vow in the Old Testament there in the book of Psalm uh uh David told us our tears I gather in the bottle he said God gather my tears in the bottle a bottle of remembrance and here and year that John is seeing when the book came open he seing our prayers in the vce and and and uh what actually it is is in this vow of incense that blow in the face of God praise the Lord if we know how important this is we will have a prayer life like never before if we know how important and Powerful this is you will never come to church without a prayer request because you always have something to pray about you always have somebody to pray about praise the Lord amen glory be to God but just like I I said our age is such a busy and fast moving age that I mean we want to do everything on the on the you know on the cell phone we want to do everything on the uh uh you know on the cell phone you know uh we send our prayer needs and this is uh you know uh Lord please help our brother we we send God a text message God please help our brother Lord we praying for our sister and and and sometimes that's all praise the Lord it it's not wrong don't don't don't think that I'm bashing against that it's not wrong but if that is just all your prayer you are worse than a Catholic praise the Lord amen if that's just all your prayer by sending those uh few messages and says Lord bless our brother Lord and yeah we yeah then then I mean that's that's ugly I believe that is uh is uh uh a medium by which we can encourage someone that we are praying for them and actually go back and really pray for them praise the Lord but tonight I will I will start and then I will before I go into what I want to say as I always don't have time I want to go back uh a little bit on uh on on on Sunday for some reason after the service Sunday I was so tired my goodness I don't know what it was but uh uh I just felt like uh uh I just felt like we had a good service amen good service will make you tired praise the Lord good service will make you tired but what while we were we were speaking on on on Sunday uh there were there were there were thoughts that that i' I've never thought about and uh you know and it was almost like they just came right to me right behind the pullit here and uh and and they were beautiful because they were now part of my NS what the thought was is that uh there was a period of time where I took the four beasts which is the four living creatures the four anointing and I was talking about the the the dove coming on the lamb praise the Lord amen that was what we saw at the River Jordan praise the Lord amen we saw the dove returning on the lamb at the river jording which is the Holy Ghost and then we spoke also of the do leading the lion which of course it had to be the Holy Ghost leading the first three Church ages because the first three Church Ages was under the anointing of the lion are we together and and actually uh uh I think I think the thought came or the inspiration came because I had in my not were you know brother bam talk about the do leading the eagle and but he said that on the wings of a snow white do and uh uh uh you know relating that to his healing and relating to what was happening at that period of time but as as we were talking on that and I talk about the dove Leading The Lion and the dove uh leading the ox you know it was the do uh H or the lamb nature in the ARX you know that uh the had the Saints during the time of the persecution for them to be able to you know bear persecution you know uh uh uh give their body to be burned go to prison and all the things that they had to go through and the do leading the you know the the the man uh uh on the the next uh uh uh uh uh Three Ages now so the first three ages the first three three Church Ages was honor the Lion's anointing that was where the great missionary work was done praise the Lord amen now what I want us to understand and learn from these living creatures is that uh that that is that's the anointing that God used to influence his church in every age praise the Lord amen he used that to influence because the church can do nothing but just respond to the anointing of their age praise the Lord amen until God comes and anoint us with his Spirit we will just be having a form of organization amen trying to make the church okay let's do this so the church can be better let's do this so the church can be better we will just come up with all of those ideas at the end we will fuss and everybody will go their way but until God anoint that's the reason why Jesus told the disciple to wait for the holy ghost in the upper room amen T until you are Inu with power power from on high so when that anointing comes that's what makes the church to go into what we are supposed to do praise the Lord are we together amen now so uh uh you know I I was thinking about that but then I thought that I will I will I will look at it through the opening of the seals I will look at it at Revelation chapter 5 so that's what I want to do tonight by the help of God now so when you look in Revelation chapter 5 as we have just read you will realize that uh the scripture is talking about the open the the opening of the seals I'm not going into the seals I just want to deal with things around it so so you can be able to grab the picture here now the Bible speaks of uh uh the strong Angel there in verse two that Proclaim with a loud voice who is wed to open the book and to loose the seals thereof now this book is the book of redemption like we all know this book is is the is is the ttle day amen it's the it's the book of life it's the book from where Adam was operating from in the beginning praise the Lord amen when we really get down to study the the the the the book of redemption and the opening of the seals you will realize that it's more than just a literal book okay now so this book Adam fulfilled the book amen it was the book that was giving him the the the power and authority for him to name the animal and God will be pleased it was the book that was giving him the Authority for him to control nature yes praise the Lord but when he listened to the devil Li the book The Authority the anointing you can call it whichever one is stay the same went back in the hands of the original owner it went back in the hands of God praise the Lord amen so in every age God will now have to deal with a man God will have to call a man into a life of Separation to be able to give him a portion of anointing for his age praise the Lord God called Noah a preacher of righteousness he was a farmer but from that book Noah was able to build an ark that was that that could survive the Judgment under that anointing Noah was able to bring all of those animals of different nature and keep them together praise the Lord he was operating from The Book of Life he was operating from from the title day a portion of anointing was given to him for that work Abraham had his shield and and and down Through the Ages praise the Lord but yes the book here returning back and now that's that's where I want us to to to be able to look at tonight and and there is no man worthy to take the book to even look upon it no man who is wor say to open the book and to lose the seals thereof verse three says no man in heaven none in Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to to to look there on John said he weep because no man was worthy the reason why I say we should pay attention to man is because when God created everything in the beginning Genesis chapter 1 it was man that God created in His image praise the Lord amen so man from the very beginning from the mind of God the that God Tau about a man was for a man to be his agent yes praise the Lord the thought of God for man because God is a spirit amen and for God to make his known his thought about a man is that the man will be the vehicle that he would drop in Praise the Lord the man will be the body that the spirit God will come and D in that was God's original thought for Us Praise the Lord his thought was to dwell in us and that's why he made us in His image and not for us to have our own life and struggle by ourself but his thought was to dwell in us that we will be his agent praise the Lord that if he want to make contact with the rest of his creation he will use man he will speak to man or he will send a man or he will Empower a man praise the Lord that was God's thought now so uh uh let's let's just read something here it will help us to to get our TOS together tonight God in his people if I said to you that I was I was born of the spirit of God and the spirit of Jesus Christ was in me you did expect me to do what he did I like he did and his Spirit working through a human being pay attention now do you believe that his Spirit work on a h h a bride seing one time do you believe that and on the pool of beesa the water chopped up in another in another sense there was current in the water amen the pool of beest that the water chop or trouble water ever who step in there believing they receive their healing is that right Co the water say look what a great water I am could the water say that no because it was not the water it was God coming on the water the same God that walk on the water in the beginning he was now coming on the water just shaking the water are we together it was the angel on the water that done the healing not the water there Angel when the angel went away it was just water praise the Lord it was the angel on the Brazen serpent that was doing the healing when the angel went away it was just brazing stepping that's the reason why when the people started worshiping it Hezekiah had to destroy it because it it became an idol if God is not in is an idol praise the Lord are we together are we together amen when the angel went away it was just a water men are just men men are just men speaking in a generous sense Hans are just Hans it's not talking mostly about men as a gender but humans are just humans men are just men but it's God's agency going back to God's purpose praise the Lord going back to his purpose to always use man to do something amen use a man to preach use a man to play music use a man also to listen to his word but we have to remember that men are just men God doesn't fall upon denomination he just don't fall upon an empty building praise the Lord amen we try to do the best you know uh to keep you know uh uh this place decent clean uh it's in one sense it is for our own good it's for our own health amen we don't want to come in a nasty place we get sick praise the Lord but you see it is not when we say the house of God as if to say that's where God live we come into his house when we leave we leave him in his house and we go to our house no he don't fall upon the building he fall upon humans praise the Lord so is the atmosphere that we create the Praises that we give to him we lift our hands we sing that's what brings him closer it's not the building it's not the mountain it's not the water it's not the Brazen sepin are we together God thus inold upon denomination God does inold upon mechanical divines praise the Lord amen it's not it's not the building and I will even say it it's not the tip that you listening to let me tell you what is what is real praise the Lord amen it's not the tape that's the reason why press play will not work God needs a man he needs you your faith to want to hear from God sir it is your faith and your desire that you want to hear from God praise the Lord it is your faith and your desire it is God coming to honor your faith praise the Lord are we together so God don't fall on my mechanical device God the Holy Spirit falls upon men God falls upon Hans he come and anoint Hons he anoint the desire that is in our heart praise the Lord amen are we together glory be to God it do for F upon mechanical device God the Holy Spirit fought upon men men are God agents and the hardest thing that God has ever had to do was to get one m to believe another that's another part of Faith praise the Lord amen that's another part of it but we want to establish the fact that man was God's aging are we together glory be to God you know when you read Malachi 4 if uh if uh if uh I uh uh folks back there can just put Malachi 4 for us we love that Malachi 4 behold I sent you Elijah I was thinking about that the other day I say uh if God can just help us to see what a beautiful promise this is amen the promise is behold I God send you praise the Lord yes sir if you realize in that prophecy amen if you realize in that prophecy the three person that is spoke about Elijah is last behold I God send you Elijah so you see the ministry of Elijah is to push you to God it's not to get between you and God no the ministry of Elijah is to push you praise the Lord is to expose you to God is to it's so it's to make you to get in contact with God he the ministrator is not to be God to you are we together praise the Lord now so man has always been God's Agent Man has always been God's agent because God do not fall on building neither do he fall on mechanical device the Holy Spirit falls upon men are we together let's read the next one our next uh yeah God has a hard time trying to get somebody that he can deal with that will stay humbl now you see in in in the first quote we read brother brandham say uh the harder thing that God have is to have one Mort to believe in another praise the Lord amen that is the hardest thing because we we we are all failures if God don't help us we are all failures amen but then let's read the next one and this one we establish or why why is that God has a hard time trying to get somebody that he can deal with that will stay humble and meek and stay in the place until God call him to do something you believe that a man that God can bless and he will still keep himself a man and not make himself an angel or God now you see because that is the thing that makes it difficult for one m to believe in another M because God himself have a hard time to keep us humble praise the Lord when he starts to bless us and nourage us a little bit give us a little understanding of his word and wisdom pretty soon we we start to be smart praise the Lord he has a hard time a man that he will bless and for that man to remain a man pretty soon he exalted himself above the people he either an angel or he's God to them as soon as a man gets bless and has a little something given to him he want to become God he want to become an angel he want to become some great person mean mine that's the wrong attitude God is haunting for somebody who he could bless and pour out his Blessing and the more he bless the little the man will be praise the lord it's not in our falling flesh praise the Lord this this flesh is not what is in this flesh is yeast it just need a little Heat it start to puff up it just need a little heat it starts to swe praise the Lord why because men fell from he lost the title that was the thing that kept Adam humble it was the T it was the life of God it was the anointing in whichever way we want to look at it tonight that's the reason why no man was worthy to take the book because now we are all affected by a blood of the serpent we are all affected by the cross breeding of the serpent in Eve praise the Lord he tried a Noah and at the end he got drunk praise the Lord he tried at Abraham and he told the LIE he tried Moses because of that cross breeding that's the reason why no man was watered but you see the thing there is that not only in the sense of no man was wanted to take the book but the book was for man are we together now another thing I want for us to see in Revelation chapter 5 is this the Bible says no man the Bible also speak and says uh uh the lion of the tribe of Judah has prevailed to take the book amen and when John Lo to see the lion he saw a lamb now I'm coming back to to Sunday just the same as no man was wanted to take the book that is the same as there was no because what what I what I want us to grab what I want us to grab I'm I'm kind of for trying to bring to you tonight is that the reason why no man was wanted to take the book is because he lost the T praise the Lord is because there was something that he needed and like I said on uh on Sunday onor every age when God de with the Believers in the first three Church ages he kept them under the Lion's anointing but yet they were under the Lion's anointing that was the anointing of the age but what they needed for the do to come upon the lion was the lamb nature praise the Lord amen so if we want to take it in an for for an example all the animals in the in the AR was all under the lamb nature now uh uh not not the physical lamb but the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world are we together it was that lamb nature so just as the same as no man was wed to take the bug we can say no lion was wed to take the B we can say no Ox was wored to take the B what am I talking about when I says that I'm I'm referring to the anointing in the sense that no matter what age a man was was honor for him to bring Christ to the people he needed to be onor the line he needed to have the lamb nature praise the Lord and and and that's where that's where the H uh our struggle is because you find uh uh uh you know people they can they can they can be able to run through the stript they can run through the the cult and tell you you know the Bible says that or the prophet says this but when it comes to that Lin nature just like brother Bram says here a man that God will bless and he will remain humble praise the Lord when it comes to that Ling nature that was what no man was walking because we will not take the b in our in our falling state but yet you will realize that the lamb that prevailed to take the book also became a man praise the Lord and that's where the king's man Redeemer comes in he had to be a Kingsman praise the Lord he had to be nearer to us so he had to take on existing element body it had to be God himself coming and dwelling in that body praise the Lord and that's the reason why when Paul would teach in the book of Corinthian he says let me show you the most excellent way you can desire gift and want to do something for the Lord but he says let me show you the excellent way to do it the first thing that you need to get is to get a lamin nature and let the dove comes in which is charity praise the Lord amen because no matter how anointing you can be no matter how you can be able to grab people and you can drive them you can bring them to the altar if that Ling nature is not there you're not getting the people to Christ praise the Lord you are not getting them to Christ you are just getting them uh uh religious you are giving them lot of information and not getting them to Christ praise the Lord are we together that's what wrong God is haunting for the man for somebody who he could bless and pour out his Blessing and the more he blessed the little the man will become and you will never get more of God until you become new nothing praise the lord we all want to do something for God Amen we all want for God to use us in a mighty way but the Way Up Is Down amen you have got to belittle yourself he that exalt himself God will abase he that will humble himself God will exalt you have got to get little before you can get big praise the Lord and you will never be big in yourself in your own self are we together are you seeing the comparison amen because you see uh uh uh uh uh it kind of for helps because uh you look at the life of Paul and you look at the life of uh you know the apostles through the age you realize that these men were not working on their own it was their anointing and every age can only respond to the anointing of their age are we together glory to God so that just uh uh uh uh something that came to me on Sunday that I wanted to share with you now let's just get into what we want we want to talk about tonight the golden vers uh uh uh that that that hold the the prayers of the Saints let me let me share this with you from the message Bridge brother Bram said he said tonight he's a mediator but he's coming today watch and when he and when he have taken the book The the four beasts and the four and and 20 ERS fell down before him having every one of them halfs and golden vows full of others which are the prayers of the saints that those that's under the altar that have prayed for a long time they have prayed for Redemption pray for resurrection and yeah these others are are are pouring out the prayers before c now we have got a representative we got a Kingsman in heaven that comes forth to make a claim praise the Lord now you have to realize now the lamb has just come come to take the book amen and the reason why he came to take the book is to make a claim and what is he making claim on he making claim on what has been requested so you see the connection that brother brandham is making with the prayers of the Saints and the taking of the book Paul says the same thing in Hebrew he's the high priest of our confession praise the Lord he makes claim on what we confess are we together so you see the comparison that he's making he's saying now we have a representative we have a Kingsman because all of these old all of the Old Testament sins they have been praying for Redemption they have been praying for Resurrection they have been all the pray prayers that they have been now we have a Kingsman on the throne praise the lord we have one that could be touched by the feelings of our infirmities we have one that came and he was born of a woman he came right from the womb he went down to the Grave he knows every pain that we feel he knows every emotion we share in our body now he's on the throne he can represent us praise the Lord praise the Lord if we realize that if that is a revelation to us oh then the song will make more meaning I must tell Jesus all of my trials what a friend we have in Jesus will make more a sense to us are we together let's look at another one again in the bridge he also face the very same message he says listen what a jubilee going on when they seen the lamb come and take the book of redemption the soul stream out we will get it all everything the others fell down they pour out the prayers of the Saints what but they was represented a Kingsman For Us Praise the Lord amen so uh uh I mean you you you hear this thing we you know you hear this thing uh uh uh all your prayers is just touching the ceiling and just coming down you know all of those things were said during the the fire and brimstone days because because it was all like we we we have to rock the church we we have to push the benches we have to we have to I mean we got to sweat it out praise the Lord maybe the time that we did not had one on the throne maybe the time we didn't had a Kingsman praise the Lord but the Bible says he can be touched by the feelings of our infirmities praise the Lord it means that when when when we when you are going through something and you are right in that moment praise the Lord if you turn it up to him he can relate to it he can connect to it he can henage praise the Lord in the first HEBs he also says this I'll read few of them and then we will close toight is almost 9:00 he says notice notice now now if there's no alter of sacrifice in heaven where is the sacrifice for sin laying them praise the Lord the L L there has to be a place where that sling lamb bloody is laying there where the blood is now the incense was the other the other stuff that they burn which the Bible says was the prayers of the Saints if there isn't No sacrifice on the altar then the pray prayers cannot be received now here another connection the other says who's wanted to take the book another one says the lion of the Trap of Judah has prevailed amen but when John turned to look for the lion he saw a lamb and the Bible said in was a bloody lamb being a bloody lamb shows that there was an UT for the lamb to be killed praise the Lord is the picture coming to together amen because you see that is the reason why like like uh H uh Genesis there the Bible says the blood of ab CED out of the earth to God when God will come down and reconcile Adam back into Fellowship he had to come with a bleeding line amen the Bible says there in Hebrew with our blood there is no remission of sins it's almost like with our blood there is no Fellowship that is the reason why even the Jews they cannot they cannot be able to have their worship because they don't have their sacrifice are we together praise the Lord but here we have a lamb a bleeding lamb that that John identified there when he looked to see the lion he saw a lamb the Bible says wounded for our transgression bruised for our iniquity so because there was a line on the altar it means that our prayers can be heard praise the Lord because our prayers are coming through the sacrifice that he made it's not coming on our works it's not coming on how how many hours we sweat it out no it's coming on the sacrifice that is on the throne are we together I will come back to the the the fifth SEI again before we close but let me read this last one this this is uh uh a comparison now they were living keeping the the the statute the Lord and so forth and they went down to worship during the time and Zachariah was a priest in the temple and his job was to wave the incense while the prayers of the saints were going up out in the congregation now that's the Old Testament Temple that's the Old Testament Tabernacle praise the Lord amen so that was the work of uh of of the priest that was the work of Zacharias he come and he blow he blow incense now you have to realize that God told Moses to build this Tabernacle according to the faction in heaven so here say here they had a type they had a physical type where the priest blow the incense before the people come in and and and and then and make their prayers to God that their prayers their desires and everything they express to God will will will will be a sweet smelling to to the Lord praise the Lord whether whether the confession of their Saints whether they are putting their sick need or whether they are putting their burden and asking God for for for deliverance when they come before they come into the place of worship and come and lift up their prayers that old priest goes there and he bow the incense and he makes sure that the place was smok it enough for the people to come in but yet when the seals were open in Revelation chapter 5 the very thing that was done in the physical temple on Earth we see that happening in heaven we see that happening when the seals were open praise the Lord hallelujah you see that is the reason why I mean uh uh uh no church or no Christian can strive without a prayer life praise the Lord amen no Christian can strive with our a prayer life no church can strive without a Praying people are we together I mean it's easy for us to to uh uh uh just get caught up in in uh in uh uh uh uh some some sort of emotion and you know and then uh we can we can we can you know run run the emotion of the People by the beat of the drum and and and and and and the farm music and you know and we come and just read some scripture and encourage the people you know God will see us through you know our God is more than able and we can say all of these things to the people but when the people are not lifting up their hearts in prayer if the people are not spending time with God praise the Lord when the people are not burning incense this time is not the physical incense it's your prayers that's how your prayers rise up to God praise the Lord every time you pray the prayer you are burning incense every time you you bring a prayer request you are burning incense for someone then read the next verse in Revelation the Bible says and they sing a new song do you see what I said the last time the order of the service prayer comes always before worship praise the Lord prayer comes before worship that's the reason why the beginning of the service is not when the song leader comes here the service begin when the first person comes through that door and get in prayer that's when the service begins that is the man that is burning incense that is the woman that is praying an atmosphere that's the next verse the Bible says then they sing a new song After the prayers has gone up praise the Lord but you see loudish your church is so busy that we have we we we we have we have organized a new order for service we get enough people in let's let's just wait let's just wait let's wait let's let's get 30 minutes they will come let's wait we wait for them to come then we say let's begin the service that's not God's order praise the Lord not not not God's order Zacharias was not waiting for the people to show up before he burn in in he knew that he needed to burn incense I believe certainly there were there that he burned incense and nobody came praise the Lord but just that sweet smell rising up to heaven was an intercession for the people that's what the laisha church has become we wait for the people we're not supposed to wait for the people we need to wait on God don't wait for the people we wait on God praise the Lord that's right onor the opening of our seals it shows us the things that is that is important not even the Revelation John have not even seen what was in the seals he didn't even know what the seals contain but the first thing the first thing that he saw when the lamb took the book was the prayers of the Saints praise the Lord the prayers of the Saints are more important than the Revelation because the revelation will only become a head knowledge if there is no prayer to back it up the prayers of the Saints is more important than the explanation of the Bible comparing scripture with scripture comparing quotes with quotes all of those things are just information if the church don't have no prayer that's the reason why we have all of these Revelation but yes we have forces and strife we have all of this Revelation everything we have been taught but it's all because the church is filling in praying she's not burning incense praise the lord we must not go without our a prayer need if you don't have nothing in your life to pray about there is something your neighbor need to pray about there is something your brother need to pray about there is something the church need to pray about the reason why we don't have prayer needs is because we don't we don't have burden if your heart is burden you will always find something to pray about we rush into praying and we rush out if that's a place that the church is afraid to stay is in the place of praying and that's the place that she supposed to be praise the Lord that is the place that she's supposed to be before even John will start seeing the the horse riders he will start seeing the pl he will start seeing everything that would be in the seals to be revealed the first thing that he saw when the lamb took the book the prayers of the saints that was the first thing that he saw and when those prayers were poured out then the Bible says they sing a new song because the atmosphere was right for worship when the prayers were poured out the atmosphere was right for worship we never have a right atmosphere until we have a Praying Church you will never have a right attitude of worship until you have a Praying life praise the Lord may God help every one of us praise the Lord may he help us we don't need that emotion you just need the discipline praise the Lord you just need the discipline that you can see in need you can see in need you can see something that you're not happy about you don't have to wait for the Wednesday night service you could stay right where you are and say Lord Jesus please help that lady it's a heart it's it's a heart that is toned in praying a heart that is in speaking terms of God the musicians can come I hope it was an encouragement to you tonight an
