the lord amen praise the lord you know uh uh that's that's one of my prayers and desire which of course the lord has blessed us you know uh in this little assembly [Music] whenever we we have a minister or whenever we have services on the weekend you notice that is not only we that are blessed you know even the ministers that come to preach they are also blessed you know brother but they say he really enjoyed the service you know this is it's nothing like preaching to a people and being received you know when the preacher feels like uh you take him off of his notes you know he feels like i mean the pool was just all over the place you know uh the last time we had brother chase and he also testified to the same and uh we pray that the law will you know would just would just keep us humbled and keep our hearts you know let's let's have a heart that is ready to receive the word i mean a people i mean that can be so ready for the word that even if we call for the service on monday night we can show up and there will not be no difference than the service on sunday morning amen that's a people that are ready for the word amen praise the lord we pray that the lord will bring us to that place that we will have no setting day of worship whether we want to have service on a tuesday night or on a friday night it is not going to affect the atmosphere because it's when the people are ready amen praise the lord we we just pray that the lord will bring us to that place amen amen and uh it was such a blessing you know such a blessing uh to be uh you know in in the house of the lord and to fellowship with people of light precious faith amen amen we we uh appreciate the lord you know i was i was uh i was studying on something today meditating on it uh actually then looking at some few things you know the scripture says you shall know the truth and the truth shah what what did the scripture says i want for us to say it together praise the lord let's say that again you shall know the truth and the truth shah praise the lord you know i'm always pulling things but i taught about it you know the the king james never said set you free it never says set you free saint john chapter 8 saint john chapter 8 let's uh let's read a little bit since i believe we we we are getting to the place where this bride is going to be the word praise the lord when things that that that we have overlooked over the years when the holy spirit start picking up those things and start making it clear to us is a sign that we this bride is going to be the word she's going to be nothing less praise the lord nothing less than the word of god may flesh praise the lord she's going to be nothing less than the word of god made flesh are we together amen what a what a wonderful wonderful wonderful father we serve amen praise the lord now so in john chapter 8 i thought actually we were just going to play the entire chapter tonight but we will do that another time and if you look over in verse 31 verse 30 the bible says and as he speak these words many believe him 31 then said jesus to those jews which believe on him okay the lord bless you let's stand together since we're reading now sorry sorry it's my fault verse 31 then said jesus to those jews which believe on him if he continued in my word then ye are my disciples indeed and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free praise the lord let us pray heavenly father we just want to ask your blessings tonight and ask the lord god you will take this word and speak to our hearts oh lord encourage us our father lord god is is uh now to be different lord god we we believe lord you you sent us a ministry lord god father uh by your prophet in this age lord god administrate that was uh that was very direct lord a ministry that would precise oh god administrate our faction lord god to be able lord father to see to help us lord see the things that was in the richness of your thoughts so we pray to god that you were coming and just bless this little portion of your word on this wednesday night that we just talked to put prayers before you father we ask our lord jesus bless us now and we pray to god for many of our brothers sisters lord that are following the service from whom may you bless them also we thank you we love you and we appreciate you in jesus name amen amen praise the lord the lord bless you you can have your seed glory be to god amen amen amen well you might you might think and says uh uh you know well brother one what what what what is the difference you know what is the difference praise the lord what's the difference between set you free and make you free [Music] they might they might sound the same but there is a big difference there is actually a big difference and uh and we will we will look at that a little bit jesus said we read in chapter 32 and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free then answer him you know they answer him saying we we be abraham's seed and we're never in bondage to any man how served there yea shall be made free praise the lord jesus answered them verily verily i say unto you whosoever committed sin is the seventh to sin and the seven aboright not in the house forever but the sun a buried in the house if the sun therefore shall make again he comes praise the lord yes amen if the son shall make you free ye shall be free indeed now so the concept the concept not to play with words but the concept there is that if a man is set free from praising he can go back to praising when you are set free you can go back but when you are make free you are free indeed so we are all in the making process oh praise the lord what a wonderful jesus we said we are all in the making process oh my goodness you love the lord tonight oh man praise the lord amen now so uh uh uh i was actually going to talk a little bit on justification tonight that we started there some time ago but i had this thought on my mind i kept looking through the scripture uh on on on on on a few of these as i kept looking at the scripture and then uh i thought i said well okay maybe uh we can kind of look look a little bit on on that tonight and see how uh you know how the the holy spirit will be able to help us you know if we we go into into studying praise the lord amen so he that the son make free is uh it's freed indeed and uh uh and if you if you if you steady you will realize that jesus in [Music] dealing with people that were that were possessed he always used this statement and says will thou be mayhold okay you always say that without being made hold you know and and and there's there's just a whole there's a whole lot of thought uh uh behind that uh there's a whole lot of talk behind there but if you if you if you if you actually you're actually steady and and look at this and follow it a little bit you realize that uh there are a lot of things that we can we can kind of look at the time is is not our frame tonight but we will try to make the best best use out of it okay we try to make the best use out of the time tonight with a few minutes that is left for us so let's just look at this thought of to be made free when i look at the or started thinking about that this afternoon sorry let me back up here a little bit i tried to look at the word yet in this i was just looking at something he says set you free implied that something outside of you like a church has has to come and free you as in the prisoner was set free by his capture whereas make you free is saying that the simple knowledge of truth will allow you to free yourself amen are we together amen are you seeing the concept set you free is something outside of you like a prisoner in praising and and the praising god set him free praise the lord but make you free is something that empowers you it empowers you to be able to break loose hallelujah are we together and so as we look at the thought tonight uh i don't know it was something i was listening to in and that that just captured my mind and and i decided i said well let me look look in the scripture and look look at it a little bit and and and they have there there are few you know uh uh biblical reference that we can we can kind of look at tonight that will you know that that will also look at and you realize that even paul over in the book of romans you know he talked about the lord how christ has made us free from the lord of sin and death he didn't set us free he made us free praise the lord so you see that's that is that is the place where uh religion becomes dangerous because a person can practice all the religious right and everything you know everything the church has taught them praise the lord they can dress right and try to live right and you know and says i'm i'm not like them you know i'm i'm not like those sinners i'm not like those denominations you are just set free for a while you can walk in that but pretty soon you realize there's a nature within that is still longing for the things of the world praise the lord that's what jesus said i i i mean john testified that in john chapter one he came unto his own and his own receiving that but as many that has received him to them have he gave him power so you see the world that we listen to young people empower us to be able to deal with the sin nature inside because the word want to make you free not set you free that's why you find many people they can walk in in righteousness and holiness for 20 years they've been set free from 20 years and then after 20 years to go right back into the bonus of sin and say i no longer believe this message this message kept me in punish you were not made free you were just set free oh glory to god tonight i don't want to preach i just want to encourage you praise the lord i just want to encourage you amen i just want to encourage you you see this word brother branham said in the church book it has the creative power of god for everything was made by him him the logos the word this word has the creative power that's the reason why we must not underestimate the word of god we must not play the word of god down we must give the word the highest reverence because this word has that's what brother brahm says god says let there be he says it will have it it could have taken many years that's praise the lord the bible says he he predestinated us in christ to be to be to be conformed to his image to walk before him in love praise the lord amen his thoughts went forth even before the apostle paul wrote it there in ephesians isaiah says his word goes out and don't return back to him when that word goes out is is it's a process it's a process just like the portal when he's when he's making he's making something out of the clay it's a process he keeps smalling it he keeps smalling it and that's that's what that's that's that's the way that god is working on us that's the reason why you can you can just hear one message and you say what i'm adopted it's a process praise the lord sometimes it looks like you're on the housetop you are on fire for god before you realize he brings you back again and he mows you and he mows you is the making process [Music] he's making you freed the church can only set you free for the wine with crease and dark man in our church we don't do this in our church we don't do in the message we don't do this and we can be set free for the y but when the word make you free you are free indeed you are freed from inside indeed praise the lord amen oh man there's just a lot of things coming to my head tonight but there's no time for it amen there is no time for it now watch here now watch him that this the the pharisees said unto him verse 33 they answer him we be abraham's seed and will never in bondage to any man praise the lord how serious doubt ye shall be mystery now you see they talk they their natural blood lineage because they were of the 12 tribes of israel from the 12 sons of jacob jacob from isaac isaac from abraham they can be able to trace it back praise the lord like many love to do around the message you know my pastor was seeing this church and and his pastor was in this church and you know and brother branham visited that church just just to be able to trace it back for some sense of rank praise the lord so you see they were looking at the unnatural lineage and saying now we are abraham's seat praise the lord and we were never in bondage because to them they believed that they were set free now you see for the very for the very fact that they use the word bondage amen they are saying we are abraham's seed and were never in bondage praise the lord so the the language that jesus used that you shall be made free confuse them a confused them because if jesus was implying that they were in bondage the right language was going to be you would be set free so they were confused well i mean you know we we we are abraham's seed we were never embarrassed you see uh saint john chapter 8 is a very wonderful wonderful chapter you have time just just read the whole thing it's just so wonderful when you read it because you will see the very same thing when jesus was saying to them that you are of your father the devil praise the lord amen let me know let's find the verse there let me let's let's let's pick that up praise the lord verse 44. praise the lord i want you okay now let's let's go back let's go back up a little bit let's go back up they are saying abraham's seed and jesus says verse 36 if the son therefore shall make you free you shall be freed indeed he says i know that ye are abraham's seed but you seek to kill me because my word have no place in you that's that's a place that you can also underline you know so that that was that was what they couldn't grab you know jesus was speaking in another dimension and they were just understanding this so physical physically just like nicodemus how can a man goes back in his mother womb the second time amen jesus was speaking in the rain of the new birth and they were they were looking at it physically as i speak that which i've seen with my father and yet do that which you have seen with your father they answered uh and said unto him abraham is our father jesus said unto them if ye were abraham's children you will do the works of abraham but now you seek to kill me a man that have told you the truth which i have heard of god this did not abraham you do the deeds of your father then said they to him we be now born of a fornication we have one father even god now so so uh you you you can you can plainly see the sepancy right here because what what brings your mind i mean jesus talking about you know abraham if abraham was your father you know what uh you know you have done the works of abraham but then pretty soon their minds goes back to talk about world i mean god is our father we are not born out of fun i mean fornication you know in all of that take the thought of relating god is our father and we are not born of fornication praise the lord the thought runs deep is not that fornication is not in the sense of their natural breath it's not in the sense of the breath with their parents is more than there because here jesus is talking about abraham that have lived hundreds of years before even they came on the scene praise the lord now so what i wanted to show you here is is in the same sense of word jesus uh uh uh uh saying the truth shall make you free and then they come on the scene and says well we were not in bondage what are you talking about us being made free yeah jesus talking about if abraham was your father you would have done the work of abraham then quickly the comments said but we're not born out of fornication god is our father praise the lord amen now so you see that uh uh as as they were listening to jesus they're beginning to see that this god is talking he's talking about something far deeper than we can understand amen and you see that is the thing of the of the word that is the thing of of of truth that is the thing of truth you see truth is not just a concept amen truth is not just a concept truth is a person amen amen i love the way someone said it he said is when the word and the deed i may won you can say the word you can read what is from the bible as the truth but when the days of your life comes into question then it makes the person that is listening to that truth to wonder is the truth amen amen are we together praise the lord now so you see here the uh uh uh the truth the truth is the word is is is is god that is that is embodied in his word it has the power to make us free praise the lord the truth is not what you say the truth is what god said praise the lord it's what god said now when when we bring our life to line up with what god says when we embrace what god says praise the lord amen then we get into the making process praise the lord then we get into the making process this message was not to set us free it was to make us free amen it was not to set us aside to be different from all the other churches give us a certain dress code a setting look praise the lord people i i think you know that you you believe the word and and and then you know you accept the lord jesus you believe the message of the hour but yet you you struggle the bible says jesus was called the friend of warren bevers amen because he was the truth he had what it takes to make them free praise the lord amen he was not he was not struggling he was not like embarrassed you know looking over his shoulders when i mean when he's when he with the common people praise the lord like the pharisees would do the pharisees were the ones that were always looking over their shoulder because they are their their religion set them apart so they cannot associate with certain group of people praise the lord this word this mess it has what it takes to get among any class of people praise the lord that's the reason why the apostle paul who says you know it was not a problem to be among the barbarians it was not a problem to be among the greeks i mean it have what it takes because it make you free amen they make you free praise the lord you read the word you you you you listen to the word you enjoy the word you get among uh the wrong company and then pretty soon you start feeling funny you know then you know that you need to get back on the mold you need some working to be done there's a work to be done amen the the the holy spirit starts to witness to you that there is a character work to be done because if you have you have christ in you the one that makes free the very sense that you are ashamed of him means that you are not free amen praise the lord you take your take our uh you know our our our uh pademic situation that we went through you know everybody was quickly to share what they were doing this is this is the way i'm dealing with this you know because you try it work for you you want to share with everybody this is what i'm doing you know i'm i'm i'm i'm i'm drinking lamb i'm eating fruits i'm taking my vitamins you know everybody because you realize that it helps you amen praise the lord a man that is that is freed and ashamed to testify that he's free there is problem that's a serious problem with him he's in more bondage than being locked up in the praising amen you see the enemy tried to to praising us in our spirit man you have to remember brother brahma says he's uh he's uh uh uh he's the prince of the power of the earth that's why paul says in ephesians amen he's the prince of the power of the head and and we have to realize that uh uh uh you know our our spirit man our spirit man the complexity of our spirit name the things that we deal with in our affection and our memory and our reasoning is all birth from the devil amen and that is the place where he seek to imprison us amen and that is the very same place where the word is working to make you free amen to free you from the condemnation of your memory you can remember some things but you don't feel condemned in as much as you regret you are not condemned because the word makes you free praise the lord now if the word does not make you free you are not in prison but every time the devil stared there oh me oh my goodness oh yeah okay okay what you are you are imprisoned in your spirit he used your memory he used your affection he used your reasoning to imprison you oh that's why the apostle paul says the word is sharper than the two-edged sword going to the dividing asunder of the spirit in the soul so the word goes right in there you see the word does not it does not liberate you only it does not cut you free from that think but you see it explain to you it tell you my child you bypass your tear funny your original nature you bypass it you were set in that situation to be tempted then you look i said really me then you see now the understanding of that frees you praise the lord just the understanding of that frees you so the word makes you free you see that over and over and over in the scripture it's already nine o'clock i don't want to take much time tonight but you see they're over over and over all in the scripture it's just all over the place our christ has made us free he has made us free praise the lord well you might think uh you know that brother one are you playing on words no i'm not playing on words i'm not playing on wars praise the lord because brother branham says i think in the same that church is there in the church book he says that creative voice of god is changing the atoms of our body as we are receiving the word so you see when people try to make the message all about brother branham and try to make the message oh this message you know it's not for everybody if god can save you he can save anybody if god can save you or me because i don't know about you i know myself if god can save me he can save anybody praise the lord and then we cut people off and says oh no you see that they are denominational nope we have just been set free that's what some of the horrible things you hear people do around the message you say wow i mean if god have not make you free you will run away from this message you will run away you will say well it's not different from from any other group yes i know the truth and the truth shy make you free can we say that together tonight yes i know the truth and the truth shall make you free praise the lord the truth is making us free there is delivering power in this world praise the lord young people there is enough power in this world to deal with our habits praise the lord that's the reason why that prophet of god can say the reason why we come to church is to be a better son of god is to be a better daughter of god be a better son to your parents better parents to your children better husband to your wife why because the word has the power to make you very very good baby the lord bless you tonight musicians you can come let's buy our heads the bible says god make man in his image amen the bible say he make man in his image that's the reason why paul says if any man being christ is a new creature all things have passed away behold all things are new we are in the making process we are in the making process the word is making us it's making us if you think that you have arrived you need to be at the foot of the cross amen if you think you have arrived is a sign of how far you are let's just thank the lord tonight let's just thank the lord tonight we can say father thank you for still working on me and until we leave from here until we've been quickened by the the voice of the archangel until the rapturing verse change our body god will keep working on us he will keep making us free he will keep making us free the church will set you free for a while your religion and your good morals will set you free but the word will make you free let's pray together tonight heavenly father we just want to thank you thank you lord god for your wonderful word oh god oh god what a power lord that is lying in his in his book
