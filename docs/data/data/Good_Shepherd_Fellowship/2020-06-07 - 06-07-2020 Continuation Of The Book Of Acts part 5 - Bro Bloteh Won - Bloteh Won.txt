for the service this morning praise the Lord and just thinking about different things I was going through my mind oh praise the Lord what a wonderful Jesus we self let's stand on our feeding in every and last chapter to reading from verse 1 again Wednesday night we took verse 1 just to talk a little bit on the Feast of the Pentecost I want to I want to go a little farther this morning we go down to verse 4 and when the date of Pentecost was fully come they were all in one Accord and in one place and suddenly they came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind and it fell all the house where they were sitting and there appeared upon them cloven tongues like as of fire and it sat upon each of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance let's pray together Heavenly Father in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ this morning oh god we thank you Father that you have shown us to provide a place of washing the

Jesus father help us Lord we give our house to you this morning we give our house Lord father steadying law in a book of Proverbs father God I will just just see in law where Solomon taught us that the more treasurer think that we should labor to God is our heart we give our house to you this morning deal with our hearts Lord beyond the things that we will hear law the things we will understand God deal with our hearts draw us to yourself we love you sweet Jesus in your precious name we pray Amy Amy the Lord bless you Prince the law so we want to do five of this and Burt Jordan coming this morning realizing we finish our tape we were listening at all and I was going to go into the subject so he asks me what we played and I said let's do the message on the Holy Ghost what is the Holy Ghost because we want to go in their direction a little bit this morning and I'm going to go a little bit fast year so I hope you are ready you have your Bibles handed or you get your notebook if you can't be able to follow us just just write those things down and steady after praise the Lord and and we are so we are so great greatly blessed greatly favored and and we we just want to continue to pray for all of those brothers you know pray for the sins over there in DC there stay you know trust in the Lord in in looking on for advices different places I might have to go down there coming of sown year to be able to help the situation there with with the brothers so we just want to commit there in the hands of the law to I'm not trying to be hasted I just you know we're just talking to them and encouraging them so we prayed and see how the law will be able to direct us here by the grace of God and praise Lord now so we we will we will deal with this we will deal with this and just I'm just kind of a trust in the Lord because like I said I don't want to go into doctrines you know if you get your doctrine or gun pulls out just put it back in the share we're not going to deal with doctrine this morning there's there's an inspiration that is so my heart and I'm praying that God will be able to bring it out but you see we have to establish everything by the wording you know there by the scripture by the message of the hour so I'm going to be looking at some few things yeah I mean we you will be tempted to think on some few things it's not wrong and but I just want for God to be able to help us see him now brother Branham says something in the message what was the Holy Ghost giving for there was a message he preached after he preached what is the Holy Ghost now thinking about this subject in thinking about the days of Pentecost and the Holy Ghost coming on a days of Pentecost what is on my mind when I listened to brother Branham talking about you know what is the Holy Ghost what is he giving for you know and and and how do we know we have he and he's talking about all of these things you know and he says some things in India is data you know he's saying all of these things and we will read what he said just now and in my mind I'm thinking about you know trying to drive the service my inspiration in a way to say knowing the Holy Ghost to know the Holy Ghost and how do we know the Holy Ghost because because of church teachings the Holy Ghost has been more in a dot uniformed you know in the teaching form you know you know you born again you receive the Holy Ghost you receive the Holy Ghost you know you feel with the Holy Ghost and and I mean all of these things I just did and with all of these teachings sometimes the mind is just overwhelming and and and and sometimes it's I mean it's but think about it this way think about it this way that's I'm going to talk about the Holy Ghost as the comforter this morning but think about it this way I'm going to keep one major type in your mind Eloisa he types the Holy Ghost he was a seven of the father that was sent out to such a Brian praise Lord and everything that Rebecca we know about Isaac was taught to her by Eliezer number for her to be able to trust the information about Isaac she has to know this man she has to know this man she's dealing with here he talking about traveling hundreds of miles to go and and a young virgin girl going to trust her life in the man that she just met other well for them to travel through the desert on the mountains in a charity to leave her to Isaac and her father axe her Rebecca will you go she said I will go she will not say that because she just under some kind of illusion to you when I said that because you just want to run out of her father house to go and jump in the hands of a man because Isaac was not just around the corner Isaac was over the mountains cross the lake down the violet through the desert they were going to travel and travel and travel and before we get in the hands of our Isaac this Holy Ghost is going to travel with us through trials through death through difficult situation if we don't know him and don't trust him we will get to the end of the day we don't even believe God we will not even believe that there is a God because we don't know the one that is dealing with us we don't know the one that have been sent to lead us to guide us to teach us that's what the Holy Ghost is the Holy Ghost is not just a badge for a church identification praise the Lord I'm afraid I will not get out of this today praise the Lord oh man so you just keep ELISA in your mind look at her look at her a picture pretty soon they're going to go from her father house she will be looking at the compound where she grew her favorite tree the world that she used to go to fresh water and slowly she's going away from home the chair will go down the street home her favorite grocery center where she likes to go and slowly they are going away from home and as the chair goes along she realized that they have entered another town not too far from home and she says oh I never been here before the other is I said oh yeah when I was coming to your place I came right down here you know right across here that's there's a goldsmith there he works there and she's oh wow you know my area more than me and what is happening as he relates to her he's buying her confidence that I know this area I'm not carrying you into dangerous water and have passed this place before and this whole agos that we have has is the same lowly goals that have led men this way before he knows the way we can trust him we can put our life into his hands that's what we want to talk about this morning knowing the Holy Ghost suppori of your daughter no guns in your pocket at the end of the salmon you can decide what you want to do with me amen keep me as a friend write me off a big life give me a middle name I don't have none praise the Lord where burn him share this in a message what is the Holy Ghost giving for he said last night we were speaking what was what was the Holy Ghost and we find it to be just about everything that God promised to us the Holy Ghost is just about everything if you make the Holy Ghost only speaking in tongues you have taken the least part of the Holy Ghost because tongue is the least part of the body and the more dearly part of the body praise the Lord a mean it's just about everything that God promised to us this is the proper teaching on the Holy Ghost hmm he said in heed in it we find just what God's church who need just what the Church of God would need in holy girls we found it to be a seal a comforter the rest the joy the peace the resurrection and all that God promised to his church lives within the Holy Spirit and then when people argue about the holy God no is this is that you are just limiting it to all your idea thing it is you are just limiting it to what your idea thing it is and that is the reason why when people hold to these things hold to these things I don't know what I told you this story before I sure I did and you know just just I mean just a young preacher starting out there way back at in 1993-94 I went into one area that was where we actually had our first church and go with a lot of this thing to happen sister faith please God will allow this thing to happen just just so he can he can push us because I was so scared to death to start a church we will have a Bible status I love Bible studies it man I don't know if it's a ministry called Bible study teacher but I love Bible studies because we can really be able to get hold of people ask question and fellowship together praise the Lord and and and that's what I would do to the brothers and Sunday we will find a church to go you know and just like that praise the Lord thank you and we were working with this Pentecostal preacher I mean very very wonderful brother and I'm fiery preacher we would go on a street corner to preach and and I mean this guy would just run down the street I mean he will just but we we had an era of conflict because he being a you're not a Pentecostal preacher you're another Pentecostal boy he believed that speaking in tongues were the evidence of the Holy Ghost and then and we didn't believe that speaking in tongues for the evidence of the Holy Ghost so he he said we did not hide the Holy Ghost you know and we were talking about it and I we went our not going too fast for him about it and you know and and I really remember some other young brothers there with me there was one day that was that was trying to have the Holy Ghost by speaking in tongues you know he was practicing him you know and letting his tongue loose Amy but I know I've spoken in tongues before and it was not in church it was in prayer you know I mean I prayed and I pray that that I turned loose and I started saying things I didn't know what but I was just having a good time before the Lord Amen that was exactly what Hannah did in the temple and Eli thought she was drunk you know when you put your heart before God where you break loose and you just praising God and just crying and just talking to God I mean you just loose your mind I mean your mind thinking one thing your tongue saying another thing amen so it got to the place where you know we would talk all the time in and there were two things that he did not really understood in the scripture one was you know speaking in tongues now been evidence of the Holy Ghost and predestination he I do the body I show him to write in the scripture the word is in the Bible he says the word is not in the Bible showing him right there he got freeze he went home but if not brother we work together and but what was happening was he was the leader that was with him that he taught us was his wife was not actually his wife they came from the same church background they'd met India in the adjoining because we all migrated to that area because of the wall so on their way that's how the methane you know and it decided to stay together and and and this woman who come to church would be just speaking in tongues all over the place there was another woman there you know so you always asked them to pray you know prayers of speaking tongues and we'll be there worship the Lord you know and you know the brothers were just but one can we just do something when I won't forget I say no let's say I'm we gotta wait for the leadership of the Holy Spirit Lord help me you know I'm just so scared to death I'm telling him just so scared to death I'm saying Lord Jesus you just got to help us yet I don't want to go and do something on my own so but what will happen here is that this woman was struggling she was struggling with a habit a drinking habit we did not know about it didn't knew about it and and and one time it happened that I mean she just I mean she was overtaken by this habit the fast and out of there in this daring you know and then the woman you know went over and talked the whole story on IV your wife and all this this is early the morning early in the morning around 7 o'clock I saw this brother to detour to the house he was he was older than us you know came over to the house and not the door I said woman what's that Carranza he said bird one I need to talk to you I said okay pull to the side he says I will tell you something you know you have told me over and over that speaking in tongues was not the evidence of the holy God he says a struggle with there he says why I've come to believe it he says I've come to believe it I'm thinking in my head you know I'm trying to rejoice there may be none angel of the Lord visited him you know and you know and show him the scripture that I'm now I'm ready now to go into everything you know because we talked about Malachi 4 we spoke about all of those things and he says and I have something to may write with you I said what is there since well you know the setting woman you know that - that my wife is really not my wife really how could you do that you know how could you do that and I mean we just we and this God is just bawling and just crying you know and and then that was how we we parted ways because I just told him I says I just can't believe that you let us in such a deception you know for a long time so we parted ways you know it was almost like you know God just had an Holy gone at the back of my head you gotta move boy I mean so I just stepped into there but you know what I'm saying here is that if we just if we just you know just reduce the Holy Ghost to just our idea of one thing we think a race you know you know brother branham you know talk about the Holy Ghost as you know recognizing your message of the day how many people does not even go any father they just believe our enemy is a prophet I mean the entire message verbatim says the Holy Ghost is a message of the hour and recognizing your message of the day you know and it just as well I had the Holy Ghost you know but the prophet of God says here he says is everything that the church needs you know everything that God has promised is our comforter I will rest our joy the seal the resurrection and all that God promised to his church lays within the Holy Ghost let's go a little bit here he says here now their purpose is his name the purpose what was God's purpose in sending the Holy Spirit now I will knock that down st. John 14 beginning with the the the fourteenth verse he says and reading true the chapter for a base we will get back to death he said we should read through the chapter of Saint John chapter 14 for a base to be able to understand what was God's purpose in sending the Holy Ghost God's purpose we find here in sending the Holy Spirit was one purpose one purpose that God Himself my door in his church back to Exeter why he told Moses to build a tabernacle one purpose because I want to come down and do it am all my people one purpose that God himself might word in his church and continue his plan through the church what is our series the continuation of the book of Acts God's purpose is to dword in his church and continue his plan through the church that God was in Christ continuing his plane through Christ out of Christ into the church continuing his work through the church the purpose of the Holy Ghost was not sitting on the bench it was not getting a badge I mean a message no it was so continuing on his work God in Christ reconciling the world through Christ to his church oh that was him God he pulled into Christ all that was in Christ he pulled into the church to continue his plan of redemption explained through his church one purpose one purpose one purpose and the evidence of the Holy Ghost will be God fulfilling that purpose through your life because that's what the Holy Ghost was giving for for God to continue to deal with your heart for God to continue on Toto to increase your walk in the word for God to continue to show his love to you for God to continue to do his work that is the purpose of the Holy Ghost amen and to step away from there we will run ourselves into trouble to step away from there we will run ourselves into trouble now yeah brother Branham says we must use Saint John chapter 14 that would be to Becky joy and all the young people the last time I give you people it's in John chapter 14 in John chapter 15 see John chapter 16 for you people to read and and for you to be able to gather everything that the Holy Ghost was was was identifying so it's in John chapter 14 we are going to get a base of the Holy Ghost let's pick up some few things here Saint John chapter 14 verse 16 amen it wouldn't help me if I don't turn to it praise the Lord and you young people we're going to deal with this subject a little bit I'm just waiting for the the church to be a little bit clearer out where I can get us in I want to spend some time with you deal with this subject I mean they're they have things that are happening praise the Lord Amen with all of these things happening around us we know that our redemption is drawing nigh amen praise the Lord some we have to go before us and some of us who wait for the body change praise the Lord but we know it's not many dear hints like the scripture says praise the Lord so I mean this is time for us to to really mean business and get serious with God this is time for us to I mean clean our house clean our life it's no time to play around amen so we will look here into st. John chapter 14 sorry let's start from chapter 14 st. John chapter 14 Jesus started talking about the Holy Ghost year right in verse 16 I will go quickly now huh right in verse 16 he started and he said I will pray I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter are we together that he would give you another comforter that word has has has bother my mind a little bit why would Jesus is another comforter because they had a comforter with them in another way because they had the comforter with them in another way and and this is what would bring us back to - to the talk here on the comforter now you look here a little bit you will see over in in Isaiah chapter as I had chapter 40 and where our sister sang from this morning is there 40 verse 1 here is a promise true the prophet Isaiah you know on to Israel comfort heat comfort he my people said the Lord speak ye comfortable to Jerusalem and cried unto her that her warfare is accomplished and their heard in equating is pattern for she have received of the Lord hand double for all her sins now and in this message this message that was coming to Israel comfort ye comfort ye my people you know I was just thinking about it I mean I just I don't want to break out of what I'm talking about this morning but I was thinking about this through the week and I was saying God is the comforter the way that God comforts listen to me now the way that God comforts is completely different from the way that that we human thinks about comfort all we demon can do is that we can sympathize we can sympathize we can we can we try to put ourself we try to feel it and and all we do is that we do it in our mind sometimes it don't really get gets close to our flesh we just think about it all my goodness I hate to think about it that I mean I mean there that church lost its pastor I just think about it oh my goodness just talking to brother Valentin this morning on my way here and we were just talking some few things you know because I had to call home when I got the message too so you know well I can't believe this and you know you only think about it you only think about it you don't know how it feels you know you don't know how it feels but when it comes back to our assembling you know many of us I would not even know how it feels because I was not here when you didn't have a pastor I will not know how it feels to go many years without a pastor you know so you can only sympathize about it you yeah but wow wow it does not come close it does not come close or there are some other things in my mind I don't want to go into it this morning let me stay right in the scripture because this is the only thing that would bless us politics is not going to help us I mean everything happening around the world we know our God is in control but look at God talking about comforting Israel and you know how he would comfort Israel he will bring John the Baptist's a man that's that's God's comfort to Israel he's comforting them because he has there with them double he's going to comfort them and the way he would come for them is to bring them a ministry or a young man that never enjoy his tender age went into the wilderness at the age of nine learning to eat locusts and hunting and all of that counts out this is God's comfort now this is God coming to comfort his people because when the scripture speaks about comfor comfort comfort give my people it was a description of John the Baptist's ministry and the way that God would come for them it's not a common sense Oh Caiaphas you've been so lawyer I mean you're been doing the best he said repent for the kingdom of heaven is on him and the people said were looking for my man is there look at his hair no hair caught out of there so where he's crazy and you look at that I mean right on the River Jordan Harris a rollin uh how you call him now he's he's a Roman general you know he says superior officer combat everybody talking about John he comes down there with his brother's wife and John trying to look at him and says some you are in a battery that's your brother's wife you know and and all those prisunic he's gonna put us in trouble Oh his mouth is too wide somebody gotta stop this man he's gonna put us in trouble he look at the soldiers down on the bang who says you people are extortion are you taking money from the people you over taxing the people he look at the religious leaders you rebuild them but this was God's comfort this is the way that God comfort his people I would say some hard things to you this morning I hope you be ready to take it amen because the way that God comfort is completely different God don't only comfort with words they come it's not a word the comforter is a person the comforter is a person it go wood comforts you he steps into your situation he comes down into your situation that is the reason why when the comforter was talking about our Lord Jesus it was talking about a spirit that were interred in us it does not come to make you happy praise the Lord it does not comes to make you happy but it brings the joy of the Lord amen because the things that make you happy is chocolate you covered that don't bring chocolate it brings the joy of the Lord he kind of chocolate and raspberry name and blueberry in all of this my goodness amen praise the Lord that was the comforter that was God's way of comforting his people by sending him his man by sinning the same way I tried to use Eliezer join us here in a picture praise the Lord and yes Jesus comes on the scene and with the sign of the Messiah and the thing that the people are identifying in a scripture they are saying oh my goodness could he be the one could he be the one they are trying to take comfort in his healing ministry but when it comes to his doctrine no I mean he gets that in the temple this God is rude he keeps the table over he's trying to get away with all our tradition they are trying to find comfort when He healed the sick when he raised the dead when it comes to the teaching of the world the back of you don't want that comfort no they don't want the comfort that changes their lives they want to come for where they can sit and amaya Wow why you saw how exact he was on it but when the comforter comes to start to change our lives and change our desire we are so stuck in our minds me why me why that's how God comfort his people that's how he comfort his people and Jesus speaking here he saves another comforter another comforter you know I was thinking on this my goodness me I said I mean I'm saying to myself I was saying this is a hard saying it's a high saying let's read a little bit yeah let me not get ahead of myself jesus said and I will pray the father and he will give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever the reason why he's using another comforter because his ministry is comfort to them but he's going to go away he will not stay with them forever but this other comforter is going to abide with you forever because the Holy Ghost leading you through this Johnny and across the river on the other side it comes back and pick up your body for the resurrection and leaves you into a glorified body so it's a comforter that would be with you forever forever you know how hard this is that sometimes for God to comfort us he would have to take the ones that we love jesus says if I don't go the comforter will not come the human mind will never understand that as comfort there is no way we can understand that as comfort but I just like brother Branham who talks about the ego how its terraced nerd he says and I mama ego would come and she would tear the comfort from honour her babies because she knows that there are abilities in them and they need to exercise the Alain's she would hear the comfort from all of them and be crying and she would just sweep down under there and spread her wings and pretty soon you see those little eat bless spraying their wings and they're enjoying it just like on trampling this is all manner that was good but then one I've never learned that that was good if you never told the nets from under them that's the reason why it is hard to understand it's hard to understand how can that be comfort and every time the read is as ayah faulty in the temple comfort he comfort you my people the priest would come up there and give the people promises when the Messiah come is going to be so peaceful you remember in a time of Solomon there was no wall all these rumors that you are looking at they're going to be on our feet and he's just giving the people because the way he thinks about comfort it's like in his bed the way that God thinks about comfort is like John the Baptist laying on the straw on a tree no roof over his head but yeah and he was God's comfort to the people praise the Lord God comfort to us the comforter to brother Branham was to take his wife and his baby away because God wanted to get his ministry out and Brennan would not understand him you and I understand it's hard to understand discomfort but when I'm trucks I think in a message comforter know in a message a true sign overlooked he talks about when he built his house he said he said my wife never wanted to leave her mother he says and I feel that it was so hard for us I build this house and I told her and says last movie and she didn't wanted to move away from her from her mom listen to what he says now go back and listen to the tape he says but when he says now her mother is gone and my mother is gone you know he says now her mother is gone and my mother is gone and I believe that God can lead us into the things that he wants us to do we think that that we think that God is our toy boy that he's our toilet boy you know we pleased with me thank you I appreciate it you know he's our toilet you know we just I mean the problem of this age the problem of this age that we have to be delivered from there are many that are worshiping the God of your imagination they they have the God of your imagination because the the figure that God would deal with them this way God will provide for them this way God would talk to them this way just a god of their imagination that's the reason why our age is one of the age of adulterous people that are worshipping idols and that idols is not stone it's now rocks it's just cover all mine the god of our imagination we reduce God to our our our simple hero tots I'll tell you this is the Asian of data I'm talking about this is the creator of the universe I'm talking about this is the one that does thing and he does not have to answer to anybody I was talking to someone yesterday in the little counseling session praise the Lord and I was saying I was saying to this person I said you know our problem you know our problem when we when we look at the unit of Maharaja this is the way I said it to them trying to process my thought here I said God said in his word when he gave the Ten Commandments worship no other God besides me he said through the Sun David said you deserve all the praise he deserve all the praise do you know that in the scripture of God don't praise anybody if you can find one scripture in the Bible that shows where God praise a man all the praises goes to God he said in the prophet Isaiah my glory I was here with no man I'm telling you this God that we serve he said all sin to God he said all center and if you don't process it in your mind for it to drop in your Honda it's about God and all about God you will never be successful and I told this person I said look when it comes to the unit of marriage there is one person that wants to be satisfied that's God and we miss it we miss it we get so filled in our mind we want this we want our desire we want to be how one pressing that needs to be happened because marriage is all about God is the Institute it's God's Institute to reflect himself in the family that's why Paul taught us in the Bible there is one person that needs to be happy and if you make God happy you get a happy marriage praise the Lord amen and then we found the Holy Ghost a happy wife it's a happy home Amen with the Holy Ghost if you make God happy you will be happy because there is one person there is one person that we needs to hit and don't like that's the devil because he does not like marriage he does not like marriage he don't care what you think about it and what do you think about God that devil fights marriage because he knows that is the higher form of reflection that's the higher form of relationship that's the highest form of relationship and that is a relationship that God has choose through the New Testament church to reflect himself Christ it's like the husband the wife is like the church that's the purpose the Bible say for this purpose a man will leave his family what purpose is enough for flowers the purpose is for God to come down Genesis chapter one verse 20 says the Bible says that he made man in His image male and female when he made that image it was male and female Genesis chapter 2 he breaks out the female spirit he takes it in the back part of the out of the Garden of Eden and he made a woman tits he's separating and their marriage is where he brings both their feminist spirit and a masculine spirit back together to be able to reflect himself true make marriage all about Hollywood if you make God happy you have a happy home they want to change your husband make God happy praise the Lord it mean you want to change your wife just make God happy but you see the thing about it there is that it is to to like like someone said to selfish person I want her to make me happen she want me to make him happen and we get all in that struggle and don't even look up to this person I said when you do that you want to be happy when you get happy go get sign go get so sad because you are missing the purpose or what am i preaching on marriage I'm gonna go back to my subject that comforter is here man I gotta get back the comforter this year that's what I'm preaching on don't change the subject sister faith amen let's get back to this my goodness it's this is a all center God is the center of everything it's the center when we make our doctoring the center of our church you lost the whole thing he is the center praise annoy oh my can you think about that what a way that the father would comfort us he says in this comforter he might have died with you even the Spirit of Truth even the Spirit of Truth you think about it have you ever going to comfort someone and says let me tell them the truth it's hard you know even if there is something that you thought that shoe have done not to get in that situation but because you want to be on a good Frank no that's not the time to talk about that but that's not God when he comes to comfort you he tells you the truth he rebuke you in your state that's why he did to David Nathan came right to David and said you are the man David but he was the comforter in David's house there is oh my goodness because you know he I've just said that the man I've done this must die but NATO said you will not die what a comfort telling him that he was the man but yet there is mercy for you that's why the comforter does the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive going go and comfort somebody and start to tell them the truth you shouldn't have lived that way you yourself get yourself in this situation they get angry right away the Spirit of Truth can out the word can I receive it the word can not receive it I'm telling I'm going to go in a direction with this subject you might you might you might kick me you know out of the lace of preachers I'm not even one praise the Lord the word can I receive it because I feared him net but Brenham right in the same message he went over that verse and he says understand him that he used that words he said look in the Greek it means it's a understand whom that neither knoweth him neither knoweth him that's where I'm to this morning nor the Holy Ghost nor the Holy Ghost asked your comforter he comes as your friend more the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is not at that spirit that is following you and ready to slap you for everything that you does nor the Holy Ghost nor in the spirit of truth we get our minds so filled with doctrine brother Branham said the Holy Ghost is dangerous but I was talking with some other young people and it took that little story from the lineman and a dog and you know we just talked about it and we laugh about it a little bit you know and it sister you know Bertram says it's just you know everyone says the Holy Ghost it's just it's just like a dope when we offend it it flies away but we say beautiful that's just beautiful but brother Branham was giving us a story the Holy Ghost is not a bird it's not a bird it's not a bird the scripture says God spoke to two John and says the one you see the spirit descending on like like that's why the scripture says even on the days of Pentecost there were proving Thrones upon your head like like and if we don't wash those things in the scripture people say when you feed the whole ago.we cuz it's a fire in my brain you know like praise the Lord you know why God type dad like a dog is because when he sent his when he sent the dog out in the in and from the ark to go and find a place you know what when we find Elena and never return back God was connecting that the Covenant of the rainbow where he says I will not destroy this word any more with water he was connecting that covenant of the rainbow that covenant with Noah right on the river Jordan he was trying to show us the breath of the earth then it was water he is going to be blocked so the same dog has to come back again the Holy Ghost in the full light and Dorf it's not a bird you do something heard of going and going flying on the tree and then when you set up a garden a flower back again but Ben was just giving us an idea how when we grieve the Holy Ghost he step back because he can you know work on your will when you surround on your will to him he steps in when you close your will to him he steps back he don't go anywhere he's right there but you are not giving him the right to work through you and we get all this opinions then the Holy Ghost fly away on the tree talk let me go let me just go with this because I'm shouldn't be out of time here norine nor in him nor in him the Spirit of Truth but you know him that's why Jesus says the word don't know him but you know him you know him for he dwelleth with you in Jesus and shall be in you he dwelleth with you that's why he used that word and not a comforter because his presence with him his ministry was a comfort unto them but now the comforter is going to come and do it in us do we say halftime for Jordan and know what the time is okay yeah it's almost 12 Teddy amen praise the Lord amen you know I was thinking about this this morning just funny and sometimes I'd be talking to myself as I'm driving I was thinking about this this morning and I says you know when a preacher starts to preach a series a series he's telling you I'm getting a hold of my poopit I'm not letting it go so part 1 by 2 by 3 by 4 by 5 verses [Music] praise the Lord you love the Lord this morning amen amen amen I'm trying to bring this thing to us trying to bring this thing to us let's look here verse 26 chapter 14 verse 26 let's just run through this entire bar BAM said we should use this this in John chapter 14 as a base for what the Holy Ghost is giving for he's giving for us to know him the Spirit of Truth verse 26 what does he say here but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things if you are not learning you don't have the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is there to teach you he's there to teach you to teach you he's there to take the messages that I preached to you to teach you he's there when you are reading your Bible he's there to teach you to help you understand what you are reading that's what the Holy Ghost is giving for if we don't know these things we don't grow in the Lord and we just make the Holy Ghost and a fine dress on Sunday I mean that's how we get all of these like like a brother said this he says we get all of these message uncle's a message auntie's they just come and take their place that just relax they know they're there in the message the moment I can find out Spears in church they're not reading their Bible they're not even going back to look at their notes and so what the Holy Ghost been been dealing with us this month what he's been speaking to us know all of these messages that are coming why are you saying these things to us what you want to achieve we're not taking the world we're not learning the purpose of the Holy Ghost is to teach us because it's written in the Book of Isaiah that all his children will be taught by him will be taught by him when you have you when you have this experience where God is teaching you in a word then all you can love your pastor but if your favorite preacher is the Holy Ghost because you know after your pastor has preached and you look at your notes and you read the scripture that have been preached you go back and play the tapes that I've been listening to you know the Holy Ghost would be there something would be saying you pass it he said this okay let me really look in the scripture the Holy Ghost is there to teach us it's not to make you an auntie he want to be an auntie to the holy ghost uncle to the Holy Ghost no he's there to teach us and what I'm going for this but I'm grinning way he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance and bring all things to your remembrance he reminds us he reminds us it's when we get into that quiet time with the Lord and you are meditating lord over and over I've seen there I've seen there because the Holy Ghost is real sometimes I will be steady in the night and something would come to my mind I say Lord I know I saw it in the world I know okay yeah maybe it's in the scripture I go and look for maybe it's in this message I go and check for it I would just I just hold my table and say dear Lord you know what my heart is looking for I just committed to him you come around some way he will show it to me he will come around some way and he will show it to me you reading something in the Bible and you don't understand it stop it pray go to your teacher that's why it goes to them we do that's what a good student will do if you don't understand it you go to your teacher and say lord i just pray father I didn't understand the scripture falling and all stroking something yeah I don't understand it fully because I mean if you are not cut you're not called to preach God is not going to deal with you like a preacher and give you all the explanation but because you are his son in his daughter he would take that scripture just won't work from there it will be able to address something in your in your life or it will be able to make a picture that you can be able to understand he's there to teach us he's there to bring back to our remembrance and that is the way that God DS sometimes with with with with with prodigal sons and and and and you see when the prodigal son came back to the father you know the father never show him his fault you know father put her arm around him and say you remember this well you remember this little tree you remember you planted this tree that's why the Holy Ghost does it remind us when God wants to deal with you he reminds you you remember this service you remember what you know you remember this time when I deal with your heart you remember what happened here he reminds you he reminds you so you can trust him so you can come more closer to him that's what the Holy Ghost is young people if you're not reading your Bible if you're not learning you're not even trying yourself to memorize Scripture that's the way you provoke the Holy Ghost bring to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you praise the Lord he's there to remind us chapter 15 let's go to chapter 15 year quickly I will go through this in and yeah you see now I've wrote this thing down in Edina even okay chapter 15 year if you get over to chapter 15 you will see over here verse 26 chapter 15 and when the comforter is come whom I have sent unto you from from my father even the Spirit of Truth which proceedeth from the father he shall testify of me he shall testify of me the Lord Jesus and ye also shall bear witness because ye have been with me from the beginning when the Holy Ghost comes it will testify of him praise the Lord amen chapter chapter 16 let's look in chapter 16 a little babe chapter 16 us let's look in chapter 16 reading from reading from verse 7 I mean I'm not just reading in clothes I mean there are just a lot of things to you that we can go through but you know that is that is the beginning of this book we went there we will not appreciate the book of Acts until we appreciate the birth to realize that God brought the both church the Jewish Church and the Gentile church into the feasts of the Pentecost the time he will choose to send his spirit to dwell in the heart of man will be Pentecost you know what Pentecost represent Jubilee you are free he that his son has set free it's free in day the Holy Ghost come to set you free to make you free of yourself oh my goodness free of yourself praise the Lord amen no my little sisters write me back home in it they ask me how you doing you know how everything goin asses I mean everything going on by the grace of God and when a problem ahah is to stay 6 feet away for myself how can you do that what do you mean be brother that's my problem but that's why the Holy Ghost can to give you 6 feet from yourself praise the Lord it's a good thing to stay that way a little bit from this guy you mean you know because that's I mean that's how Paul identified this flesh he brought this flesh to the place of one of the greatest Roman punishment it was when the room with the Romans would take a dead body and tie to a man process or wretched man that I am who would deliver me praise the Lord but you know when you can come to the place to realize that this guy hanging on you he's dead you don't have no life in it you don't have to look at his tongue outside to be afraid you don't have to look at his eyes he's dead tell yourself he's dead he's dead he can hang on as far as he wants to hang on you I did know you are dead the only problem you giving me is just a little weight but you are dead but when a man cannot it will kill you before your time yes she are you okay I did okay let's read from verse seven year praise the Lord amen st. John chapter 16 verse 7 nevertheless I tell you the truth it is expedient for you that go away this was the scripture that kind of one hit me how can God comfort us by taking the one that we love he comfort us by taking the things that we love in our life the habits we love when Holy Ghost come he comes to comfort you he takes those habit away and sometimes that's what make people are afraid of the Holy Ghost they don't want to lose it because they have made those habit their identification you know I'm a short temper God so they don't want to lose that short temper Ness because whenever they draw into it it can it can just make them who they are when the Holy Ghost come you want to take that short temper and just make it long a little bit by giving you patience woo it is a speeding for you that I go away for if I go not away the comforter will not come unto you the comforter will not come unto you that's what sometimes when these things happen to our dear loved ones it's good to look and see what God is doing as much as it hurt us in Hindman there is know where we can process it there was just no way no way there is not a word somebody who said to you I'm just thinking about it this morning I can't just and just imagine for the Iroquois fan and the children you know and I was just there's just no way somebody can say in it you know when there was no word but when you think about it this way that God is going to step into that situation you don't know how he's going to take you but he's ready to hold your hands and take you to another level in your life that you had never experienced as long as he was there it is only God I can't comfort he's the truth comforter praise the Lord ever seen those people that comes to comfort you and it just makes you feel sorrowful you're trying to get over the sorrow you just did I mean singing a song and if they come around just and they just roll you right back into the sound again God is not like that I would comfort that it's not like that they can't take you to another level he comes to open the coaching he says look at the sunshine let's go beyond the Sun let's go beyond the more he starts to think there's a land beyond the river oh my goodness me that's a land beyond the river that we call sweet forever you but if I depart I will send him unto you verse 8 and when he is come he will reprove the world of sin and of righteousness and of judgment of sin because they believe not a mean of righteousness because I go to my father and you see me no more of judgment because the prince of this world is George I could take those three things and just go into something this morning and show how beautiful the Holy Ghost is with us you know it is with us here immoral bear talks about he talks about sin self and Satan the three s sin self in the devil I could just go into that but I would live there for another time amen he says I have had many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them now you will not be able to bed him you think about this is a sorrowful moment Jesus telling these people that have been comforted by their by his presence he's telling them I'm about to leave you I'm about to leave what is good for me to leave because if not you will not move on in your walk with God sometimes that's what God takes his man where he takes the profit away he takes you know his messengers away because he want his people to move on and keep their eyes on Jesus praise the Lord howbeit when he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth do you know that God fulfilled it divers in a ministry to brother branham he was napped the Spirit of Truth his ministry was the Spirit of Truth that guided us he guided us to the truth understanding of the word that's why he preached a message the guide when he preached a message to guy let me say this to you read a message to comforter better better I'm coming to preach the message the comforter after his mother passed away and he's preaching this message and he's showing to us how God comfort him knowing that his mom who passed away and God and not give him a vision but what God would do to come for him is to give him a vision not a vision about his mother but a vision about that they're both with their length of home was it 42 inches you know the exact measure when he preached a message comforter that's why he tells us that God led him into the experience to give him exact measurement of the whole of the ball that he would kill as a comfort that I'm with you to every inch of the way but here God will not show him a dream about his mother going away that's how God comforted that's why he comfort he comforts you in his word the Word of God is our comfort he comforts you with his presence I will never leave you never forsake you you don't give you a brand new car as a comfort because he knows as soon as you drive away from the parking lot a lost value you don't even give you a home as a comfort or as you have given John about this one girl called for his people in his word and by his spirit and I reduced God to houses and cars and shoes and suits the Spirit of Truth has come he will guide you into all truth into all truth the truth is not the man the truth is the message it's a ministry it's a Bible you keep your eyes on the man you see something with his life you would get trouble for for he shall not speak of himself and why we want to make brother branham everything if he had a ministry of the spirit of truth it's not about him it's about Christ it's about word Elias I was not talking about himself and he is I was talking about Isaac and everything that Rebecca knew about Isaac came from Eliezer because that man was in the house when Sarah was conceived he saw Sarah body change he was in the house when Ishmael was born he knew the difference he grew up there he born in the house he knew everything praise the Lord and he's telling he's selling Rebecca when when when I there was a little boy he used to like chocolate she said hmm looks like I used to like chocolate too praise the Lord he would not speak of himself but whatsoever he shy here whatsoever he shy here by visions of revelation that shall he speak and he shall show you things to come he shall glorify me for he shall receive of mine and shall shew it unto you this valley his it will continue to pass 6 if we don't get our subject on the Holy Ghost right the bulk of us will just become a historical book to us that's what the Holy Ghost is giving for that's what the Holy Ghost is Noreen the Holy Ghost Noreen this spirit that is dealing with our life people will profess the Holy Ghost and profess the Holy Ghost and it says well I don't believe the message again and you see them down the street I mean it just it just dress up and just dress they're working it for Holy Ghost you have you never known this Holy Ghost you just make it a message Holy Ghost even if I have a problem with this preacher and I leave the church I have the Holy Ghost I'm not going to change I'm not going to reduce the standard of the holy God because I don't agree with this brother oh I don't agree with the message again we don't know the Holy Ghost we must know him whom the father have seen nor in him whom the father have seen or else we have just caught our self in this way of dressing in this way of behaving that's what people they stay key there are most treasure idols in their closet they are just telling behind this thing does not work I get back to my pins I would get back to my drawers now they will get back to all the award unless they they I mean the idea their muscle I'm they have the hair time to tie it around their head and jump on the back you know that I mean a relative a relative I mean keeping all of those thing if this thing does not work I hope it work but when you know what the Holy Ghost is you burn every breaches behind you you burn everything because you know that he's going to lead you safely to your Isaac you trust him think about that young woman young woman she was just in her teens going with that man over the hill traveling with him in that distance because she had fall in love we won that she have now seen but I can trust him to lead me all the way norine the Holy Ghost let's bow our head praise the Lord bris can't let you sing Holy Spirit you
