[Music] praise the lord let's read from verse one to verse six musicians will just stop here and then i will call you back just just in a few minutes before we turn the service over to the community tonight i just want to take a little talk here and address something about the scripture deuteronomy chapter 16 let's read from verse 1. observe the man of ivy and keep the passover unto the lord thy god for in the mount of abba the lord thy god brought thee forth out of egypt by night thou shalt therefore sacrifice the passover unto the lord thy god of the floods and of and the herb in the place which the lord shall choose to place his name there thou shalt eat no unleavened bread with a seven days shadow eat on living bread there with even the bread of affliction for thou cameth fought out of the land of egypt in haste thou came effort out of the land of egypt in haste just like we have said before the communion must be done in haste praise the lord after we have gone through all the praying you know when we come to the table we must be able to okay let's go right ahead that came for out of the land of egypt in his that that thou may i remember the day when thou came fought out of the land of egypt all the days of their life there and there shall be no living breath seen with thee in all that cost seven days neither shall they shall be anything of the flesh which thou sacrifice the first day at evening remain all the night until the morning so when the sacrifice is done that evening you know everything should be done nothing should be kept in the morning that thou may have now sacrificed the passover within any of the gates which the lord thy god giveth thee but at the place which the lord thy god shall choose to place his name in there shall thou sacrifice the passover at even at the going down of the sun at the season that thou came effort out of egypt let's pray together heavenly father we take this portion of your word and we just want to ask that you bless it as we uh uh talk about you tonight you are our sacrifice father god and we we have been taught by your word that the worshiper was never on our examination so god will look in your word tonight father is before us lord we want to examine it that there is no fault in your word as we approach your promise tonight we love you in jesus name we pray amen the lord bless you you may have your seed just before we go to the table of the lord tonight i want to take a little talk here like i said just to be able to address uh a scriptural principle uh i entitled between two evenings between two evenings praise the lord between two evenings now that the thought of this of this principle is the hour of communion uh paul when we read the scripture there in uh in corinthians paul says that that same evening the lord jesus took bread and wine and he blessed it now so the thought of eveling has always been conflicting around the church because of the jewish time and the gentile time so it has always been conflicting i've seen many brothers that have you know uh that uh uh you know you know sometimes they visit uh the country uh over here in the u.s and and it it kind of uh stumbled them when communion is half around this time you know because uh uh the thought of evening is is when uh the dark is about to fall you know that's how they think about it but i want us to look in the scripture tonight and a little bit in the message and then we would we was for us to be able to realize that the biblical evening uh which is the jewish evening evening when the passover was took place it's completely different from the kind of eviling that we think about because it it it is said and taught you know that night you know so when we read back in exeter and it's thought about that night so uh uh you know most people stumble that communion should be taken late in the evening anything after six o'clock when that when when the you know when their shadows that the the evening the night is falling in but actually i just want us to look at just some few things and i'll read a quote here from god choosing place of worship and then we go right into the communion so uh and and and actually as i was i was looking there in god choosing place of washi that was what i saw brother brandon read the scripture uh to preach that message and and and if you even look in that scripture let's go back there again and then we will i want us to grab the principle there and then we will travel a little bit wreck that in verse 6 verse 16 uh chapter 16 verse 6. chapter 16 verse 6 but other place which the law that god shall choose to place his name in there shall thou sacrifice the past over at even which means even at the going down of the sun at the season that thou came it out came forth out of egypt now so we will see that the jews have two evenings they have an early evening and they have a late evening and the sacrifice was supposed to be between the two evenings praise the lord now we will look at a little bit of of of uh of of the jewish time not very good with these things but uh i i promise you i will improve amen as soon as the lord can start helping me i will do better praise god praise the lord thank you for being understanding now let's let's let's do something here uh sorry i have my little my little note here for the evening let's look at these few scriptures let's look at saint john chapter 11 verse 9. sin john chapter 11 verse 9. it's in john chapter 11 verse 9 jesus right there with meredith martyr expecting philosopher to come forth out of the grave verse 9 jesus answered are there not 12 owls in the day if any man walk in the day he stumbled at net because he seared the light of the world so the principle here is that there are 12 hours in the day and there are 12 hours in the night so the the jewish day the first hour begins uh uh from from from the break of day when the daylight cometh so the the the 12 hours of the day the first hour will be from 6 to 7. so 12 hours in the day uh will be from six in the morning to six in the evening are we together and then right after six in the evening the the the night time starts are we together praise the lord so jesus said on that i then that 12 hours in the day so we want to keep that principle now let's look at the fulfillment of the passover which is the killing of the lamb let's look at the death of jesus matthew chapter 27 matthew chapter 27. matthew chapter 27 a lot of things that have gone over with with church traditions and as we walk in the light with the message of the owl we it is not in the sense of us trying to you know uh change things but we want to come to a better understanding it's it's our that's that's what the message of the hour is is to bring us to a better understanding because when we when we have a better understanding of what we are doing and make ours ourselves our our service our sacrifice acceptable to the lord we're just doing it because that's how we were taught or because everybody do it that way it's better to have a better understanding and there is no way you can get it from in the word of god so let's look at this together matthew 27 verse 45 matthew 27 verse 45. the scripture was his year now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the lane until the ninth hour now if you take that into our hour uh one o'clock to six o'clock uh i mean from from six to nine it's already our evening hour so the darkness will not be very significant for darkness to come because that's the time we expect for darkness to come okay that is in our our timepiece but over in the jewish timepiece the the sixth hour of the day is 3 p.m so from 3 p.m to 6 p.m the the the earth was completely dark so that that darkness was very significant are we together so in uh in in uh in the jewish time the first evening begins from the sixth hour of the day from the sixth hour of the day uh to the ninth hour of the day that's when the first evening begins so the first evening begins from 3 p.m to 6 p.m then the second evening begins from 6 p.m to 9 00 p.m are we together so that's that's the that's that's the two evening uh uh uh uh in in the jewish sense because when you read when you actually read in exodus chapter 2 verse 6 where he says the passover must be sacrificed that evening in the in the hebrew it says that it must be sacrificed between the two evenings what what proved that is what we read in in in deuteronomy chapter 16. it talks about the evening and it also talks about the going down of the sun praise the lord oh you never saw that let's go back there again deuteronomy chapter 16. i remember years back a good friend of mine we we got on this subject but at the time i did not i i i did not fully grab the subject you know the reality now steady on it but we we had that was many years back we had a talk on it and and and he brought the subject of the two evenings but the way that he brought it was it have to be from our 6 p.m to to 12 noon i mean 12 midnight so we at the time we were we were we were struggling to be able to establish the two evenings from from 6 pm to 12 but when you hit 12 ui at morning that's not an evening praise the lord so i i i the the subject kind of just dropped somewhere down in my subconscious and that you know i've been i've just been reading i made i made a lot of research just trying to look into the message and see what brother branham said and uh and also looking through the scripture but just as we were we were thinking about praying about this convenience service then the talk the the inspiration just came to me and i said well okay let me look closely maybe the law might help me okay let's read this again back there in verse six of deuteronomy 16 but at the place which the lord thy god shall choose to place his name in that there thou shalt sacrifice the passover at even at the going down of the sun right there it shows the two evening one is the first evening the second evening is the going down of the sun praise the lord now and ask chapter three as chapter three let's go quickly that's chapter three chapter 3 verse 1 now peter and john went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer being the ninth hour that was the jewish evening sacrifice evening time of prayer it was about the 9th hour as chapter 10. let me try to speed it a little bit as chapter 10. this is colina's experience verse 3 he saw a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an angel of god coming coming in to him and saying unto him kalinas let's drop down to verse 30. colin is testifying here he says said four days ago i was fasting until this hour and at the ninth hour i prayed in my house [Music] and behold a man's stool before me in in a bright cloth now so if if you take the jewish sabbath the rest you take the jewish sabbath and and they were not to do anything from the rising of the sun to the going down so it was about from six six in the morning to six in the evening that will be from the first hour of the day to the ninth hour are we together okay and uh so so as we as we look at as we look at the the the the subject together uh is not is is not in a place of uh trying to to start any kind of a new doctrine just like i said it is only to be able to address the time because for many of us that uh look at the evening time from the scripture when you're reading the bible and and paul says and that evening you know he took bread and you look at the time we are doing communion sometimes a conflict people mind i've received people asking me that question you know uh uh you know and even there was a brother sometime that visited with us and he he said the same thing to me why are you people taking communion early you know he says uh why are you taking communion supposed to be in the evening time you know and uh so if you understand that uh uh as we we we are looking back just like i said you know for the gentile is always a type in shadow we look back to what god they there for the jews is a pattern you know but for the gentiles it starts in shadow we have to look back there so when you look back over to the jewish time you will realize that you know uh if if we have our communion this time of the day we are right in scripture because it is between two evenings let's read this quote it's all from one message and god only provided place of worship again i was over for the for the uh december 31st meeting somewhere and we were to have conveniently at nighting and i mean it was a huge group of people i mean there was a very big church and i was i just got so troubled because we were in the late hour of the night you know taking communion doing full washing and all of that and you know but the thing about it did is that in as much as we are keeping the ordinance you know i just i just kind of uh settle my thought with that you know the people are keeping jesus says as as much as you do this in remembrance of men they are keeping the ordinance so i then i wanted to be radical in my spirit before i start creating doubt right but i was actually troubled because looking at a time that we started having the convenience service about about 10 p.m in the night and i'm and i'm talking about a congregation of over almost about three to 500 people you know but that is is uh is uh you know is is uh is the is the level of understanding because we look to the evenings to be when the the evening shadows are falling when when night is coming but you have to realize that even the darkness that was in egypt was not the night darkness it was a darkness that god put on the land just like the darkness that came when jesus gave up the ghost it was not the eve it was not the night darkness it was it was darkness that came right at a time when it was supposed to be daylight like this so looking for darkness for communion i wonder if we're not looking for judgment because darkness at that time was judgment to egypt are we together now listen to brother branham here god provided a place in worship now christ was tested the lamb first from from the mother earwy married the virgin and was tested by what satan against the word when he hit eve she fell hit moses he failed but when he flew up against christ and tried to cut the scriptures to him wrong he found out that that wasn't moses amen and sure he will find that also that this bride is naive amen see he was tested he he turned around and said if thou be the son of god now they tell me you perform miracle the the and they tell me that the messiah to do that now if it is so you are hungry [Music] he said you having it turned these bread or these stones into bread and eat he said it is written men shall not live by bread alone your creed and so far but by what every word a part of the word we will say no every word that proceeds out of the mouth of god that's what men live by see the lamb was tested see if this anything he had fallen he says here he was tested to see where he was standing see tested in every manner tested like we are tested but there was no giving in and this bride will not give in amen there was no giving to him at all no sir that was the son of god watching now and the lamb was tested and was kept up for 14 days that that was two sabbath now there is there is there is uh there is uh there is a place here of two sabbath and that is the reason why the the calculation of the of the passover that that was picked up by the roman church even though they were uh they were they were introducing their their moon god worship the whole the whole easter comes from there from that worship uh of the moon god and and and and because what happened there is that uh uh at that time uh the rabbits are very filtered because roberts was represented in the roman kingdom for fatality that's where comes the bunny rabbit during easter and the easter eggs rabbit on lake edge i don't know how we got the two in easter but it all comes from a roman background now so what happened here is that the the the the calculation of the day because there were two sabbaths there were two sabbaths from i think i went over that one time here uh uh uh from the time that jesus uh you know was was arrested uh and all from the time that he was pirated hosanna hosanna blessed is he that coming in the name of the lord from that time to to the time he went over to his uh crucification there were two sabbath another time we will look at that i don't have time for us to go through all the scripture but it's right in the scripture it was a time in the jewish festival where a sabbath come in the middle of the week so because some of they was generally known to be saturday that's the reason why we came out with a good friday tradition and that's why we always get the conflict of calculating a complete three days and three nights because you will not get a complete calculation of three days and three nights if jesus was crucified friday night you cannot be able to get a complete calculation of three days and three nights and jesus himself said as jonah lied in the world of the belly three days and three nights saw the son of man will lie in the heart of the earth are we together okay let's read here and the lamb was and the lamb was tested and was kept up for 14 days that that was two sabbath or two ages one for the jews which they offer the lamb in type one for the gentiles who has the real lamb and all of them was made perfect by believing this line who come but he was tempted 14 days or examining 14 days he was the word and because he was the word they found no fault in him now see 14 days it was it was tested that was christ and notice then he was killed in the evening time should be killed the lamb was christ died in the evening time the afternoon so what happened here is that brother branham is is is trying to place us in the scripture but yet he's also interpreting the scripture he died in the evening time the afternoon so which is the first eve the first evening because that was the sixth hour are we together and it it all goes back to the to the place where the biblical communion time is evening the law supper praise the lord so and in time before the evening we will be we will be stepping out of scripture we will be we will be going back into what catholicism introduced to the word all of these all of these uh uh denominational system you know do their communion in the morning you know and and all of that because that was what uh uh uh uh catholicism gave to the world [Music] he was killed in the evening time this he i mean killing the evil time should be killed the lamb was killed christ died in the evening the afternoon notice he went on he says uh you say every morning i enter i enter the matter they get this that's the church every morning you go to the catholic game well the law let the law let his people go in and out them gates god god people in the catholic church the matter this church the presbyterian church all of them pentecostals show you don't worship the law in that gate see but the lord has a setting place a setting gate glory he has a gate but at the place which the law thy god choose to place his name in thou shall sacrifice the passover at evening when did rebecca find isaac when did eleazar call her to be the bride evening time praise the lord amen it was evening time between the two evenings it was between the two evenings it was a evening time that rebecca came and fell the camel it was at evening time she told her father i will go it had to be between the two evenings because when they came over they met isaac in the field it was in the evening time musicians you can come tonight praise the lord amen so even when a guest told the to the winter time where we have early nights it is not because the darkness is coming but we we try the best we can to be able to keep it in a scriptural time praise the lord amen i pray that it was a blessing to you let's buy our house [Music] together [Music] [Music] that'll cross where the dead and best for the world of loss sinner was
