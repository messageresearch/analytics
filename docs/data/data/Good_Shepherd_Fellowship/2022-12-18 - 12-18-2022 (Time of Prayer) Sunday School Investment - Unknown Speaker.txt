========================================

[Music] foreign [Music] you don't want to do that Jesus taught the same thing when you got a talent don't hide it you got to put it to use groin I may be talking to Presbyterian Methodist Baptists in these breakfasts and whatever more you never know who's setting before you see so remember if you've got some investment something to invest in invested in something that's good something that's real something that's been proven that'll pay off some good a reliable identified firm that has been proven to pay off in the past it's got a name behind it you may know that even if you have to take a slower coming up your your Dividends are are smaller yet I'd rather know all my money I was drawing two percent and sure to get it and drawing fifty percent never get it promise fifty percent see you want to you want to stay with the firm or the the business that's got a background it's got a a name behind it something is going to pay off and something that's right now this young fella that we're speaking about this young businessman well he was he was given the opportunity to make an investment and one of the greatest businesses that he could invest in he was given the opportunity to follow Jesus Christ and what a ridiculous saying that he did what a rational thing that this young fella given this type of an opportunity to invest this is soul and his money and whatever he had in the kingdom of God and he turned it down flatly we look at him this morning as this young businessman as a as a very uh poor businessman but you couldn't have told him that Jesus couldn't tell him any better see the word of God when Jesus speaks it's so it's all truth it doesn't have to be explained God just speaks the truth and you don't have to go around like we do to them explain it it's that's all there is to it he said follow me that's all he didn't have to tell him why uh explain it all like I do and other people do but his words are all truth we don't have to go around with it just said he said follow me and that settled you had the invitation to make an investment in Jesus Christ and that's the person I'm speaking about this morning the investment that I want you to make if you haven't made it but the Rich Young fella the teenager of his day I had probably an aired a lot of money and and which that's all right there's nothing against that and uh I'll be thankful for any man or anybody that's been uh given that privilege but when the what I have against the fella is this being a man of business and did you notice he asked for eternal life that was his business proposition what must I do now to have eternal life and Jesus told him exactly what to do but he wasn't interested because of the thing that he had to do to have eternal life and now we look on that we Pentecost so people who think that man was out of his mind and not to do a thing but let's let's take it down home for a few minutes see there was something went with it he was asked about the Commandments he said this I've done sets my youth probably raised in a in a good Orthodox home where he was raised up not to steal her lie or cheat or commit adultery maybe the boy was a cheater the boy was a liar they've been raised with good parents somebody that taught him and there was a god and that God would bring into judgment someday and he'd have to give an account for all that he did and that teaching of his of his parent maybe it's stuck with him and he knowed that there was a God but now it comes a time where he's got to to personally meet this God he's got to meet this person and he was asked why he asked what could he do and uh to have this eternal life and Jesus told him what to do but he was not interested in that kind of investment because it took away the things that he had held so dear well you say that man had money and it was taken from him because uh the money rather Jesus has taken because that was his Earthly possessions but it don't all together mean money there's just a lot more things that we hold to us just as much as our Idol as that young man held to that money popularity denominational difference fashions lusts of the world idols everything there's so many things that that man today instead of being risk holding to things they of money they they hold to different things like that just as tight as that young man because they're not interested in the investment that Christ is offering them it might mean that Christ would call you out of the group that you're in Christ might call you out from the card party that you have in your church the bunco game the society that you belong to and if you hold to that you're you're just as much making a rational mistake as this young rich man did see you're holding to something more of a treasure than investing your life's journey in Jesus Christ now this may not have a shouting background to it but it's got a gospel background to it a word it's the thing that the children uh laugh and dance and rejoice and so forth but you got to know what you're doing is about if you don't that becomes idolatry to you just becomes Idol and if we look and notice it at the conditions that we're winding into it comes so sneaking it's just like a man a tree standing on a highway and a little Vine Rises up a wild Vine and begins to wrap around that tree the tree wants to grow now this may not have a shouting background to it but it's got a gospel background to it a word it's the thing that the children uh laugh and dance and rejoice and so forth but you got to know what you're doing is about if you don't that becomes idolatry to you just becomes Idol and if we look and notice it at the conditions that we're winding into it comes so sneaking it's just like a man a tree standing on a highway and a little Vine Rises up a wild Vine and begins to wrap around that tree the tree wants to grow straight but that vine finally gets a hold of that tree in such a way until it's forced to move the other way so do we get in those kind of places or we let other things slip in them to us and wind us from that real sincerity in the word uh Israel was very sincere and what they did at the beginning well I can imagine a Jew coming down the road with his sick sacrifice the best he's got in this herd going down to the the sacrifice puts his hand up on the animal and identifies himself with the Animal by placing his hand up on this animal and then the blood is shed and that Q goes back home just as happy as he could be because he know he had done Jehovah's bidding that was signed for a long time then after a while that same thing become a family tradition it was this sake of an animal but someone would perhaps say you know this is the new moon oh perhaps maybe yes I've got to offer a sacrifice when he took down the way the first man did but he he didn't have that sincerity to it and when he did Jehovah said the thing has become a stake in my nose and it raised a great man on the scene Isaiah the prophet who cried out and said your sacrifices your solemn Feast is a stink before me be careful Pentecost your sacrifices and rejoicing will become a stink in the nostrils of Jehovah if it is an idiot deepness of sincerity we we must come deadly sincere not just laughing and rejoicing and rallying around we've got to calm deeply and sincerely to the word of the promise there take a holy altar stay there until something happens so we thoroughly die out till we are making an investment in the Kingdom of God in Jesus Christ then we're on no matter how fundamentally we can be fundamental yet you got to come under sincerity now this young Jew we're just as sincere as he could be and what he was doing but when the the time come to change his Creed then that's where the turtle come I wonder if the same God isn't just as able today to rise itself in Isaiah rise us up somebody that can tell us at our solemn Feast becomes esteem we should be ready for the Rapture at this time of the age look where we're at something needed and that's back to the word we're promised over in Malachi that we would be brought back to the word the original faith and so let's remember that now but the the price that this young fellow was asked to pay was too great he had to sell out all these worldly possessions in order to have this eternal life [Music] thank you
