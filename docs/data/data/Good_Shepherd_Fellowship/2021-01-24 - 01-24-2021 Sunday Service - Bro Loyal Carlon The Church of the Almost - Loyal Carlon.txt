the lord for giving us this opportunity praise the lord and we want to greet once again each one of you in the name of the lord jesus good to have you our brother thomas with us praise the lord amen and also sister lisa good to have you as sister and marita and rachel's little sister and we also have a few prayer birthing this morning we continue to remember brother andrews and his family in prayer and uh during the week his first started earlier the week in the beginning of the week sister evie was not feeling well she had some congestion or whatever it was like a breathing issue and she went over to to see the doctor at the end of the week but there was no major problem there with her receiving wolves experienced the same and it's going to see him also in church he went over to the urgent care they did all the tests there was no major problem there so we don't know where that is from but uh now that we don't know we know it is from the devil amen praise the lord i know you're saying your man how can you say we don't know where he's from when it is the devil amen but we just want to just continue uh you know trusting the lord in and praying and doing everything that we are we are taught to do as we as we all deal with uh of this situation praise the lord amen so uh it's so good to be in the house of the lord last week we were speaking something on the turning point we took 1956 as the turning point there was something i was i was uh i had on my on on my heart that i was going to look at this morning but wednesday night we are continuing our session of prayer meetings wednesday so [Music] i was i was suspecting that uh because brother-in-law told me he was going to be in town so i had in my mind that he was going to testify on wednesday night so uh but he didn't made it in until late thursday and so he will he will come in and testify to us this morning and but i wanted to this was dwelling on my mind last night and and the reason why i saw that it was important is because of all the history of the ages and where we are just like i said uh last week you know uh we re we read a couple of messages where brother branham was talking about you know uh over roberts and allen and tommy osborne every one of them leaving the field to come back home because of what was happening in america when even deed himself did not knew what was happening bill graham and every one of them calling you know the nation back and like i said many of us we were not born you know we were not around 1956. we were not part of the pentecostal revival and in 1963 came which was seven years after 1956 which was a mono jubilee we talked about the major jubilee and we talked about the mono jubilee and then after 1963 when the seals were open i wish of course there was another call to the church this time the first 1956 was a call to the nation 1963 was a call to the church and then so after that every seven years 1970 pentecostal went straight into organization they separated into united pentecosta and assembling assembly of god and united pentecostal they were all from the azusa street revival they were all part of the pentecostal church 1970 seven seven years after 1963 they separated they went into organization taking united pentecostal an organization named assembly of god another organization named 1977 brought us a brother brandon prediction that has created a contradiction and people had different thinking about it and we will talk about it just like i said but then every other seven years we've been seeing major changes in the world major changes in the word but this is what caught my mind last night that i want to share with you before we call a brother lloyd up [Music] just like revelation 3 20 says behold i stand at the door and knock and the reason why i'm saying this i'm saying it to us i'm saying it to us the young people young people i'm i'm calling your attention to this trying to lay the foundation so uh but lloyd can bring his testimony but listen to this israel in their joining from egypt after they cross the red sea they are joining to the promised land we are the generation every one of us here in this building we are the generation that was born in the wilderness very very few of us are brusqued our brother john baby were born during the time the prophet was here but they were not in brother branham's meeting the prophet has left so we we are the generation that was born in the wilderness and what we have experienced there have been doctrines that have rise fanaticism that has followed this message all the same thing that happened to israel in the wilderness has been around this message now a journey that you have taken them [Music] four days brother branham said in some places took them 40 years 10 years to a day of rejection and what i want to say to you young people sometimes with our educational level and our exposure to internet we think we are smart [Music] but a little sense of rejection when god is dealing with you could take you through a wilderness journey [Music] it could have you dealing with something for many years a little sense of rejection [Music] we're not this is not plain church we all know with everything that we have heard and everything that has been preached you don't need a preacher like i've always said you don't need a new message what we need is the effect of the word in our life what we need is the word being made [Music] flesh if god made a promise brother branham says repent and be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost if we if we did that the holy ghost is ours so just like israel should have taken four days to uh to the promised land we have just these three stages repent be baptized and you step right into the promise if we are not enjoying [Music] the fruit of the land don't look anywhere else look to yourself look to yourself if you are allowing things in your life that you know you should not it might cost you a wilderness joining i'll tell you as as your pastor i've been there before i've been there before [Music] am i joining as a preacher am i joining as as a young man let's buy our heads together let's stand on our feet let's just worship the lord [Music] i just wanted to use this to grab your attention this morning and so the world can be able to have a place in our life this morning praise the lord amen [Music] wednesday night we will continue [Music] in my life something you in my life something new in my life [Music] oh lord do something new in my life something new [Music] live without you oh i cannot live [Music] without you i cannot live without you i cannot live without you oh lord oh i cannot live without you i cannot live without you i cannot live without you oh lord heavenly father we just remember all of those needs lord father god and for the dear ones law that are now well in our midst we pray that your grace lord will raise them up father lord we just committing ourselves this morning father god as your son come lord jesus and testify lord father to to this assembly this morning bring your word open our hearts lord may we all father god be able to receive your word this morning father lord we just committing ourselves lord father oh god we are rededicating ourself in your hands lord father you promise us lord the dynamic to this church will be the refilling of the holy ghost that's what your prophet said that's what we're looking forward to lord come now lord speak to us lord in a way that only you can to you be the praise to you be the glory and honor this morning in the name of the lord jesus we pray amen amen praise the lord praise the lord amen you know we don't have no excuse in the house of the lord amen there is no there is no reason or no way of escaping our responsibility praise the lord amen amen whether you if you if you dress up whichever way that's why i brought the lord and myself was talking this morning there's no excuse amen if it's fall on your lot uh we will bring you up here that you will preach anyhow so it's on by the lord's lord this morning to be able to bring us the wording so uh [Music] let's let's receive the one this morning praise the lord let's think uh [Music] let's think you don't know what i know what the lord has done for me and [Music] oh thank god [Music] it watches wide eye oh thank god thank god [Music] oh you don't know like i know what he's done for me you don't know like i know what he's done for me you don't know like i know what he's done for me what the lord has done for me thank god oh thank god for the blood god for the blood thank god for the blood it washes white as snow this joy that i have all this joy that i have the world then gave it to me this joy that i had the world didn't give it to me this joy that i had the world didn't give it to me the world didn't give it and the world can't i got my mind made up [Music]

rest of my life hallelujah lord hallelujah amen praise thank you for singing that song i feel right at home again i am at home praise the lord i trust that that's the uh it's a profession of faith becoming a reality that we really have made up our mind that and we won't go back that no matter what happens no water no matter what befalls us no matter the the roadblock or the setback or the trial or the error doesn't really matter if god be for us who can be against us in all these things we are made more than conquerors not by our own strength not by our own ability but because god said so god made a provision that today as we come to church this morning it's not based upon our own merit not based upon our own ability not whether or not we ate a good breakfast and we feel good about ourselves this morning whether or not we are the rankest of sinners or the most righteous christian on earth it doesn't matter we come under the shed blood of jesus christ praise god thank god for the blood let's sing that one more time thank god for the blood yes thank god hallelujah for the blood thank god for the blood it washes white as snow thank god for the blood oh thank god for the blood thank god for the blood it washes white ass i praise the lord amen [Music] if i don't stop now we'll just keep praising and that's all we'll do all day today praise the lord praise the lord [Music] hallelujah glory yes yes hallelujah amen amen let's take that same spirit right into the service that it's the same it's the same anointing whether we're praising or preaching or responding to the word of god it's the same anointing let's not let that stop let's not sit down and then think about hmm i gotta get to lunch you know i'm kind of tired oh that's right i gotta do this afterwards no but let us actually take that enter into a spirit because you know there's a point there's a point where we can get to where time stands still where you look up at the clock and you think where have i been i can't i don't even know where i've been i i can't even what just happened and that is the point that we need to reach to this morning that it's no longer just coming not just not just listening to the word but we're participating we're engaged with the word of god that we might enter into his spirit enter into his courts with thanksgiving into his gates with praise that we might truly not just in a sensation or emotion but truly press press into the spirit into the kingdom of almighty god this morning that we wouldn't just stop that we wouldn't just stop at this not just this this is just the foyer of heaven this is just the entryway of heaven there's more there's more than this yes hallelujah amen praise the lord amen musicians you you can be seated otherwise i'm just going to keep right on singing praise the lord got to cut me off i transition into the word of god this morning i'm excited excited you can be seated just for a second just for a second you know what's funny in baseball games they always do like the wave and all this stuff right it's funny and and i think that we have too much in church of this it's funny because it really doesn't come from the gospel it comes from the world this idea of now you have the the music and now you just all sit you just listen it's an old old you know teaching like style of communication i don't even really like having a pulpit up here i'd rather be out there because if you look at it in the bible i'm gonna come breathe on all you guys um if you look at it in the bible when jesus they talk about this he was in solomon's court he talked with the people he wasn't back here he wasn't way back he wasn't in this loft position untouchable to the people he was always there with them he was among them yes they were on the mountain yes sometimes they stepped up under the boat so that everyone could see him so that they could see him they could hear him they could touch him it wasn't meant to be a separation it wasn't meant to be a divider it was it was so that he came and spoke the language of the people in that day right where they were we look at the king james version bible now we think oh no no our approach to god is oh so like it has to be this way it's so like precise and so so measured out and so formal and that's not the way to god now there is a reverence that is you need that reverence that is true but god god designed it in such a way that us in our day-to-day normal communications we could talk to him he could he could be touched we think once again that word he could be touched by the feelings of our infirmities we take that and we make that complicated that's not he can be touched by the feelings of our infirmities he empathizes he cares he can be he feels what that's what that says he feels what you're going through no matter what that is he feels it we can cry out to god and not have to worry about him misunderstanding what we're talking about he knows the depths of our heart he knows before the foundation before we were even a twinkle in our great grandparents you know genome like he knows he knows exactly why things have happened the way they've happened he knows why he knows why we don't know why we don't know why and we can look through our story and see where we've messed up or we've made mistakes and it's very easy for us to beat ourselves up about these things we beat ourselves up and we think oh i'm just a no good person i'm just i'm this or that and you're absolutely right you're absolutely right you're absolutely right and satan will always come to us in our worst moments and remind us of those things and tell us that god doesn't love us tell us that god doesn't love us because you did this or you did that god doesn't love you but thank god for the blood we are here under the umbrella of the grace of god nothing that we've done nothing that we could ever do we come simply before the throne of grace and we boldly ask for mercy god i've done these things i'm the worst person ever i'm the worst ever but god i come not because i think i can i come because you said i could you said i could and that's what i'm standing on today and every day god i messed up again i messed up again today but thank god your mercies are new every morning your mercies are new i can put my faith and my trust in that that you the one who is called he's predestined he is the one who started the work in me and he will draw me into the end it's the same god it's the same god we're not worshiping a god of the bygone we're not worshiping a god of the has-been we're not worshiping some way off-distant future event or something that was way off in the past we are worshiping a god of today and today is the only day that it exists it's the only day that exists we like to build calendars and project plans and goals and we look at the passing of the calendar and we think oh you know next year i'm going to do this or that or whatever but to god it's an unbounded now it's an unbounded now and it is what we do in the day today look up your redemption draws nigh today it's always today and you look at it the content i'm getting ahead of myself but the unjust judge jesus told us a parable the kingdom of heaven is likened to a woman and an unjust judge and the woman said come solve my problem effectively solve my problem and he talked about that the unjust judge even him being an unjust judge due to her persistence to her persistence will he not come an adventure and how much more your heavenly father and it's the same thing for us don't get tired of asking don't get tired of asking the finishing of that story is when he comes when god comes to the door to answer your problem will he find faith will you still be knocking and so before i even get into the sermon i would say if you're knocking now keep on knocking do not allow do not stop don't stop there are things we may have waited years for years and years and years and years and in those seasons in those times of waiting when satan comes in and tries to build a case against god a case against god if god was a loving god why would he do this why would he do that once again just like job he would build this case and that god he's never going to answer you he's never going to answer you and if we listen to satan and that time in that time we can miss the mark we can miss the blessing we can miss that blessing let's go ahead and stand we're going to jump right in go to ruth one excuse me ruth one familiar passage if you're there say amen i'm reading out of a new bible so i am not there yet so i apologize ruth ariel if you're there have you go ahead and read verse one who's there who's somebody there brother go ahead and read from verse one to uh we'll go through verse uh seven and then we'll go from seven to fourteen chapter 1 verse 1. if you can speak up just a little yep he and his wife and his two sons and the name of the man was amalek and the name of his wife naomi and the name of his two sons malone and shilon the aphronites of bethlehem judah and they came into the country of moab and they continued there verse three and emilie naomi's husband died and she was left and her two sons and they took them wives of the women of moab and the name of and the name of one was up upfront and the name of the order roof and it well there about 10 years we'll go ahead and pause right there let's go ahead and pray dear father lord we just come before you once again this morning lord god trusting in you lord god i've had a great song service we appreciate you lord god uh your spirit among us lord god father and now that we're here we don't want to miss what you want to do lord god i pray that you'd help us help me each one of us lord to get ourselves out of the way and let your spirit reign supreme this morning lord god father that we might not just hear from you not just have a intellectual uh experience lord god but father that we could go beyond these veils of flesh truly into the holiest of holies this morning that we might truly experience you lord god we just committed to your hands now father in the name of jesus christ amen you may be seated i'm actually going to just jump in from here there so what's i'll keep reading and then i wanted to come back to something in this passage so and they took um you can go ahead and be seated we're good thank you appreciate that it's always weird switching bibles because you're like oh man all my spots where it would flip open and things it's just not there so um and malon and chilean died so and they took them wives of the women of moab and the name of the one was orpah and the name of the other ruth and they dwelled there about 10 years and malone and chilean died also both of them and the woman was left of her two sons and her husband and this is a very familiar you know like we make kids stories about this like this is a very very familiar passage but i want you to and i say this all the time but is pretend you've never heard this story before because there's something about like when we're reading the bible if we're not careful especially for the story that we've heard we start to filter it out it's like reading a dictionary or something we just start to like oh yep and they were there and melon and chilean died and we know you know because mo they went into moab and they were supposed to stay in israel and we start to filter these things and depending on how long you've been around if you've heard it more and more it's it's so easy to just start filtering it out but i want us to pay attention today god you're here no matter what i'm talking about you in your heart god i'm here speak to me speak to me pull him off his notes talk to me i got needs god today i need to hear from you and you make that purpose in your heart and you will absolutely be on a shadow of a doubt here from god absolutely i have had a succession of weeks now the last probably six weeks in a row every time i've gone to service every single time i've gone into service and i i had something i was praying to god about and every single time exactly what was happening was preached about exactly precisely even down to the same exact words i had prayed came across the pulpit and so we have to come to god believing he is here we're not come we have not come to be entertained we have not come just for the excitement we're not we haven't been come even to be taught in a sense though those things are great we have come to experience god experience god and that's what we need we need to experience god they took of them wives the woman of moab we're just going to kind of skim through this and they dwelled there about 10 years 10 years i saw this today that's a long time if you listen to adventures in odyssey or many of these kids stories it's like they moved to moab got married and immediately died you know it's like no no no it's 10 years that's a long time think of where you were 10 years ago think about where you are today 10 years then she arose speaking of naomi with her daughters in law that she might return from the country of moab for she had heard in the country of moab how that the lord had visited his people in giving them bread wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was and her two daughters-in-law with her and they went on the way to return unto the land of judah and naomi said unto her two daughters-in-law go return each other to her mother's house the lord deal kindly with you as ye have dealt with the dead and with me remember 10 years that's a long time 10 years and the lord grant you that he that ye may find rest each of you in the house of her husband so she's telling them go find go back to your families find a new husband leave me the lord grant you that you may find rest each of you in the house of her husband and then she kissed them and they lifted up their voice and wept and they said unto her surely we will return with thee unto thy people and naomi said turn again my daughters why will you go with me are there yet any more sons in my womb that they may be your husbands once again we know the story turn again my daughters go your way for i am too old to have a husband if i should say i have hope if i should have a husband also tonight it should bear sons would you tarry for them till they were grown would you stay for them from having husbands name i daughters for grieveth me much for your sakes that the hand of the lord has gone out against me and they lifted up their voice and wept again and orpah kissed her mother-in-law but ruth clave unto her and i want to preach today if i would give it a title the church of the almost the church of the almost you look at orpah here and this is just fascinating i just was really thinking about orpah we putting myself into those shoes 10 years think about that think of the relationships of 10 years spending time with naomi spending time seeing that life seeing seeing the she had the same experience as ruth you look at that married into the family husband dies love naomi you even look at it right here they lifted up their voice and wept they all did orpah and ruth orpah and ruth and yet orpah kissed her mother-in-law goodbye and walked away and ruth clave unto her judges 1. it came to pass when israel was strong that they put the canaan knights to tribute and did not utterly drive them out neither did ephraim drive out the canaanites that dwelt in geezer but the canaanites dwelt and geezer among them neither did zebulon drive out the inhabitants of kitran nor the inhabitants of nahal gonna mess up these names but the canaanites dwelt among them and became tributaries can go on neither did asher drive out neither did naftali drive out they were in the land and they almost had possession of the land almost almost acts 26 27 king agrippa believe this is paul he was brought before the judges and there was king of grip and we're not we have a lot to cover so we're only just hitting some highlights to lay some foundation king agrippa believeth thou the prophets i know that thou believers this is paul talking he's been brought before this judgment seat then agrippa said unto paul almost thou persuades me to be a christian almost there's a cycle of bondage and we see this throughout the scripture there's a cycle of bondage people turn to god so right they're following god a people turn to god they get success they get wins and in that winning they build up their fortifications they have a position of strength they have a position they have position they own things now they own things and in that fortification bible talks about a rich man's wealth is his strength is his strong tower and it also says it's hard for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven in that strength in that fortification they relax they relax that let my heart take its ease and they turn to other gods you can see this all throughout the book of judges they turn to other gods they turn to frolic they turn to play they no longer they left if you look at the commandment that mo god gave through moses to the children of israel before they went into the land of canaan to possess it was he specifically told them do not take them as tributaries do not make alliances with them said if you don't drive them out they will be pricks in your side and thorns in your eyes pricks in your side and yet you can go down the list and they never took full possession they never israel never took full possession they were always almost in full possession and you can see that exactly happened they got lazy they they stopped they stopped they set up their walls we're good we got walls we're strong we have an army look i mean look we've pushed basically everyone out basically everyone out they turn to other gods and of course we can talk about balaam and astroth in these different ones and i've preached on it here before but if you look at baal baal is very much definitely a god of success it is the golden calf we still see it represented today in wall street it is the idea the scripture says that where the ox is or where there is no ox the crib is clean you don't have to feed the ox but with the ox comes much increase this idea of increase in success they turn to other gods which leads to bondage because they no longer are pushing outward they're no longer they're no longer taking possession they're resting they content they go to sleep which eventually leads them to bondage it eventually and you can see this once again all throughout the book of judges where they they would do this and then here comes in an enemy and of course we know that that's the grace of god god allowed it to happen to bring them back to an awareness they would come into bondage and then they would cry again out to god they would cry again out to god they would seek the hand of god and then god would raise up a deliverer and the heart of the people would be steadfast while that deliverer lived it would be steadfast and then once the deliverer died they went right back to the same ways over and over a cycle a cycle of almost succeeding a cycle of almost entering in hebrews 10 35 cast not away therefore your confidence which hath great recompense of reward for ye have need of patience that after you have done the will of god you might receive the promise for yet a little while and he that shall come will come and will not tarry now the just shall live by faith and we know that part stop right so the whole lutheran doctrine is built around now the just shall live by faith but but this is the next part it's literally half a sentence but if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him but we are not of them who draw back unto perdition but of them that believe to the saving of the soul and we're going to go through some different instances of this and there's this continual pattern of those that come to a threshold they come to a threshold let's go ahead and throw up um the three rings and we'll we'll go between the three rings and the um and the assembly there if we can throw that up they come to a threshold while they're getting that up the rich young ruler sought the lord from his youth he sought the lord from his youth and he came to a threshold he came to jesus he came right up to the king of kings himself and he couldn't cross that threshold he turned back he drew back so just to review just a little bit and we've talked about this a few times we are made up of effectively three sections of our being in a sense here's our body we've got five senses that can communicate with our body we've got feel taste here smell c if anyone has any extra ones let me know about that because i'd really like to know thank you thank you thank you thank you uh how does this work there we go yeah if you've got any extra ones that that would be fantastic um then we've got the spirit so this is in your inner being this is this is the operator in a sense of this is your spirit your reasoning your conscience your imagination affection and memory and we're not going to take too much time on this other than to say that reasoning tends to lean towards logic affection emotion conscience is more of your innate sense of right and wrong which can be good or bad depending on what your upbringing and your nature nurture has been if you want to throw some terms out your conscience can be seared and mislead you absolutely absolutely can mislead you and yet this is a door god often uses to communicate with us imagination once again can be positive or negative the the ability to foresee or to look ahead into the future none of these are innately positive or negative they are gates into your spirit and they can be used for good or bad memory we think of this one oftentimes as being kind of bad it's like oh i remember all the bad stuff i've done right you know or oh yeah yikes or even imagination uh the stuff i'm gonna do you know like we can start to think about this stuff and we can we can paint them as very negative but they are they just simply are they are and both satan and god can operate within these realms and what really matters at the end of the day is what is in here in the soul who your inner being you're at this is who you actually are there are plenty of people in the world that have all of this all good to go all of this is good to go they're super people they are literally super people and yet right in here they are totally messed up they're told everything is done for is as a projection outward it's a projection so that other people can see them so that they can see themselves look at how great a person i am but yet they know and this is the thing with this you know you will never ever ever be able to talk yourself out of this no matter how much this is mastered no matter how much you can convince everyone else no matter how many people you surround yourself with that tell you you are a great person surely surely you won't die surely you won't surely the lord has blessed you you know you know you cannot get away from it you know and the inverse is also true there are people who legitimately believe and they know and they are led by the spirit of god from the soul and this part of their being is completely messed up completely messed up like the seed going into good ground you know good ground doesn't always look so good it's full of manure and fertilizer and garbage and just like all kinds of stuff is in that ground it's been sitting there gestating fertilizing rotting just a rotten mess but in that rotten mess there's a seed there's a seed of faith right there it's just waiting for god to strike it waiting for the sun and the rain it's crying out to god god help me help me i can't help myself i can't change my reasoning my imagination my affection my memory i can't change what i feel when i taste what i hear but god help me come down and save me save me pull me out of this miry clay lord i'm here god you know lord they're right there and they just keep on believing they just it might not look like it on the outside it might not look so good out here we might not even like them sometimes in church but they just keep on showing up they just keep on showing up they're looking for a redeemer they're looking for someone to come quicken this to me god i don't know what's real my consciences are all messed up my reasoning's messed up my memory afflicts me all of this afflicts me but there must be something real there must be someone there must be an answer to all of this there must be an answer to all of this in the soul in the soul let's go to the next slide to the inner and outer court so here's the this is the tabernacle that god gave the pattern to moses and this is if we zoomed further out which we're not going to it's not in the image but you would have all the 12 tribes around camped around this and then this is the the tabernacle in the wilderness you'd have this fence here and then the pillar of fire would descend upon this in the bible and this was the first dwelling of god in a sense now we know he appeared on mount sinai and we you can't contain him god fills all space time matter everything he can't be contained but he set a pattern back in the old testament of the house that i will dwell in and you can look at this there's three stages there's the outer courtyard right here where you've got the altar for the burnt offerings you've got the brazen laver go inside you got the table of showbread the menorah altar of incense with the menorah is the golden candlestick and then of course we've got the ark of the covenant which they put aaron's rod in there they also put the uh manna a sample of manna from the wilderness and then the tables of stone were in there and you look at this and the the procession to come into the holiest of holies they had to pass all of these stages the priests had to come the priest had to be ready he had to follow in the way that god ordained to come in to make the sacrifice to something had to die before you could even come in here something had to die then they would breach reach the brazen labor where they would walk they would wash they would cleanse themselves of any of the dust or any of the issues from out here and they would come in and then they would go into the holy place we're not going to go into too much detail on like what they did in there i'm just giving you some highlights so you would enter in of course in here we've got the table of showbread and the menorah and the altar of incense we come to a door to a threshold and many people they come from here we'll call this out here it's the the outer outer it's the real like this is the mass of the world in sem in a sense you're a part of the assembly you're not really in anything you're just a part of the assembly you get into here you're in the outer courtyard you're in you you have reached a point of communion with god of connection with god you've made a sacrifice you've you've been washed you've been washed out here though you're still influenced by the sun and the rain whatever whatever weather whatever atmosphere whatever mood i'm really hungry while i'm out here right i'm hungry then i go into the holy place and in here we've got the table of showbread i'm not hungry anymore there's light even if it's raining outside i'm pretty good this i could stay in here a long long time it smells great alternate there's not no stink from this altar down out here no sting from the congregation coming in i'm alone with god i'm alone with god right here and we stop right here go back to the other slide again it's symbolic it's a pattern the same outer court got that inner court and the holiest of holies and many people they start here yeah i made a sacrifice look i'm washed you know i look pretty good on the outside right everything that people can see pretty good then some people they even go a little higher and they actually do get this straightened out their conscience their reasoning memory affection it's good to go and they stop they stop it's pretty good in here things there's not a lot bothering me anymore my past doesn't really bother me anymore i'm not worried about the future anymore my conscience i know right from wrong i'm i'm a man of the community i'm a man i'm respected in this community i'm able i'm people come to me for counsel for counsel my affections are my emotions are in line i've got them all straightened out i don't fly off the handle anymore i don't have these just random impulses that are just like really i'm good i am good the problem so you go back to the other slide again within here everything in here is finite everything in here and they're direct we're not going to go through them but there are direct instructions for how to maintain all of these you got to make sure that the oil keeps on you know coming in here you got to keep on checking make sure that light keeps on going got you know this is restored the bread here is restored it's not if they're eating it it doesn't just magically reappear i should miraculously excuse me altar of incense even it's a part of their duty to care for these things to constantly maintain and it's the same thing with our spirit we're called to maintain to continuously maintain to wash ourselves to cleanse ourselves from the things of the world out here and then to enter in and and have this maintenance of our spirit we're not flying off the handle we're not doing these things and this makes a really good christian a really good christian someone who is admired and i know i'm repeating myself here but i think it's worth emphasizing many people never never go here they're almost there they're literally it's a thin curtain it's a thin curt it's one strides distance away and yet they're satisfied to stay right here satisfied stay right here let's go ahead and throw up um i think i sent you that picture of that olympian running let's go ahead and throw that up there i know i had that video too we're going to skip the video for now thank you for looking for it though i appreciate it there's a um this article if we can go ahead and throw this up here i thought this was really amazing we often talk about and this is funny we admire the people who win by an inch right they just run into running and running they win by an inch this is exactly the opposite he lost by an inch by a fraction of a second a 19 year old olympic runner's premature celebration at the finish line ends in defeat an olympic an olympian was reminded mere steps and you can see this article if you want mere steps from the finish line of a new year's eve race that when it comes to running it's best to hold off on celebrations jacob kiplimo a teenager who represented uganda in 2016 olympics was about to win the 95 95th san silvestre de sao paulo road race wow that's hard to say with a record-setting pace tuesday in brazil when he raised his arms as he neared the finish but he failed to hear the footsteps of kenya's kibiwatt kandi who zoomed past him with a last-second burst winning by a half stride connie became the first to win the 15k event in under 43 minutes finishing in 42.59 if you keep reading this you see this guy right here so he finished 42 59 43 one second one second and if you watch the video you see him he's just starting to raise his arms going through the tape and this guy just blazes past him just you see him coming and like what's interesting with the video there's police over there's like a a procession like this guy's won everything told him he had won everything told him he had won and this guy at the last second snatched defeat from the jaws of victory from the jaws of victory bear with me is this okay i know where i've got a lot more ground to cover you just don't look at that clock don't think about anything well don't think about nothing you know obviously think about what we're talking about here so there's this concept and i'm probably and bear with me we're going through some things on purpose is all intentional quantum mechanics who wants to talk about quantum mechanics i've got three people yes and i'm going to get this wrong because i just threw this in here i did do a fair amount of research on this originally um but it wasn't part of the sermon i just it stuck with me i was like okay drop quantum mechanics in here it's just one line so there's principle of particles when they're observed shift from acting and you can correct me on which direction it is they shift from acting like a wave or like a particle depending on if they are observed it's literally known there are so there are tons of videos on this they've done tons of studies on this and you can correct me which if i say it the wrong direction it's whether it's observed if it acts like a wave or a particle to some extent it doesn't matter for this this instance what matters is the fact the the act of observation literally changes at the quantum level literally changes how things in the sub atomic level react whether or not it's observed so whether or not it's measured if anything is measuring it it literally shifts and what's curious about this once again you can have these notes um i have a whole study on it that's not in this sermon they did this they tested this with meditation around the world and they had this experiment with it not physically being observed by any instrument but they had and it's a very long complicated study you guys can go read it i'm just giving you the highlight they had thousands tens of thousands of people so this is a huge sample and they accounted for vibrations they accounted for everything you can think of of what could have influenced uh these quantum mechanics to shift if something in the room was observing it you know something like that they've literally proven that people thinking about these particles or from across the world shifted it shifted it from a wave to a particle it shifted its its its action how it represented itself and you see the same thing here vision vision we talk about this we live in a time so if you go through the in revelations i know we're covering a lot of ground stay with me stay awake who's still awake if i can see a hand ah a couple people are asleep i know it's complicated for for the kids hey good job i saw a hand back there on the kids i know it's complicated we'll come back to some simple stuff come back to some simple stuff one second i just want to drop this in here we live in a time so we talk about this throughout history there's four beasts in the bible there's the lion ox man and eagle what is an eagle an eagle is a bird of flight and a vision is the ability it's looking ahead it's always its ability to perceive and see but if you think about it it's not looking at itself it's not observing itself it is observing the goal it is observing the target it is aiming at the target it is its whole perception is to hit that thing that's its perception and if this runner had had that perception if there had been no cues around to tell him you're done you've made it there had been no cues he wouldn't have stopped running he wouldn't have stopped running was going to leave that there a double-minded man is unstable in all of his ways wavering uncertain doubting divided in in interest two-spirited vacillating looking in two directions at once unfocused confused seeing i can't do it i can't cross my eyes this direction seeing two different ways let's go ahead and real quick we'll just jump into the target talk about this you're still with me i know this is a lot there's a reason for all of this all right i don't know well you guys can let's uh can someone grab that light thank you i tried to get this as i don't know this is very fast this morning so kids has anyone back there ever shot of rubber band at someone else shot a rubber band threw a ball through anything it's somebody else okay we got a couple people that admitted to it we'll talk to you after church i'm just kidding i'm just kidding i'm kidding i've done it too with thomas oh by the way say hi to thomas he's from tennessee my good friend right here let's give him a clap and welcome say hi to him he just turned 18 on friday so wanted to make sure to get him up here and uh yeah so represent so once again bring greetings from the south as well so he's a good guy so um snowballs we've all thrown snowballs at someone i mean there's tons of snow out there this happens you should do it right after church but represent this concept so we can get this idea of here's a target i should have put a person there instead but we're not going to do that for the kids just pretend that this is a person so if we've got a target this is what we're aiming at it's what we're looking at and some of you remember we talked about this before it's a little bit of refresher for a reason to hit the target is the is the effect effectively of faith sin means to miss the mark that's literally what the word means sin means to miss the mark in that i'm not able to hit it go ahead and put the next one up and so if i'm trying to hit the mark the bullseye the target the person running away from my snowball i gotta aim at them right i gotta look at them i gotta look at them i'm not just gonna be like huh now some people if they're practice enough you look at pro basketball players they can do it but even then they're imagining it in their mind their focus their focus is only on the target they're not thinking about the defenders or the offenders they're they're singular of vision their singular vision they're aiming they want that ball to go through that hoop or that ball to go across to make a touchdown that's their only goal and what's funny is if they get their eyes off that goal that's when they end up you know scoring in the opposing team's basket or running the opposite direction making a touchdown on the other side so they're aiming at the target and what we have here is degrees of aim so you can think of this like if i'm looking here it's my direction of aim it's a way of measuring by degrees i heard someone yawn so do we need to stand up and sing a song i heard someone clap so i think that that's a yes but maybe right after this thank god thank god finally sang a song we're aiming at the target and i drew two lines here to illustrate you can look at this this is one degree of difference from the place of my aim to the target look at how much different my spread my ability to hit that target becomes just from one degree shifted i wasn't looking at the target quite right i didn't have my aim lined up quite right let's go to the next one uh and this one you can't even see it so i made the target very small representing it being far off it's far away it's far away if we're right on the mark at the beginning we'll hit the target we'll hit the target but if we're just a little bit off it's one degree it's literally one degree off here it's not it's not a big deal and you miss the target completely you miss the tar it's one millimeter so close almost there almost there go to the next one this one so this is another concept so we got the first part you missed the mark because you weren't aimed this represents you throw the first uh text on there stopping short of the mark your aim is perfect it's right on the mark you think of it once again throwing snowballs i threw the i looked right at we've all had this in basketball come on ever like people play soccer doesn't matter i was like wow laid up for the shot the aim was perfect and it just hit the ground right in front of the basket it stopped short my aim my ambition my desire was right it was right but it stopped short it lost velocity it lost momentum and it dropped you see this even with guns and bullets if those of you that don't know depending on the distance to the target you can literally miss the target because it just drops it starts to drop eventually the weight of the bullet overcomes the propulsion eventually eventually go to the next slide it stopped short because whoever shot it didn't account for the wind they didn't account for the distance go to the next one there was a lack of enough power to break through the resistance but it was almost there the aim was perfect it was lined up with christ it just didn't have enough to make it all the way so close first kings 19 and after the earthquake of fire let's go ahead and we'll just leave this up after the earthquake of fire but the lord was not in the fire and after the fire and this is elijah elijah was called into the mountain because after his showdown with with um jezebel after the juniper tree experience after the juniper tree experience god calls him into the wilderness to talk to him right how many has been through a juniper tree experience where you feel like i'm no good i'm gonna die god you just gotta help me and it's in that time god calls him into the wilderness alone alone with god for 40 days and 40 nights alone with god and after the earthquake so he's in the mountain there's an earthquake after the earthquake of fire but the lord was not in the fire and after the fire and you can go through this there was a thunder and lightning and everything else there was a still small voice he didn't stop at the fire he didn't stop at the thunder he didn't stop at the lightning at the earthquake he didn't stop he waited for the still small voice and you can look at it he found the exact he was feeling all alone he was feeling all alone god asked him what what are you doing here elijah just updating like i say what doest thou what are you doing here elijah and he said i've been very jealous for the lord god of hosts i've been very good i've been very zeal he had just had a mount carmel experience 40 days before because the children of israel have forsaken thy covenant thrown down thine altars and slain thy prophets of the sword and i even i only am left and they seek my life to take it and of course if you go on god tells him the exact answer to that need you're not alone i've left i've left a propitiation i've left i think it's 7 000 other men for there's a people you're not alone you are not alone psalm 78 verse 40. how often we're just going to leave this up here like i said how oft did they provoke him in the wilderness speaking of the children of israel and grieve him in the desert yes they turned back and tempted god and limited the holy one of israel they remembered not his hand nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy have not i sent thee in 1962 and you'll see an accident that just almost takes your life and you'll say oh if i would have died lord thank you for sparing me speaking of us i'm going to serve you then forget about it see until one until one's done caught you see and then it's too late see you always the people usually forget god they don't always do it thank god for that but mostly it's easy to forget when everything's going good when everything's going good what happens so we're gonna go ahead once again stay with me go to the next slide we'll go to the velocity portion to escape velocity so there's this concept in space travel i know we're talking about some you know this is literally rocket science today so is this concept getting to space is easy it's not like something could do you could do in your car this is directly off of an article you can see all the sources but it's not a huge challenge you could get a person to space with a small sounding rocket the size of a telephone pole the x-15 aircraft reach space just by going fast and then steering up but getting to space is easy the problem is staying there the problem is staying there go to the the blue one so we think no yeah that one hey take it out for a second don't read that look at me we think we're going up once again thinking of that target we're going to space kids space is awesome right you look at the stars ever telescope space is awesome i want to go up in space go to the moon you know all this stuff that people people get excited about but what happens is as we're going up you could just barely have enough velocity or barely not have enough velocity and what happens if we throw that uh the first diagram back up not the blue one sorry about that i meant to mention this more is the as you go up if you don't have enough velocity that's fine if you don't have enough velocity to break the earth's gravitational pull to actually travel in outer space one you'll go back down and hit the earth and crash and burn two you'll end up here and maybe wander around and then three you'll end up in orbit around the earth you'll end up in orbit you can throw the blue one back up misconception alert most satellites and spacecraft sent into space do not reach escape velocity sorry for all the jumping around space is usually considered to start at an altitude of 100 kilometers blah blah got details this is known if a rocket goes fast enough and high enough to enter space but does not reach escape velocity it will enter orbit around the earth the international space station and many satellites orbit the earth so you think of this as spiritual astronauts we we are called to leave this earth to leave the influences of this earth we're called not to be to exist in these outer rings of our body we're not just existing in our spirit we want to go into the soul to actually have an experience with god to actually go somewhere with god to go somewhere with god come follow me follow me you look at the call jesus gave everyone it's not just an accepting christ and christ coming into your heart and now you sit there that's not it it is a active walk it is an active walking with god and what happens far too often is we end up with a stay with me we end up with enough velocity enough of a commitment to god just to get off the ground and get stuck in the earth's orbit stuck no more fuel no more propulsion just circling the earth i'm in space praise god i'm in space i'm i've left i got my mind made up i'm i'm never coming back down in space floating around in the spirit floating around not going anywhere with god not going anywhere just a floater wandering around taking pictures of the earth taking pictures of the stars this is amazing look at all those people down on the earth they have no idea they have no idea i've arrived i'm in space i'm in space two kings 18 now elijah was falling sick of his sickness whereof he died coming to a close in a brother kaido diggs fashion now elisha was falling sick of his sickness whereof he died everybody stand up real quick everybody right now everybody turn around turn around five times to the right just don't get too dizzy then turn around five times to the left and just imagine you're floating in space you're floating in space and hopefully you have some propulsion nice sound effects whoever just put that through the all right you can be seated ready for liftoff yes somebody say praise the lord praise the lord say this is the most amazing thing i've ever heard that's all right that's all right this is for somebody now elisha was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died and joash the king of israel came down unto him and wept over his face and said o my father my father the chariot of israel and the horsemen thereof and elijah said unto him take bow and arrows and he took unto him bow and arrow and he said to the king of israel put thine hand upon the bow and he put his hand upon it and elisha put his hand upon the king's hands think of it he's got the prophet literally directing his aim his aim is perfect it's exactly to the target he's following in exactly what the prophet told them to do he's looking exactly to where the prophet told him to look he's right directly on the mark he's got the the elijah's hands on his hands he's guided by the spirit he's literally on the mark on the threshold and he said open the window eastward and he opened it and elisha said shoot and he shot and he said the arrow of the lord's deliverance and the error of deliverance from syria for thou shalt smite the syrians and aphec till thou have consumed them praise god right i can imagine i can't imagine joe after like this was a good thing to come talk to elisha right like praise the lord the error of god's deliverance we are going to you know we're going to till thou have consumed them i mean he just said it we've won yes and he said elisha take the arrows and he took them and he said unto the king of israel smite upon the ground and he smote thrice and stayed three times with number of perfection biblically that's really good right you know father son holy ghost smoted three times and the man of god was wrathed with him and said thou shouldest have smitten five or six times then hats thou smitten syria till thou heads consumed it whereas now thou shalt smite syria but thrice but you wouldn't utterly consume them he already had victory in his profession he already had victory the prophet just told me i got victory okay this is just i'm just going through the motions now beat the ground three times he said beat the ground three times they say get baptized they said come to church on sunday and wednesday they said to pay my tithe going through the motions going through the motions everything would be all right they think elijah in the meal offering 1960 but the nation had thought as long as they were eating good and were well clothed that everything would be all right and you see this it's on the border it's on the threshold and i know i'm saying this over and over we're coming to something i'm coming to a close it is on the border of true victory of true deliverance of true baptism of true feeling of the holy ghost that we stop short just short of the target and end up a floater floating around in space floating around church floating from church to church i wonder if this is right i wonder if that's right i can see the word there it is pray i can see the earth but if you know the so the u.s space station that's floating around the i guess the russia and the u.s and a couple other countries are all in on this but we call the u.s space station it's floating up there it's floating up there it is still affected by 90 of the gravity as you and i it just happens to be floating around in space 90 percent they're just able to be moving around the earth fast enough that in effect the force is keeping them aloft it's keeping them aloft and that's the same thing sometimes you see this it's people they're running they're running if i just keep moving if i just keep moving i'm okay if i just keep moving if i just go to the next event if i just go to the next revival they're just keep moving this frantic ongoing moving but yet they know something's pulling them back down to the earth something is pulling them back down to the earth because they never really left it they never really left it they're almost there but they didn't how do we do this how do we leave we need more velocity we need more propulsion we need more fuel we need more oomph bible calls it dunamis it's literally the root word that we get for dynamite dot you need more boom we need more boom and that boom is not just a loud noise it's not just a loud noise it is a inner fire it is an inner work it is an inner thing going back to ruth 1 verse 15 and she said this is naomi again coming back around behold thy sister-in-law has gone back unto her people and unto her gods speaking to ruth return thou after that so orphans just left there's a way out she's not in the majority anymore she there's a way naomi's literally telling her to go telling her to go her family the only family she's got is telling her to go maybe she's got some family in the world telling her to go return now after thy sister-in-law and ruth said entreat me not to leave thee or to return from from following after thee for whither thou goist wherever you go take i wanted to change that it's the same word we just get so we we we we just wither so ever we don't pay attention wherever you go i will go where you lodge where you stay i'm gonna stay your people are gonna be my people and your god my god where you die i'll die and there will i be buried and may the lord do so to me and more also if ought but death part theme if anything separates us then may the lord smite me dead that's effectively what she's saying if anything but death separates i'm gonna go with you no matter what no matter what and when she saw that she was steadfastly minded to go with her then she left speaking and of course steadfastly it's an old-fashioned word when she was determined she was determined to go then naomi left speaking unto her matthew 22 36 going fast coming to a close master which is the great commandment in the law jesus said unto him thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind this is the first and great commandment and the second is like unto it thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself on these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets and i want to just drill down what these the words they're using this is the actual meaning of those words to love the lord your god from the seed of your appetite the seat of emotion and passions inclination resolution determination from the man himself or woman from the self from the person from the individual from the activity of mind the activity of the will activity of the character by might by force and abundance by demand and you can cross this over matthew 6 seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you take therefore no thought for the moral for the moral shall take thought for the things of itself sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof that word seek literally means and i've said this here before but i think it's worth emphasizing because i believe it is the singular most critical thing in our lives i believe this i live my life i will stay i will die on this i believe it we are called to crave him that's what that word means it is to crave him to demand it in a sense not god you owe me but god just like ruth where you go i will go your people will be my people if anything stops me smite me dead smut where you die i will die and that's what it takes to be a christian that's what it takes to actually hit the mark that's what it takes is an actual and you look at this hebrews 11 again but without faith it is impossible it's impossible to please him for he that cometh to god he that hits the target must believe that he is he that he is and that he's a warner of them that diligently seek him and that same word is the exact same word the exact same word to crave to require to demand to demand it of this life that no matter what happens no matter what happens i don't care if my leg gets blown off i don't care if i end up out there in the street with the rioters out there i don't care what happens no matter what happens i will never stop and if i do god strike me dead strike me dead today and there are people right now in this room that are thinking but isn't that tempting god isn't that tempting god isn't that tempting god it's just not so it's holding god to his word it's not demanding it in the sense of you oh me god like you we recognize god i am nothing i am nothing i am absolutely nothing but you said you are the vine i'm the branches if you don't come and flow through me i'm gonna make a mess out of it so god you said you said it i need you i'm craving after you you've gotta come i need you i'm not gonna hit the target we've all fallen short we've all been born and sinned by nature we will all miss the mark but by the power of christ in me by the power of christ in me not anything i can do but by his own spirit by his own spirit seeky first and that word first love it means of utmost importance priority everything it is first relationships aren't first family isn't first bible goes on to say if you don't hate your father your mother your brother your wife your sister for my name's sake and that sounds really harsh but he's trying to make a point if you don't count the searching of my spirit greater than these things you've missed the mark if you don't count this of of greater value and importance and you see this all the time people get that out of line they're so close they're almost there they let the pastor get right up there between them and god they let their wife get up there between them and god they let their own selves get between them and god so close almost there they can allow the church to get between them and god they allow what they're doing for the church to be between them and god seeking first the kingdom is not just getting out there and witnessing or testifying or paying our ties or showing up and singing or reading the bible 12 times it's not listening to the sermons all day every day all night long to the point where i can repeat it out of my mouth without even thinking about it that's not seeking the kingdom those are tactics those are things to do those are things that may help me seek the kingdom those are all great they're fine i'm all for it but really at the end of the day if you go back in time if all of this was gone what would be left you and god that's it you and god and we must we absolutely and i'm talking to you young people too and myself and you old people oh y'all yes we must we must especially now today in this time where things we we were things it doesn't even matter i would say it's less dangerous now than it was like a while ago even years ago like wow things are so great back whenever you know 10 years ago when gas prices were low and it is in those seasons it doesn't matter we've got two cert there's two reasons why people don't cross that threshold one they're afraid they're afraid and they stop short they're afraid look at the rich young ruler god caught jesus himself in flesh stood in front of him he asked the right question to the right person and he got the right answer and jesus came and said you've got to forsake it all that's what he really said we can go down to the detail like no it's because riches are bad and he had to go give away all of his money and that's why and richard like no no that's not the point that's not what he meant he took the thing that was most valuable to him he took that thing whatever is most valuable to you god will call you to that point where you have to choose between that and him absolutely he will he will bring you to that point where you must absolutely choose and you know what he may even give that thing back to you a hundred fold later on but you have to come to that point where even if he doesn't like job we are all called to that point to that walk to that place where we reach the the end of our ability the end of our understanding when we can actually cry out to god though you slay me though you abandon me though i can't see you though i don't know what to do though it feels as if the entire world god i'm not going to stop i'm not going to stop i'm not going to stop loving you serving you believing in you i'm never going to stop i'm not going to stop samson gave god his strength coming to a close i'm watching the time samson gave god his strength but he never gave him his heart and we see that again people that love the lord and you should do those things let's come to chur i've done it my whole life come up and sing and play the instruments and all those are great i'm all for it i love it but it's beyond that it's beyond that let's throw up the the courts again we're good we are coming to a close except that i accidentally scrolled back up to the top of my notes so i'm going to preach the whole sermon again it literally just happened oops it comes down elisha we'll just leave this up here for now elisha and it came to pass when the lord would take up elijah into heaven by our world and we know the story but look at the parallels with ruth it's the exact same thing and elijah said unto elisha uh it when the lord would take up elijah into heaven by a whirlwind that elijah went with elisha from gilgal and elijah said unto elisha tarry here i pray thee for the lord hath sent me to bethel and elisha said unto him as the lord liveth and as thy soul liveth i will not leave thee so they went down to bethel and of course we can read we're just going to skip through this because there's a bit here son of the prophets come up don't you know that god's gonna take your prophet that's what they keep saying don't you know like just like the world don't you know this is about to happen don't you know don't you know and he and elijah continually says yeah i know hold your peace be quiet i know but just be quiet don't listen to it my eyes are on elijah focusing on elijah and elijah said until elisha terry here stay stay at bethel you know what bethel means the house of god stay at the house of god that sounds really good doesn't it sounds great for the lord has sent me to jericho and jericho represents if you're looking at this it represents walking down the road to hell it literally means it's a backsliders walk the road to jericho is a backsliders walk it's going to get real rough from here stay in bed stay in the house of god the lord has sent me to jericho and he said as the lord liveth and as thy soul liveth i will not leave thee so they came to jericho and again the sons of the prophets we know came to elisha said the same thing and he again says be quiet shut up i miss brother john lafontaine he used to say that all the time like sometimes you just need to tell the devil shut up shut up sometimes you need to tell yourself shut up and just like brother kaidri i'm practicing the ministry of shut your mouth shut your mouth yes shut up don't talk about it don't talk about it yeah something's going wrong who cares doesn't matter don't talk about it don't spread that thing around don't don't just say like oh yeah let's just me oh look at what's happening like a monster just coming out of you spread that thing around everybody should know about this and elijah said to him terry here i pray thee for the lord that sent me to jordan and jordan represents death jordan represents death to watch out for jordan um and he said as the lord that's why he's always wearing black as the lord liveth and as thy soul liveth i will not leave thee and they went on and of course we know the rest of the story that god came and because of this it was after this that elijah told him if you see you know he asked him what do you want he obtained the promise because he followed him from the house of god he didn't leave god in church he didn't just stay at church he followed god through his own backslidings through his own struggles through his own garbage though he would stray through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil for you're with me he followed him all the way to the point of death always and it was after they had crossed over they'd cross that threshold that he obtained the promise he crossed that threshold and obtained the promise it comes down to death and that's why people stay here coming to a close i'm for real they don't want to die because to go in here means to die you cannot stay who you are and go in here you can't you can't stay who you are that old being inside of you the man or woman themselves that thing will go you it is to die it is literally and it's funny because we see this outer man and the body and we think i know they didn't die they didn't die they just change you know their spirit they just like god this all cleaned up no they're not the same they are not the same and i know it's happened to me i know i'm not the same there's something different it's not that i don't have problems out here it's not that this thing doesn't get smokey and you know i have to rechange this oil and i got to go back out and you know do this this offering in the rain and sometimes something in here and it's real it's real it's real coming to a close it's real by faith hebrews 11 enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found he crossed this but he didn't see physical death god had translated him like elijah think about that enoch and elijah he had this testimony that he pleased god and that's the portion right before but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and then he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek him so we can infer or conclude enoch diligently sought god he diligently craved god and it's not in a coincidence that we talk about enoch walking with god craving leads to seeking leads to following i must have this it's this continual moving towards him and i will also say and i am at coming to a close just give me five minutes and then we'll call the musicians the genesis of this for myself the re this sermon came to me just a few weeks ago so this is brand new um for me like i'm sure someone's preached it before um but because there's nothing new under the sun god god allows these things times but this became real to me i noticed in myself i noticed in myself let's go ahead and throw up the matthew principle real quick the slide those of you that know me and i've preached about it before i've been through a pretty hard couple of years and it's been rough and something in me has shifted even beyond anything i had i don't know i can't explain it i know it's real i i know it's it's like it's changed for me it is literally it's inside and i've reached that point like yeah i know i experienced god before that but it was in the suffering in the worst parts of my life where i got to the point where i could i didn't know i wasn't even sure god was real and it was in that that god became real that god became real was in that i had no ability in myself to make him real and he made himself real he made himself real he made himself real in that and i'm so grateful for that so grateful for that and i realized you know here it's been a long journey and things have been getting better and better and i just feel this feeling and so there's this matthew principle so again this is a lot of stuff i am coming to a close and they talk about this jesus matthew 13 for whosoever hath to him shall be given and he shall have more abundance but whosoever hath not from him shall be taken away even that he hath and people look at this like wow that sounds awful jesus like i thought you were kind no it's a principle it is a literal law it's a law of god everything engages in this and i've been through this so on this end of the this grid and i just hastily drew this together when things start going bad they all go bad this principle of compounding interest like a circle all of a sudden things spiral downward and it seems like everything goes wrong all at once you typically go from a plateau where things were pretty good and you got lazy stop stop walking with god and everything's fine and then all of a sudden it gets bad really fast compounding one thing happens and the next thing happens then the next thing happens we've all been there we've all and we will be there again we will it will happen and it's somehow i've i've managed to make this and it's weird it's very strange but i feel this feeling i'm right here where everything's about to get way better i feel it it's weird i'm like wow everything like like thomas like i was telling his brother josh like i was literally like everything's about to change i feel it like i feel like my wit my wings are in the wind and everything's about to change and that's great praise god and what happened next was the weirdest thing i found right here all of a sudden i started doing this it's this hesitation at the threshold this hesitation and i noticed it in myself you know i've got goals i've got ambitions i've prayed a lot i've talked to god and like okay god these are the things that i really feel like i should be aiming at like spend a lot of time and i've seen god direct me and i can see them like wow these are everything's about to get way better and in that i i just like i felt that feeling of like i just don't want to get up in the morning i don't want to like what is going on like what what what's happening and i woke up one morning and it's like something and i don't like to say god told me because that sounds so definite it's like oh yeah god talks to me like he does but i don't want you know i just i don't know i don't i don't like that but something spoke to me and i heard it was like a thought as soon as i woke up said you have not prepared yourself for success and just spoke and just left i was like i haven't prepared myself for success and i what does that mean i started thinking about that next day i was taking a nap as i was laying down it was this image the same one let's go to the through the target image it's like i just saw it in my head i was just i wasn't thinking about it at all all of a sudden i just saw this idea and this is where the sermon comes from and i i don't know i just i guess i tell on myself all the time because at least then i know it's real i'm not preaching theory i believe this i absolutely believe this with every every ounce of my being i believe this the key is to aim through the mark not to the mark is to have this continued velocity of and and it's exactly what we're just talking about of god i'm not just going to do enough to get here i'm not just going to do enough to kind of sort of make it i'm not going to just slide by into the gates of the kingdom of god i'm not going to do that i'm going to blast through that target i'm going to bl i'm going to blast through that target there's not even going to be a target left by the time i'm done with this thing i'm going to blast through this target i'm gonna blast through this thing that that i'm going to put every ounce of everything i've got into this everything i've got and that is and it is the principle i keep sliding up my slides god must be trying to tell me i'm missing something or something is the principle whatever you do do it with your might with every fiber of your being for the glory of god as if he is the one calling you in you and commissioning you to do it whether it's your job your relationship doesn't matter everything for the glory of god i want to be the best employee i can possibly be for the glory of god not for myself or for my boss or anything like that i want to be the best brother or the best preacher or the best mom or the best cousin or son or doesn't matter whatever is laid upon my heart to do i want to be the best the best at it and i would call out to every one of us we reach that same point of right here right things are go we're basically there we're at the target in our relationship we're at the target in our marriage we're at the target in our career in our finances and we allow ourselves to just wander take heed any man that thinks he stands lest he fall lest he fall do it with your might every fiber of your being i am coming to last thing i think i said that 20 times i think that's that'll be my line not not i'm coming to a close it'll be last thing i'll say it 20 times last thing how there's a principle we're just going to skim through this very fast how do we give our all we're called you look at this principle laid out for the children of israel to remember remember exodus 12 they shall eat the flesh in that night roast with fire and unleavened bread with bitter herbs they shall eat it remember the bondage on purpose not dragging you back out into the world but remembering it calling it to our attention a reminder this is where i came from as a reminder because what happens is once you're out in space i'm off the ground our perception changes we have our context changes and we think we're good and that's the second reason people don't cross that threshold one is they're afraid two they think they've already arrived they think they've already arrived they were in the promised land and they stopped remembering egypt they stopped remembering the bondage that's why the bitter herbs are in there to remind them remember these feast days keep them holy to remember the bondage and remember the greatness of almighty god both remember these things and i would say today remember call to your remembrance don't forget them don't forget those things and that's not just today every day calling it to your mind to your remembrance that god as a practice as a discipline to call our attention to god our attention and and reading our bible and praying is great i believe that brother ram taught us he said if you want to get brother branham i want to get closer to jesus what do i do read your bible and pray but you look closer there's one precondition to that if i want to it starts with the craving it starts it must start the craving not just the actions those are great i believe in that but we need to come down to the place before god where we earnestly desire him we really desire him that there is a longing and we just have to have it and those things will fall into place they will absolutely they will if you want chocolate you're hungry right now because you probably are i am too you will be drawn you'll be drawn no one has to tell you you should probably go get something to eat you know and if you don't have a craving if you don't have a craving start there i want to want to what should i do help me god i want to want to musicians can go ahead and come this is your house i want to want to i'm just going to throw this in here real quick one more thing because i believe that this is important i really feel like god i laid awake last night or the night before i don't know i was thinking about this and i was thinking about this a lot and it really troubled me [Music] i've traveled a lot in phoenix right now tennessee been around the world 10 different countries [Music] and i see this stopping short and it breaks my heart it breaks my heart people are in the same meetings i was in they're in the same atmosphere i was in they were in the same place and they stopped short hot why why and how to encourage you wherever you are don't stop short go on with jesus go on with christ as an individual and as a church this place this place has come really far it's come a long way through a lot of hard roads through a lot of bitter herbs this place and it's come really far it's a nice looking building we got great sound we got great musicians things are looking good don't stop don't stop this is the point just the point where god is starting to be able to use us just the point where god is starting to be able and so i encourage you and myself each one of us we're all in this god help us to not settle but like caleb to come out of egypt go through the wilderness help everyone else get their land and then take my mountain he said give me my mountain i'm more able now he's a hundred what a hundred and something years old i'm more able now to take it than i ever have been he didn't settle there was something in him that said that there was more there was more of god and no matter how far we've come with him let us like paul in philippians 3 say not as though i had already attained either were already perfect but i follow after that i may apprehend for that which also i am apprehended of christ brethren i can't count myself not to have apprehended not to have hit the target but this one thing i do forgetting those things that are behind good or bad and reaching forth unto those things which are before i press towards the mark of the high calling of god in christ jesus [Music] let's just bow our heads let's go to lord in prayer this morning dear father lord we just consecrate this word to you now today lord god [Music] sorry for taking keeping people so long lord god but i just feel a sense of urgency god in my spirit that this needs to be said help us lord god father i pray to heed your spirit lord god and if there would be anyone here who is at that point may their heart be stirred lord god that they would see themselves and they wouldn't cop out they wouldn't rely on the past of the past experiences with god or their past duties or their past anything good or bad but that they might feel you calling them up higher to something more and that they would step up to that call that there's something more that you have for them more god and that it would anchor down that it would anchor down in their souls lord which is committed to your hands now father in the name of jesus christ it takes god himself in a man not what god has to say not out of god's example not god's precepts not god as a far away object of our emulation or worship it takes god himself in man and i would say once again this morning emotions won't do it singing the songs won't do it lining up with the word won't do it you must be born again you must it is a must and if you're sure that you're born of the spirit of god that you have the holy ghost and the promises of god is yours you don't care what the devil does you can still rest assured faith takes its unmovable stand it stands there nothing will move it and if you don't have that this morning it's time it's time whether it's here or on your own it doesn't really matter it's time this is your house this is your house brother one you can come oh father come and dwell this is your house it's a holy house prayer where the law stands lonely bring their burdens and your kids this is your house is this your heart [Music] world we are your hearts a holy house of bread where the [Music] bring your burdens and your gifts we are your house we are your house come and work praise the lord praise the lord you know i would say this and we pray and be dismissed thank the lord for the word this morning thank the lord for and i think it came in such a way that we can relate to you know ariel always tell me she said papa you preach too serious she said you preach too serious you don't even make people laugh [Music] praise the lord but let me say this you know we are in such a time just like i talked about israel joining i think the message this morning relates to that almost there almost there and and what is happening is that there in israel johnny there was a generation that was born in the wilderness like i said last sunday they were born in the wilderness out of those 40 years the people that went into the promised land there were only two originally that came out of egypt it was caleb and joshua the multitude that went with caleb and joshua were the people that were born in the wilderness and we represent those people that is born in the wilderness our joshua is the holy ghost amen our joshua is the holy ghost that is going to take us into the promised land but just like brother lloyd preached and just like the word says most of the things that israel suffered was that wandering they came so close and something just made them to go back that wondering and we are in such a time we get so bold with uh we there's a crave for something new there's a crave for something more and what it is is not it's not a new church it's not a new city it's not a new and uh i mean if by choice or by leadership the law leads you somewhere else but what it is is the promise of the owl praise the lord and most especially for many of our young people our children that are born around this truth from the day we dedicate dedicated them we bring them to church and you come to church and you come to church and you come to church and sometimes it's hard for you to even tell where your journey started [Music] but you need to have a starting place [Music] you've been coming to church from the day that you were dedicated really did not mean that you have [Music] started [Music] but you know those generation that was born in the wilderness [Music] with everything that he saw all the argument the witness go opening the earth and swallowing up all the unbelievers the witness people trying to turn back and go back to egypt when the red city is already closed so those people turning back they are just going to be drowned there is no way back god is not going to open the rear seat again for you to go back and place whatever your desire is you are just going to get drowned into the world [Music] i just want to encourage you this morning just hold on this thing is real there's a dynamic that is going to strike this church that is going to make this message real to you is going to make the holy ghost so real that you will be grateful [Music] that you never got consumed by this word no matter what is your situation what you're going through the things that explain in your mind the many questions that nobody can answer just hold on if there is nothing that is real to you let me remind you god is real he's more real than anything you are looking at he's real than the colors god is real and you hold to that faith in your heart that god is real listen to our feet let's just worship him a little bit while we try to digest this word wants my sword now oh yes wants [Music] gave me peace joy and love when he reached down his hands for me oh when he reached down his hands for me oh yeah when he reached [Music] [Music] for me [Music] [Applause] [Music] gave me glow re-complete when he reached down his hands for me oh yes when he reached down his hands for me oh yeah when he reached [Music] [Music] got all his son when he reached down he says for me praise the lord amen we want to thank the lord for reaching down his hands and you know i learned something this week i was listening to uh to uh to something and and the person said when you're feeling stressed and whatever you are doing that is stressing you out one of the best way to deal with stress is look for what you know how to do best leave what you are doing and go to do what you know how to do best and do it that's the easy way to be able to get out of stress then you can go back and face your challenge amen and i think what we know how to do best is to praise the lord amen praise the lord so if the lord i mean if the devil is bugging you just leave what you are doing and get to praising god amen you'll be able to gain strength let's just think uh a victory some year i woke up this morning i didn't have a doubt i knew that the lord would bring me out amen let's just let's just praise the lord a little bit amen thanking the lord for everything that he's doing you know just like brother lord said we have come a long way as a church one of our focus has been on creating an atmosphere to see god moving in our midst and we have seen it time and time and time again praise the lord and that's the reason why we spend time in praying we keep a praying atmosphere around this assembly praise the lord amen let's just sing there i woke up [Music] i went that on my knees i said lord help me please and i woke up sinking shall take me to blessing one more time oh yes i woke up this morning i didn't had a doubt oh i knew that the law will bring me out i went down on my knees oh i said lord help me [Music] is mine oh yeah victory today it is [Music] [Applause] is is mine oh victory oh yes my lord victory to thee is my [Music] is mine let's just clap our hands to the [Music] lord i will not be defeated no i won't you know the lord is on my side [Music] yeah i will not be defeated no i won't i will not be defeated no i won't you know the lord is on my side i will not be the night oh i will not be defeated no i won't say tommy come against me satan may come against me in one way but he will have to flee in seven is against me in one way is [Applause] let us pray together now heavenly father lord we come to the end of the service this morning i pray dear lord that father your word minister this
