week praise the Lord amen amen we have our brother Joseph grain Pastor Joseph grain uh spoke for us last night he'll be speaking for us uh this morning again thank you for coming out last night to support the service and uh uh uh and all those that will also follow the service online praise the Lord and uh for many many few years we had uh uh lot of the brothers coming a certain time of the year and most of the most of that time will be between June and uh in September uh if you do remember we we sometimes we have floss of brother coming all through uh every other week or every week or so as much as we can get them in now the reason there is there are uh most of those Brothers come for a longstanding mission meetings that brother brother Joe Green they've been having for over 51 years and uh uh so I mean they come from all over the world uh uh from Africa Asia and I mean just everywhere they come so most of the time when they come the few that know us try to make contact and then we have them come you know uh uh brother Samuel OTA that was here from Uganda uh and then uh many of the brothers we can we can call their names and they're all coming for that meeting so uh we we kind of made contact with brother Joel earlier this year and wanted him to come and just visit with us and I was just I was just sharing him sharing with him a little bit and uh uh I just felt like uh uh you know they are men that dedicate their time to you know their work to different things you know some are greatly involved in printing books and and other things like even from our little assembly year we try to do the little that we can and uh supporting some of the missionary brothers that are out there so when these brothers come they are all coming on one miss one Mission need or another and the little the little bit we think that we can we can do or encourage them is to just have them come down speak for us in a little way that we can support them we try to do that the best that we can so uh I mean it's really been an honor having brother Joe to be with us this weekend he's a very busy man and a busy in the things that they do there in North Carolina but we thank the Lord for taking it him taking his time to come and also our dear brother Eric also praise the Lord uh I got to know after the service yesterday that he's a he's a preaching Deacon so I told him okay he have to come back and and and testify amen we never we never give him the opportunity to to do that but I think we can we can spare a few minutes and uh and have brother brother ER to come and and and greet the church before brother Joel come so brother ER you come up brother amen just like to say it is an honor to be here with you this morning uh honor to travel with my pastor amen I know brother Joe's been they've been doing the mission uh uh meetings for 51 years but I've been there for 35 of them so you know since 1989 [Applause] so and it's like brother Joe says it's not just his meeting it's all of our meeting just like the service is this morning this is not not just brother Juan's service brother Joe's service this is your service it's what you make out of it you have to pull on the gift of God you have to get what you need this morning just like last night all you got to do is come up here the pull pit and grab the 20 that's all it takes but I just want to greet you this morning say you're a lovely bunch of people and I'm honored to be among you this morning and I'm honored to serve the same God that you serve amen [Applause] amen if I knew he was preaching he was going to preach last night and then brother Joel was going to rest and preach this morning we don't waste gifts amen we don't waste we don't have no wrong no dust being for gift amen we make use of every one of them that God gave us praise the Lord so a couple of years ago we were down in uh Zimbabwe doing some meetings for Brother Joseph chosi and uh so one of the brothers are passing through he will be down with brother Brooks he actually preaching for brother Brooks in Iowa this morning and he's taking his flight through Minneapolis to Tucson so brother Samuel chesa will be

let's come and support the service amen it'll be yet on on Wednesday night speaking for us so uh we want to thank the Lord for that the Lord bless you let's stand on our feet and then we will sing a song yet and ask brother Joel to come and and take the liberty and just and just uh bring the word and speak to us this morning praise praise the Lord what a mighty God we serve amen praise the Lord

God he knew me amen you know I I have a little a little I had a little ball cap that I wore and a little picture on that ball cap there a little boy and he has a a slingshot in his pocket you a slingshot like uh like we played with with kids with the little things on the side you put a rock in you pull it back and Let It Go not like David's sling but a little uh rubberized one one that my

standing but just a moment but certainly been our privilege and joy to be here and uh grow our fellowship with Brother Juan and with you Saints here it's just been just a pleasure for us and uh we we've known him uh in in a little bit of a way for a number of years and now to get to have some time of Fellowship together it's just been a a grand privilege for us this morning and we we're certainly honored to meet you I I believe this morning that one day we'll sit down by the River of Life and talk it all over and testify one to another of how God led us and brought us and dealt with our hearts and it'll be a wonderful time amen when we get to the other side so may God bless you this morning and greet you from our assembly back home Bible Tabernacle Church and the Big Town of Roose North Carolina we have one traffic light uh you know I don't know what you all would do with one traffic light amen it's just uh just amazes me all the crossing and and bridges and everything is just just wonderful amen but technology of man is just just great to our benefit this morning amen but it can be detrimental amen but we we just thank God for his mercies and we are a mission-minded church I was sharing with Brother Juan yesterday a little bit of of the vision that we've had over the years my dad started the church in the early 60s under the direction of the Lord he was pastoring a a group we we will you bear with me just a moment this morning I'm going to be standing standing for a little while so I'll let you stand for a moment amen uh dad was pastoring another church and the Lord spoke to him to leave that a thriving church maybe 300 people uh radio broadcasts mission trips doing very well there but he just desired more from the Lord and he called a fast and solemn assembly and prayed for a couple of three days and sought the Lord and the Lord spoke to him to leave them there and come to Ruth and build a church for the common people and uh he set in practice uh by following that instruction he set in practice some instructions that brother branam had given to his Pastor brother Glenn pardon in 1956 to uh go and come to the mission fields of the world and the church would be a support or a backlog for the missionary efforts so dad caught that Vision brother Parton failed to do it and dad caught that vision and and uh ran with it as we say and uh by God's grace the rest is history uh dad and brother Dan uh preached all around the world and and India and Africa and the Canary Islands Philippine islands all the Caribbean islands Mexico uh Honduras Central America dad and brother Dan took a pickup truck from North Carolina Ina Brother Juan drove it all the way down to Honduras all the way through Mexico and whatever countries down through there to get to hondurus for our little brother a missionary brother there and and I left it with him and uh it's just it's just so many things to to to relate this morning but we're just happy to be a servant of the most high God Amen so may God bless you this morning if you ever run of out out of anything to pray for pray for us amen because we desire amen the the leadership of the Lord and we desire the prayers of the people brother renam uh he said you know a couple of times and maybe more than a couple of times but he said attribute the success of my people to these two brothers as he pointed to them said that their prayers amen is what holds us up and what encourages us and I I believe this morning that the prayers of the Saints they hold more value than we realize they do this morning amen so may God bless you greetings from my wife she wanted to come but uh due to circumstances her health and so forth she wasn't able to make the trip so I just felt in my heart to ask with Eric to travel with me and I sure appreciate him coming this morning amen he's he's most of the time very quiet until he gets in the pull pit and then uh I think brother ju his first sermon uh 31 years ago or 32 years ago before my dad passed away was was 50 1 minutes long his first sermon amen so brother Eric I sure appreciate him and his support there in the church he's he's the one I call on most of the time when I need an emergency preacher amen so he's he's always willing and ready so we do appreciate that amen as you find your place in the scripture in Luke chapter 1 we'll just bow our hearts this morning for a word of prayer precious father this morning God how grateful we are and Lord uh we could go on and on talking about your goodness and the great things that we have seen Lord the the the missionary efforts lord it's just it's just a part of us Lord we can't help it it's it's it's the ver vision and the burden that you placed uh Upon Our Hearts upon my dad brother Dan between us and then myself Lord it it's something Lord that's inbred I believe within us and we thank you for these precious people this morning they're there are many of them Lord from another country but circumstances and situations have brought them here and Lord I I I believe the the most important thing that's brought him here is the word of God and I pray this morning Lord God that you would just help me today God to step aside and Lord to yield my vessel to you that you Lord could take control I pray you touch my physical frame this morning Lord God and just give me strength and help me father to to be sensitive to the leading of the spirit this morning God as we spoke last night and shared Lord the the the little things that you've placed within our heart and we're just going to continue in that train of thought this morning by your grace and I pray you just help help us father to to be a blessing God as as brother Sorano wrote the song in the Philippines Lord just to be a blessing I'd climb up the highest mountain I'd cross the deep blue sea and God that's that's what our desire is just to be a blessing and a help in some little way bless our fellowship together now bless the assembly the trustees the elders Lord the deacons God Brother Juan the pastor and all the saints of God have your way now Lord as we commit oursel to you for service in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen and amen Luke chapter 1 I want to read verse 50 this morning before you have your seats amen let's just back up to verse 49 and 50 Luke chapter 1 verse 49 I hear Pages turning so I'm giving you just a moment to catch it this morning amen Luke for 149 for he that is mighty ha done great done gun sorry for he that is mighty hath done to me great things and holy is his name and his Mercy is on them that fear Him from generation to generation amen may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of the word this morning as you have your seats we'd like by the help of the Lord I thought I would go a different direction but before we got here but then as the service went last night I just feel to continue with that this morning and if you weren't here uh I spoke your condition is not your conclusion and you know we all deal with conditions we all deal with circumstances in life amen but that's not the outcome that's just the condition amen and if we if we take this morning and realize that even in our conditions the mercy of the Lord is on them that fear Him from generation to generation amen I I am a second generation as it were believer this morning amen I never saw brother random physically I never was in the meetings physically amen but just like just like uh amen just like the son of Abraham or the descend of Abraham paid ties in the Lord of his father Abraham I was in the meetings amen so you know I I I I'm just happy to report this morning that I believe this message with all of my heart amen I believe it's sent from God to me the scripture says in Malachi 4 verse 5 and 6 behold I send unto you Elijah the prophet amen so I I believe that with all of my heart God said sent brother Bram for me amen and the message that he brought was for me amen now you know there's a lot of people in church when when the word is going forth and there's something dealing with this or with that or whatever you know they we call them Pitchfork Christians you know you farmer takes the Pitchfork and he moves the hay around and that's what a lot of people think about the word of God they say well that's for brother so and so and that's for s sister so and so let me tell you if it comes across the pull pit you need to hear it amen it may not be affecting you right then but somewhere in your Christian Journey this word of God Amen will will help you and and deal with your situation amen that wasn't in a note so that's free this morning amen but I as I said I'm as it were a second generation amen and my father was and mother was in uh the meetings in Spindale there which is right the town next to us it's just a a little Cotton Mill Town which the cotton Mills are no longer there but uh you know it's just a small town brother Brenham came there 1956 and preached four Services one in the church the crowd was so big they had to move it to a gymnasium and they estimated 3500 people and the police chief of that era told my dad said we we turned way about 3,500 people so uh about 7,000 people wanted to be a part of it 3500 or so were amen and and dad was an usher in those meetings and and as as I think back to that this morning amen I I'm so glad amen that that dad had a had a response people would ask him brother green why did Brother renam come to a little bitty place like this and Dad's response always was he came to get me amen he came to get me and and uh you know I I there was just a handful of people that caught the message and began to follow it that that were in those Services there at at at our little area and you know they they caught it they caught the vision and they begin to run with it amen but here we are this morning and I don't believe it just because my daddy preached it I don't believe it because my mama lived it I believe it because it is a divine revelation to me this morning amen and I thank God for that amen you know a lot of people they they're followers whatever Mama believes the church you know we have people that talk and and worked in in the the secular world we have people well I go to this church and you know I I I kind of see what you're saying but you know my mama went to this church and she played the organ and you know my great Grandpa he bought the pews and and you know so my uncle so and so he put a window in and paid for that and I just can't leave this church well you know if you're hanging on to a church because of a window or a Pew let me tell you you're missing the mark this morning it's not about the windows it's not about the pews let me let me just share with you I was in the Philippines a few years ago amen and uh you know there's a little brother came up to me amen and and he said uh uh he wanted to put walls on his church and you know I uh being a mission-minded and having a heart to try to help uh in in those kind of situations I just asked the little brother I said well what what would it cost to put walls around the church just had a pole Church you know thatch roof I said what would it cost to put uh walls around your church and the little brother responded through brother Sorano The Interpreter and said well it it would take about $120 I thought my God $120 and it just happened to be my birthday so you know what I did I pulled out my wallet and I pulled out $120 I said I'm going to give myself a birthday present I'm going to pay for the walls around that church and it wasn't brick and stucco nothing fancy it was just a a bamboo strips that were woven together and made a a a a mesh material amen but for $120 amen I put walls on a church and gave myself a birthday present amen and and I say that tonight to say this it's not in the fineries of things amen it's not in uh uh great Cathedrals and all of that it's in the living word that's why we come this morning we're not here amen or a fancy structure or or fine fineries of life and the pumpum circumstance amen we are here for the word of God this morning amen so we we just thank thank God for his goodness and blessings today amen now as the scripture tells us in Genesis 17 and7 and I will establish my Covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an Everlasting Covenant to be a god unto thee and to thy seed after thee amen so uh I'm trying to bring this in to show you that God told us in his word amen believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved amen and thy house this morning now a lot of people amen uh they they have kids maybe the kids go Wayward and get away from God away from church amen but I I believe amen we have a promise this morning amen that that if we uh you shall be saved and your house amen so we claim our house now it's not up to us when or how they come amen it's up to God this morning our requirement is to believe his word our requirement is to accept the promise this morning and believe what he said amen because he's not going to start lying now he never has his word says God is not a man that he should lie amen so he'll he he'll keep his word this morning amen and he will be a God to you unto generation and generation going on as as brother one said last night Moses amen told the people amen teach these things to your children and your children's children amen as I said they may Wonder amen but when the seed is planted in there my Bible said teach them when they're young and when they get old they will not depart from it amen so we're so glad Amen to have that generational blessing this morning amen now as we spoke last night and for those of you that weren't here amen I placed the $20 bill up here and I made the promise I'm going to give this $20 bill away I don't have one with me this morning so don't get excited amen I gave them all the way last night amen but I I put that there and I said now I'm going to give that away before this service is over I said now I want you to exercise your faith amen I want you to to realize somebody's going to get that $20 bill good morning are you are you awake this morning okay I just wanted to check I'm just me you forgive me this morning amen but I put that there and I said Somebody's going to get that before we leave the service tonight so I I just preached as best I could and and tried to build faith and I I did it for the little ones Under 12 and I said you know somebody's going to take it home with you amen you just got to let your faith build to come and get it now I want you to realize this morning amen there are many exceeding and precious promises in the word of God Amen and God has done just like I did with a $20 Bill he laid it out there and he said now you come and get it let your faith rise to the place to where you can accept the promises of God where you can receive what God Amen has already given you this morning amen it's up to us to take hold of the promise it's up to us this morning to receive it amen ask for ourself amen now as we as we spoke those things last night and we tried to show amen how important it is to recognize the word of God and recognize amen that it is given to us amen it it's been given to us this morning amen and when we when we recognize amen that we are in need of that promise amen that promise that said uh you shall be saved and your house amen what do we do we don't just say well that sounds good it looks good amen maybe it'll work for the pastor or maybe it'll work for the Deacon no we've got to come to the place to where we say that's my promise amen my children are are are Wayward and I I don't know your lives I don't know your children situation amen but God does this morning amen and and and you know so so he gave us the promise and it's up to us this morning to get out of our seats amen if you will and come to the podium and get the $20 amen get the promise of God to claim your household claim your children claim your husband claim your wife whatever the circumstance may be claim your healing claim your deliverance claim your Victory this morning amen it's already been provided we sing a little chorus it's already done it's already done praise the Lord It's Already Done amen God Amen before the foundation of the world in the mind of God bore the stripes across his back for our healing the Lamb of God was slain before the foundation of the world for our Salvation this morning it's already done we've just got to accept it this morning amen now our our approach this morning amen uh to our conditions or in the middle of our conditions amen our approach to God is very important Amen in the re the the the response that we hear from him amen the condition of your prayer amen it's going to open or close doors amen and I I I must first have gotten the statement I must have caught what was said amen I must have have grasped amen that by faith Enoch amen was translated now we're living in the age of translation this morning we're living in the age of the Rapture Amen in fact we we we realize from the message of the hour amen that we're already in the process this morning amen and and and it's coming down to one morning I'm going to wake up and there's going to be my dad sitting at the table waiting on me to have coffee amen or for me to have coffee and and you know I probably won't when I see him there I'll be picking up my phone and calling brother one amen my dad just appeared to me my mom brother dad this one brother bradam even came by amen you say brother Joe that's a little farfetch no that's the Bible amen when Jesus resurrected many of the saints were seen among the the people there in the city of Jerusalem and I believe God has given us an example of what we are to look for in this hour amen and I believe with all my heart amen that's going going to take place just any day now well look around you look what's happening in the world Wednesday night I believe it was at home I read uh a quote or or or an article and and referred to it amen that right now amen the last vote in the UN that4 Nations have signed off Amen to to to refuse Israel the right to defend themselves 114 Nations amen they've said you you know you can't defend yourself against these enemies that are coming against you amen and do it with with our blessing amen what does the Bible say all nations will turn against Israel let me tell you this morning friend we are we are nearing that time and when they do let me tell you this morning amen this little bride is about to be taken out of here amen oh I tell you saints of God we ought to be the most happiest people on the face of the Earth realizing amen that this world cannot hold us there's something amen that's been birthed inside of us this morning amen that cannot keep us here oh my gravity is holding me here now or I'd be floating around amen but there is something greater that's going could cause me to defy gravity this morning amen oh as as brother no Johnson and our our church he's he's almost 80 and he says I I'm just waiting for the change to take place he's totally white-headed has a big white beard and and you know he he he says I'm just waiting for the change to take place I'm going to lose 50 lbs and 50 years in a second Lord amen I tell you this morning you you look up here and and and you know I know this may be a silly illustration but I'm expecting a change after a while I'm looking for it I'm expecting it or brother Joe you don't need that well one day I will amen and I'm getting ready for it I'm preparing myself but greater than that I want my heart prepared because he's not coming except for those that are looking for him those that are prepared amen and ready for him to come and catch them away amen now as we said I I have first I I must first have gotten the the statement the the the Declaration that God has made in order to release my faith I must believe that he's coming again in order to release my faith amen I must have realized his word has declared I'm coming back for Joe Green brother Ram said put your name in the scripture amen so he's going away he said if I go away I will come again and receive Joe Green unto myself amen now we have to we have to find ourself in the word of God amen now if we don't find oursel in there how can we have faith for what's written amen we have to find our promise so that we can release our faith amen that our condition is not our conclusion amen now uh you forgive me this morning if you think I'm just harping on that too much but I I believe with all of my heart amen that God doesn't want us Amen to be raggy run down worn out people well brother Joel I wish you'd give me a scripture for that I'm so glad you asked me to Jude tells us amen beloved I would above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health even as your soul prospers ERS amen so the main thing this morning is make sure your soul is prospering amen and then let God take care of the rest of these things amen 2 Timothy 3:16 all scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for Doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness that the man of God may be perfect thly furnished unto all good works now a lot of people read that thoroughly furnished but it's not thoroughly it's thly Amen in other words in other words you've got to realize amen that that no matter what the circumstance no matter what the situation God's word has the remedy this morning amen that word inspiration taking it back to the the the concordance and looking up the definition amen it's the opostos and I'm not no Greek scholar so uh just bear with my pronunciation there amen but it means divinely breathe in amen so the word of God is divinely breathe in amen holy men of old wrote as they were in ins ired of God Amen as as God breathed into them these words this morning they wrote it down and we have it here that we can tap in to that inspiration tap in to that Breath of God this morning amen and and let that word come alive in our soul in our Our Lives this morning Amen to bring a manifestation now it also goes back to another Greek word which is the amen of certain or uncertain Affinity they they don't know exactly the origin of it but a deity and especially Amen to the Supreme Divinity amen figuratively a magistrate and there's no greater magistrate or judge than almighty God this morning amen so it's it's exceeding amen abundantly that God would bless you this morning amen now again not thoroughly but thly and that word thly amen taking back to the original XR d tzo uh e x a r t i d zo zo amen it says to equip to accomplish or thoroughly furnish now I want you to realize this morning God has not left us amen with without equipment to fight this battle amen he's given us a two-edged sword that cuts coming and going this morning amen and if we in our faith amen apply the word of God to our situations of life let me tell you there is no weapon that's formed against you that shall prosper because the word of God covers every Avenue of life this morning every sickness every disease every problem every trial that we go through let me tell you there is a verse here amen that will cut the head off of that devil this morning amen if we'll just take the sword of the word and apply it amen a lot of people have the sword but they don't know how to use it amen but I thank God for the message this morning it has showed us how to wield that sword it has showed us when to use it amen when the devil raises his head will the sword hallu now going back to the prayer that Hezekiah prays in 2 Kings 20 verses 2 and three he appeals to God as a son who has not finished his work and bends on the grace of his father to Grant him the time that is needed to be become complete in him now he had a work to do he had something he needed to finish and when God sent the the prophet to tell him set your house in order you're going to die Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and he began to pray he began to call out to God God I i' I've served you all these years I've walked in the precepts of your word amen I I I've done what the prophet has told me and Lord I've got this situation I need I feel I need to to complete it Lord grant me some more time and listen before the prophet got out the courtyard God spoke to him go back and tell him I've added to his life 15 years now we know at the end of that he went astray and so forth but his prayer changed the mind of God now prayer won't change his word but it it can affect your situation amen now take note this morning Hezekiah was told set your house in order you are going to die can you imagine a death sentence but his faith was such that that didn't bother him he asked God for some more time it didn't hinder his faith to believe that God could give him more time Lord it was a condition but it was not the conclusion it was a circumstance but it wasn't the end of the matter it wasn't the conclusion because God added to his time 15 years amen and now I want you to realize he didn't allow amen this condition of impending death amen to distract him from his prayer of faith so tonight whatever are this morning whatever you're going through amen whatever your circumstance don't let that distract you this morning from praying and asking God well my my husband's been a sinner and he's been a drunk he's done this he's done that for all these years and I I just don't know I just I'm just not sure amen don't let that distract you from praying for the Salvation of your husband you get the picture this morning don't let that hinder your prayer of faith amen hanging on to the promise of God that God said You shall be saved and your house this morning now allow me just a moment this morning to let you know that your condition does not control you you control your condition amen you know you you find people in this world and and especially seemed like the last few years it's it's it's gotten worse and this is no uh judgment or anything I'm just making an illustration you know we we and and around home it seems that they're busting people in the homeless and so forth and and and bringing them in there's just more homeless people than I've ever seen in all my life of living there amen but you know I I I know circumstances arise as brother Ram talked about amen the man that we found in the the skidrow and the gutter you know living the life amen he had a high-paying job a good family and all that but overnight or through circumstances he found himself in this situation amen but you know this morning in this land of opportunity you don't have to stay there that's a condition but it don't have to be the conclusion this morning amen you folks maybe I know some of you maybe came through some War torn countries and so forth amen that was a condition but you didn't stay there you changed it and now here you are with a different conclusion this morning amen oh I tell you the saints of God don't you realize amen that we a as the people of God Amen we have been given every opportunity amen don't base the words of the doctor the lawyer or the bill collector don't don't base your faith in that this morning recognize amen that they're presenting to you a condition just like we spoke last night of sister Connor amen you know up in years and the doctor told her just to be basically honest with you TR truly honest with you it was breast cancer the doctor said your sisters have died three or four sisters I forget with this condition and you know you have it now and she looked at the doctor and said bless God I wouldn't have the low down devil she didn't sign for that box of rattlesnakes she didn't accept it she said no sir I'm not having it I will not accept it amen and listen she lived on up into her 90s amen rejoicing and praising God Amen because she didn't accept what the devil tried to give her listen this morning amen you don't have to accept it either you don't have to accept nervousness well you know it was my it was a hereditary thing for my daddy and my my mama and my my sisters have it my brothers have it I guess I'll have it too no no no no no the power of your tongue taking the word of God can say like sister Connor I won't have that low down devil I refuse to accept it that was them that's not me this morning because I believe what the word of God said by his strip I am healed keep my Commandments obey my word and I'll put none of these diseases upon you which I have put upon the Egyptians we don't have to sign for it amen we don't have to accept that condition and the conclusion of a condition that they have have put a a label on a devil but we don't have to accept that devil this morning amen God says in his word the king's heart is in the hand of the Lord as the rivers of water he turneth it withs soever he will I want you to recognize this morning we are not in the hands of a doctor we are in the hands of almighty God Amen we are in the hands of the promises of the word of God this morning amen and God directs your path amen as we read last not Jeremiah 29:11 for I know the plans I have for you God Amen has an expected end for your life this morning amen now as we try to bring this home amen and and get through here this morning amen James 5 and 16 tells us the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much now what we've got to do this morning is to condition ourself to pray effectually now how many knows what effectually means effectually means sufficient to produce a result amen so we have to come to that place brother the one to where we take God at his word and we begin to pray effectually sufficiently amen Faithfully in faith believing amen that what we are asking God for what we are telling him he said in his word amen will apply in our lives amen and it will manifest in our lives this morning amen uh the result will come this morning amen you know I know probably you've heard of our dear friend brother Ron Spencer how many's heard of brother Ron Amen brother Ron spoke our missionary meeting in 2019 he left there went home and began to deal with some situ situations physically and ended up toward the end of the year the doctors told him Mr Spencer you have cancer of the brain amen of of the the lungs and of your lymph nodes amen and before that brother Ron had the Lord to speak to him and say if you will trust me I will use you like never before now I want you to realize this morning he didn't know what was about to happen he didn't know what was fixing to take place he didn't know he was fixing to get uh such a death sentence listen now amen uh the doctors gave him at that point amen two to three months to live 2019 that's five years ago he's preaching this morning [Applause] he's following the doctor's advice he's taking the chemo amen he's doing what they tell him to do he's having all the skins and the test amen but his trust is not in the doctor's ability because the doctor said three to four 2 three 4 months you'll be dead they told him here just recently if you you know they they they keep asking him how long Mr Spencer do you want to continue fighting he said I'll never give up I have confidence that God told me trust me and I'll use you like never before even through all of this his testimony is strong he's still preaching amen he he doesn't let this condition amen hold him back amen he's he's in fact he's going this weekend up to to Saskatoon to preach for brother Kelly hilderbrand or this coming weekend amen a meeting there amen and that's that's his plans amen and and I saw him Thursday evening at a wedding in Virginia amen and and he looks good to look at him you wouldn't think there's a thing wrong with him amen but but you know I've been with him when he's sick I've been with him when he's throwing up all over the place amen because of the the medication and all that he's dealing with amen but his confidence is this is a condition but it is not my conclusion it's not what how the devil is going to take me out of here amen and the devil cannot do anything to me unless God gives him permission his testimony is the devil wants to kill me but he ain't got enough because I'm still here the doctor said amen two three months but five years later he's still carrying the torch amen we have a sister in our church amen has a similar situation finding cancer the doctors when she was first diagnosed told her she had three to four days I believe it was wasn't brother Eric amen that she wouldn't live that's been nearly six months ago well brother Joe what are you trying to say it's a condition it's not a conclusion amen it is something that we have to take the word of God and believe what he said amen now and I said that to get to this point we have to come expecting a positive outcome it said that expectation is the breeding ground for miracles amen Hezekiah didn't just pray to hear himself pray amen he didn't pray amen like so many do this this morning you know we sat down to eat and God is great God is good just a simple prayer just to say that we said our prayer over our lunch amen that's not it he prays diligently amen he prays expecting this morning and we as Believers amen we ought not to just you know the a lot of people they say well say a prayer I don't believe in saying a prayer now I lay me down to sleep I pray the Lord my soul to keep how many children have said that prayer how many parents have taught that to their children and that that's okay you're teaching them the value of prayer amen but when you get an understanding don't repeat a prayer that's not diligently seeking God that's not diligently amen coming to God with EXP expectation it's just a habit anybody home are are you still with me this morning amen I i' I've got a long ways home so let me you know don't don't shut me off just yet amen diligence expecting what you're asking God for to have happened amen now listen Hezekiah didn't know when God would answer but he knew it had to be before he died amen if he had died he' know that God was answer was no but if God restored his life he would have said God said yes hallelujah praise God thank God I'm going to live live a little bit longer amen had to come before he died but I want you to realize only as God can do he gives answers before you're doing your praying I I was relating on the way back to the room last night with brother ju in the car you know my dad was he was just an old country boy he left to trade and you know trade p knives and rifles and and and cars and what whatever he could make a little profit on to help some missionary or something so he loved to listen to the local radio station they had a program called swapping shop and in that program people would call in and say I've got something for sale so much money and here's my number and so forth so dad was listening one day and this gentleman come on there and he said I've got a a Martin guitar I want to sell now dad played the guitar a little bit and he'd had some different guitars over the years but he never had a Martin guitar and if you're familiar with guitars that's one of the better quality ones but he never could afford it never could afford to to buy a new one and so forth so so when he heard this guy his ears perked up and then the guy said I want $200 for this guitar now you just have to know my dad so he listened intently took the number down and and immediately called the gentleman and said you know what what have you got what kind of Martin guitar is it he said well it's a 1965 Martin d18 guitar amen so Dad said well where are you at and he took the address and he said don't talk to nobody else I'm on my way so he got in the car and he ran or drove rather to where the man was at and looked at it and and and the man said I want $200 for it Dad said I'll take it amen so he bought that guitar and and you know when he brought it home then he was sharing with me I played just a little bit and and and he was sharing it with me and oh it just had such a small neck and it Fred so well played so well and and I I tried my best daddy trade with me let me let me have that one and he said no son said I've always wanted one and and couldn't afford it so God has blessed me with this and said when I'm gone on I I'll make sure that it's in the wheel that you get it I said oh all right daddy disappointed like many of us are when God don't give us exactly what we want when we want it amen but he said it's yours when I'm gone said okay so few months went by and I stopped by to see him after work one day Mom was working at the time and and she hadn't got home yet and he said hang around till Mom gets here I got something for for you so when Mom come in he said let's let's go in the bedroom here so we went in the bedroom there and on the bed lay two Martin guitar cases he opened them up he said this is this is the one son that I promised you when I am gone that you can have this guitar and said this is one after after I told you that he said I knew I wouldn't get to see you play it and enjoy it if I waited till I was gone so he said I went down to the local music store and I laid one away and I made payments on it until I could get it out and he said now this one is yours and this one is mine and we both have one I said praise the Lord my inheritance has come early I want you to realize this morning that all of these promises of God are our inheritance and we don't have to wait because our our testator amen he has already died and he left this to us tonight he's already given it to us in his will amen thank God and we don't have to wait any longer it's already ours amen but the story don't end there after Dad went home to be with the Lord mom called me in and said son you know I know the story behind your guitar amen and here's this other Martin said I want you to have it too so guess what amen I enjoyed the benefits of my inheritance and then I got a greater inheritance on top of that so now I have two Martin guitars amen oh I tell you this morning don't you realize it hadn't even entered into the heart of man the things that God has prepared for those that love him amen so the blessing we enjoy here just wait amen as brother juel thorny sings a song won't it be a time amen I'm going to look at my head and my hands looked new I looked at my feets and my feets did too I looked all around and all around did Shine thank God we've got that to look forward to this morning that's right that's right amen Hezekiah was not the only one that conditions or that had conditions as you check the Bible amen and they had expectation that their conclusion would be great what is expectation it's nothing more than having faith to believe God for a testimony amen do you realize that a testimony cannot be had unless there is a test amen unless you go through something this morning you can't testify of how God brought you out amen unless I had been without a job as I referred to last night I couldn't have had that testimony of what God did for me amen and and he told me what if I what if I prepared this for you amen and and and such a a great thing in my mind Amen in my thinking I'm just so grateful for what God has provided this morning amen now as we said expectation is nothing more than having faith in God Amen to to believe God for your testimony Revelation 12:1 tells us and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony amen and they love not their lives unto the death it doesn't matter amen man because they they knew God was going to bring them through they didn't know how they didn't know when they didn't know what the circumstances would be but they had faith in God that he would bring them through this morning amen overcoming conditions by the blood of the lamb and Romans 4:17 and calling those things which be not as though they were I mentioned last night one my three sisters that worked in the pharmacy with me amen the one sister my eldest sister amen she she would come by and she would be going through some struggles of life and situations she didn't know what to do and and you know we would we would just right there in my little office we would agree and pray and that just ask God to move in the situation and and you know I would I would remind her amen your faith is the bridge that you walk on until God brings the bridge into reality your faith in God Amen is what brings the solution to your troubles until it's manifested Amen so as we quoted last night as well faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen amen so we realize our faith amen and listen what what did Brother ROM tell us real faith says it's already done it it's already completed it's already accomplished so as we referred to last night amen we are already in that other dimension in our theophanies but what we've got to do is have faith that God's going to bring this flesh amen and change it and move it into that theophany state this morning amen now as we kind of wind down this morning we got to realize our conclusion is not based upon the condition right our our no matter what our condition may be it is not the conclusion now I know we have to have the condition to get the conclusion I know we have to have the circumstance the trial the test to come out a winner on the other side but I I I want you to realize what the word has declared we are more than conquerors through him that loved us and and gave himself for us amen there is nowhere in the scripture that God refers to us as losers God calls us Overcomers amen and he said in in the Book of Revelation there to him that overcometh eth that is continually overcomes let me tell you this morning in life we have trials well maybe maybe you all don't have the problems we have on the East Coast maybe you all are living Angelic lives and everything's just Blissful and happy and no worries no problems N I don't think so don't fool yourself amen Paul said you be as I am for I am as you are if we got problems on the East Coast you got problem up here in the Midwest amen and and you know what we got to do is recognize it's just conditions it's just circumstances but it's not the conclusion amen because the conclusion is amen that we fear God we keep his Commandments and we know that he will not lose one of his own amen and he with every Temptation every test every trial he has already made a way of Escape amen now your condition may be drugs and and I pray that that's none here maybe alcohol again I pray none here it may be smoking maybe drinking amen uh it may be sex it may be lust it may be pain it may be abuse whatever your condition this morning that is not not the conclusion amen it may [Applause] be it may be some Doctrine that's going around that's trying to deceive you and draw you away from the balance of the message listen this morning friend this message is balanced amen so many men my brother have tried to to lean it this way they've tried to lean it that way they've tried to add their interpretation to the interpreted word of God I'd like to tell you the interpreted word has already been interpreted and it don't need another interpretation what we need to do amen you know that there's well let me say it this way what we need to do is get into the message hear what the prophet has said now I I'm not for putting the tape player up here to be your Prophet your pastor that's not it hear what I say that's not it amen heard one service late in brother brenham's Ministry he ordained about 13 to 14 preachers right in a row amen and he told him to go preach this message go preach the gospel amen and nowhere in there was there a tape recorder that that was ordained he didn't lay his hands on a tape recorder and said I ordain you to preach the gospel don't take me wrong I want us to hear the message of the hour I want us to read the books I want us to hear the tapes but you need brother one you need him a tape recorder well I can't say that started to say a tech recorder can't marry your children but they they do that oh my you know brother BR made the statement he said it wasn't a mystery how that Martin Luther could stand in his day the mystery was that he could overcome all the fanaticism that went with his message I want you to understand that's where we are today amen this message is real this message is truth this message has been sent to prepare me for a Rapture amen I trust you feel the same way and I believe you do this morning it was sent to dress me in the Garment of the word this morning Amen to take me in a Rapture amen well that wasn't in the notes either brother one so you know that's just extra no extra charge amen listen we just come through a a big ordeal of uh in in our area especially of of those that have backed away from the message and said you know I can't trust it I can't believe it I I I just don't see it anymore let me tell you that is a lie of the devil amen we have been given a message amen and listen today friend you know they they they say well I can't prove this and I can't prove that amen I I I I can't find a record of it let me tell you this morning friend amen there's things in this Bible that for thousands of years they couldn't find a record of but now they're finding a record Amen in archaeology and so forth they're seeing the things that were mentioned in the bible they're real amen they're finding archaeological records of it today but I want you to understand amen how do I know this message is real because it chained me right here right here is the result of this message don't don't take what somebody said and listen and and again this ain't in the notes I hope it's all right amen you know that Spirit that's behind that movement it is a bad Spirit there's there's some in our church that that they were they were you know encouraged to listen to certain certain men that that were giving their testimonies of why they left the message and so forth amen and as they begin to listen to that amen their testimony is that I felt the most awful Spirit coming out of that it wasn't a live Ministry but it was a a video amen and they said I felt the most awful ungodly Spirit coming out of that and said I quickly turned it off I said you did the right thing you didn't need to listen to it in the first place praise the Lord that ain't in the notes but I want you to understand this morning if that comes up on your your search amen about the message turn it off quickly because that it it's inspired of Hell to deceive men and women amen and try to get you distracted from the true events that has taken place in this hour amen as I telling brother one my dad amen and mom and my Uncle Albert and a lib amen they traveled all up and down the East Coast they heard Roberts and Cole and Allan and and the Jones and and and and and all the great preachers of the day anywhere they could hear orl Roberts and TL osbor they they heard all of them and were in the meetings and and and so forth and and and you know as they heard them preach and that you know they they preached what they knew what they understood amen but when brother mam came to Spindale in 1956 my dad and mom was there and dad said when whenever brother bham came through the door before he even said evening friends dad said I found myself just Weeping at the presence of God that was with brother brandom amen he said when I he said I hadn't felt that with Roberts and osbor and Thea Jones and and and you know all the Great Men all the great preachers of the day he said I never had that experience before but when that little man came through that door before before he said evening friends he said I I I was just so moved by the presence of God it wasn't that little Kentucky hillbilly it was the god that he represented it was the god that stood by his side amen and did the Miracles and did the sign that did the Wonders amen that's in that Pillar of Fire that's out in the picture there that God is what made such an impression this morning amen not to say that those other men weren't doing great works and and God was working through them him amen but there was something more with this little prophet of God Amen and from that time in April 1956 from that time Dad started following the ministry of brother bam and started catching the Revelation amen and listen he believed it with all of his heart and his condition of being you know a manf follower if you will and and I don't say that disrespectfully because he never was connected with any denomination or organization thank God Amen he just felt that wasn't right and he didn't join up amen but he he he found something that was real and I want you to understand this morning this message is real amen it it's reality it's not some man-made theology or idea let me tell you you listen to the tapes and you hear brother manam talk about the scientific things and the the astronomical things and you know the the things from history a man with a seventh grade education had the knowledge and ability to put all those things together I'm here to tell you it wasn't his seventh grade education it was the inspiration of the Holy Ghost the inspiration of this message that had to bring the loose ends together to bring it all to a point Amen to where we could see that that condition wasn't our conclusion this morning amen we're the condition of denomination it wasn't our conclusion the condition of church entity it wasn't our conclusion the CH the condition of religiosity that wasn't our conclusion this morning our conclusion was that we come out of her my people and we are separate sayith the Lord amen that we have been called out Amen to be called in to the body of Christ this morning amen United Together by The Living Word of God this morning amen that is alive in our hearts and lets us know amen that there is a God Amen that lives and abides forever this morning amen go God says that's not your cond conclusion it's just a trick of the enemy to make you feel that you'll always be bound by your condition amen remember God said through the mouth of the Apostle Paul 2 Corinthians 4:17 for our light Affliction which is but for a moment it worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal way of glory amen now I want you to understand amen the afflictions that Paul is SPO speaking about there are conditions amen but but what they're doing is they're working a more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory this morning amen listen brother B spoke about the the chicken egg that the eagle egg rather that was farmer needed another egg for a setting and he got the egg out of the Eagle's Nest and he put it under the hen and it hatch with all the other little chicks amen and and as that eagle be to grow something about him was different than the chicks something about him was different than the Rhode Island Reds and and and you know and the Americas and all of those little chicks something was different his voice was different his walk was different amen his his his mentality was different they eat those worms they eat that old grain I'm looking for something that has some substance to it I'm looking for something that's real alive amen so one day as that little chicken grew or that little Eagle rather grew amen thinking he was a chicken being told he was a chicken being told amen you you belong here with us you you may not look like us but you're you're one of us go go with us down to the Barnyard and PE Peck the Grain and I I just can't stomach that but one day he heard a voice and that eagle scream flying out that Mama Eagle looking for her baby amen he heard that and I'm not going to try to scream like an eagle but he heard that amen and he looked up where did that come from where did that come from and he caught it amen and he heard her scream out again come up high amen come up come a little deeper into the word and come a little little further into the walk with God amen and and he said oh I'm I'm in this system I'm I'm bound here no that's just a condition that's not your conclusion this morning amen flap Them Wings oh I tell you little e let's flap our wings this morning amen and recognize we're not chickens in the barnyard we are eagles amen and what is an eagle an eagle is a ripper with the beak this morning amen he takes that live prey and he begins to rip the the meat and begins to eat it oh don't you realize God wants us this morning Amen to take the meat of the word amen and with our Holy Ghost speak began to rip it apart and to digest it this morning because we are eagles and not chickens he jumped up on the fence post oh keep flapping Them Wings you can do it amen and the next thing you know he got caught in the wind amen we send a little course set your wings on the Winds of Faith you were born for a higher plane amen and on and on it goes and I can't remember all of it but the Ender hinder part of it the end of it amen it talks about set your wings and don't you realize amen the power that's in the Wind of the Holy Ghost that's what's going to take you to the heavens this morning that's what's going to allow you to soar set your wings amen so let me encourage you this morning set your wings in the promises of the word your condition amen is not your conclusion your conclusion is that you're soaring through the heights of the heavens amen without your effort amen it's just the wind of the Holy Ghost that's leading you higher and higher into the depths of the word this morning amen oh I tell you Saints the more I look at this word the more I study it the more I realize it had to be God Amen the more I read the message it had to be God because there was a people that were called for his name's sake that needed that Heavenly Mana to come and strengthen them for that body change amen Moses had a condition he was a murderer he ran for his life amen he looked this way and he looked that way and when he saw that there's no man he slew the Egyptian and he hid him in the sand but then he went to the backs side of the desert and he had an experience with God after 40 years yes amen that's why we don't need to give up this morning we need to keep pressing we need to keep praying we need to keep believing for our family and our loved ones amen it was his condition but not his conclusion he became the Savior to the Jews use being an instrument to deliver them out of Egypt's bondage non had a condition he was a leper I'm trying to get it all in here this morning and I'm just about done amen but being a leper there was a little servant girl taken captive oh my it don't matter where you're at this morning you may be you know a servant girl you may work in the in in in the halls of Parliament and the state C Capital you may be there but I want you to realize you're there for a reason as a daughter or son of God God has placed you just like I my testimony last night what if I arranged this for you God put me there for a reason amen that we might be a help to so many amen and and that that that man amen could be good to this member of the Bride maybe you know he never did see the message he never did understand how we could know all you people from different parts of the world Amen but you know I tried to tell him it's because of a message it's because of a word amen but you know brother one it may be what he done for me that gives him eternal life at the great judgment amen God may may say Henry Leonard it's your time to be judged and he'll come forth amen and you know just like we brother Brenham had the dream you know of going there and standing at the great judgment and and Jesus came out and said father he stood for me on Earth and I stand for him you know maybe I'll get the opportunity father he was good to me and he helped me to go to the mission field and different things and said now I'm standing for him we we just don't know amen the Bible teaches us give a he that giveth a cup of water in the name of the Lord will not lose his reward oh let me tell you God is so good this morning amen as we as we wind up in the message thirsting for life brother bam said so you see the same God was with Florence Nightingale there is the same God that's right here he's the same one the only thing you don't have to wait to be prayed for the only thing you have to do is just believe the work is done if you're a sinner you don't have to wait for an altar call right where you are sitting amen while Peter yet spake these words the Holy Ghost fell on them that heard the word they were ready it's a condition of the heart it's a condition of the people now right now if there's a sick person here you don't have to remain sick till I even read the scripture brother bam said you can be healed right now because you are healed the only thing the scripture would do would be a witness to say that Jesus said it and if the Holy Spirit would come tonight and give a great calling here and called out different people that wouldn't mean they were healed it would only just lift up the faith of the people amen that they can accept their healing that's already been purchased for them you understand it now see that's what healings for amen listen brother R I'm telling those people you're so and so you did this you got this situation and and and all the things up to as many as 14 or 17 different things to one individual that wasn't what healed them they were already healed all that was doing was building their faith to accept what God had already done these things that we've rehearsed to you last night in this morning it's not to heal you or not to bring your conclusion but to give you Faith tonight amen or this morning to recognize God has already given you an expected end amen God bless you this morning amen would you just stand with us pise the Lord amen may as we bow our heads this morning maybe you're here today and you've got a condition and you know it it can't be your conclusion there's got to be something more there's got to be something of Deliverance of healing of Victory would you just slip up your hand and say brother Joe pray pray for me in my situation I I I don't want this to be my conclusion and I don't believe it is would would you just as we pray this morning hold your hand before the Lord and say Lord the preacher has preached and God he has declared that my condition is not my conclusion maybe you've never accepted the Lord Jesus that's a condition but it don't have to be your conclusion may you just recognize amen that I can hear the Savior calling I can hear him say to me you're in that condition but you don't have to remain amen Lord Jesus this morning as we have our hands raised and Lord we recognize sickness depression oppression God disease and affliction it's just conditions a lost toate lord it's just a condition but God we're believing this morning by the promises of your word that it's not our conclusion and we're expecting Lord the power of the supernatural God to sweep through this building this morning Lord and minister to every need and every life oh God this morning God if there's one here that would like to come and have hands laid upon them we'll do that this morning we believe amen they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover it's it's a proven fact this morning but God as we hear your word and we accept it God we believe it this morning oh God move us beyond our conditions to our conclusion of a healing touch of the almighty God grant it today Lord God we commit these two little Services into your hands accomplish Lord what you will God you know in our little country boy way we never dreamed we'd fly halfway across the country and preach to a a group of Believers but Lord in your great Providence God our thoughts of of no thoughts about it Lord that was our condition but the conclusion is you sent us here Lord and God even whenever we first made the arrangements and the schedule the timing to come you began to deal with my heart to minister these thoughts today Lord last night and I pray today Lord God that that that you would just move in the midst of the people minister to them Lord and God let them be able to send word of a testimony of what you have done granted father we commit it to you now Lord Jesus and ask you almighty God to overshadow each and every one today Lord and minister to their needs we pray Grant it father we thank you for it now we believe it Lord God if one wants to come this morning or 10 wants to come or
