========================================

[Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] to lot you 25 years you're not going to get feeble you be able to go and I'm going to lot you 25 years on Earth would you take from from birth to 25 or from 25 to 50 50 to 75 or 75 to 100 now any man is looted any time on Earth will certainly do a most rational thing if you don't spend that time in service of God I don't care what he does if you're going to be a heartbreak for the women or so forth you better take that young age that first 25 if you're going to be a carpenter a mechanic or something you better take the second 25 see but I was thinking about what about me what would I take I'd take from 75 to 100 I'd be smarter wiser I'd be more settled I know more about what I'm doing I'm 10 eight or 10 years older than the last time I was overseas I won't jump in like I'm killing snakes I know more about it too I know how is it like a dog fighting the see you know about how to take a hold of you don't jump in there scatch you up know his tricks and watch him what he does and we learn more about the enemy so we've got to find out all his techniques and how he approaches and what he does learn his punches and you're trained to go on you see so I believe now I told life I believe I'm better shape out of us when it's 40 years old and one over I'm 54 now I believe if I live and can still get around as good as can not when I'm a 100 if I if Jesus would carry that long I'd be in better shape than I am now to go because you know more about it you know more about what to do and how to handle it how to handle the situation take a lot of people out if you're going to get operated on say say a new doctor just graduated the other day and just come out of medical school you never had an operation yet let him do it oh no you say nothing to it not that guy no sir yet I don't want him putting no knife on me I'd really to go down here and get so and so I know he's had a lot of operations he knows how to do it that's that's you think about this but what about that soul I want somebody who knows where they're at know the road who's traveling yes indeed Lord bless you all right brother n get up here now God bless brother n don't forget now next time I was just uh had a surprise in my heart for the thing because in myself I had recognized I esteemed the min Ministry of my many Brethren outside of there before brother Brandon come I said I don't know is he'll Minister tonight I was talking to Dr Lee ve here and I said I was in the meeting at Middletown Ohio and you were the one that talked through the day and I said I deeply appreciated the meeting along with the teaching at brother veale did over there in conjunction with the meeting at Middletown yes and I said I esteem the Servants of God and uh one of us I said whoever preaches it always does the other one good because the ministry is all inspired by the same spirit amen and uh there isn't any any selfishness or ambitiousness in me and I Delight to welcome the Ministers of God especially who are cooperating together with this and in it together with us I Delight to hear from them amen so I asked Dr Lee Vale I said would you Minister if brother brandham doesn't brother brandham didn't he might have known this didn't say anything and so I asked brother Vale tonight if he would Minister for us in case that brother brandham didn't because he's associated with him in the meetings and he knows about the way this way and we're glad to have brother Veil I appreciate him and respect him as well as I do any of the other ministers and like I do all the others so if he will come tonight and speak for us I'd be delighted to have him to do it God bless and let's pray for brother Vale some of you have never heard him and I trust that you'll pray for him I apologize to you audience I didn't know sat there did this was fixed up God bless you brother the day it wasn't fixed up he said if you didn't come came good that's fine I can hear him myself brother B spoke him anytime IE of in the meetings and and so forth he managed the meetings for a long time and fine Brother done a swell job and I'm sure this audience is always glad to hear Brother B when he speak Lord blessy so much was said uh I couldn't say nothing to make it any better and I truly believe that it was the Lord that worked this out for brother Veil to bring this man amen after this morning yes so do I you see it has to work that way we we accept that from God yes well there's so many things he saying I I I have 20 sermons go down here off what he said I was thinking here of one little illustration to back up what he said now we look at this watch to find out what time it is unless that every instrument in that watch is coordinating one with the other we'll never know the correct time amen is that right yeah and that takes all of us all together if we want to see the third pool really do something for God it's coordination with every one of us together to Humble ourselves before God and confess our wrongs and pray and believe God for these things I truly believe that what brother Bale said is the truth that God will never put his spirit in un holy unrighteous disobedient temples it's got to come in the the way of the cleansing of our hearts from all G and iniquity that we might be pure before God that he might work his pure Holy Spirit through us to bring these things to pass I I think that when you go home tonight if you would read that little book of Jude you just learn a whole lot now of what brother Bale has said and he said and I earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the saints that got away from it how a man of corrupt mind and and so forth to come in and begal him away from the from the real things of God and God can only operate as we let him operate and so many wonderful things about saying you know people are want power and really they don't know what power is amen they don't really know what what what goes with it the the Way Up Is Down always you if you want Power see how humble you can get just get away from all your worried thinking and humble yourself before God and then you got more power than the man that runs all over the building and makes a big lot of noise because you have been able to conquer yourself and commit yourself to Christ see to humble yourself before him that's really power you show me a church that's humbled real humble not a a irant a church just a sweet humble church I'll show you a church that has the favor and power of God Amen that's right that's the thing it takes hum humility huming ourselves before God letting God just work to us don't have to make a lot of noise uh sometimes as the farmer said he went out to the field with his wagon and every time he hit a bump it just rattled and went on but when he come back he hit the same bup didn't make no noise at all because it's loaded with good things so I think that's about right that we get filled up with the good things of God that the fruit of the spirit might be known through us as he referred so much to First Corinthians 13 there how that though I get my body be burnt and have all these things and have not charity it's nothing profits mean nothing you see we want to do that above all things it's our individual Souls that we're responsible before God see it's it's you going to have it it isn't whether I go or he goes It's You Going see it you first and you've got to look this out and come sweet before the Lord and I've always found out that the man that humbles himself is a man that God exalts when you take a person with his chest out knows everything and you can't tell him nothing and he's arrogant and and well that that's a person that never gets anywhere but you take that person that humbles themselves and walks sweetly I was talking to a man to a date just organized the church up at the uh uh pulled out of an organization that had been uh what brother Bose and then church where they they had that great church there for so long and the Lord is Blessing and the people got to a place that they want to polish up like the rest of them and want to throw it into an organization and when they did it just those humble Christians in there did not want that all their life had been taught against it so they walked away from it now they've got a group and the Lord has blessed them until they're coming in up into a big place now again bought a church now that puts up about 4 5,000 people and they're starting over and they come to me and said brother BR sitting right there in in the office of the church office the other day and he said uh one of the leaders that the Closs and them said what must we do I said find a man to be the Shepherd that has no reputation in all denomination just a real good Janine sweet humble brother that lives Alive God will take care of the rest of us I said a good pastor that feed the sheep and be hung and than God will do the rest if you not some big know it all is coming he's going to put this in order and this has to be this way and cutting things eyes it'll never work you just got through it that's it every piece in the church must work together and you must keep up your part of it so we can see what time we're living in we may be closer than we think we are now we appreciate brother the veil don't we amen Lord bless you brother thank you and we thank the Lord for bringing this great message to us tonight and this uh got a note a few minutes ago one of the sisters and had something she wanted to tell in a dream of you just write it out tell me sister I um The Giver some dreams that has been absolutely true we don't accept all dreams no no but when they of God we want to know it it's God talking to it like everything speaks the tongues we don't believe it but when there's an interpretation comes that tells us something that's going to happen we see it happen and we thank the Lord for see we want to keep it running smoothly sweetly in an order uh of the Lord so just remember that your part may be the main spring or it may be the little uh some little hand or some little part of the winding stem whatever it may be or it may be the hands on the face the clock it tells the time but whatever it is it takes us all working together in harmony with the Gospel of Jesus Christ to bring this to fa just think if gifts is so great what we call power and Paul said though I have faith that I can move them on and have not charity I am nothing amen amen think of that and though you say well though I I understand I wish trying know the Bible though I understand all the mysteries of God see and still though I could do it and have not charity I I'm nothing see I haven't got no wor yet see the main thing is love God and humble yourself with it I surely uh after all these years on the field and around the world and seen different people I ought know a little bit about the gate to enter in at and if you want to get somewhere with God never let a irran spirit ever come around you don't let No Malice come in no matter what anybody's done if they are wrong don't you never build up a complex against that person see you'd be sweet and kind remember God loved you when you were in sin and if the spirit of God's in you you love the other person when he's in wrong just pray for them and love one another above everything love God and love one another and be humble with God and around one another and God will bless us and it's hard tell what he will do usually when Church begins to get in numbers and get to getting a little bigger or something like that then they get away from that real things the real things you know what brought these things to pass when I first started the Lord appeared to me down the river and told me that his brother B saw that I believe in the paper in Canada many years ago where that angel of the Lord appeared on the river down there is on the social sh press Mystic light over a local minister of wild bapti and and you know what did that when we had the tent meeting just across the street a tent that seated about or 2 200 people ministers come from a war and said brother come here minut not just a boy but or just a kid and he said how do you keep those people in one Accord they love one another till they I never seen people love one another that's the Lord that's what this church was established upon that Godly brotherly love for one another I see them even shake hands to one another leaving the place and cry like babies believe one another they love one another that well and I could go to their house to visit them and times the Bible was laying open and stain with tears coming at night time where fathers and mothers was gathered together and their little children around on the floor kneeling around and fathers and mothers on their knees crying and praying stand at the door and wait and wait and wait and they didn't stop praying I just sat down on the steps and start praying myself waiting for see and that that was and they love one another they love one another we used to stand and sing that old song blessed be the ti that binds our hearts in Christian love a fellowship of kindered mind is like to that above when we are Sunder part it gives us inward pain but we shall still be Jin in heart and hope to meet again I say this with great joy in my heart to Christ life many of them are sleeping around in these Graves marks and I waiting for that great Resurrection where we'll meet together again let not that Spirit ever depart from this place if it ever does then I don't care how eloquent your pastor might be how well he might bring the word of God the spirit of God is grieved away when we can have all things in Fellowship in common love one another then God will work with us and we're keeping time that the people come by and say if you want to see a church that's really a church that really loves God dropping up there at that Tabernacle one time and watch them look at the care they have for one another the respect when the gospel is being preached how rever how everything just in order that's then they can look and see what time we're living you'll see the spirit of God moving among you great signs and wonders and things will be taking place if the things working together it's telling the time but if it isn't working then time is stopped it won't tell the time no more so if we want to know what time time we're living just start everybody working together in the gospel loving one another loving God and the hands itself will tell the time what we're amen do you believe that amen amen the Lord bless you real richly don't forget now get around this week and if you know any the sick people it's coming in tell them when he come say dear I uh I want to ask you we're having a prayer for the sick Sunday morning over the Tabernacle and um you've been sick for a while now one well I want to go of always want to go now I just heard a message Sunday night from a brother there that how we must confess our faults one to another and pray one for another that we might be healed James 5:14 13141 15 that we must confess our fals one to another before we even come for him confess our fals one to another and pray one for the other see see that this exactly what he's talking about tonight brings back the Beatitudes in with Mark 16 blend that together you've got it then healings take place look at Jesus nothing but one bundle of Love see he was God manifested he God expressed himself through it no wonder Miracles and things happen his humble lives and consecrated life to come from to from being God to be a man here on Earth to express God to himself that's what made him what he was I've always said what made Jesus God to me was the way he humbled himself he was so great and a small that's right the Lord bless you real good now let's stand up and for the dismiss um let's just try that you might not know sister that bless be the ti let's sing that one time will you give [Music] us [Music] now while we sing his last ver let's take over one of hands when we have
