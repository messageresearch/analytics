the day long this is my story this is my song praising my Savior all the day long how to do you hey man this is my soaring story this is my song praising my Savior all the day long any man praise the Lord you know I remember brother David right when he was up here he's happy to wear his glasses and he'd always be putting him on taking him off and I'm think I'm starting to get the revelation what that is so me ma'am how did he yeah you know I was telling sister Carol yesterday afternoon it would have been nice to set something up so we could have her sitting at the piano and at home that brother Wesley sitting next door he could hold the phone while she sang a special but we haven't quite got there yet so aim and I know that they are having good progress on the remodeling and the church and still a little bit little ways to go yet so and of course you may have heard I think it was on Saturday afternoon governor walls had a very special session to announce that that churches could actually start opening up a little bit and and have services together so a little bit of limitation on there yes all we were preaching brother booth we are teasing brother blot a thought you have to have two or three services and we could just have one group coming for each one you can just go from one to the next to the next so I he would just get warmed up on the first group and then really get into with the second group and probably wrap it up with the third group so but we'll see what happens amen hallelujah amen well let's go right to prayer this morning I trust that you're already having a good day today that you're anticipating what the Lord would do we've had some wonderful services all my saints of God and I'm sure we have something special in store for us today not because of brother blah T or good singing or anything like that those things are all fine but because our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ before the foundation of the world knew that each and every one of us would be where we're at today dialing into this service a man do you think God was surprised about Kovac 19 and the fact that we have to broadcast remotely he knew before the foundation of the world Amen exactly what was going to happen but yet he still has made a provision for us any man to be able to have him break the bread of life to us this morning so as we go to prayer is anything too hard for God is there something that you have on your heart I need that you have I know there's a number of brothers still looking for work God hasn't forgotten about you I just want to say that if you've got sickness God hasn't forgotten you he's still mindful for mindful of you you've got burdens for loved ones that aren't saved yet God hasn't forgotten that and he's already said that he won't lose a one so as we go to prayer that's go to him confidently in prayer knowing that he is able saints of God praise the Lord let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord as we gather here together or

service to you in Jesus name we pray Amy Amy praise the Lord praise the Lord thank you Jesus Amy thank you sister Naomi praise the Lord ask chapter one let's go back amen praise the Lord praise Lord I hope by His grace we can be able to go through this but I would encourage you I was if if you will never add a lot to your Bible reading if you can just encourage yourself by reading through the box of book of Acts and we want to continue from where we stopped on Wednesday night a revelation of Jesus Christ now remember this Christ in the truth church is the continuation of the book of Acts praise the Lord and what we were trying to bring out of their subject was to show you how that after the Holy Ghost came on the date of Pentecost and God pour out his spirit and he was going to use common men not only the 12 disciples or the tour of apostle's but he also used men and women that dedicated himself and if the truth church is going to be the continuation of the book of us it means that God is still going to use common people the Bible says the common people heard him gladly if the common people hear him gladly why not he used the common people praise the Lord so that's why we want to continue on this morning by the grace of God as chapter 1 let us read praise the Lord the formal treaty have I made oh dear Phyllis - of all that Jesus began both to do and teach until the dead in which he was taken up after that he true the holy girls have given commandment unto the Apostles whom he have chosen Allah bless you have your seat we continue to read to whom also he show himself alive after his passion by many infallible Pro being seen of them forty days and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God praise the Lord we have to realize that the kingdom of God like I said their language the kingdom of God was never used until the time of the New Covenant John the Baptist was the first person I used that phrase repent for the kingdom of God is at hand when Jesus came he took the same message from John repent for the kingdom of God the kingdom of heaven is a hymn praise the Lord and verse full and being assembled together with them commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem but wait for the promise of the Father we say he he have heard of me for John truly baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence when they therefore will come together they acts of him saying Lord will down at this time restore again the kingdom of Israel now Jesus John were introducing the kingdom of God the kingdom of heaven these Jews high in their mind the promise of the Kingdom of Israel which is the kingdom of David so yeah yeah are these Jews sitting on a a John ministry with Jesus Jesus and saying they're giving parable the kingdom of heaven is like unto ten virgins he gave the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that made of he's preaching days but all in your mind they are thinking about the Kingdom of Israel but that promise of the Kingdom of Israel was a promise for the Millennium where Jesus will rule as the son of David back on the trail yeah he's trying to introduce a spiritual Kingdom to them sorry let me drink water yeah yeah he's trying to introduce a spiritual Kingdom to them and they are almost set in their name and in your mind they are thinking about oh yes oh yeah yes we've seen that the Ministry of the Messiah Indian mind they are thinking about oh yeah we will conquer these Romans and and we will kick them out of this place they are thinking about a physical Kingdom when his message is all about a spiritual Kingdom and I think that's the simplest were the church the church is in the day that we are living in when the people preach and talk about prosperity and talk about God's blessing it's all about natural things how you would give us money how you would give us car when actually the blessings of the Lord is spiritual blessings their wishes the baptism of the holy gold that gets all ready for the kingdom of God it does not means that God will not bless us physically but actually his blessings and spiritual blessings restored again the qidan to Israel and he said unto them it is it is never for you to know the times or the seasons which the father have put in his own power no man nor the day and the hour he says here but ye shall receive power after the Holy Ghost is come upon you and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in Judea and in Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth and when he has spoken these things did why they beheld he was taken up and a cloud received him out of their sight now as we said on Wednesday night this record that is given to us is a record of our beloved physician look I will beloved brother praise the Lord wish of course he was not normal among the twelve he was not at he was not one of the 12 apostles this man he was not an eyewitness but he was someone that was able to gather the testimony of the different eyewitnesses and he was able to put them together and give us a report now we realized that none of the gospel really bring out this part of of Jesus's testimony and why they look stiff as to was heaven verse 10 as he went up behold two men stood by them in white apparel which also said Ye men of Galilee why stand ye gazing up into heaven they same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven then returned there unto Jerusalem from the mount called olive which is from Jerusalem a Sabbath day's journey and when they will come into coming they were up into an upper room where a ball both fitted in James and John and Andrews and Philip and Thomas and you see right here Luke is not giving us the record of all of those disciples and the men and women that were in the upper room but as you listen to his testimony he's not telling you that I was one of them in the upper room he's telling you this is a true witness he's telling you of those that were in the upper room he's giving us first him report because he received these testimonies from the disciples verse 14 these all continued with one Accord in prayer in supplication with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus and wave his brethren praise the Lord I've stopped right there for the reading of the word and then we will we will go right into this now I want to bring something here from the message the testimony of a truth witness rubber number actually read it's very same scripture that we read to preach this message the testimony of a true witness he says now a testimony a person has to have an experience before they can testify praise the Lord a person have to have an experience before they can testify now Burt Scott is almost like I'm giving you a testimony and I'm telling you brother Scott this is what happened as you are listening to me and grabbing the words just like what he'll do I said she had an experience listening to brother Branham speaking about those scars if she never had an experience she would not be inspired because she was not the only one in the room there were men and women all sitting down in the room listening to his testimony but it affected her it impacted her that is the experience that a true testimony brings it impacts you so much you hear about somebody praying and getting an answer it affects you so much until you break down and you start crying to God that I believe you are the same if you did it for this person you can do the same for me a person have to have an experience before they can testify if you were called in court you didn't have to ask gave a testimony you have to know something before you can testify then he also talks about a witness he said and a witness is a person who have seen something praise the Lord who have seen something take a thing about it Andrews there is not a book of Andrews there is not a book of Thomas praise the Lord all of these men they saw something Thomas saw he was the one that put his hands in the print of Jesus but you see even with with all the things they experienced there is a naught of Jairus daughter open it the blind man as he's in John chapter 9 Jesus telling Peter to put it pushes both all of those things that they experienced you have to realize that it had to bring God has to bring a man to a place if you sit down with Thomas he will tell you what he experienced but he was not just inspired and blessed to write a report like Matthew day to write a report like Matt did to write a report like John did but they have seen something a person who have seen something that know that it is truth but bamse Yuma you should see all you have heard it for you to be a witness praise the Lord and the to give witness and then a witness must know what he's talking about he must not be someone told me a setting setting think he must be a witness himself if net he is speaking on someone SS there could be a witness at the same praise the Lord yeah so we realized here Luke giving this report that he has gathered from these apostles went to different ones went down to the Mary I mean I had the belief he spoke with the women you know just like generation book you know gather all of these testimony compare testimonies with testimonies just to be he had the burden he was the man God anointed him for there we will not have a book of us we wouldn't have known what topless on the day of Pentecost even though he did not come himself number and mourn then they were in the upper room but yet he brought us a wrecker praise the Lord Amen oh because I believe that after the Holy Ghost fell there were more and more that received the Holy Ghost and in in different ways the Spirit of God was moving on the earth at that time and people that had their heart open and and were ready to be able to receive the Apostolic message God was visiting them with the Holy Ghost if God who have just given us a record of how many people believe they received the Holy Ghost around that time we will not have a book but the scriptures gave us three principal way that the Holy Ghost came why Peters speak the word or as chapter 2 experience why Peters speak the word and also the laying on of hands praise the Lord I mean God display it that way so we cannot be like Pentecostal church and only way to speak in tongues before we believe that we can receive the Holy Ghost we can receive the Holy Ghost in our home from the receiving of the word it's receiving the word is the heart ready to receive God's Word praise the Lord and if the devil is is blasting your mind and he keeps condemning you and you don't feel like you have the Holy Ghost we can bring some man filled with the Holy Ghost and we can lay our hands on you and break you through that experience it's all Pentecost those men were in there in in in the room I don't want to go ahead of myself but they were in in the upper room like Luke said they were in the upper endoscopy is they were all in the upper room waiting for the promise they did not know how it would come they were just waiting preparing themselves I can tell you one secret of the Holy Ghost one secret of the Holy Ghost is that you should be in constant preparation but constant repentance you should have a heart of repentance praise the Lord amen God will never buy price repentance and give you the Holy Ghost he will not bypass repentance he could bypass baptism God can bypass gift God can bypass a preacher and give you the Holy Ghost God can bypass a church and give you the Holy Ghost but he will never bypass repentance because when John came with this message he said repent for the kingdom of God is a hand repentance is the foundation work is the foundation stone of the kingdom of God the first stone I was put into the earth as a cornerstone is repentance oh that's a little secret you can just put that in your purse hide it somewhere let the devil don't see it get a heart of repentance all the time if you don't have confidence that you have the holy God just keep repenting praise the Lord because God will now bypass repentance that is the foundation stone for this new kid on this spiritual Kingdom called the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is a spiritual Kingdom we are born into it we can join it it does not come by membership it comes by the new birth repent for the kingdom of heaven is a hand praise the Lord so we're talking about a true witness here the testimony of a true witness praise the Lord I was reading this this morning hours and you know sometimes how you try to think about a while look at this it says I didn't really difference is there a difference between it you know a testimony is there the difference between a witness I was just kind of looking at I think that both of them goes goes the same praise the Lord and man I have had an experience he has a testimony and his experience is his witness the experience comes like the Bible says the Holy Spirit bear record that we are children of God it come and witness to her that you are a son of God you are a daughter of God praise the Lord Amen oh my and he goes down in that in that same message she says the word is the testimony of God oh we know that the scripture says in Revelation you know the testimony of Jesus Christ is the spirit of prophecy and then he starts to talk about how God in in creation and in nature he witnessed to his people everything praise the Lord the Word of God is his testimony amen the Word of God is his testimony now this is the way how they can they can grab a man being the truth witness or a false witness wash his testimony if his testimony is not constant he's brought in the first time to testify and he says something different then the next day that brings him in then he says no it was not Monday actually it was Tuesday evening and then the tenth day of the brief scene he says really it was in the morning I think it was Monday praise the Lord I mean he's standing as a witness before for his testimony to be accepted for us to accept him as a truth witness we have to look at his testimony so the Word of God is God's testimony and he witnessed the word in nature in creation the Sun comes up in the morning it goes unknown evening it goes down the next morning it comes over and over since the day of creation the Sun has been doing that it's a witness that the testimony of the Resurrection is truth praise the Lord so for you to be able to be true witness your testimony must be constant for you to be a true witness your testimony must line up with God's Word praise the Lord that's the reason why and I mean I mean look testifying of these things you learn of his gospel you learn a Luke gospel with Matthew Mark and John you will find out that he'd been a true witness because sometimes you think look is growing a little bit farther to say something that might you never said but check John John says the same thing praise the Lord amen so we see God here a Wednesday night I was talking about the using common people but this this morning as we look at the continuation of the book of Acts remember we just we just spoke the other day talking about apostolic time among us and we need to step into it we need to step by fit right into that the things that God wants to do through his children to make his present real in this time indeed that we are living praise the Lord a friend of mine from south africa tsamina text this morning he says he said I remember what he said in the text there but he said something like he says this is yeah man well I like your president you know he said he just he just on the heels of devil you ish own so I text him back I said well you know the Prophet told us watch how the church is praying and you see what is happening so I believe that just like we spoke about the mother of all living and shows that the church she represents the moon that controls you know the moon God placed the moon to be able to take out of judgment you think about flawed you think about rain falling you think about natural disaster the moon controls them and that's how the church is the church controls the judgment that comes upon the earth and when the people gets down to pray like the law to Solomon if my people that are called by my name and I believe the church the people has been caught upon God's name and for God to answer that prayer he just had to are not diner Trump to get behind those politician open the churches and let the people pray praise the Lord it meant I just believed that it's an answer to our prayers as the people prayed around the world and prayed around the nation it's not it's not only us here everywhere around the world you know people are crying in their home people are fasting and I mean but yet God is working at the back of the scene so we want to thank the Lord for that praise the Lord so we get right here we see that Luke is testifying that a promise was giving the promise of the Father he says for John truly baptized with water verse 5 but ye shall receive ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many there hangs yeah actually it's in verse 4 when he talks about the promise of the Father there soon a depart from Jerusalem but wait for the promise of the father we say heed ye have heard of me for John truly baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence can you imagine how anxious these disciples were for the Holy Ghost understanding understanding that Jesus said when I go I will send the comforter understanding that the understanding that the thing that Jesus did can you imagine those men they went out they cast out Devils they came back shouting & hyuna one little boy with epaulets and they prayed and they cried that the row on the ground Jehovah Lord the cry cry crowd Ananda Jessica Lynne do it do you realize how on answer prayers how a we can faith I mean when you really desperate and you crying out to God poorly now you are doing all that you know how to do anxiously waiting to see a miracle and you wake up and it looks like nothing change praise the Lord and that is the problem of this last days Church we have had a lot of unanswered prayers the reason is because people are bypassing the Word of God and the one result of the Word of God you can get you can playing Korn and get apples you can bypass God's principle you will not repent you and I live right but yet you want God to be an errand boy for you every time you ask him for something he's rushing to give it to you that's the problem of our age on answer prayers has killed the church that's the reason why most of them do I mean going into strange spirits lying miracles because God honor his word praise the Lord Solomon says that he will not hear abominable prayers people living in abomination they can even dress right in church but yeah they want to have loud mouth before God god I commend you you are speaking to the God of your imagination not the God of this Bible or the God of heaven because God will not yet abominable prayers people living on clean live in adultery and all sorts of things and then the whole the Sacre word of God is the God of your imagination not the God of heaven in air because the God of heaven and earth he stands behind his world he stands behind his word look at this principle that Jesus taught us Matt chapter 11 jesus said if you have faith you will say to this mountain be they remove and after you have moved the mountain then ask whatever you will is to promise in 1 you first have to move the mountain you need a faith by the Word of God to address the mountain in your life in your situation then now you can speak like Adam and ask whatever you will the Bible says praise the Lord but no we want to we want to hide behind the mountains of doubt and fear we want to be behind a mountain we have not addressed the mountain yet and just believing that God will show up somehow and give us exactly what we say from man like Elijah to come out and said there will be no rain or Dew you until I call for it asks whatever you will just add the word for you to do that you have to first move the mountain you have to have faith to these will unbeliev indeed with doubt and deal with complex and be waiver I mean just just anything contrary to God's Word praise the Lord the truth church is the continuation of the book of patch and what the Holy Ghost has come to do remember Luke said what Jesus began to do and teach the Holy Ghost has come back in the church to be able to teach us right you remember one time when Jesus was around one of those two brothers they wanted to turn those people into wolf they were going to misuse the power of God but yet the Holy Ghost has now come to the church in obedient of what as I said in Isaiah chapter 28 to teach teach us teach us how to live right how to talk right how to use what God has given to us not to make money out of our gifts or make money out of the things of God no how to live according to God's Word that's why the Holy Ghost has come now it's not you know we read we read here the Bible says and you shall receive power when the Holy Ghost have come we jump over all the teaching we jump over the foundation work that the Holy Ghost supposed to do in our life we want power the Bible says when the Holy Ghost shall come we will have power everybody want the power but they have foundation work to be done you realize if you don't have the foundation right it's an explosion you will be caught up in a when that power come is going to blow you up even because you don't have the foundation right the foundation work don't well just like I said the foundation stone is repentance having a heart that is right before God having a heart that is seeking God's mercy oh if that would just be the attitude of God's children whenever we find ourselves in the wrong not justifying ourselves and blending the church and and-and-and-and-and blaming everybody it's God I call you are a son of God you are a daughter of God you are responsible to go for His Word put your hand right with God and then you will see God moving on the same for you we want power oh we wonder blind eyes to opium we want to we want to go yeah praise the Lord oh my goodness hey man Amen I was talking with one young man and he says I mean you were just talking about fading talking about what God would do it he says you know I just feel like calling to all of these Finneran woman and because I want to see God raised in the dead sea water faith but there is a foundation stone you know there is a foundation stone you see when when those foundation stones are placed right when our hearts are right with God and we are living right you will not be anxious for miracle no girl would get the right man in the right place at the right time and do the right thing you will not be wanting to see wanting to see no when the foundation is laid right just like Solomon temple the glory of God came down that even the people never had a place to stand go fill his tabernacle and that's what God was doing on the days of pentacle get the foundation right praise the Lord can you imagine all those imposters in the in the upper room sitting down and an America going there to matter matter you know I just thought about something you know I really I didn't realize that that day when I said that to you you remember that day I mean some years ago I said that to you and I real hopefully you I'm so sorry you know because God was preparing their hearts God was preparing the heart and Susan remember that the lady down the street she talks some things from her and she never paid her and she just been avoiding the lady so what she did she sneak cover her head went down there and make it right putting the foundation strewn right God will never back pass repentance and give you the Holy Ghost repentance is the foundation stone for us to rewrite the book of Acts or be a continuation of the book of we must go back in address our foundation stone ha our hard right before God sorry must never be a difficult word we must not even stormer to see sorry we must say it and say it loud and clear we must be glad to say I'm sorry praise the Lord if we can address the foundation stone because you realize that the foundation stone was the rejected stone and because it was the rejected stone the building was not complete their building is going to fall down if you if you if you reject your foundation stone that building is going to crumble praise the Lord because if you keep the Alpha and Omega principle the capstone and the foundation stone is Christ so the capstone and the foundation stone because you know message believe it equate to blow you out of your preaching no no no the rosetta stone was the capstone is the same as the foundation stone go and look in the message that Weber Bentham says because it's the Alpha and Omega principle he begin it he close it up he was the foundation stone upon this rock I will build my church and he was the capstone so if you reject the capstone is the same if you have a building in the capstone is not there it's not ready to be boring if you have a building in the foundation stone is now right that building is coming down oh I just believe that's what God is looking for a hot that travail the heart that is crying before God I want a heart that is right with you Oh Lord then your heart be right with God leave the rest remember the Bible says if a man weighs pleases the Lord well if a man weighs pleases the Lord leave the rest in the hands of God praise the Lord yeah I love the way the Bible says it when a man which pleases the Lord he never says his brothers will be happy his enemy so which means if the enemy will be happy everybody close will be more happy when a man wins pleases the Lord is going to overflow it's going to overflow it's the foundation stone we seek to please this person we want to make this other person happy we want to make this press and our vertical relationship is just completely out of order which are seeking to make men happy and seeking to make this person happen we don't even look at buff and said I wonder if God is happy about what I'm doing happy about the life that I'm living we bleed the the Savior's heart he has a standard mercy and grace love to us protection we heard his heart every day when we keep walking into those things that we know we should not do and then we get a big bore go it's a merciful God on pause should we continue in sin that grace muscle-bound he said golf obey realizing that one of these days our days will be number and we will have to stand before I will make her and give a count oh that's why when were scared he was singing that's on there's a room at the cross that's all I was thinking about so all revival is son that's a that's a song that gives an opportunity for people to make the heart ride because there's a room at the Cross God has room at the cross and what is that room for for you to be me right with cavalry for you to open your heart press a lot why he was up there hanging between heaven and earth the veil in the temple rented it make room for everybody it wouldn't had a little passage for the high priest but he rented the whole thing praise the Lord amen I was having having Bible Stella Wilbur Brad one night he said it's so beautiful alive he said he said he said well can you imagine that they feel rented and then after all of those things the sacrifice has already been painful and the next day those Jewish priests started sawing the veal back we gotta hang this temple up is not right and it started making effort to sew it before the people would come to church they started sewing it back praise the Lord I believe 100 godly men came in and he look I'm seeing the red thread on that Whiteville what is that no it is not straight honey can you see there is that a sewing it's not even balanced right that's what happens when men are put in effort God is trying to pull you out of your wrong trying to pull you out of your mistakes and your slothfulness and you keep trying to make up yourself praise the Lord that's what people do make up just to look a little bit different amen just to look a little bit different amen praise the Lord oh my goodness a continuation of the book of ads we can never walk where these are posters have trolled if we don't start where they studied we can walk where they apostle's after all verb MC is almost like foods getting on her nails shoes to walk we're injures have trolled we could see people claiming Apostolic Faith and claiming you know apostolic blessing and claiming everything of the Apostles but it refused to start worthy and postures have started see what the Bible says here they were all in one Accord all in one Accord we can't even agree with ourself praise the Lord we can even agree with ourself the Holy Ghost is dealing with your heart your mind is I doing about it they were all in one Accord that's where they started from if we would get the apostolic blessing we have to come to that place we wanna call does not mean we must wear black and white with black time and all the sisters in black skirt with white blouses that's not want a card that's cutters in one Accord is for us to forsake our ideas and subscribe to what the Word of God says if it is the word of God accept it and forget about what you think about it one Accord and in that's the way they supposed to be oh my praise the Lord I mean if if a church will receive the the Pentecostal blessing we must go back to the Pentecost of the beginning we start with repentance in and uniting our heart back to the Word of God uniting our heart back to the Word of God praise the Lord that's the apostolic blessing that's where they started from they're all together in one heart and one mind praying with supplication everybody yeah mine were all focusing on the Holy Ghost we all can be praying Lord bless our young people in church and all our mind praise you get a father when we come back together all Lord help me let me let me dedicate myself to the word Lord if I was never serious before let me be serious if if all of our mind is driving to that place of God we want to see you in our miss father if anything I was I'm doing that it's not right my slothfulness mind mind mind you know lateness for church and you know I mean not Navy being conscious of what you're doing in our mess every one of them in that Upper Room there was one thing on your mind the promise of the Father praise the Lord the promise of the Father I like the way but Jesse Smith sherry applause here in a few minutes he says he says can you remember I can you imagine 10 days they took off from work he said they took off from work it was so serious that it took off from work and he had to put a happy for God times out what x is so filled up praise the Lord then when we even have a little break from work we don't know what to do because just a lot of things to be done but they said a time is high even though it was a promise of God I was driving him to that place it was a promise of God I was driving them because remembered the the the Saints I spent 40 days on the earth the Lord and the scenes and in in the 10 day period that was between the 40 and 50 because that's what Pentecost means it means 50 the 10 day period that was in between the this man and women took off they have just stood on Mount Olive looking at him in a glory of his presence ascending up to heaven and says the same manner you see him glory praise the Lord the same manner you see him extending caught up in a cloud sending up to heaven praise the Lord I know when you talk about this our mind goes to the cloud and and get startled first I'm not not have to fuss with anybody I'm talking about a reality because we can talk about there we can fall back and what I believe in what what you to believe in and this other person says this and but we are talking about a time we have a promise that the same where does our posture saw him going he was going to come back in that same way if any kid in his presence with a client praise the Lord so we've been living in a cycle living in a cycle a time that we call the coming of the Lord we've been living in that atmosphere and that is the reason why we have to go back today foundation-stone go back to the beginning one one wanna call some people are just they're just anointed to be different they always there they are just that way their mind is geared that way when God came down he was so pleased with their prayers and their supplication he was so pleased that the heart was right I'm telling you brother Scott one of the easier way to solve trash problem it's like everybody maybe a hot right when Joshua will call for a solemn assembly when everybody had is right we will all seek what would please God the easier way to solve a family problem everybody maybe a hard right if we are if we argue let's just stop again let's pray let's just ask God to forgive us for arguing I'm sorry Lord I shouted my wife I'm sorry lord I shot at my host let's just make our husband as soon as you hit that plane you realize that both are you people all you will see is what we please God in this situation I listen to a testimonial of a preacher and its wife and I mean there was just a lot of things going on in the woman she was feeling hurt because of some things he was doing and all that and he says you know he choose this day to go and surprise his wife took her to one of the expensive hotel he went there and he playing with the guy you know every I think I know every five minutes or every ten minutes he would come with a different color flavor you know so the woman is sitting there they are in the restaurant and every ten minutes one of the the Seavers in the restaurant would come with a with a different color flower and presented to the woman she said I'm sitting there and I'm thinking yeah he really doing he really doing I mean working hard to impress me and then another ten minutes another guy comes again and bowed down with a purple flower and she's sitting yeah Wow blue purple and after ten minutes again another one come with so in his mind he's so impressed I've caught him of color in heaven in the atmosphere of love I'm blowing her mind and a woman is just a mean look here he and he went through twelve different roses and different flowers and everything after that they finish eating and and all of this thing she just I mean she just behaving well because the in the restaurant and the god on the road and started driving and he's talking he's happy that he oh I mean yes yeah really flower the woman with color and she just sitting there looking at you and he said he was he was you know talking he wanted to reach alice's honey you had a good evening just taking use of me this is then he realized that oh my goodness all the flowers i've gone through the window so he had parked the car by the side of the road and says what's wrong that's when she started pouring out her heart to him the beautiful part of the story he said he was right out of place to take out his gun to start defending himself and he says the Lord just spoke to him shut your mouth praise the Lord he says I was so glad that I heard his voice and as soon as he obeyed the Lord the Lord just broke his heart he says I never said one word I can't explain to you how I turned myself in the driver's seat and got down in the driver's seat I didn't care what my wife was listening to me on that I started repenting to the Lord because he knew what he was doing and things he was getting himself involved in that was not right but he wanted his wife to support him anyway he said he just got right down there and he started repenting and the woman was sitting in the driver's seat he said his eyes was closed he was not even listening to anything didn't care whether she was there because he believed he was not speaking to her he was pouring out his heart and she testified right in that same moment a presence came in the vehicle and she got down on her seat and started repenting to God because the Lord also struck her that what she was desiring is not to make God happy just to make herself happy she said she realized that she had a selfishness there because she was not wanting to make God happy or she was fed up was what would make her happy and the Lord just struck but you see what I'm talking about is that that is the way to solve crisis the both of them make the hot right and he was able to repent to his wife repent before the Lord and she repented before the Lord because she realized that look God bring us together to make him happy and when we want to seek our own personal happiness then sometimes we go into crisis because it's all about making him happy he redeemed us for us to live for his pleasure for his praise for his glory one Accord in one mind and both of these people on the radio talk talking their live testimony why because God brought him to one one one I wanna call that's a truth testimony they're not making up for one another petting one another on the back he testified I just saw myself foolish trying to impress my wife with different colors of flower when I know my heart is not right when a man weighs pleases the Lord when a man weighs pleases the Lord that is the beginning of the book of Acts we cannot be a continuation if we are divided in our mind everybody has their acted to you and all of the Adam and we are just misbehaving in ourselves and we claim it to go in a rapture let's come back to apostolic foundation young people there's no way you're going to get the Holy Ghost if you don't land to repent of your sin if you don't learn to make your heart right before God there is no way you receive the Holy Ghost if you want the Spirit of God living in your heart you have to learn to constantly repent of your sin constantly ask God to forgive you meaning from your heart cry before God that is the foundation stone and if you reject their their house is going to crumble it will never be able to stand the storm of life but when your heart is right before God never seeking to justify yourself being the first one to hold the horns of the altar and say I'm sorry that is the foundation stone will stop you this morning praise the Lord praise the Lord don't thank the law to giving us the grace to be Auto get through this I mean it's been accountable you know hot seeking time you see there you know young Manny and what he tried to do for the Lord and I mean the wife the children the church church and everything you think about that really not being an easier weekend for us you know I've been a week

and and and all of that and and you know and and the grace of God comes on the scene and right here that give us a witness if this earthly Tabernacle be dissolve there is one waiting not after the resurrection no there is one waiting right now brother Branham says before the car the Undertaker he said you step into that one and you are looking at your body it's real Paul said intermitting the cross of Jesus abolished death and it brings immortality so this Holy Ghost that we have in us is a portion of immortality that makes us to step out of this body and step into a brand-new body and you know the beautiful thing about it no matter how you love to go back you never want to go back no matter how they cry for you when you cross out of this body you never want to come back when berra berra was taught that he was going to go back he said to that body that was where he got the word a pest house it was from that vision of looking and his body on the bed that's when he got that word
