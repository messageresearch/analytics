you musicians praise the lord that's 10 hour feeding and i hope i didn't leave someone out but it's good to have each and every one and [Music] praise the lord sister miracle center sent us a prayer request this morning to pray for her homeland beginning there is a little bit of unrest there and uh which of course affect the entire west coast of africa so we want to keep the people in the republic of gaining in prayer that the grace of god will guide him and protect him praise the lord amen for a while now we've been dwelling in uh on the bulk of uh uh obi dies we've been reading on the prophecy of obedience one chapter and but i want us to read this morning from jeremiah chapter 49 jeremiah 49 the only reason why i want for us to read there because as we read it you will see that it paraphrased exactly the prophecy of obi dies that we've been reading so uh uh let's let's go back to it and and then we we will be able to do a little review this morning and uh and then trust that the holy spirit will be able to pick up the context and speak to us this morning praise the lord jeremiah chapter 49. let's read from verse 14. jeremiah 49 reading from verse 14. if we would just draw back a little bit of verse 13 it will give us an idea yet as we go along for i have sown by myself said the lord that basra shall become a desolation a reproach a waste place that curse and all the cities thereof shall be perpetually waste i have heard a roman from the lord and an ambassador is sent unto the head and saying gather here together and come to and come against her and rise up to the battle for lord i will make thee small among the headings and despise among men praise the lord that terribleness have deceived thee and that and the pride of that heart all thou that dwellers in the cliff of the rock that hold the height of the hills though thou should make their nets as high as the ego i will bring thee down from him said the lord also edom shall be a desolation everyone that goeth by it shall be astonished and shall haste at all the plague thereof let us pray father in the name of the lord jesus christ we are approaching your sacred word father that we believe no man has the right to interpret this word office of their own intellect lord father because man of all by inspiration wrote this word it takes the same inspiration of the holy spirit to bring a context out of faith dear lord we are needed people and lord i will most need that we have we need you so we pray this morning lord come take your word break into our hearts of god father we ask that lord things will be said of internal value this morning maybe we might leave the 99 and just go after one if it is your will let it be done father oh god it would be a great thing father lord that in 99 will you we unite their faith lord when they see that one is being gone after may we now sit in the seat of this comfort this morning may we not sit in the seat of no at all but may we pour our house to you lord and just humble ourselves before you because what almighty god you are you know our uprising you know our down setting there is nothing of our life that is hidden from you for paul said always of a man is naked in your eyes and here we come this morning just as i am like the songwriter said without no play the blood is my only play i asked this morning father but we find grace in your sight this morning oh god may we be a privileged people to say he spoke to my heart not the preacher the lord spoke to my heart father that's our prayer this morning come now father and glorify yourself in jesus name we pray amen amen praise the lord the lord bless you you may have your seat amen amen we started speaking uh if this is not close to a month now uh we're getting close but we we've been speaking on on edom the prophecy that derived from esau and jacob now you see that's the reason why i asked brother jordan and his staff for them to change what we were playing for sunday school in the church age book but i asked them to change it this morning and played a portion of that message hearing recognizing and acting upon the word and uh because that's what i want to draw my inspiration from to to speak to you this morning so uh uh but we will do a little review here like we said and when we read the scripture this morning it was uh but brandon read from romans and that if you go back to romans where paul was talking about israel he was approaching the subject of election and he was talking about uh easter and jacob and uh let's go back there a little bit in romans chapter eight that's romans chapter nine romans chapter 9 we read from verse 6 coming down not as though the word of god has taken non-effect for they are not all israel which are of israel neither because they are the seed of abraham are they all children but in isaac shall that seed be called now we talk about all the children of of of abraham like i said in our review here we we spoke a little bit about abraham having having sarah uh his wife that was giving the promise by whom he would become the father of many nations but we know heger was introduced praise the lord hagar was grafted into the program and out of haga came ishmael and ishmael to our sons and then after abraham isaac that was not the only son in ishmael that abraham had when sarah died abraham married keturah and he had another psalms with keturah praise the lord so paul yet addressing their subject is saying that neither because they are seed of abraham from hager or from keturah neither because they are seed of abraham they are children but in isaac shall that see be called that is they which are the children of the flesh these are not the children of god but the children of the promise accounted for seed praise the lord spoken word is the original seed god's principle from the beginning before he started creating everything he took everything that he created into a sea form praise the lord before god made the trees he started in a sea form so uh the the uh the sea the power of the sea can now be unestimated with god will deal with you he have to start dealing with you in sea form amen praise the lord let's not miss that principle there is a flesh form and verse 8 that is they which are the children of the flesh they are now children uh of god but the children of the promise are counted for seed for this is the word of promise at this time i will come and sarah shall have a son praise the lord amen now so what paul is saying here is that abraham waited for this promise for 25 years until elohim show on the scene and spoke a word amen it was that spoken word that created a seed in syria are we together are you seeing the principle so it is not how long you've been around or how long you've been in the church is the the grace of receiving the spoken word are we together for this is the word of promise at this time will i come and sarah shah have a son and not only this but when rebecca also had conceived by one even by our father isaac for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of god are calling to election praise the lord that the purpose of god are calling to election the purpose of god that can never fail the purpose of god that can never be defeated the purpose of god that nothing in time can affect praise the lord john was put on the island of patmos and he was poured into a boiling oil the purpose of god could not burn him kept him safe shadrach meshach and abednego was put into a phonics of fire heated seven times the purpose of god could never be burned daniel was put into the lion then the purpose of god can never be eaten the purpose of god can never be defeated praise the lord and i believe that the purpose of god in this coronavirus still will never be defeated i believe that god is going to use this to draw his children closer to him the shock is going to fall away then the seed will comes to maturity for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of god i call into election must stand not of works not of works but of him that calleth and the one that calleth is almighty god praise the lord it was said unto her the other shall save the younger as it is written jacob have i love but either have i hated what shall we say then is there unrighteousness with god god forbid praise the lord amen so we we look at this we have gone through this like i said i'm doing a review this morning but when we look at this and uh uh narrowing it down to to uh esa and jacob we realized that paul had two part of the word he heard what the angel told rebecca in genesis and he also hear what malachi say in malachi chapter 1 because at the birth of the children there is nowhere that is written either allah or jacob ahead it is not ready the angel only told rebecca that the other will save the younger praise the lord but then we will realize that right down through time it would come to the prophet malachite in malachi chapter 1 where malachi was trying to show israel the love of god praise the lord the love of god which of course is a love that you and myself cannot understand we cannot understand it we cannot fart on the love of god are we together amen so malachi trying to tell the children of israel about how god loved them because he's bringing them to a place you know these people have gone through a lot of things in their lives and and and and you know there's questioning you know how can i be a child of god and be going through these things in my life you know how how can it be you know is is is god ever asleep you know and and and malachite is trying to help them to see there so then he brings out this story about esau and jacob as it is written in the lord uh jacob i love he says was not easier than jacob brothers but yet god said jacob i love and esau ahead so so the apostle paul here now is taking both revelation and malachi to be able to address this subject of election praise the lord because you see the subject of election our call and our election is not only when we show up in church praise the lord amen our quarter in election it's now when we show up that's the reason why we don't have no roster yet to call names for you to stay present the roll call will be done someday but now from the back of this pulpit [Music] amen and i i prayed and hoped that when the royal court is done you show up amen because i will be there watching amen praise the lord amen amen praise the lord so uh you know so that the the subject about election and calling and and all of that you see this is a subject just like god knows the the the end from the beginning okay it's a subject that also runs from the from the from the beginning to the end now so uh uh these ones that god has elected called elected and predestinated he have already seen them in glory because paul said yet in romans chapter chapter 8 him that god has called he has justified and then that he has justified has already been glorified praise the lord you know so so god has he have seen us true that's why he's not nervous the god we serve is not a nervous god he's a god that is fully under control praise the lord the only thing there he does not sleep or as he will have just gone to sleep because he has everything under control but he do not sleep and he don't slumber praise the lord now so we see this here and and paul is addressing this let's let's uh let we will come back to this a little bit let's uh re-yell it a little bit let's study together and uh uh we look in our notes here i have something on the laodicea church age that talks about examining the love of god let us examine the first phrase this is actually from revelation chapter 3. that's exactly the first phrase as many as i love in the greek the emphasis is upon the personal pronoun ah as many as i love not as many that love me because your love for god will fail with circumstances but god love for you will never fail are we together amen jesus said because iniquity shall abound the love of many or what's called so circumstances can affect our love no wonder after the flood of noah god saves both winter summer uh uh uh seeding time and uh dry time and everything he says it will it will never stop it will keep coming because that's what that's one of the elements of time you have to remember one of the element of time is change one of the elements of time is change if nothing around you can tell you look at your age look at your strength praise the lord amen so there is one thing that that time brings it brings change and as long as we stay in time there will be changes amen so circumstances can affect our love but god he's not a god of time amen he's an intent of god and eternity is constant as many as i love the greek emphasis is upon the personal pronoun i he does not say that as many who feel he as as many who feel he should say it as many as love me no sir we must never try to make jesus the object of human love praise the lord we must never make jesus the object of human love in another way to help us understand this that's what brother branham said jesus never died on the cross that we would feel sorry for him and save god he said oh my goodness he had to be oh man lord jesus oh man i need to give my life to god no isaiah chapter 53 say a please god a please god whatever places you you have no regrets a please god that he must be stricken we should never try to make jesus the object of human love in this verse no it is the many that are the loved ones of god it is his love in question not our love it is his love in question not our love you see when when the word of god is challenged when the message of the hour is challenged and and and and we want to come on the scene you know and and you know i'll prove to you that this is the word of god you can defend god's word god is more than able amen amen see shadrach meshach and abednego he says our god will deliver us but even if he if he does not you see because if you stick to that place that god that herself he's going to he's going to show you praise the lord and you have to realize that god weighed every element of your body you might be talking the god that herself he's almighty god he will show you and in all that confession when god put it on the scale he could see a little proud in it and say i'm not going to associate with that because my glory i would give to no man praise the lord and then god doesn't show up oh my god the bowers i don't even believe this bible i've got a church again that's just what was in you that's all that was in you and you wanted to associate god with that are we together praise the lord it is the many that are the loved ones of god it is his love in question not ours so once again we find ourselves glorying in his salvation his purpose his and we are we are confirmed even more strongly in the truth of the doctrine of the sovereignty of god amen even as he said in romans 9 13 jacob have our love they'll say now obtain that since he loves only the meaning is he therefore in a state of complacency awaiting the love of those who have not drawn nigh to him by no means is the soul for he declared also in romans 9 13 easter have i hate it praise the lord this is a very big uh controversial uh verse in the bible for the atheists you know and and you know in in the many of them that are struggling with biblical truth praise the lord you know you see it i was thinking about this the other day you know when people argued about whether god is real or ned you know and uh it's it's just as simple as you know me telling you about your father there is no way i can do it i might think i have an idea about your father but i can tell you about your father from the outside i might be looking at him in all my knowledge and thought would be what i know from the outside but you are the one that is in relationship with him praise the lord so young people if anybody want to bother you about what a god being real you should just ask them you know that question are we together amen now so we read down here either half i ate it hate it and in verse 11 the spirit bowling call out for the children not being born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of god according to election might stand you see that is the major thing in this whole thing that we are reading the purpose of god the purpose of god his determined counsel shall always stand praise the lord not of works but of him that calleth this love is elective love it is his love for his elect it is his law for them for his law for them is a part from human merit for it says that the purpose of god staying in election which is exactly opposite to work or anything man has in himself because before the children were born he has already said jacob i love and easily i hate let me let me just stick on this a little bit because that's the next session i was going to and and and for us to be able to look at some things here let's look at this famous uh statement that came out of uh uh praise the lord are we together let me find myself here the little bit here we'll come back to there but let's look at this uh behold a greater than solomon is here we all know this we have heard it before a pardon is not a pardon unless it has been accepted as a pattern praise the lord now for us to understand this is for us to be able to appreciate god's on rating laws there is an unwritten lord of god that is in nature the lord of reproduction is anonymity lord what you saw is what you will reap praise the lord and as much as thy lord is truth it is also the lord of contracts is also truth understanding the lord of contracts will be will be able to help us to appreciate when you struggle with the thought of how can god hate or how can god say i create good i create evil praise the lord the lord of contracts help us to appreciate that because with a lot of contracts you we will not appreciate day if we did not have night praise the lord amen if we never had a global crisis where people are caught up in the icus on ventilator many of us who have gone and never appreciate the good health that we have praise the lord so it takes one ugly to be able to appreciate the goat praise the lord now so god this sovereign god trying to manifest his attributes praise the lord has to allow a law of contracts to play out for his attributes to be appreciated if there was none sake we would never know him as a healer praise the lord so you see in one sense it's the beauty of almighty god trying to make himself known and trying to reveal himself his potential to his people so it's lay out in the lord of contracts we can appreciate good behavior because we know bad behavior praise the lord now so as we look at this we all know the story uh the story was told from the revolution you know about this uh soldier that was that was going to be forgiving and then uh his pardon was ready and was taken to him in the praising from from the commander from the leader and whoever it is and it was handed to him but he kind of looked at the sheet that the pattern was written on and the problem was not the writing the problem was not the the problem was he has already condemned himself to death he has filled in his mind that he will be hanged tomorrow he never found no room for mercy for himself so even if it was written with gold in pain and it was sealed and it was put in an envelope there is no way he he will struggle to accept it because he has been eating up with his own guilt praise the lord so you see the problem was met that he was forsaking and there was no mercy given to him the problem there is that because he has already consumed himself with his problem praise the lord are we together just like jesus said all things are possible to them that belief all things still remain possible but the ones that will experience that possibility we have to be the ones that believe not believe in your abilities not believe in your strength but believe in the one that has made the promise now so the struggle comes to the place where we look at ourselves and and and we know all of our thoughts we know that our struggle so the problem is now with the promise the problem is with the things you are dealing with you cannot rise above those things and believe that the god that have created you is the god that have made this promise [Music] are we together are you seeing the picture it's not a god that is possessed with a with a hit character but a god that is showing he's manifesting that this pure fountain of love that he is the only ones that will receive it are the ones from him praise the lord this is two rivers that run parallel and never meet there is no way you can jump from one to the other are we together amen all this now by might it's not about power what is by the spirit of god that is going to rise his children above the situation of their lives [Music] to be able to receive god's word and god's mind about you praise the lord amen there is one that has the desire and the thing that drive him to church because he have heard you know god is a good god you know he's a god of prosperity and and as he approached this it's all about himself his reasoning about serving god is to have a better job a better life a better wife a better house it's just order by himself [Music] praise the lord and there is another one also that is approaching this promise and it's all about be it unto me not calling to your word [Music] whatever is your purpose in in your mind concerning me are we together [Music] oh god has been so merciful he's being so gracious he's been he's been so good i mean protection you can see his hand in many places of our lives the one whose approach to god is odd about himself as long as he does not have what this person has or has what that person has no the goodness of god has not reached to that level yet god has said goodbye i have not reached to that level because it's all about self and what is behind seth pride pride but it's the other that said don't you slave me yet i would still love you because you separated me from my mother's form when there were millions of sales from my father you said this one will live i never had no choosing in it praise the lord [Music] so you understand what brother bannon says year in recognizing the nighting upon the word is because the ability to accept god's will for your life and rejoice in it amen the ability of identifying god's way for your life job struggle with it but when the vision broke forth he said i know my redeemer levitt praise the lord he said i know my redeemer live it naked i came naked i'll return but i know that we see him face to face [Applause] at the beginning job struggle with the bob's struggle with lost in his children's struggle with everything but when he break through that china he said be it unto me i call him to your word amen praise the lord that's the reason why all these meager churches or prosperity they only go for three years because the people have been promised to i mean to live in beverly's hills they have been promised to ride the uh 2022 vehicles and it keeps sowing and it keeps sowing and it keeps sowing and nothing is happening praise the lord god is not an atm are we together amen let's look at this other promise also introduction church h book the bible said first corinthians chapter 5 verse 21 that we have become the righteousness of god by our union with jesus christ did you get it it says that we are the very righteousness of god himself amen just by reading that and with the amen i can see how you're struggling with that in your mind i can feed it already i can feed it how are you struggling with that because all devil is just right my friend you know you know what i know and the devil is just breathing everything in your ears and your mind your mind is gone out of this building you're looking back instead of reading this word and embracing god's truth so you see is the ability to receive what god has said not to function it in your mind not to understand it the way you want to understand it but to take god's word just like he have said praise the lord that becomes the battle of the believer he fights because the devil will remind him and flood his mind with all of his failures and all of the things that he's going through but there is enough power in him like jesus said he that had received has been given power to become the sons of god there is enough power in him to fight every bed as he gets on his knees and say god your word is true i don't care what my body goes through i don't care how my mind is abused by the devil but your word remains true if there is a that father's in me is not with your word that thought is never with your word because your word is yeah and amen [Applause] why should we blame god because of our failure when he has never failed it says that we are the very righteousness praise the lord okay it's posted in this it's posted nassau read it together the bible says let's go the bible says in second corinthians 5 21 that we have get it it says [Music] oh your voice is just going back and like the battery is going alone your voice started and then like the battery is feeling [Laughter] praise the lord [Music] the maf is doing his best to read it the mind is in the battle oh praise the lord lord help us help us to receive your word help us lord to embrace your truth lord amen amen okay let's read the this phrase that is that is all embodied here let's read that together again amen amen thank you for pressing true and let there be your confession praise the lord it says that he jesus became sin for us it does not say he became sinful he said he became sin and say he became sin he took on our sin he took on lust he took on adultery he took on whatever sin there is in the word he became sin for us are we together it does not say he became sinful he became sin for us that by our union with him we might become the righteousness of god amen if we accept the fact and we must praise the lord we must it's a must just like the new birth is a must this is a must the lord if you don't accept it as a must you can never go free because you give him half and you carrying half with the rest of your life but he became sin for us it's a must you must let it go you must give it to him amen [Music] praise the lord oh my let's say thank you jesus thank you jesus amen if we accept the fight and we must that he literally literally the roman picture tried to put a little cloth around him but he was stripped naked literally naked that he literally became seen for us by his substitute for us then we must also accept you see the problem is accepting one and not accepting the other it does not work it does not work that way it does not work that way are we together it does not work that way we must also accept the fact that we about our union with him have become the very righteousness of god to reject one is to reject the other praise the lord the man never believed that he was pardoned so nothing could free him nothing could free him the possibility of letting him out of prison is for him to commit suicide the possibility of just opening the present gate and say go you are free is for him to commit he go and hang himself that's what judah said because there was nothing in him to accept that he was free his mind has condemned him he have accepted in his heart he wrote his will what is what he should give to his children he has already buried himself before he was dead and how many times god's children walk like this we come to church and we sing the songs of zion and we praise god we dance to the music and in every one of that and we go through those doors we go through those doors just the way we came in the fact that you cannot go just the way you came you either go better or you go worse praise the lord if you believe with me that we serve an almighty god that there is nothing impossible with him praise the lord amen then we must never leave this building defeated we must never leave this building with hidden things in our lives we must never leave this building with sin struggle or as you have just come to church and you have never met god praise the lord unto the lord be the glory great thing he have done praise the lord i believe that great thing he's still doing i believe that great thing he's doing right now praise the lord just like i said wednesday now all of these people having problems with the message they are all failures they have failed to produce god in their lives they have failed to see the manifestation of god how can you blame the seventh grade man seventh grade man with a seventh grade education that shook the world with the move of god oh he was a man yeah he was a man oh yeah he was a man he had his floor like every other man but the thing about that man he took god at his word amen praise the lord amen can't even blame the pastor how can you blame the pastor for your work with god how can you blame the church when god is ever pressing when god has made himself available that you don't have to go through another person you can be able to experience him right handed [Music] praise the lord if there is anybody to blame is yourself you must blame yourself [Music] praise the lord oh if we would just learn to be like that man lord i believe help my own belief then cassie blame him and cast him blame you then cast him blame thee when we have the word of god given to us like in no other age in no other age [Music] we have the word of god given to us i have an app on my phone that has the bible in every written language i went to visit my auntie the other day and she was not welding i prayed for her and all of that so i checked through my arm and i saw the you know uh one of our vernacular that is close to her to to what what they speak there so uh i never told her i just i just went to the app put the the bible on and started playing and she says oh that's var she said yeah that's va i can't i can't understand what to say i can't understand that i cannot understand it but i i just i just did i wanted to change the mood around her a little bit and i just did that and and yeah and she felt good about it praise the lord so the problem is with laodicea's christians this is a rich age this age is not only reaching goals this age is rich in god this age is rich in god this is a rich age but the christians of this age are lazy lazy to be able to reach out just like we have press button for everything we also want to press button and put ourselves in the rapture we won by the press button you will receive the holy ghost no brother no you have to get down on your knees you got to get in business with god you got to get in business with god because god will not give you a portion of himself that you don't value [Music] praise the lord so you see where where where are we coming to them where we are with the thought you know we we try to make this law we we understand it in our mind you know we understand it in our mind why all the people on earth at that time god will only choose job to wipe out all his children why can you see love in there the human mind will never see love in that but with god that is love it's election i choose this man to trust him i choose this man among everybody on the earth to trust him because the human mind will never understand that as love that's the reason why your friends thought he was a secret sinner because no way you can think that that is love why god will wipe all the all his family all his wealth i mean it would have even been better keep him healthy he will work and get it again but god struck his health for 14 years let it just cut your phone off one day because you don't go on facebook oh god what is this oh god oh god what is this oh god we have we have limited ourself because you can limit god we have turned in our mind to think that god is touchable things yes material things we must be able to catch up with the technology then god is good to me god is good to me praise the lord a songwriter said even if you don't pay for one more miracle he still remain good he still is a good god because just the the thought of you acknowledging that is a miracle it's a miracle in himself so i'm all over the place but i think i'm standing at a good place amen praise the lord so you see yeah we we we kind of are looking at the life year of uh of of issa and jacob and all like brother branham said in crisis the mystery of god revealed god choose his man in all the ages even in this time god has chosen a people to rise up above the situation of this age praise the lord god will always have a witness he will always have a son of god he will have a daughter of god no matter what people say no matter what people think amen praise the lord it can be in a hidden part of the earth there will still be a man or a woman that says i know that god is real i know that there is a living god praise the lord so god choose this character these characters in the bible to to display his attributes just like in the beginning when he said let the water divided from the land let it let let the letter f bring forth grass so he did the eating but now when it comes over to the time of abraham isaac jacob and all of those men through the ages god wanted to show his attribute of faith working in human flesh now you have to know that this body is produced by eve in the serpent but yet god is going to raise a man up called abraham from uh uh uh i idolatrous background he was worshiping idols now god is going to use that one man in that generation to show that a man can come from a worse path but because he's in the election of god god can get ahold of him and he can stand up in his generation [Applause] abraham separated from his father's house going to a place where he had never been before praise the lord you call it faith abraham he didn't know how to cut it you are the one that said abraham walked by faith for abraham he didn't know how to cut it for him there was something that was dealing with his heart he was just going you said enough walk by faith that's not what enoch said there is no way in the scripture where the bible says enoch said i walk by faith you are the one that said it or maybe you took the language from paul in hebrew 11. but for enoch there was a time in his life where something struck him and he find this time in his everyday to get along just be alone no matter what was going on he had his farm he had his tattoos he had everything but he fought the time every day to get along whether it was in the bush whether it was by the beach he just found a time to get alone and every time he was alone it was wonderful praise the lord maybe he talking by himself look at the stars it's so beautiful oh my goodness it's so wonderful don't mind me he's losing his mind i see that old man every day he comes here he's losing his mind and paul says by faith but for enoch it was not faith it was something that was part of him abraham got tired with the idols of his father for some reason something just came on him every day we got to go and carry rice and oil water to this image there it does not talk we make sacrifice you don't even move you touch your smile it falls down you got to put it all back again something just came in his mind and says i don't know what happened to my daddy he's losing his mind the same thing that came over gideon when he broke all his father idols and he said given why you did this abomination he said why are you people fighting for god why you're fighting for god [Applause] [Music] and abraham walking he walked he took his his nephew locked along and and he walked and uh i mean abraham talking all of these things it does not make sense to to lot father of nation your part is not a general how you going to be father of national you are you know you are you feeling living your inheritance but it was just a revelation that he could not understand something kept telling him praise the lord now you see the human mind what the human mind will produce is that as soon as abraham steps up god must make sarah pregnant and god must give him favor with everything the human mind wants it so easy but abraham stepped out he don't even know where he's going he's even going with fear he's afraid that they're going to kill him because of his wife but yet he's glory [Laughter] yet he's glory oh may god help us praise the lord may god help us so god choose these men in the ages he choose this man jesus would come and tell the i mean the pharisees were asking the sadducees about the resurrection and they were bringing this crazy story to jesus and said there was a man that had a wife he never had a child and he died and the next brother married him married a woman she never had a child and she died and the next brother and he died now they want to be stupid to prove that there is no resurrection so they are asking jesus in the resurrection who wife will she be but watch now god in the old testament in the life of their father jacob or judah in the life of their father judah god wrote the very thing they were talking in the new testament god wrote it in judah life because judah had a daughter-in-law called tema that she gave her first santo and he died and the next one came and behaved stupid god killed him and the next one came so what the cyruses were talking about god has already wrote it in in terms life praise the lord are we together amen god will use a hallowed woman called rahab that got herself involved with high-class men praise the lord rehab was not going for any beggar on the street praise the lord she was going for the high-class man and the foreigners thinking like she was a woman always around the airport praise the lord and just ask how that looks horrible in the life of rahab a divine purpose kept her that way because that is the desire that will attract her to the spice because she's always looking for foreigners oh that god's purpose of election will stand amen that's why he passed us through the things that we go through in our lives if we only give it back to him and say lord just ask her aim amen we found no play i bring all of this back to you god will choose these men and women throughout so when it comes to esa and jacob before that's why the scripture said before they were even born so it goes back to the foundation of the word it goes back to the mind of god it goes back to god's internal purpose praise the lord before they were even born malacca the prophet picking up from god's mind read malachi chapter 1 you will appreciate that scripture you will not see it in the kind of sense of loving and hating you will see it in the sense of god expressing his love and the ability for you to receive it you'll be always grateful because the bible says god for god so loved the word he loved to the word is the same the only difference is you have the ability to receive it and appreciate it and some done some done they argue they insult god are we together let's go back to something we we all heard this morning if you if you did follow the sunday school now we are fully acquainted we people who search the scripture day tonight and read our papers and yeah the news coming true let's bring it to our day that this word is now standing in the gaps of two great spiritual forces praise the lord amen two great spiritual forces that's the reason why i believe that christians should not feed on the media christian must take god's promise and get down on their knees and say lord there is a deaf angel over the land there is a death angel over the land i want to make sure that the talking is applied i apply the talking for my neighbors i apply it for my relatives instead of feeding on the news media and cooking our minds with uh conspiracy theory and all sorts of things two great spiritual forces can you see it we're living just in a town like it was in egypt the bible says there were darkness that could be felt and every one of us can feed this virus if not you will not wear maxes in the area that you wearing maxis i do too it's because we all can feed it it's a darkness that can be fed two great spiritual forces and they are both religious they are both religious jesus said the two spirit of this end time will be so close that if possible the illet will be deceived and that's the reason what i said right from the beginning i'm never going to approach this coronavirus thing on faith oh if you have it you don't have faith if you i don't have it you have faith don't bring that here because it's not truth god will allow some of his children to go by that way and we will still lift our hands and say blessed be the name of the lord and yet god will raise some visiting them by an angel just like brother brother fling testified to brother amos over there in alaska god visited him by an injure and say fear not you won't die because it's two great spiritual forces religious very religious and i believe that these great forces are soon coming to the head means they are coming to a clash they are coming to a clash and we will see what they are made of we will see what they are made of and i believe that these forces are sown coming to the head and both of these great forces was represented in these two sons of isaac praise the lord just like how god used abraham to show how through the ages he will raise men of faith praise the lord amen when it came to isaac in god's mind was a love story it was a love story the beautiful the beauty is love story now abraham will call eloiza and say go to a land go back to my father's home and find a wife for my son put your hand on my tired and promise me you will not bring no one except the one from my father's house praise the lord amen this brother had a problem with his wife and before he got married i mean he was so on fire and he was testifying to the pastor you know god gave him his wife god gave me my wife so he came to the pastor and says pastor i have to send her back to her parents i can't stand her the pastor said well you kill her then say well i don't want to kill he said well you told me that god gave her to you the only way to send her back to god is for you to kill her okay let's get back praise the lord the most beautiful love story in the bible god using the life of isaac read the bible when when when god promised abraham he told abraham he will possess the gifts of the enemy rebecca parents were met with abraham but when they were sending rebecca out they pronounced those same words over rebecca so what was god doing with that with that with the life of isaac just bringing out love story for god so loved the world that he gave us his only begotten son abraham taking isaac up on the hill it was a love story god never wanted isaac god just wanted for abraham to express love to him amen it was not about isaac it was about the love of abraham amen amen are we ready to let go the things we love the most praise the lord amen so god god faith in abraham he expressed love all through the life of isaac nanny and jacob god's purpose was to show his grace it was to show his grace praise the lord jake i mean david was raised up for god to show a man after god's own heart that's what god raised him up for and gave him a trial for 30 years he was on the run praise the lord amen he was on the run running running from from uh from uh sword turtle close to 30 years because i thirty years he came on the throne so close to 30 years he had to go through the striatus so you see these two great forces are coming to a cloud they are religious spirit and i believe the two grace forces are coming to the head and both of these forces are represented in these two songs how that god in his infinite wisdom has foreshadowed all things to us like paul said they were for our good god foreshadowed these things that we might but these things know of asserting what lays before us he made it plain just like how uh jacob had to prepare himself to meet ease her that is the same way this last day church have to prepare herself for the world council of churches praise the lord and we realize that every man that has been in our ranks they are not carrying order of our secrets they say the cloud is no more than he said this is no more than he said that is no more praise the lord coming to a close here made it so plain that god in his word and his nature and his universe is so perfectly arranged together amen now even the sinner can see something is fixing to take place god has arranged his soul and no one is to fire skills now we see these two sounds the evening day before they were even born they were at war one with another even though they are virgin mother for she was a virgin the beautiful rebecca that married the righteous seed of god's promise isaac that they were two consecrated spirit-filled believers of god of their time praise the lord how isaac entreated the lord for his wife and said god you raised me up from the dead because you heard the hands of my father before that knife came down and you that raised me up from the dead you can also give life to the womb of my wife the bible said he entreated the lord for his wife they were righteous god the people of their day are we together spiritual fall ordained to the very marriage that they were united together god for knew it and how could such a thing comes true that one mother by one father one a very evil person and another a good person praise the lord you know it just all go to show that you know we we never we never gave birth to to uh uh uh you know uh have let me free me let me see the right way so it will now sound very ugly you know when we give birth to our children they need a new birth amen we don't bone believers it would break the scripture because david said in sin did my mother conceive me so every child that we born is born in sin as long as they come by the natural birth they need an experience with god they need a visitation they need a birth of god there has always been the program of god you cannot change it he says we will know it today as the lord of contracts there's word there is good there is evil where there is right there is wrong and we will never know matter what our environment will be maybe ever be able to shake ourselves from the presence of either because paul said when i will do good evil is present you have a flesh that is not converted you have a flesh that is not converted that birth of god is in you is in your soul it's a c word that is in your soul and as you feed it with the world you nourish it it grows to bring this body honest objection [Music] but this body will never be a seed of god it was never and it would never be you will root it you will possess it until you step in your new body you must fight to keep it under control bring is thought subject to the word bring his desire subject to the word bring his feelings subject to the word for everything of this flesh is of this word the loss of the eye the loss of the flesh the pride of life no matter what your environment is you will never be able to shake yourself from the presence of of either the sinner will never be able to shake himself away from christians and the christians from the sinner there will be a witness there of right and the testimony of wrong always and you make your choice that's where your free moral agency is it's your choice to receive or reject that's where your free moral agency is god does not he don't have put things down our truck he don't force us no he present his word now you have to make a choice [Music] and what is in you will drive your choice [Music] that's what your free moral agency is if god will not force you why you want to force him you can have one or the other glory be to god amen this is when people start to judge children you know take children attitude the bible says foolishness is in every child amen and because we sometimes we become so self-righteous and think that well the mother is not training him right or the father is not training him right you know all you have to do just pray you know just pray wait until you get there but you see this is this is god's purpose this is what is in his mind that's what bran said this morning he says this is this is doctrine this is teaching this is where the rubber meets the road because that's where we come into we are coming to that climax the people in the world they can feed it they don't know what is happening but we know what is happening we have the information because the word of god declared it to us and just like i said wednesday night the baptising of the holy ghost is our way of escape amen the holy ghost young people is your way of escape from this present evil word don't take nothing less than that don't take a favorite pastor don't take nothing less than the holy ghost because if you don't have the holy ghost we will soon read your own post on facebook how i was in the message and this is what it do in the message and in the message it's just control in a message is bunnish i have to be free you kept yourself in bondage out of this why you kept yourself because those things were in you to do [Music] you love the lord this morning praise the lord that's the time we are coming to sorry i was just all over the place i couldn't go go in any direction i don't know who was you had staring anyway so you were the one driving the car this morning you know so uh uh but we just want to thank the lord we want to be grateful to him for for encouraging our hearts reminding us of those things that we have been told before if you i mean if you didn't hear it before you hearing it the first time you know uh i will be glad to share more with you and uh so uh [Music] we are just so grateful but you see that's the time that we are living in you know we are coming to that time where there is a great spirit of jealousy you know that is that is creeping up every man want to be the man of the hour praise the lord every man wants to be the man of the hour so a spirit of jealousy is creeping people that comes uh you know around the message and i really never you know grabbed the revelation they struggle with the thought of a preacher referring to brother brandon brother brandon brother branham people that have sat around the message long and i have never got a revelation they also struggle with that thought you know why can't i be free to say what i want to say they want some glory they want some manifestation they want they want to produce something just a spirit of jealousy because of jealousy jacob i mean joseph woke up early in the morning he just go to his father daddy had this dream he did not make it up why were the brothers jealous that he had to save him i mean sell him that youth he was robbed of all his youthfulness never got to play games because he went to egypt as a seven but it was jealousy it was jealousy when quran and dayton rose up in the wilderness why moses moses is just moses and aaron moses and aaron praise the lord but you remember all of these years they've been in egypt whether they were riding big cars whether they were living in decent homes they were still slaves they did not change their status they were still a slave because a pharaoh rose of that never knew joseph they were all in egypt and none of them enter pharaoh house and say let my people go but when moses step on the scene they say you want to cause problems for us praise the lord when he got to the red city we're all complaining this is what we said you just wanted to bring us here to for us to die none of them had the road to stretch it over that river for it to part and with their eyes not in their dream with their eyes they saw the water pattern but yet it was not enough to convince them that this was the vindicated man of the hour they wanted their name to be in the story they wanted for people to talk about them you know that brother he got a mighty ministry he got a mighty ministry so what was it a spirit of jealousy they say we we too we are from the levi tribe we have a right to minister to the people now only moses and what did god there he opened the earth and swallow innocent people innocent people that will not take time to read the word but they will just follow whatever is posted quran and dayton started posting we are from the liver trap too it's not only moses and this is so everything they read on on on their own opposed you think facebook is only now they have just come to you in the morning since but man has been posting the bible called them gain sales [Music] gain sales opinion of man that is able to gain the minds of people and god opened the earth and swallowed those people because they never took time to stay with god's word and read god's word they should have asked themselves a question what was quran and dayton when we were in egypt praise the lord saint john chapter 9 the blind man the pharisees came to him and says this man i open your eye he has a devil he says the first thing whether he has a devil or not what i know i was blind and now i can see [Applause] so if you always sit down here and a man that has devil will open my eyes i think we will worship that devil together [Applause] [Music] i've been with you guys since i was born i come here to the temple gate every morning can you tell him he said he got he has a devil that y'all went to school that you guys studied the straw that you know all the law of moses don't bring that argument to me what i know for myself is that i was blind his eyes could not see [Music] and now i can see the other qualification not qualified he's qualified he disqualified that you're arguing what i know musicians you can come praise the lord what i know i was blind [Applause] and now by the light i can see praise the lord praise the lord amen now sister uh this is mary thanking god for granting her
