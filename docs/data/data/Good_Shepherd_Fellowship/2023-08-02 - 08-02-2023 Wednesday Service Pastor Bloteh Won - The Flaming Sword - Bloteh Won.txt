each and every one of us sorry we couldn't make the service on Sunday but we want to thank the Lord that the Holy Ghost was here praise the Lord amen I think brother Stephen was praying and and mentioning the service on Sunday it was brought down there preaching that brother one hey praise the Lord so uh we thank the Lord for that let's take our Bibles in Hebrew chapter four Hebrew chapter 4 we want to just uh take a thought uh Hebrew chapter 4. thank you for your prayers thank you and Hebrew chapter 4 tonight I was on a on a daddy's Duty and that kind of for caught us over there in in Philadelphia but we we had also the privilege to visit with brother Otis in the group there and I spoke with him before we left and I knew he had a visiting preacher so I intentionally never told him I was going to be around because I did not wanted to this you know kind of a structure what they had playing there and uh so when we didn't make our flight in the morning I just called him and then he came to pick us up so he had Brother Francis a young brother from DC preaching there and and it was wonderful it was wonderful for us to be with them so Hebrew chapter four let's read verse 11 and uh 12. let us labor therefore to enter into that rest at least any man fall after the same example of unbelief it's only the word that can bring rest so Paul is going to tell us how we can enter into that rest for the word of God is quick and Powerful and sharper than any two edges swore piercing even to the dividing asunder of the soul and the spirit and of the joints and maroon and it's a descender of the thoughts and the intents of the heart neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight but all things are negative and open unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do so the one that we are dealing with tonight nothing is here from him let's ask blessing father we just want to thank you that uh that make you awesome Lord you know where we are tonight you know the thoughts that goes through our mind you know father every bit of our heart tonight father Lord you know our needs and so we pray that Lord God you will just meet us where we are tonight from the pulpit to the peel speak to us out of your word in Jesus name amen amen the Lord bless you you may have your seed so I had this sorry I had this uh had this thought can also put this on after I wore my jacket so I can push through everything up foreign [Music] so I was I was talking about uh uh the fight for Ministry I was I was actually looking at this and I wanted to speak on uh uh the Flaming swallow I was going to talk on the cherubins in the Garden of Eden that was given to wash the way of the treat of life so uh that's the direction I want to go I was actually standing there on Friday night for some reason I couldn't sleep so I was spend some time up studying that so we had that burden in our heart so brother Otis asked that we greet the church so we just have to tell them what was on our heart so I spoke a little bit on that and before the preacher came and so we want to go in that direction tonight but let's go to Hebrew chapter 1. Hebrew chapter one Hebrew chapter 1 . now when we were we were looking at this uh we we were talking about the the the angels [Music] we pick up there from the Sun where David said his angels are ministering spirits so Paul used the same thing here but I want for us to look at it I want for us to look at it closely as we read Hebrew chapter 1. Paul said here Hebrew chapter 1 verse 1 God who at sundra times and in Davos manner speak in time past unto the fathers by the prophets in Davao manners he used different ways to bring his word to To His prophets praise the Lord in a message I have seen but now I've heard brother Branham say God used Visions God use inspiration God you dreams different ways that he he was able to bring bring the words to the prophets in time pass verse 2. have in these last days spoken unto us by his son praise the Lord whom he have appointed hearers of all things by whom also he made the worst now when you when you look at this and make you and make us as Bible Believers and and and the message Believers it make you to look very closely here because he said in this last day he has spoken to us by his son but he's connecting the song that was made flesh also with the son that created all things in the beginning praise the Lord amen he says whom he have appointed hearers of all things and by whom also he made the worst of the entire universe now so we see here that uh this song that he has spoken to us by when he was Jesus it was the logos made flesh that's what Paul wants for us to pick up here that the same one that spoke the word in existence was the same one that became flesh and it's the same one that is with us tonight praise the Lord amen now Paul is using this Foundation to be a for to be able to help us to see the importance of the word we can never put our gifts or our sensation above the word amen he's helping us for us to be able to see the importance of the word so I wanted because in Hebrew 4 12 he says that word is sharper then two edges for so that's the reason why I came back to this verse so we can see in the Old Testament he used different ways he used different manifestations he spoke through uh the the you spoke with lightly and thunder on the Mountain uh uh uh Moses there was uh you know a burning bulge uh uh concerning the birth of something and enjoy appeared to his parents God used different ways but in this last day his major way is his word praise the Lord so no matter how he speaks to us whether we have a dream or a vision that's the reason why every gift must be brought back to the word no matter how real it sounds if it cannot goes through the word don't have anything to do with it in this last day he has spoken to us by his son now if you are in the tradition you will take it back to to Jesus of Nazareth but that son is still here the revealed word of the hour are we together now so uh I wanted to to establish their first and then uh let's let's read let's read down a little bit it will it will help us here we'll be in the brightness verse 3 of his glory they expressed image of his of his person and ofholding all things by the word of his power when he had by himself porch our sins sit down on the right hand of the majesticid on high be made so much better than the angels as he have by inheritance obtained a more excellent Name than they For unto which are the Angels say he at any time there are my son this day how far begotten thee again I will be to him a father and he shall be to mean a son praise the Lord and again when when he bringeth in the first begotten into the word he said and let all the angels of God worship Him now you see the uh this verse explained what brother Branham shared in question and answer in Genesis where he says that the uh God is an object of worship so when he when he brought the first big Garden which was the logos then the Angels worship the logos and by that God became God because there was an object of worship are we together I'm going somewhere with this and of the angels He said who maketh his Angel spirit and his Minister a flame of fire praise the Lord that's that's where I want to to get with this you go uh uh and of his angels He said we'll maketh his Angel spirit and his ministry the flame of fire now we read back in Genesis chapter 3 word those cherubins to God the treat of life praise the Lord and and that's what we want to we want to uh we want to do it on tonight so yeah there are some things that uh brother Brandon said yeah let me read this one from pagama from pagama's Vision he said talking on Hebrew 4 12 the word of God is quick and powerful and sharpered in and in two edges swore piercing even to the dividing the Thunder of the soul and the spirit and of the joints and the marine and it's a descender of the thoughts and the intents of the heart it is the word praise the Lord is the word that does all of that it is performing where onto it was him for it the word is full of power it is the same spirit that was in Jesus the word amen it was the word when he told the the the the the woman at the word you're having five husbands the one you awake it was just the word praise the Lord amen it is the same spirit that was in Jesus the word that is present again in the church in this last age as a last sign trying to hear the people all from joshmen for they they reject him the word are now already come to Josh joshman crucifying him at fresh no so he identified that same gift as a sign that come to the last day Church which of course is the ministry of the son of man that uh the manifested in brother Branham is the word said that word never stop with that son of man Ministry that word was promised to continue with the bride so we still have the gift of discernment not in the one-man Ministry amen anybody trying to do that that would be a impersonation we have the word the word descend our needs are we together the word is the one that discern our needs and minister to the same praise the Lord now so when we look at this uh this this this thing of uh uh uh bringing the the the Cherry beans are the the treat of like brother Branham say this and I want for us to follow it a little bit here because we're talking around the fight for Ministry Ephesian Church age to him that overcome I will give to eat of the treat of life which is in the midst of the paradise of God what a thrilling thought is this the Tree of Life In the Garden of Eden which could not be approached unto because of the fall of Adam is now giving to the Overcomers the Flaming sword of The Guiding cherubim has been shared but it was not shared air is blade was blotted with the blood of the Lamb let us meditate upon this truth the white as we consider why the tree was denied to Adam and his descendants but noun aloud again praise the Lord so we asked yeah we are actually here to meditate but then see when brother Branham came to the resume of the age he said it's also referring back to their same uh uh verse again them that have overcome we eat of the tree of life he says resume of the age he says to him that overcometh will I get to eat of the Tree of Life in the Paradox of God the church already invaded too deeply in too deeply of the tree of death or a denomination of false Vine Wu ends is the Lake of Fire but there I know cherubins with flaming soil to guide the treat of life now God does not now depart from the midst of his church as he departed from eating oh no he will ever be in the midst of his church until the final age and until that time he calls to all to come now so uh if you look at this subject and you look at the two codes that we have just read uh uh year in the resume of the age brother Branham is bringing this thought up as if uh uh with God being in the midst of his church we do now have their physical manifestation of uh of the Flaming sword in one sense what actually it is is uh you remember taking on the whole armor of God brother Branham says that that that those faithful Ministry is God dress word so if God is in the midst of his church you know he embodied the fight for Ministry praise the Lord amen so uh that's that's what he's uh he's uh trying to to make us to honest him because in the Ephesian Church age he says that uh the the the Fleming salt what was shaded okay uh the the cherubins Shaded their flaming soil after the the the sharing of the Lamb's blood he says we must meditate on that how God would now keep his children away from the treat of life but now they are now asked to come back to the Tree of Life pray to praise the Lord amen now we spoke about the cherubins and we took them in types of their four faces and and we said how each one of those faces uh take a representation in the faithful Ministry now so he gave his angels uh uh just like uh uh his Angel spirit and his ministers flames of fire so the fight for Ministry now plays the role of what the cherubins were doing to the treat of life praise the Lord that's where I want to bring this whole talk now that there are faithful Ministry they place the role of what the cherubim the cherubim that was placed in the Garden of Eden was to keep men from coming but now on the faithful Ministry is to bring them back to the treat of life are we together not to bring people to church but to the truth of life not to bring people to themselves but to the treat of life that is the purpose of the ministry to guide the people back to the Tree of Life praise the Lord now so let's get into what we want to talk about a little bit tonight if the Lord will allow us to be able to explode it now we read here word Paul says that the word of God is sharper than any two edges swore amen praise the Lord that the word is sharper than ending two edges swore when uh when I share this let's let's go back a little bit yeah let's take some few scriptures here Deuteronomy chapter six let's read four and five praise the Lord are we together if we will be able to achieve what God or deemed to achieve with his word I mean with his church or with his people we must major on the word nothing less than the word amen we can we can we can uh you know uh bring uh you know create uh uh activities and other programs for the church but nothing will be able to achieve God's desire for his people than the word amen I mean we can we can have barbecues we can we can we can choose to do while uh a full shedder and uh you know and and and and and put uh you know a kind of a tent right by the side of the road and decide to feed this community I mean all of those things are good but there is nothing that will be able to achieve God's desire for his church and his people than the word praise the Lord amen and uh they are there are different programs you know uh to help people manage anger they are different programs to help people marriage relationship manage relationship there are different programs to help people raise their children you know and all of that all of those things are wonderful praise the Lord but let's realize as Believers that uh the word of God is the most successful thing to use praise the Lord so Deuteronomy chapter 6 Moses said here let's read verse 4 year o Israel the Lord our God is one Lord and thou shall love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy might praise the Lord and these words which I commanded this day shall be in thine heart are we together let's look at Mark chapter 12. Mark chapter 12 in the New Testament Jesus pick up their very statement of of Moses Jesus pick up their very statement of Moses Mark chapter 12 verse 29 Jesus answered him the first of all the commitment is ye o Israel the Lord our God is one Lord and thou shall love the Lord thy God with all the heart with all thy sword with all thy mind and with all that strength this is their first commandment praise the Lord now when Moses said that he says love the Lord with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might when Jesus speaks of this he introduced another element which is the mind praise the Lord Oma in the Book of Romans Paul uses the mind and the spirit he he he use he uses talking about a spirit he will talks about the mind and talking about the mind you know he used the mind and the spirit so I want for us to watch this as we as we look at this together and Jeremiah chapter 17. Jeremiah chapter 17. praise the Lord Jeremiah chapter 17. are we together amen Jeremiah chapter 17 this is a verse that is very familiar to every one of us now Jeremiah 17 does verse 9 9 and 10. we're going to look at together the heart is the heart okay get caught up with different verses yeah the heart is deceitful Above All Things and desperately weak it who can know it are the laws search the heart I try the range even to give every man according to his ways and I call him to the fruit of his doing praise the Lord amen now uh when you look at this actually when you when you when you said it on this verse you will see in a way that Jeremiah described the heart here being deceitful above all things and desperately wicked and it means that the heart uh that word desperately wicked means that the heart is incurable the heart of man is incurable praise the Lord and you see that's the reason why when you look in the scripture God never talks about curing the heart he talks about I'll give you a new heart praise the Lord because the the the the the the fall makes our heart deceitful above everything and desperately wicked and moreover who can know it praise the Lord are we together now so uh uh realizing that we are caught in their situation we are caught at that place that I mean that's that is what we are we are born with let me go let me go a little further uh Matthew chapter 15. let me go a little further here it will help me to be able to follow my thoughts here a little bit our emphasis here is making the word having the preeminence we can you can follow your thoughts praise the lord we must follow the word you can follow your feelings we must follow the word amen is only the word that can deliver us your feelings can lie to you your thoughts can also lie to you if it is not in line with the word now uh now Jesus said here I'll just read verse 19. uh he says out of the heart proceed evil talks murder adultery fornication teeth false witness blaspheming out of the heart proceed out of there when you when you look at that carefully it helps us to be able to see you see there are some of the things that that will that makes us to really appreciate uh the son of man Ministry because with what Jesus said here out of the heart proceed evil thought and it proceed all of these evil things then we realize that the heart that the Bible is talking about for us to love the Lord with all of our heart it is not this muscle that pumps our blood because if it is this muscle then the doctors that work on heart must be able to take evil thoughts praise the Lord they must be able to go in there and take evil thoughts and and you know and take all of these things uh thieves and false witness and all of these things that Jesus said that proceed out of their heart they must be able to to operate us and take it from that praise the Lord but let's let's read something here of brother Branham second coming of the Lord amen I wish of course we are all familiar with he says when it said that you know God said as a man thinking in his heart the scripture say out of the heart this the scientists said that God got everything mix up there was no mental faculty in the heart to think with he has to think with his mind his mind was the only thing that he could think of and that was his heart with his mind but God just made a mistake when he said heart heart when he said heart he means heart praise the Lord I want to be able to say this one I'm just I'm just reading in in my mind is not together when he said heart he means hot a few weeks a few weeks ago Medical Science found that in the center of the heart is a tiny little place that doesn't have blood cells or anything around it and they claim medical science claim it is is their occupation of the Soul animal doesn't have it so after all God was right man things with his heart now so yeah brother Brandon now making us succeed that even signs us realized that uh there is a compartment in the human heart where blood do not go now so he's he's making us to be able to see that uh uh that place it's a special place that place is uh uh the the where the sword of man is he said where men think it from praise the Lord amen amen now we get back to what the Apostle Paul says the word of God is sharper than any two edges swore and it goes to it it uh it goes to the he says and it's piercing even to their divided asunder of the spirit and the Soul what does that mean praise the Lord and tore the joints and the marriage and is at the center of the thoughts and the intents of our heart praise the Lord that's just how powerful the word that we sit under is when we realize that our mind is not our brain that compartment there where blood do not goes to the word gets into that compartment and is is able to be able to tell your spirit Reign and is able to tell your soul Raymond you know and brother Branham will go back to tell us about our subconscious and and and all of that praise the Lord we shall cause over and over he make us to realize that that is what the real U is that's where the word is is is is designed and predestined to deal with you praise the Lord this body that we have that is you know that is made out of uh you know James from our father our mother that runs down from our grandparents you know we we are just caught up in this body and there are a lot of things that we deal with in this body praise the Lord Thou Art against us he says the Apostle Paul again says you know when oh who will deliver me from this Wretched Man that I am praise the Lord because he's he's now realizing he's now realizing how much he have trained himself to follow the law to follow the tradition of his father praise the Lord and how he have disciplined himself you know what to keep the word to live by the message but he will also realizing that he kept coming short of their zeal he kept coming short of that desire praise the Lord and after being saved and and and being converted by the Holy Ghost he realized that there was a new work that was taking place from within praise the Lord with everything that he knew about the Lord and everything he knew about the word but there was uh uh uh uh uh a desire a longing in his heart even though his his flesh was filling him his mind was filling him and and then he couldn't even see better with his eyes after that experience but in his heart praise the Lord there was this longing are we together now so you see the the the the the very there is the responsibility of the ministry if we if we if we if we just sit down and realize that is to make sure you see that's the reason why this word must not be mixed with nothing because it's only the word and the word alone that can goes in that channel praise the Lord amen while telling somebody you know you know you know your parents used to serve the Lord your you know and and just plain on their emotion you can make them feel sorry for you can just do it in their Spirit Room but it will never be able to address the situation in their soul praise the Lord the purpose of the word is to be able to address that compartment whatever is in that compartment praise the Lord that's the purpose of the word that's where the word is aiming at are we together and then if if we are laboring together as he have called us to be laborers with him that is the place that we must be focusing on also that is the place where we must be focusing on that is the place where the image of Christ is built because the image of Christ is built by the word are we to together now so you see the thing about it there is the other that's the reason why Paul says that you know I've not come with enticing words of men wisdom I've come preached the gospel with the the demonstration of the Holy Ghost he was he warned us against uh you know uh uh preaching psychology praise the Lord and what psychology would do that I mean they would just they would just wash your life parting wash the things you eat and you know when you wake up and you know how your mood is in the morning and and how your mood is in the afternoon and you know all of those things they will steady and uh you know God has blessed people in that area they have been able to help people but you see it does not bring conviction it does not bring the the body change the only thing that is designed to bring the body change the only thing that is designed to give us the overcoming power is the word praise the Lord psychology is not it's not a design praise the Lord you see and it put lot of responsibility on the ministry to know what is the word of the hour what do we need to be feeding on praise the Lord and we must bring the world we must we must you know uh put the you know the the bride the church right into into the the message of the hour that's where rapturing faith is it is not I mean just to make us happy or just to preach and make the church sign no we must be able to put the church right in the word because it is him with whom we have to do it is him that we have to deal with praise the Lord there are uh uh an individual uh you know frustration look at this look at this also let me read this to you getting close to uh close enough yeah Birmingham share this in the message revealing God revealing himself to his people he says now this is not mentor telepod and neither is this neither is it's psychology Peter said at the gate of beautiful to the man that sat there he says look on us is that right Jesus told the woman said bring me a drink he got in contact with her Paul why he was preaching he said to the man said I perceive that you have faith to be healed is that right then it is in Psychology is the power of God so what the brother Branham is talking about yeah Peter said look on us making contact the word must make contact that's where it takes effect praise the Lord all the preacher will carry out all his emotion he will be shouting he will be you know jumping up of everything he's doing he's just trying to get your attention so the word can take contact so the world can be able to nail right to that place what they want to address in our life praise the Lord amen and I mean I mean just like uh uh just like the woman or the word that says sir I perceive that you are a prophet the word took contact what did he do equipping her amen a quick in her and and and and you experience that when the world take contact you says wow yeah that word is is spoke directly to me the word pick up something in uh not just you know uh uh you know in in enjoying the majority of everything the preacher is saying but how the word address things in our life now most of the time it's not just the sense of telling you things that you are doing wrong that's not the only work of the word but the word comes also to be able to take you sometimes from tradition when you do you you have established a way of doing things and you think that is the way and the word comes in and you see it in the world wow it brings correction the word corrects the error are we together that's how it makes contact that's when it's a blessing when it makes contact open your understanding praise the Lord amen I mean I mean just like was that last week also yet last week Wednesday we we rarely cooked there better brand was talking about that woman you know uh that he that he knew she had the Holy Ghost you know but uh uh just to be able to give her their self-confidence brother Branham says I pray Lord that you allow her to speak in tongues praise the Lord because you want to Psalm some athlete manifestation she wanted some kind of a manifestation to be able to Anchor her faith praise the Lord I was following the service on Sunday I mean brother Dan preaching did on uh where he found faith what was running through my mind as I was listening I said you know what uh Jesus knowing the time that we will be leaving him praise the Lord and some of the elements of this time that we are living in is that uh what our trouble is there are a lot of things of the age that is creating fear there are a lot of things of the age also that there is there is there is never a time where we have fats amen being an Information Age it has given us a lot of facts praise the Lord so this is an age that is driven with fats feared and faith praise the Lord I mean just just say something people just take out their phone they go and check it up and see if it's fat is an Information Age we are driving people live their life out of fats it's not true I don't believe it they just they just send it through the window amen because they cannot find no information on it and another spirit that is driven The Edge is a spirit of fear we are living in a time of uncertainty the world is changing rapidly in a way that oh wow I mean the middle of August we have a rainstorm praise the Lord I was just thinking about that our law knew exactly what we will be dealing with he knew exactly the time the spirit that will be dominated in our age praise the Lord oh yeah I mean back there the people uh I mean it was it was a treasure to have the word of God now we can have 15 different translations on our phones it was such a treasure such a treasure to to have the word and many of them did not even have a uh have a Bible it was just if they had a confidence in a man whatever the man says they hang their soul onto it praise the Lord but it's not like that now we're having we have in the Bible every word we have the message we can go and search out what are you telling us what the prophecy on that which is a good thing but that's not what we are called to base our walk on amen sons of God Sons and Daughters of God are led by the spirit and we are called to live a life of faith praise the Lord our faith in God's in God's word in God's promised word must be above everything we know that is fats praise the Lord amen because even if you take you take some some uh some health situations that we go through I mean you go to see the doctor the doctor give you his report everything he says it's a fact praise the Lord but Fox will not bring will not bring healing it's faith in God's word that will bring healing praise the Lord amen but sometimes for us to be able to to to step up to that place of of uh of of faith and and take God God I'm standing on your promise I'm holding to your word sometimes we need to understand what is going on with the body are we together brother bam says if if if a man was was was condemned to die he was sentenced to die he will be hanged tomorrow morning he says I mean there's there is nothing that fear will do fear will kill him before even he think fear will kill him before even death reach him he says but faith can change the situation praise the Lord faith can change the situation I mean that is the time that we are living that is the spirit that is dominating the age whether you like it or not we all we go in and out of it we like to prove things we would like to make sure the information is truth I would like to gather truth on these things but our walk with God must not be driven by those things amen we believe in a God that can change situation we'll be living the god that can heal the sake amen we believe in a god that is that is among his people are we together I believe that's what I better brand I'm addressed here he says uh uh we read that before then in the the resume of the age he says that the the church already embedded too deep on the tree of death you know the false bind denomination whose ends is in the Lake of Fire but there are no cherubins with flaming soil to guide to the to the tree of life now why because God is in the midst of his church and he's not going to leave praise the Lord so if you just you just think about that you know that he's in the midst of his church and he's not going to leave amen he gave us all of these gifts and the sole purpose of it is to lead us back into his presence that's the sole purpose of it is to lead us right back into his presence so you think about that again you know uh uh I mean we we we go with we we go through different things I mean there there's there are some things you you you you take an even through it of yourself you see uh uh uh uh things that your body is going through and and things your mind is going through we must be able to bring all of those things on a suggestion to the word you must be able to bring all of those things your feelings your fear bring everything to what God is doing in that little compartment in your heart praise the Lord if you believe that God is dealing with you you believe that he's speaking to you you believe that he's changing your life then whatever you are going through you have to bring it to that place you have to bring it to that place because that is the place where the word is going the word is not the word the word is not going to uh uh is is not is not coming to your feelings is not coming is going to that place is sharper than the two-edges sword and even if look at the beautiful thing that Paul says here even to the joints and the marrow it goes right down there and then it's even distributed to bring healing to our body when a word is received in that compartment it goes every word in our body where we need healing the word address it where we need cleansing the word address it where we need to re-address our thought the word address it you see but when a person you if you are just taking the word from a place of reasoning praise the Lord you will just think your mind will just go your mouth would just go but you will not get the effect of the word but when a person is receiving the word speak to me Lord amen that's the reason why sometimes we sit on a year in the word and uh I mean you you hear the word you receive the word and and then sometimes uh uh uh in a week something from the word that you have received just speaks to you amen and just come back to your mind and it stays on your mind for a while say oh wow oh wow yeah oh I see why oh okay I understand that's what he was talking about are we together you see this this particular verse in the Bible it really destroyed the psychology amen psychology might be able to talk and help people in human behavior but to be able to bring a solution to be able to bring healing and deliverance when it comes back the word praise the Lord the word goes straight to that compartment it castings away from our spirit the word receive in that compartment of our soul it create more love in your heart for God it brings your body subject it puts your soul in uh uh uh uh in more fellowship with God praise the Lord he want to make contact amen the world want to make contact I listened to brother Branham he says he says over rubber was good he said over rubber will tell the people you know he had a television program he says he said make contact put your hand on television he says oh yeah if you have in your Bible there just just put your hand on your Bible or or whole whole hands he said but he didn't get it you know he didn't get it that was his way of trying to help the people to make contact with the word claiming faith for their healing praise the Lord by the way that God designed for his word to make contact with us is a word going to that dividing the sunder of our soul and our spirit amen even at the center of our thoughts the intents of our heart praise the Lord amen the brother Graham says the nine the nine uh fruits of the spirit he says you cannot go to any address to Walgreens or CVS and and be able to buy Loft and and be able to buy all of these all of these fruit of the spirit you see so it brings us to the place where we have to realize there is something big you know the prophet of God will say is that you can create another word and go and live on it praise the Lord amen there is something if if a Son of God or that or a daughter of God God can just get us to be able to to uh uh uh you know understand the way he's dealing with us and know that you know this is is far beyond of everything our our senses is is reflecting to us most of the time we are caught up in our senses praise the Lord but God has not given us the spirit of fear amen he have not given us the spirit of fear he had given us assignment but let me ask you a question don't you feel afraid yeah you do feel afraid why it's your body it's your five senses where God has not given you a spirit of fear is that it's in that little compartment there is no fear that the words there is the place where he's dealing with you your mind but when God get a hold of your heart and you are able to Center your mind on him you realize the fear just go away you will always have a sense of fear in this body your five senses will always speak fear to you but when it comes to that little compartment fear does not worry praise the Lord are we together that's the reason why it's it's it's major on the word bringing us back to the Tree of Life it's not just uh you know uh uh because that's that's the place where Adam was he was dealing with God from from a realm where he never knew fear he did not new doubt he never even knew he was naked you think about it he's naked he never knew where was he dealing with God from not from the body speaking things into existence and calling this mountain I don't want naming the animals and grabbing the thought of God and manifesting it he was not dealing with God from this body he was living in such a realm that that lifted him above everything his body was going through praise the Lord so that's where the word is supposed to bring us praise the Lord amen that's where the word is supposed to bring us Jesus in his day he cried to the people it's nine o'clock I'll leave you here he cried to the people he says uh you know how how they have turned to the traditions of men turn the Commandments to the traditions of men the word that was supposed to be changing the people they have made forms out of it and the Word was losing its effect because we were we we were we were we were paying more attention to addressing people emotions people feeling oh I don't feel good about it okay let's do something about it yeah this sister don't feel good about this thing in the church so let's do the other person come with their own a feeling let's do it I mean we will have a mess let's stay with the word let's make the world happen let's look for the word to be manifested in our midst let the word brings Joy To Us amen we will not work out ourselves to let the world let them let us preaching of the word Rejoice our hearts are we together the joy of the Lord is our strength amen and Moses said love the Lord with all of your strength how can you put that strength into it the word has to give you the strength praise the Lord like uh no brother Stephen preach praying tonight and he says you know uh you know many of us who would not like to be yet you know and coming from work we are tired and but that word knowing that we kept you coming to Fellowship from that room something kicks in you it gives you a joy I want to be in church tonight if it is just the senses of the body I mean you I mean everybody would like to have the Wednesday off and we just make a Sunday service praise the Lord I mean even the ones that can that can make it and and and tuning into the service I mean it takes some kind of for joy of the word it takes a joy it takes a desire of the word it takes a strength that comes from within that's part of how your body feels but the moment you you you you give into that it turns on it takes over the weakness of your body praise the Lord your mind is set for church your strength is coming I want to be in service I'm going to church praise the Lord how close with this I I know I know of a sister many years ago very lovely sister her husband believed the message and and she was not a Believer she was a Catholic and uh uh you know he was he was he was he was a man of a varied uh #he was a diplomat and then uh you know he would go to church and and uh you know she will she will always be wondering you know I mean you know I mean I mean why he's just he's so dedicated to water uh you know and but then she was finding her way to be uh I mean when he's around she don't want to have nothing to do with the message when he's not around then she found her way to be able to read what is in this thing that he's really reading you know and you should go as you read the message you know it's not making sense to harden you know and on and on and then one day uh one of the things that were bothering her was was in a way that uh you know uh uh you know Mary was there with you know the the way that the Catholic Church put a lot of reverence on Merit you know the mother of God the Holy Mary and all of that you know and the way message Believers would talk about you know her husband was a preacher too you know he became a preacher leader and the way he would talk about married and I mean she just couldn't stand it you know so she said one day she was just there and the thought hit her hit her mind and uh uh and it it kind of addressed this whole thing about about this the merry subject in her mind that uh uh that's a beautiful beautiful way that she said it I can I can be able to remember a word for word but it was more like uh no matter how we think about Mary and no matter how people what they say about Mary it does not change what the actual you know young virgin wants you know in in their sense whether we are making too much of her or whether people are trying to degrade her it does not change what she wants you know she was what she was you know so she said that that thing just changed her mind so one day her husband is going to church and and he got read it and then you know he he uh he uh and and she she playing secretly that she was going to join him and never told him that she was going to join him but he got ready knowing that his wife would stay home or you know uh do her just get in her place and just do her sign of the cross and do her Catholic prayer and all of that he got ready and uh and he says as soon as he drove he got to the to the security gate he called the the wife called the security and tell and tell them to stop her husband and uh they stopped stopping he says oh your wife said you should come back so he was wondering why oh I wonder what happened you know he ran back quickly thinking that maybe she was not well or so and that's when he got back up she says I'm going to church with you I mean that was the biggest shock in his life okay praise the Lord but what happened was there the because she was reading the word she was reading the word the word was able to find her praise the Lord the word was able to find her another another testimony there is the other uh a brother there over in uh uh uh Alabama he took a seven Church age book and he told a friend of his I think it was a Baptist preacher but a denomination of preacher he says stick this book if you will read this book if you will read this book and just apply what this book is saying your church will grow praise the Lord he said if you would just read this book The Seven Church ages give it to the to the man and say if you would just read this book and just apply what is in the book your church will grow so he said that the gentleman took took the book from him their seventh Church age book and he went and started reading the book and you know and he's oh wow you know and it's I mean he's he's coming to the pulpit and he's he's preaching what is in the book praise the Lord and grow not only in the sense of Amiga Church but the people started growing in the word they started having desire to go back and look in the scripture and see what he was saying they didn't know why he was getting it from but whatever he was saying it was scriptural praise the Lord so you see the word has the power to do its work it has its power to do his work praise the Lord and he came back and met the brother and said and says I I don't know what's happening but exactly what you said is happening my people beginning to respond to the word I beginning to feel the effect of my preaching in church because the word has the power to change our life praise the Lord if we will just take the word and apply it to our our situation we will get a positive result amen a word that was in chaos and darkness all God had to do was speak his word let there be light and there was light and that word was able to bring an Eden it was able to bring an author in the midst of Chaos when we start to take our thoughts and our desire the way we want things above the world the way we think things should be above the word praise the Lord you are just hanging yourself for a great fall because you hold to that thought you hold to that thought the day it does not manifest you're going to fall because God is not obligated to our thoughts he's not obligated to our feelings he's not obligated to your fear God is obligated to his word praise the Lord the same way happy for that brother uh uh uh wife a happy for another sister husband uh the very same thing a very good family there uh in the in the Ivory Coast also you know this I mean we all used to call him a secret believer I was I was very surprised when uh when they called me that you know this day he just he just told his wife he was he wanted to be he he probably he just went straight forward he wanted to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus praise the Lord amen yeah I mean he I hang around this message so long and I mean he knew all the preachers he knew all the brothers praise the Lord and the word just worked you know the wife uh the children lived the best they know how to and the word takes effect praise the Lord the word of God is sharper and Powerful praise the Lord if we can just put that verse up let's read it together and then we go to the Lord in prayer musicians you can come up if we can just put that word that
