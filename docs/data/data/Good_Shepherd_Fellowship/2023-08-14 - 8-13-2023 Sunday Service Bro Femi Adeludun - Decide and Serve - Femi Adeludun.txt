John 13 34 and 35. sorry if I if I'm taking a little a little bit more time I mean that scripture basically talks about okay so this Jesus is saying a new commandment I give unto you that ye love one another as I have loved you that he also loved one another verse 35 he says by this shall all men know that ye are my disciples if no way I mean I can come to you and smile at you and talk nice to you but the love comes here it comes from here not from the facial expression even though that's part of it in acts when it says um the uh the apostles before yeah before they were in due when they were gathered up in a in the upper room they were not just gathered together they were in what one are called I mean we could be a pup someone could be in a different state but we could be one Accord in spirit but we could be gathered here and be laughing and be joking and be smiling at each other but in our hearts we are far apart in the dream what what appeared to me was uh Siva was in the church and faces were shown me and when you first popped up your heart the condition the state of your heart appears to me like I could see it that hasn't happened to me a lot of times a few times and sometimes I could just buy not even a person saying something I could pick their what is happening inside of them what your heart is doing what your mind is doing what you are feeling badly I could pick that we should love one another you know this happened to me last month and when I was listening to brother who wants a sermon on I think last Sunday he picked on something and all through the the sermon when I was listening to him closely he touched on very Cardinal things we are not just cut it here we don't just walk through those doors and come in here to hear some sermon feel good and just go home God is working on our hearts that's what it brings us here for not to just hear some things that will make us feel good but if God can do anything Among Us it will be on the premise that we love one another I could have a word for you but if your health is not receptive of that word I could give it to you but it will not benefit you because the basis that the soil that that the word will thrive on is is the condition of your heart and that is the love I think the second one will come later God bless you let's bow his let's pray the Lord's Prayer together Our Father was in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kid and come that will be done on Earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as he forgive those who trespass against us and lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from all evil foreign forever and ever amen amen our attorney service over to the preacher in the little why but let me just uh encourage you and and uh you know like I've always said is it's amazing that we just spoke about gives in in this season and I'm sure that the Lord is wanting to deal with us and and use us but you see then we we have been given the word of the the problem with with the churches or Through the Ages is that if we don't do things I call into the order of God's word and we will be doing God a service and we'll be completely out of his will okay brother Brian gave us an order how to be in church and when to be in church that's that's where the whole thing begins from you know when we get to church and he says that uh 30 minutes time is when we come in and we wait on the Lord and uh you know and pray before the service and and many times we see people coming doing his song service right in the midst of the service and all of that but may God help each and every one of us praise the Lord and uh and like I've always said uh I told the the song leaders the deacons you know uh testimonies and those things they come before the song service you know we must do those things just before we get into worship because you see uh uh the the the spirit goes in the level you know and we go from one level to another another level get ourselves ready before the world comes so uh when we get things all mixed up then sometimes it affects the moving of the spirit we know that uh uh we have we have few of uh the scenes that are now feeling well and that call in this morning we will we will take those knees to the Lord in prayer and uh even this message we've been playing on uh part of prisoner you know brother Branham says the problem with the church is that you can go back and see that in the message that's one of the things that I will have commented from the message he says we term now to be sincere with the things that we believe you know we term not to be sincere with the things that we believe we have to realize that uh the commission given to the prophet and the bride is here to continue their commission it's a commission that is in contrainity if we will be sincere the angel of the law said not not even cancer we stand before our prayer and and then how many times that angel has told Brother Branham you know how sincere we ought to be now so you see we have we have all of these things we have all of these things and I'm I'm fully convinced and uh you know that God wants to deal with us God wants to use us but we have to do things I call into God's word we have to follow the word of God we have to follow the author that is given to us are we together praise the Lord so uh uh and and like I've always said with many of you brothers and sisters that have uh you know dreams and different things the right order there is for you to write those dreams down and and give it to me you know because uh if a word will be brought before the church we have to the like the like the Bible says we have to we have to look at those things we have to line it up with the word okay that's that is the order that is given to us praise the Lord [Music] now uh uh I don't know when brother brother uh I think brother decimal might have given that in the midst of the service but uh I just think that that being a wonderful world of admonishment for the church it came right in the mace of Praise that is completely out of order that's not the way it's supposed to be that's not the way it's supposed to be all of those things that's what the church denomination have got into trouble for we have an author [Music] and we must follow that other if we if we would be pleasing to God we must follow their order we don't make Church work it's the word of God that makes trust work Jesus said I'll bail my my church and the gifts of hell will not prevailed against it are we together let's buy our hearts and and take these few needs uh to the Lord and [Music] just allow me if you would just please uh play Reach Out And Touch the law for me [Music] where Wesley called this morning sister carrot is now feeling well and uh blood pressure is still bothering her she was not able to sleep well and we mentioned brother John baby this morning brother Stephen bear prayed for him our sister Faith not feeling well so she and brother Joel in that in church brother Andrews called this morning he and his wife we should remember them they're not in church with us too and we're having a few ones that also travel we want to bring all of those needs before the Lord let's buy what has to be together Heavenly Father almighty God We Just Want to Thank You Lord father father honor no means Lord we want to honor mind

you prayed amen praise the Lord God bless you you can please be seated for a while I want to appreciate you all for coming to the house of the Lord we know Believers come to church and you're coming today is in response to God's Commandments and I believe the Lord will bless you abundantly amen before I go into the world I want to appreciate the pastor and his family and they've been taking care of me so well may the Lord bless you and you know yourself even to the grammar and the children may the Lord reward you immensely beyond your aspirations also there have been people who have loved to take me out for lunch and so forth I heard about them I pray the Lord will even bless those intentions amen I'm also want to bring greetings from my family my wife and the children they said I should greet you all we know we are not strangers to one another if we didn't meet their owners definitely by the grace of God in the meeting in the year none of us will be missing amen also from the church my pastor and the rest of the team I do coming coming communicate with them and they have expressed their desire that I should send greetings unto you I hope they are acceptable to you God bless you I want to assure you that we are moving fine and all is going well this is God's program and there's nothing the enemy can do about it amen God's will be done regardless Hallelujah even in your life amen God bless you um let's rise up for the word turn the Bible to the Book of Ruth chapter one we are reading three verses The Book of Ruth chapter one from verse 15 to 18. four verses Ruth chapter 1 verses 15 to 18. is on the screen in case you are not there so I can start reading and she said Behold thy sister-in-law is gone back unto our people and unto our gods return Thou after thy sister-in-law and rude said in treatment on to leave them or to return from following afternoon for whether so ever that goeth I will go and we are thou largest I will Lodge thy people shall be my people and thy God my God where thou direst will I die and there will I be buried the Lord do so to me and more also if odd but death party and me when she saw that she was steadfastly minded to go with her then she left speaking onto her amen may the Lord have blessings to the Rene of his holy word you can please receive him once again God bless you and you are welcome to the house of the Lord this morning by the special grace of God we'll be looking at a sermon I titled decisions amen we are this is an act that we all participating whether consciously or unconsciously I read that an average adult makes about 35 000 decisions every day so if you are an adult you make that decision consciously unconsciously even the decision to come to church today the kind of clothes you will wear where you will see it and everything they are all decisions amen and because of the significance of decisions in our life I felt that we need to know how to make those decisions Hallelujah the prophet preached about three sermons that specifically bothers on decision making he preached them time of decision power of decision and the result of decisions so I've collected those sermons and some others including choosing of a bride and the rest of them to to come up with this topic so I believe that by the grace of God at the end of it all we will know how to make our decisions amen because whether we like it or not we have to make decisions so it will be in our best interest to know how to go about it so that all the time we can make correct decisions Hallelujah so where we have read we read about sister Ruth who from account of the Bible she isn't even an Israelite she's from Moab praise the Lord I am if you remember the history of Moab Moab they are products of incest Moab is a son of lot by the daughter of lots Hallelujah I mean if you are good Bible readers you can go back to that I think in the Book of Genesis Maybe 19. so you can read about Lords and how Moab came into being so and it's kind of abomination in Israel for such a relationship to occur but Sister Rose I'm coming from that background we saw that Grace overlooks all such things Hallelujah so don't you can say oh my background it doesn't matter that's why Christ calls all amen and when Christ is calling all it does not matter who you are all you have to do is to yield to that call and your life will not remain the same Hallelujah so this sister Ruth is a product from such background but we saw that um she made a decision and then we see the procedure the way she did it and then today we cannot even talk about Christ especially his lineage without even talking about the same sister rules that's one of the importance of decision making Hallelujah from that story you can go back I think it's just about four chapters so I encourage you to read through them a man called elimelech who is from Bethlehem Judah and his wife Naomi we have sister Naomi here a wonderful sister God bless you so they've decided you know they were saying some action you know and that's why I believe us we don't live our ground your ground is not the United States of America your ground is the word of God hallelujah whatever you are doing in this life make sure it's within the context of the word that way God can back you up all the way halleluia but if you are doing your own will then you have to back yourself up I know man can help himself only God can help us so let's stay with the word amen so elimination Naomi they decided even though it's against the law of God for them to live their land because things are becoming summer so if things are hard today it's not the first time Solomon told us that there is nothing new Under the Sun if it's out today it has been had before and it will still be hard tomorrow but we have a promise that whatever it is we are more than conqueror through him that loved us so they decided to leave Bethlehem Judah for the land of Moab because the heart that things are moving down there that dollars are easier to make there so they moved Hallelujah and then the meaning of early Malik is worship means Pleasant so we have a pleasant worship moving from the land where they should be worshiping Hallelujah and then they give back to two children and Malon and chilon and the prophet unfortunately is said the meaning of Marlon and chillon is sickness and death so we wonder how can play some worship produce sickness and death you know maybe they are not correctly planted so we need to know we have to put in ourselves so now we can use correct fruits then in the course of time the worship died elimelech died in the land of Moab you know it looked like what's going on if you leave the word you know everything around Fellowship worship is very important I don't think we can over emphasize the importance of coming to church because it's part of the word Believers we're not coming to church it's a sacrifice and the more you give in to service the more you receive from it so let's be willing to do that I know God will bless you and you are doing that already so we saw in the eliminally died and then Naomi and our two sons they decided to take further step now the prophet told us I step into Aero without withdrawal leads to more steps into the error so if you notice we are making a mistake the first thing to do is to withdraw and then repent and correct your ways amen if you're correct on that part it can lead to God so they decided to marry the daughters of Moab which again the word of God said under no circumstantial a Believer marry a non-believer so they are broken two laws again now leaving the land and then marrying to the unbelievers and God is not responsible for that Hallelujah and so but God is saying everything and you see when we say the will of God will be done regardless there's nothing you do wherever you turn Bible said there is no divination nothing against God there is nothing this one that can be against God I can stand God will always have his way and that's why God's children is good to obey him because whether you like it or not is we will be done Hallelujah so let's get it done in the right way don't let us be dragged with arm and leg broken because we surely drag you in a man so they married these two sisters oppa and the rules is not even done with them he took the two sons away so Nami he said she said she went in full and came back empty he said the Lord was against her you know why if you read it you see that she was not saying it's God that was against her but she forgot that she ignored God's instruction before taking our decisions so he said oh the Lord that satisfied against me I'm left of the husband my two sons everybody is gone only me I'm left therefore let me go back to my base I think that's what she should have done earlier amen because when we see that we have made a mistake the person is to repent and get on the right track amen so she decided okay nothing to lose again I've lost all before I myself die let me run back Hallelujah she had the chance the others didn't have that chance and so that's why the word said today when you hear his voice hiding not your heart because you may not have tomorrow so why you have today make the best use of it amen so on our way back the two daughters-in-law decided to go with her oppa and Ruth and so she told them look the Lord has testified against me I mean there's nothing I have to offer you anymore your husbands are dead and myself I'm very old I can't if I ever give back today are you sure can you wait for the child to grow so there is no hope so just go back and the message was suiting to Hopper so she kissed her and left and then she was surprised Naomi that somebody was still standing and the person standing was Sister Rose say what what are you still doing your sister-in-law has gone back go away I have nothing for you and roots she's looked at the mother and I said look and treat me not to go back I have decided and that's why God is a topic decision halleluia she told her I have decided I am going with you amen your people they shall be my people those girls you told me to go back to I'm not going back there your own God will be my God hallelujah and you know she mentioned something you know we used to know that the greatest sacrifice is death there's nothing Beyond it she offered that look where you die there will I die and there will I be buried he said so there's nothing so now we realize that this lady she has decided there is no going back and the Bible told us she left talking Hallelujah and so when I read that and some of the other Summers I came up with the ways that Believers should make decisions amen so I found out that the first approach to decision making for believers is to put God first Hallelujah Whatever the song you are making whether it's physical whether it's spiritual whether it's for yourself or others make sure God is Central to that decision once you put God in that decision that means it becomes a program of God and then God doesn't fail amen so put God first there are accounts foreign the next thing to do in your decision making process is to ensure you do so on time Hallelujah don't just hang around and say well anytime I feel you can't you don't have all the time even though we are Eternal beings but the body we are operating with today is not etana ensure it's a wasting body and that's why God had other provisions because he has a glorified body for us this body cannot go in rapture Hallelujah and it's good to care for it but don't waste your time too much on that Hallelujah just keep it up so that I can serve you here because after here is of no use Hallelujah and that's why God said does that word to those thou return us that was talking about this body amen and so you don't have forever in making your decisions do so on time in the salmon time of decision paragraph 21 to 22 where I'm talking about the sister that she had um proposals from two good Brothers you know two of them were trying to get a hand in marriage but she couldn't make her mind up she didn't know whether to choose whether he or B and brother said because she wasted so much time she lost the two brothers so we need to make up our mind on time you can also check that in January Genesis 24 psalm 58. that's about sister Rebecca you know Hallelujah if you go through that one time Abraham he decided that Isaac should not marry from the daughters of the land you know that gospel has remained through from Genesis to Revelation Believers will marry believers saying you are going to go and look for a wife for my son among my Kindred so eliasa was taxed with that job and Eleazar haven't learned the ways of Abraham that Abraham put God first in everything he does when she go when he got there he prayed first and what was the prayer let it be that any daughter that I will ask for water and she will offer to give water to my Commerce and my men let that be the same one you have chosen for your son Isaac that was his prayer Hallelujah and we saw that Rebecca came up and then he approached and says look um I'm a I'm a traveler I need water to drink so oh no problem I have water first so let me rush and get your comments water and then he was surprised does that is that how God has prayers so quickly yes sometimes it does that but often time it doesn't come so quickly but ultimately he answers our prayers Hallelujah so Rebecca did that and then he asked whose daughters are you whose daughter are you I say I'm from Beethoven exactly where it was sent and then realized God has answered this prayer and he offered all the gifts and said take me to your home and when they go there they explain his mission and now God has answered this prayer and that's our brothers if we want to take on a wife you should be bold enough to go to their house you should be avoided enough to discuss with whoever needs to be discussed with there is nothing to hide about marriage relationship Hallelujah because it's Brahman said after the gift of after salvation the gift of your spouse is the next best thing and so it should be done with all the enthusiasm that we need and in line with the word amen so he got to the house and then they found out that well they said this is the move of God we have nothing against it but our sister is going to go with you can you let us stay with us for like 10 days you know so that we just look at her face and all that and then let us say please don't end up me saying that God has blessed me okay since they cannot agree they say let's ask sister Rebecca will you go with the man he said I will go today not tomorrow so decisions must be made on time Hallelujah another thing you need to do is that when you are making decision there it must be a clear-cut decision don't say I want black and white what do you want the black item or the white one you can't want the two so it must be clear cut I'm a Christian but um there's no but it must be a Christian and you must be ready to follow through in short you need to burn the bridges that leads you back that's what we call a clear-cut decision and that's what sister Ruth did he said there is nothing with me and more I begin so once I've married your son I have married Israel I am an Israelite your God are now my God anything about you is mine Hallelujah so believe us we need to make a clerical decision once there is so much ambiguity even the motivation to progress will be less so we have learned through things now your decision must have got a center theme of it then it must be made on time and then it must be clear-cut Hallelujah then another thing when you make a Clockwork decision decision requires service Hallelujah so everything whether you have decided to be a Christian there are Works to be done you are sleeping at home you have not made a decision amen even I want to be a mother oh I'm praying God give me fruit of the womb there is what's to be done amen because those children they require attention they cannot just say I'm a mother I don't have time for all these dirty things you are not ready there is work to be done and some of these works you cannot delegate them oh you shall get to Nani oh I will do this Hallelujah you are trying to dodge responsibilities in management you cannot delegate responsibility if I say oh help me sweep that floor but it's your job if the fly is not well swept you get the blame because you cannot delegate responsibility so children their responsibilities no matter you push each other and there is still your call amen so it doesn't matter where you are once you have them you have to give accounts and so when you remember that you know the work has to be done well and that goes for every other thing even children you are children at home does that when we are born in Christian home is God's heritage because some are born otherwise what do you want them to do but you are born in the light you know you're left from right you should appreciate God for that sometimes you look like oh they are buttoning us or they don't allow us to be free may the Lord help us that is the same they said they are trying to save a small chick from the oak but why do you think the chick is saying he said they don't allow me to have a good time yeah that's it and that's what our children think oftentimes good time is called to death and so those who know better than I said that ways there is no way there Insurance stay close but I say no I'm free I have your rights Brethren I will write this by the word Hallelujah that way we can enjoy the journey because all gods are for us Bible told us God's thought towards us is good to bring us to the expected end Hallelujah whether you are a child you are an adult all God's plan for you is for goodness sometimes they correct you but it's for your good once Believers understand this concept we go through our journey enjoy and peace amen so your decision will lead you to service oh I want to be I want to have my degree bachelor's associate whatever it is there is work to be done and you cannot pray with the service we go and fast for seven days so that I can pass exam without reading there is no word for it you will fail Hallelujah there is no shortcut to Victory Hallelujah someone should make decisions be ready to serve so in a quarter Cross Physical spiritual so there's no children also we are talking spiritual now let me just pray about it you pray about it you work about it Hallelujah then after that service God takes control you know your decision making now you have put God first in four items that I say work for God too and that's why I believe as the one of God acts 38 he said repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ then God will give you the gift of the Holy Ghost that's God's work in decision making too there is a rest for you amen there is a rest promise whether it's Christianity whether in your physical and the others that will be a time that you climax and then you can go on autopilot people often today they see physically now they see all those guys who have made some achievements and then young boy want to be like that you know a teenager I was 21 year old wants to drive Rolls-Royce because I see some adults driving it he didn't know that there is a journey between the two you know because everything is just in our faces but it's not just like that there are some things to be put in and so we say that in the case of rules which is our main subject after they got to Bethlehem Judah she looked at the mother-in-law say you are old now but I'm still young and then we've got to eat and this goes straight to the brothers you have a responsibility to take care of your own Bible told us that those who don't take care of their own they are worse than an infidel oh I'm looking for a job to sit in the office God will grant it pending that time you've got to do something Hallelujah I don't say oh I'm praying about it pray and walk and so Ruth when they got to Bethlehem Judah he said I've got to find something to do because we got to eat and so she decided to claim Bible said they came into Bethlehem Judah at the time of Bali Harvest and so you know according to the law of God God told them that when you want to harvest your crops don't Advance everything you know live some because of the poor of the land so that's what gleaning about when the investors are working whatever is Left Behind the glimmastic and so Ruth decided that that's what I would do because I mean maybe I don't have a work permit yet I don't have all this so I've got to do something you know we like to give excuses oftentimes God don't take excuses amen and so rude did not give excuse she went about doing the work because the Mother-in-law must do what she must eat and so she did that she was taking notice of that's why they find that she was a more abilities Bible said it has been reported to me that you're a virtuous woman she did not follow the young man whether I reach or poor she was focused on why she was on that land and so if we go to chapter three there nominal look at everything and say my daughter shall I not find rest for you that's where we are rest and what was the rest he said you are going to do now the advance is over I don't know how long it was for there'll be a festival a kind of party in that party you are going to dress properly the owner of the farm which is Boaz in someone kinsman redeemer that's like Christ to us a king's man who came to redeem us Hallelujah so that boy said Mark where are we sleep when in the night you go there sleeping under his leg uncover the feet and stay there the man would know what to do because of course there is a tradition now brethren whether this behavior is contrary to roots procedure in their country is relevant she told the Mother-in-law all that you tell me I will do Hallelujah you know he said well I'm a message believer the message commands so you must believe it oh don't say I take exception then you are not ready to follow and so rude said all that you tell me I will do it and she did and when a boy has woke up he said what a lady here what's going on and she she told him you are the near Kingsman come by me that way both understand what she was talking about and said okay you take your rest I will do all that needs to be done and then the story told us that in the morning Boaz gave us some gift I said go to your mother-in-law the procedure required I will do them and when she got to the Mother-in-law when I said look you just go and rest Hallelujah dancing the procedure of God when the Holy Ghost is giving you don't toast to and fro all the issues around they don't move you anymore because you are grounded in the world things will happen but you place them in the world that's always the only ghost is say rest brother and the only ghost is not new heaven it's not New Jerusalem but it's like the promised land you know in the promised land when they left Egypt they got into Israel they see how it was you know they have battles to fight over there there is no more battle to fight it's Eternal rest so only ghost is that Promised Land and it's a promised land for all believers and you will have it too Hallelujah brother about the only ghost we often when I saw I'm trusting God for Holy Ghost and trusting God it is a promise of God for you it is something that you must have because without the only goals there is nothing because it cannot be like Christ except the Christ spirit is in you so only God is compulsory for all believers God understand that and you will have it amen he told us in the Book of Luke ask and you shall be giving knock and you shall find and he said how many of you fathers will your son or child ask for fish and you give him snake or ask for bread and you give Stone he concluded by saying if you who are wicked know how to give good gifts to your children how much more your heavenly Father in heaven we give holy ghosts for those who desire it so brother if he desire only goes tonight or today it is yours Hallelujah insurance is one of the primary things Christ went up for so be ready to receive it amen and so now we told rules rest that man that you saw he will not rest until he has finished the program so after you have make your decision putting God first doing it on time make the decision a clear quarter to one no ambiguity then you serve that will be a rest your neighbors in this world there is a rest will Crown it perhaps a God is not the answer of frustration it's not like that if things are promised in the Bible they are accomplished and they are achievable they are not myths or some stories God must be lifted up out of History if he did it yesterday brother I can do it today and they still do it tomorrow if those who have been attended to they come unto God upon some basis if you come on that basis too Brethren you will receive what you Pro what you desire it's not some rocket science you will have what you desire and so after that after service and rest then the rest is not the reward there are still a reward promise a man in the case of rules let me explain what the concept of reward reward is not salary are we together salary reasonably commensurate with the work you put in but reward is way above that Amen Let me give you like um people work in those multinationals they call something stock option you know for instance if you work with Apple Incorporated and then maybe um maybe a marketer or something and then they say okay with this job if you work with us for maybe five years or something you'll be entitled to maybe two thousand units of Apple stock you know now apple is a I think three trillion dollar country company now right and if you have 2 000 units of Apple shares maybe at the time they gave you it was what hundred dollars you know that's a hundred the last two hundred thousand dollars today maybe it's what 1000 something that's already having two million dollars to your name and it will keep growing that's the concept of reward far above salaries amen so that's what we are working for we are not working for salary there are handfuls of blessings that God will be dropping here and there but God promised us a reward amen and so for our rules you know what happened after she took the step follow now misinstruction she rested and then Boaz did what he has to do Bible says it once in those time he will call for Gathering he said there is also a nearer King's Man Batman said that person is a representative of Satan it's closer to us but he cannot redeem us it's just a Tormentor that's all he does it's not to help you it's not to so don't compromise with Satan when they make proposals so you check it by the word proposal Satan it might look good today but ultimately it's bad for you it's a bad business so this guy was calling to a meeting by Boaz um elimelech Ave land you know the story and then he needs to be redeemed and the guy said oh I can buy the land [Music] my inheritance so and then they have to pull off his shoe you know you can see that in case my redeemer and so Boaz became the rightful person to redeem Ruth and then she he did that by the land and made Rose his wife Allelujah whoever thinks that rules a window can become mother of children in such a short period that's what a God can do so don't lose hope whatever be your circumstance you might have looked left and right back and forth and you can't see a way Brethren where there is no way he promised us that he wouldn't become the way for us amen so believe us we don't lose hope we increase our faith in God amen so Ruth became the wife of Boaz and I said that is not enough but then look at this when Roots was in the plantation during the Harvest you know following the Reapers you know they say don't go there this is your area this is your area now that route now became the wife of the owner of the farm hallelujah what kind of reward do you think that is she has become a part owner of the same Farm all the superiors and supervisors and whatever they are now under her that's what God does all the time Brethren trust the Lord Hallelujah so as if that is not enough God gave by his son Bible they called the name Obed who became the father of Jesse and then the father of David and then up to Jesus Christ that's the reward so Brethren quickly take note that in decision making you've got to put God first you've got to decide first and on time your audition must be clear caught no ambiguity then you must be ready to serve under that history don't say oh I decide but you are not ready to know you have not decided Hallelujah then when you have done those four go with grander effort with a rest Believers don't are not toast to and fro oh the word is coming to and then one time in Nigeria they thought I've forgotten the year now they told us the one will come to end October 28th I don't know whether I got here everybody was running a tasketta buying food stuff buying this selling what they have Believers are hard money they are buying them because they know that the if the world is coming to and nobody should know the date Hallelujah and that's the way we are in this world when you see all these moves you see the moves of the Antichrist you know where they belong amen you know the devil always try to make the first move that's the way he does when he make that move cool down just stay on the wall don't be under pressure because God has his own program and God's program nothing can stop it and then after those rest there'll be a reward breeding there was a time the disciples a rich young ruler came to Christ you know and then he said Master good Master what can I do to inherit the Kingdom of Heaven and Christ look at it and say why do you even call me good okay go and keep the law and he said all the laws have I kept from my youth and Bible said Christ loved him and he looked at him it's the only one thing left just one thing sell all that you have give to the poor take up your cross and follow me that's all I'm Bible told us I demand went back home sorrowfully because he had great possessions that's that was his problem he couldn't leave those possessions for Christ but in the same vein if you read further down Peter now look at Christ say Christ what's going on this guy could not leave money but we we have left all and we have followed you once our game Hallelujah and many of us will say what does Peter have but Christ did not say Peter they didn't leave anything because Peter wasn't really poor Hallelujah Peter was online but it wasn't poor and that's why I could look at Christ in the fancy look where this man cannot leave money when we have left both money Family everything what is our gain amen hallelujah and Christ told him whoever left father mother whatever in this world he said in this same world I will reward the person a hundred fold Hallelujah so Christianity has reward amen and then they want to come eternal life amen you know some people do the research I think you see our UK they were trying to find the benefit of Christianity they are not Christians they just decided to commission the research and then so their findings they said um they cannot see whether the Miracles are happening or anything but one thing they found out that all the people call themselves Christian that because of the the the communal interaction that there seems to be better than the rest I said that's even enough for us hallelujah amen that's the worldly people amen so in being a Christian that's reward in following the law of God there is great reward amen God is conscious of your efforts amen that's why he came you know he took the form of his servants so that I can be tempted as you and me and then he became the high priest of our confession the Bible told us that sometimes you don't even know what to pray for but the spirit interceded for us hallelujah because we are God's children and the devil cannot have upper hand in our lives I'm so certain of that a child of God can never be lost because we have the same material with Christ Hallelujah whether you realize it or not that's just the truth amen and somewhere I see quickly looking at something you know I told you earlier that the prophet preached three sermons relating to decisions he preached a power of decision I encourage you to go and read it I want them to give me numbers 14 30. the power what does decision what is the power and decision making don't let us be wishing washing you want to do anything make a clear-cut decision because he has power Numbers Chapter 14 verse 13. I want to just so just to illustrate the power of decision okay I'm Moses said unto the Lord is that 14 no 30 30. not 13. now he said that less you shall not come into the land concerning which I swear to make you do a grn safe Caleb the son of jeffony and Joshua the son of noon the background to this is that trespasses were sent to inspire the land you know God said John sent To Us by his Elders let them go into the land to see whether it is actually flowing with milk and honey that's their job and then they went and 10 others came back and said no the land is truly flowing with milk and honey as shown by the fruit you know carried between two men but God did not send the message of birth but they added that to them there are giants in the land and so forth and we cannot go but this Joshua and Caleb they decided that no we can go and sure let's go up at once and take over Allelujah power up decision and God came down because people decided to Stone them because when 10 people are saying something only two are saying otherwise you know majority minority may have their say but majority will always have their way but that's not the way God works Hallelujah any minority that stay with you well God stays with them it is father's good pleasure to give you the Kingdom of Heaven oh someone said your stretch is too small God is not there God is there as long as the world is there the number is irrelevant amen and so God came down and said what and those standard as they died right there and God further establish Joshua and kill him I told them because you people another spirit is in you you have decided for me only two of you will get into the Promised Land power off decision he said all those other people from age 20 upward none of them would get into the Canaan land except these two people that's power decision you make today can you see look at this church it's a decision of some people Hallelujah even you you are living in somebody's decision amen all those things we see around us they are just a little trace of God's infinite abilities somebody can look the prophet told us we are creators from your mind you have a vision and then you can bring you to reality those are powers of decisions so don't let's be afraid to make decisions especially decision for God then a preachers to another one the results or reward of decision that you can see in the Book of Joshua chapter 1 India God after the death of Moses God called unto Joshua he said now my sister Moses my servant is dead you are to lead the people the result of decision Joshua became a leader after Moses because of that decision it took being a spy he decided to be against the time even though the 10 they are more in numbers and no the word of God say this and stand by this and I'm ready to die by it but we said I did not die he became a leader in Hallelujah also um kill him at the time he went to spy Bible told us Caleb was 40 years old at this time he went to Joshua I said Joshua I think that is um chapter Joshua chapter 14 just for your reference and that time he went back to Joshua I said Joshua you remember when me and you and the rest of the elders we went to go and spy the land and you know what happened that Moses promised me that it will give me a land the land that my leg has touched so it reminded you shall look my strength I am now 85 years old you know 40 45 years have passed since that decision was made he said as I was then so my strength now halleluia the decision stop Aging in his life are we together he testified himself that I can still go to war the way I was then so I am give me the land so that I will go and possess it reward of decision and we saw that Joshua the Bible said Joshua gave him the land of Abram so Abram belonged to Joshua and his children up to today Hallelujah reward of decision then I have explained to you time of decision earlier that's concerning Rebecca when even though she was to go and meet a man she didn't even know you know she didn't know Isaac she didn't know but according to she saw that this is God's promise this is a prayer answered you know and that's my brethren when we see God manifesting it will be wrong for us to turn our back to it what do we want to say again this message you want to say God is Not There is there if he's there what are we waiting for why are we not committed may the Lord help us let's make our decision and God will back us up Hallelujah oh praise the Lord and you can also find that for time of decision also numbers 13 30. at that time Caleb said instead of wasting our time here let's go apart once you know why do others are making excuses the land of giant this and that say Brethren let's leave that let's do so now brother listen to Joshua and Caleb they won't be where they were but they were dragging feet so Brethren let's make decision Hallelujah we are still continuing now I want to read something if you can give me choosing of a bride is only one choosing of a bride paragraph 31. so that we can read it together choosing of a bride paragraph 31 it's only one 650429e I have it here I'm just waiting for them 650429e you will talk about your own decisions too you know we have given examples here and there we look at the prophet decision then what do you do yourself and let me continue to say in many things of life we are given a choice the way of life itself is a choice we have a right to make our own way is your right choose our own way that we want to live education is a choice we can choose whether we are going to be educated or whether we are not going to be educated that's the choice that we have right and wrong is a choice every man every woman boy and girl has to choose whether they are going to try to live right or not live right it's a choice choice is a great thing your Eternal destination is a choice and maybe today some of you will make that choice of where you will spend eternity okay there before this service ends tonight or today there will be one time that if you turn God down many times there will be one time you will turn him down the last time there's a line between mercy and judgment it's a dangerous thing for a man or a woman boy or girl to step across that line for there is no return when you step across that deadline so today it might be the time that many will make their decision where they will spend the endless eternity there is another choice that we have in life a life's companion a young man or young woman stepping out on life has been given a right to make a choice the young man chooses the young woman has a right to accept or Rejoice but it is still a choice on both sides both man and woman they have a right to choice also you have a choice as a Christian you have a choice of the church here in America so far that you can go to that's your own American privilege to choose any church that you want to belong to that's a choice you don't have to go to any of them if you don't want to but if you want to change from the messages to the Baptist or Catholics or precipit Protestants or so forth and there's nobody that can tell you or make you to come to any certain church that's our freedom that's what our democracy is every man can choose for himself freedom of religion that's a blessing God help us to keep it as long as you can you have also a choice when you choose this church you can choose whether in this church whether you will choose a church that will guide you to your Eternal destination you can choose a church that has a certain Creed that you might think that Creed is just what you want or the other church that has their Creed and then there is the word of God you have a choice of you have to make that choice that's an unwritten law Among Us of choosing you know the word of God if you have chosen to stick by the word of God you must make it all the way I mean that's why we have denomination they refuse to go all the way but once you have chosen that Lord I stand by your work because heaven and earth will pass away but everyone little duty of this one will not go without doing that with you to a sense then I will stand by it Hallelujah nothing want to look let's grab them also make a choice you know he had all the options he can join the denominations he has the gift and but he made a choice which made him unpopular let's look at standing in the Gap then I will not get to our own choice then we close standing in the Gap if you can get it 630623 okay I'll continue reading here to save our time so I read them in paragraph 131. sobraham also made a choice let's see God also commented about his choice or his decision so that this will help you to make your own decision and choice too paragraph one three one so I was preaching in Los Angeles at the businessman's breakfast I need to read this background so that you understand what it is and something that I just learning on those organizations and they are said the admin of the assemblies and many of the Great dignitaries had gathered in there and when I got through speaking I started to leave the platform getting ready because the message was being sent out Across the Nation on radio and had to change back during this change when they cut up the radio then to send that message out and come back and announce the station I was in Clifton's where we had the breakfast and as I was walking from the upper platform to the lower a fine handsome looking young fellow of about 30 years old to run forth and threw his arm around me he said I'm Danny Henry and not knowing that it was a brother it was his brother doing the televising it televises there for the Christian businessmen and it's Jane Russell that movie star a cousin he was talking of Mario and Morrow our mother is a Pentecostal preacher and then when it started running to me he threw his arm around me and said God bless you with Abraham he said I hope excuse me I hope this doesn't sound sacrilegious but to my way of seeing it that message could be the 23rd chapter of Revelation you know it was saying that why the prophet preached about was not in the Bible is not Revelation ended 22nd so he said Ram has added to the Bible that's his own View so and when he said that he started speaking in tongues a boy who had never even heard of such a thing a Baptist by denomination as soon as they finish it turned white and he looked at me he didn't know what to do there is man standing here there where they are afraid how many were there at that time you know trying to confirm and there was a great big French woman sitting down there she raised up and said why that don't need any interpretation thank you it's up there that was purely French and the boy said I don't know one word of French and she had written down what he said and then there was a man setting on the corner I said that's correct I've got wrote I've got to wrote down what he said is French way back in the back a blonde headed handsome looking fellow standing up against the wall came forward and compared notes it was interpreter for the United Nation for French and this man over here was Victor Lido of the anvik church out there and he wrote it down and I've got the interpretation to it so the background was that Abraham was he preached a sermon he said it was you know collecting those denominations and so forth and this boy Baptist came around and said oh Brenda bam what I've just preached can be termed as 23rd chapter of Revelation and then when you touch the prophet you know he started speaking in tongues so we want to see what did he say so I'm going to just jump so to paragraph one 360. he said now yes what it said listen because thou has chosen the narrow past the other way down as a world in your own children are we together so this choice is yours you must own it amen and now I can see that Moses had to make his choice too see thou has picked the precise and correct way correct decision and it is my way amen underline my way the Holy Spirit speaking back because of this momentous decision a huge portion of Heaven awaits thee what a glorious decision now listen close what a glorious decision thou has made this in itself is that which you make and come to pass the tremendous victory in love divine Hallelujah its own decision that's that's my and then even though it was making his own decision God told him it is his own decision Hallelujah so how can you put God in your decision and that's how we say You must put God first God must be the central thing or for your decision whether it's personal whether it's official whether it's richer make sure you can put God in it you know Reverend said oh I think went to somewhere and I said don't talk about God yeah I said why they can't talk about God I can't be there myself Hallelujah so if any decision you are trying to make make sure you you wrap it back to God amen because that way God can hone you and once god holds you will not leave you Hallelujah we cannot hold God because our hand can get tired but when that unfailing hands is around you Hallelujah you can never fail amen and so let's talk to ourselves now I mean it will not be me talking let's read the time of decision paragraph 31-34 time of decision that's your own decision how do you make your decision let's talk to ourselves we have seen examples from the Bible from the message then what about ourselves so 590611 590611 31 paragraph 31. this one is speaking directly to us about our decision making he said I read he said and then there was another great decision had to be made then after she was giving she's talking about Rebecca then the prince said well just let us stay around about 10 days let her hang around the Revival to really feel whether she has decided to do it or not I haven't got much confidence in a person make a decision to wait even until tomorrow are we together make it now but the message that still had Rebecca she was satisfying the message was from God so the parents said oh let us stick around the world she'll get over it maybe it's some infatuation and it's just a little excitement and she was over to that Revival you know but oh the truth servant said don't worry us don't hinder me a lot of the servant of God has been hindered by put up decisions don't hinder me seeing the Lord has sent me saying that he has been good to me don't hinder me then they say let her make her own decision that's where you stand tonight or today make your own decision then they call Rebecca and said will you go with this man or do you want to stay around a little while to see whether you really want to do it she said I will go what do you say today she was ready our decision was quickly made she knew there have been something been leading her she knew something had happened to her and she knew that it was God and she was satisfied she wanted to go quickly what are you waiting for once you are sure it was God may the Lord help us she put on a garment and she got all the gifts that was sent to her by the father to Medicine oh God if the church could only make that decision right quick put on all our gifts she climbed up on the camel and took out and it was in the evening time when Isaac had wandered from the tent out into the feet to meditate and when he seen the coming coming Rebecca looked at him and then it was loved at first sight a man because God wasn't it she had to believe it before she went oftentimes you want to see God moves first and God said move Hallelujah believe and you will see the glory of God I say sin is believing when you say why do you need to believe again aha you have seen it so what is the point of believing You Must Believe to see the glory of God amen Faith coming by hearing she didn't know what the man looked like and he didn't make no difference it was God making the decisions amen I don't care whether it's big or little what color is that makes me no difference he is my Lord I will love him when I see him because he is God's gift to me and to you she lighted up the camera and she had the brain from her face and I saw normally I spot the eyes of Isaac into our arms into hams he went and took her to the mother's place or the finest place and married her brother or sister listen there is no time to linger it is time to make the decision what kind of an effect as a message made on you are you ready to say I will go I will arise and go to Jesus it will embrace me in his arms in the arms of my dear savior oh there are 10 000 charms said the poet now let's get to the final one choosing of a bride again paragraph 41-43 sorry quickly and it is I hope you enjoy reading the message amen amen it is a dangerous thing to wait till the last hour are we together these are all talking to you and me because you might take on something that you could never shake off out of it you know there is a time when you can be warned then if you step across the line of warning then you are already marked on the other side branded remember when the Jubilee year come and the priest rode with the trumpet sounding that every slave should could go straight but if they refuse to accept their freedom then he had to be taken to the temple to a post and an all born through him through the air and then inside this master always if you remember the Year of Jubilee somebody said oh I'm enjoying my master I don't want to be free but I'm saying no matter how much Jubilee sound here after that it will not make any difference are we together one that time comes for you to be free and say no no no no like wait I'm enjoying the wages of iniquity that person can no longer hear it even though if he's standing you say I can't respond again because it's too late May that never be our portion in the name of Jesus Christ he said but if they refuse to accept their freedom then he had to be taken to the Temple to report and then all brought him through the hair and then he served this master always it was put on his ear as a type of he had a faith coming by hearing he had that trumpets but he didn't want to listen to it amen look at this final paragraph I'm reading and many times men and women hear God's truth and Seed Vindicated and proven are we together truth but yet they don't want to hear it why he said there are some other reason Hallelujah oftentimes you see brothers or why have you not done this say I'm praying Brian said is not praying there are some other reasons you know they used I'm praying to silence the question now because I say once you tell a believer I'm praying you okay okay but look at he said there is some other reason there is some other choosing that they have are we together when they can't make that decision they have some other choosing they are not proud to say it out so they will say I'm praying and say they done to face up to the truth and facts therefore their ears can be close to the gospel May that never be our portion sir they will never hear it again now listen to the advice of the prophets that's my closing remarks he said my advice to you brothers and sisters when God speaks to your heart what do you do you act right then may

Consciousness with the word that being preached to us this morning like our brother says consciously and unconsciously we made decisions we react to things [Music] we make choices [Music] and that that the Holy Spirit was choose to speak to us this morning says alive full of excuses is now wanted of the Gospel and sometimes and many times we will make excuses is because of uncertainty and sometimes it's because of fear but you see he didn't give a spirit of fear he gave us his word and if we come to the place to realize that he's the one that keep us he's our keeper if the Lord do not keep us there's no way we can keep ourself [Music] this afternoon reflecting on the word I don't know how the Lord have spoke to you and there with your heart this morning I don't know what you're dealing with in your life I don't know where choices is before you but you see yeah just like our brother said your [Music] we have to realize and brother Branham share this also [Music] that for us to be here this morning for us each and every one of us that is in the building all that is under the sound of the message preached this morning for us to be here where we are it was God's choice for us [Music] he choose us Prophet was said in the message shall One in a Million when it comes to what if we would be a male or female it was his choice yes there were thousands and millions of cells that was in a race but it was God that choose this the egg cells and the blood cells for us to be here now you see if God if God will make you his first choice if he will make you his first choice what what are we choosing that we cannot make him our first choice you see God don't want to be the first among many he want to be the first and the only not the first among many choices that's the reason why we have to bring him into our choice that's the first thing we have to think about is this thing pleasing to the Lord what I have just said what the words that have just come out of my mouth is it pleasing to God [Music] please him this thing I want to do is the Lord please about it before the foundation of the word before God would create anything Paul let us know he choose us in him amen he make you his first choice because he know that that will influence your life to make him your first choice [Music] and that's why the mystery of God is revealed that's why God brought all of these things under the Seven Seals to let us know that we were choosing and predestinated from the foundation of the word he brought all of these things onto US to bring us to the place because his his purpose was to have the preeminence and God cannot have a preeminence in the midst of a people that that have their choices all scattered and the Lord is the last thing to think about it his word is the last thing that we consult and and and uh uh their personal objective Immortals is dominating your mind more than the promises of God can only have a preeminence in the midst of a people that make him their primary Choice their first choice brother banham says show me the man or the woman that put God first I will show you the one that we prosper in everything that we do is [Music] I don't know where you are this morning I don't know what is going through your mind I don't know what you're dealing with I don't know what you're struggling with I don't know the choices that are facing you but every one of us are facing choices that that there is one thing that you cannot do without every meaning of your life [Music] [Music] myself Heavenly Father [Music] Lord your word being preach

God may you bless us Lord father May the Holy Ghost bring these things back to our remembrance Lord amen May the Holy Ghost just find them Lord may he use the word that was preached to address things in our lives father we love you we thank you and we appreciate you Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus we pray amen amen preach the message what is the attraction now he uses a user blessing the word where he was able to uh draw the context of his text from that scripture what is the attraction on the mountain and Jesus coming in Jerusalem but then he talks about the different different biblical Mountain what is the attraction what was the attraction of Mount Sana he brought it to our day what is the attraction but if if you if you look into their subject you will realize that the major thought there is there Christ is our attraction amen amen amen amen Christ is our attraction and and and everything taking us from Christ is a destruction as a Son of God as a daughter of God as an as as an elect of God they have recognized what God is doing in this age Christ is our attraction the word is our attraction pool of the Holy Ghost is to attract us to the word because that is your defense that's your protection that's your strength that's your inspiration you might read other things look into Ado that are all part of our our daily activities but we have to bring our attraction into those things because you will not enjoy your job if God is not in it even I enjoy it it would just become going to work eight hours you come home you go back again and then you tired if you cannot find your attraction that's the reason why even take for the sense of marriage you're looking for the young man and you're looking for the young woman to marry if you just look at the beauty and that becomes your attraction that they're the the movement the word shows up you will start having problems with that person that is the major theme of that subject that's the reason why brother Branham said it has gone from uh uh from the prophet to his prophecy and what is his prophecy Christ in you the hope of glory he is the bride's attraction praise the Lord Hallelujah said everything about Isaac all it did was it just create a vision in Rebecca head I want to see this person that he's talking about so Isaac Becomes Her attraction that she couldn't even wait for the canvas to stop when she saw Isaac in the field because the word is our attraction [Music] it's only the word that can satisfied as the word I can give you Joy it is the word that can give you life your life will have no meaning if you take the word out of it it will be full of frustration and pains [Music] praise the Lord we want wives we want husband we want children but let Christ be your attraction because it's in him we have all of these things the scripture says oh thanks he gave us all things why because he's our attraction [Music] and the thing there is that we we we we we make the destruction of this life our our attraction [Music] we made the destruction of this life you look at your bank account and you think you don't have the money that you get so distant I gotta put in more hours we make the destruction of this life our major no less Christ be your attraction the same one that Paul Coin in the fish mouth he stayed alive today he knows your needs he can meet your needs all is real let that word be your attraction fall in love with God for the Lord where you can you can feel it you are in love with him Lord I love you it's not just words you love him because your heart beat after
