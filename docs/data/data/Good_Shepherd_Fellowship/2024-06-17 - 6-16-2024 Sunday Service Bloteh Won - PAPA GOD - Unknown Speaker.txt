like we um mention on Wednesday night uh uh yeah brother Joe Pasco with daughter uh ayena that has been going through the bone Mar transplant have finally been moved to the house of recovery she's not back home yet but uh they had to put her in this house and observe her I think for 100 days if I'm right with the father and uh and then she can be able to go home and live a normal life praise the Lord but we want to thank the Lord for bringing that child through a massive Journey amen praise the Lord and uh uh uh if you never been sick to be confined to a hospital bed you will never know what it is praise the Lord but if you sit around the hospital you will know there are a lot of people that need a touch from the Lord amen and that's the reason why we want to be grateful every day every day that uh that he gives to us and um I want to uh this morning um speak a little message U I was going to go back to Revelation chapter 5 where I started but as I was I was uh studying yesterday I read something there that kind of just changed my thoughts and I say well okay maybe I can we can make a prayer I mean we can make a father this's message out of this uh in in the message hating life

temptation but Deliver Us from all evil for thine is thy kingdom and thy power and th Glory forever amen amen amen praise the Lord thank you musicians you can have your seat we'll take our Bibles this morning and we will read U from uh St John chapter 20 in John chapter 20 Matthew chapter 6 The Lord's Prayer is my first scripture reading but we have already prayed there so I will just make reference to it as I go along but let's read in John chapter 20 when when Jesus taught the disciples to pray he says when you pray says our father amen that was at the beginning of his ministry but when he resurrected in verse 16 St John chapter 20 in verse 16 the Bible says Jesus said unto Mary Jesus said unto her sorry Mary she turned herself and said on to him Rabon which is to say master Jesus said unto her touch me not for I am not yet ascended to the father but go to my brethren and said unto them I Ascend unto my father and your father and to my God and your God praise praise the Lord he started his ministry by teaching them our father he ended his ministry by telling them is still our father it's your father it is my father he's your God and he's my god let's pray together Heavenly Father precious Lord the word will know nothing about fatherhood if you never came from eternity if you never condense your self to be able to give birth to a creation and give birth Lord father God and make man we will know nothing about fatherhood and precious Lord God in all that we know and all that we have achieved as father will not come nearly close to you you you are our father Lord you are the one that should be celebrated this day you are the one Lord God but precious Lord Jesus we also want to thank you Lord that you have placed men in our lives that we can call fathers we want to thank you precious Lord Jesus oh God only in eternity will reveal the many struggle that goes through many times they hold back their tears Lord just so father God to be able to labor for the family dear God we pray and uh we just want to commit ourself in your hands Lord father what a great responsibility what a great responsibility Lord we know father God it's not just all about how many children we have Lord but father with God is a Sac calling it's a calling of responsibility father we pray this morning as we were look in your word we just ask that Lord you will help us the little portion of god father we will take to talk about father who this morning we ask that Lord you will bless it you will inspire it that it will make so much so much sense to us Lord and it will draw us closer to you we love you we thank you and appreciate you this morning Father we are so grateful that we can call you papa God bless the service now in Jesus name amen amen praise the Lord amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat I learned is uh uh brother Jordan's birthday if I get it right and it's also his first Father's Day so wherever he is he better enjoy it he better enjoy it that little girl might be cooking pancake for him this morning praise the Lord amen amen there there there are some beautiful things here that uh caught my attention yesterday you will realize here when Jesus resurrected he he said to Mary touch me n that was in the morning that was just after he resurrected and went to the tomb but then in the evening time he told Thomas come and touch me said see my head see my side come and touch me praise the Lord I was looking at that yesterday and I is I mean the word of God is just so beautiful so beautiful we know when Jesus resurrect Ed there was there was the time he would have performed his priesthood ministry as a high priest he needed to go in the presence of the shakana glory to present the sacrifice so that's what he told Mary don't touch me because I have not extended yet I have not gone behind the veil I have not presented the sacrifice so he had to go and present himself to the father it's a great mystery of godliness praise the Lord he say he's your father and he's your God you see that's the reason why if you don't understand the mystery of godliness and you just make Jesus God without understanding there you will be just as wrong as those that believe in Trinity praise the Lord amen so so uh uh uh he told Mary don't touch me touch me not for I have not yet ascended to my father but go tell the Brethren and said unto them I send it to my father and your father to my God and your God and just like I said right after he did that in the afternoon time he walked with those men on the road of EMAs those guys that was walking after he came came he walked with them and then uh uh uh when he broke the bread the eyes were open and then uh in the evening time then he met with the disciples where he showed Thomas his hand and he said he come and touch me now so what I was thinking about this I thought on U uh a little message uh I was looking at the other time where uh uh John was told in the Book of Revelation chapter 1 write this things that I said unto you that's what Jesus said unto John the angel said to John write these things but when you come to Revelation 10:7 he told John do not write praise the Lord the same one that say right is the same one that said do not right the same one that said don't touch me was the same one that said come and touch me praise the Lord and uh uh uh because of uh what John was told in Revelation 10 many head on to that and say the seven tunnel is not revealed how can it be revealed if it was not written but if you read the rest of the scripture you will understand that he told John do not write these things but in the day of the voice of the seven Angel when he shall begin to sound those things will be revealed they were not supposed to to be written they were supposed to be preached yes they were supposed to be spoken yes praise the Lord amen so uh I mean it's very beautiful here it's very beautiful you see those patterns in the word and uh you enjoy this morning I want to talk on if I can choose a title for myself will be Papa God our father my father your father my God your God praise the Lord now if you look in the Bible you will realize that Jesus uh taught the Lord's Prayer two times many times uh uh we think that is one because it's written in two different gospels but when you look at the setting you'll realize it was two different times that he taught the Lord's Prayer one in Matthew chapter 6 The Bible says that was his Sermon on the Mount where he gave the Beatitudes and he taught the disciples and said when you pray go into your closet and say our father praise the Lord amen whether it is just you that is praying say our father because it is not supposed to be prayer is never a selfish thing praise the Lord if there is one thing that you you should never be selfish with is praying and that's the reason why it counts more for you to pray for others than praying for yourself amen because you can never be selfish with prayer and uh but if you look also in uh uh uh St Luke chap 11 St Luke chap 11 verse1 the Bible says Jesus came out of praying and the disciples came to him and said uh uh it came to pass that as he was praying in a setting place when he sees one of the these disciples said unto him Lord said unto him Lord teach us to pray as John also taught his disciples now it's strange enough that when they asked him he repeated the same thing he taught them praise the Lord it is almost like when Jesus says verily verily a sense of making emphasis a the sense of showing the prayer that I taught you before is very important if there is any prayer that would reach the father it was what I taught you before praise the Lord Jesus knows all the Redemptive name of the father because they were manifested in him he knew that he was the bridge he's the Living Water he's the alpha he's the Omega he knows all all the titles through the scripture because he was the very revelation of those titles praise the Lord but when he taught us to pray he never taught us titles he taught us relationship praise the lord it's true that in many of the titles we are also related with the Father the rose of Sharon he's the one that eases our pains praise the Lord and uh and and and we we can go through all that but when you just look look at this you will realize that there is something important about this prayer Our Father praise the Lord our father and uh uh uh when you look at the Lord's prayer and you prayed it not in a in a recitation way but you prayed as as praying or speaking a prayer to the Lord you will realize that you go through 13 Cycles Our Father which are in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come that will be done you will realize it is 13 Cycles 13 is the number of the church you will also realize that when you count every word in the Lord's Prayer is 66 and I'll read something to you it will encourage you to mark of the beast the the whole word of God the whole the whole word of God in every bit ties together 66 books wrote by numbers of men hundreds of years apart and not one contradict the other one not a one every one of them perfect never was a piece of literature wrote like it in all the word amen amen praise the Lord and I was I was fellowshipping with a brother yesterday we were you know we were talking and and uh you know he was he was uh you know just sharing with me and and we just fellowshipping and he was just sharing with me in uh you know U where where should I start you know uh you know I love reading the Bible and you know I I get discouraged because you know I start reading and then I love L strike or I'm not understanding you know so I I I share with him something that I learned and what is it is that when you want to learn a language that is not your language the way to learn it is not to learn it by yourself praise the Lord is to look for a community that speaks that language praise the Lord and go in that community so you start you start verbalizing the words you have learned and and then also you start picking from their action the way they are saying you know uh uh uh uh take for example French V you know saying come here you know you you start picking from their action and all of that and as you stay in that environment pretty soon you will see yourself absorbing the language you will start picking up words you will start understanding phrases is because of the action of the people and all of that the word of God is called the word of God because it's God's language you don't go to school to learn it if you really want to learn it you got to get in the environment of the word you got to stay where the word is preached where the word is appreciated where the word is fellowship around praise the Lord and pretty soon you know things will be shared and and and things you are reading will be said over the pulpit your oh wow yeah I think I read that you know and just like that you you know you that that that that environment you will start absorbing the word start you start becoming part of it you start you start loving it praise the Lord and uh and and but that is the thing with every language if you want to learn it and you just go and practice bunch of words you know bunch of words I remember a old friend of mine that uh that told me his story he was coming to the states for for the first time and then he I mean he he he just tried to practice all the greetings you know all the greetings and as soon as he got to the airport when you heard people talking yeah he said everything just went from my head everything the thing I practice months and months he said they just wait I was just lost praise the Lord say I wish I Carri my my my little cassette with me praise the Lord so you see that's how the word is now so we reading this let's continue with this now he's saying now there is there is never a piece of literature that is written like the word of God they have been for 2,000 years trying to alter The Lord's Prayer to put one word to it or take one word from it to to make it better you just can't do it oh it's perfect it is it's the word of God so you see the Lord's pray have 66 words in it and we have 66 books in the Bible praise the Lord I don't know what you would do with that this morning but I would tell you that uh The Lord's Prayer never gets old amen The Lord's Prayer is good for every day there is not one thing that you can be dven and desire and burden to tell the Lord that is not said in the Lord's Prayer praise the Lord if you pray the Lord's Prayer and now recite it is different from reciting yes and praying it if you pray the Lord's Prayer there is not anything you want to say to God that is not in that in that prayer and that's the reason why though Jesus taught his disciples and yet when they ask him again teach us how to pray he reminded them when you pray say our father who are in heaven praise the Lord I mean like I said he could say Jehovah Rafa Jehovah shalom from Jehovah you know we we we go we go when you know we go into all of that we go into all of that and uh and sometimes we are just exercising our religious knowledge of what we know you know how we can pronounce it and how we can you know articulate ourself before God is that's far different from praying when you put your heart out to God and I believe that was the reason why that phrase Papa God meant a whole lot to brother Brandon because you see I challenge you try when you are praying say papa God it move your heart in a different way it makes it so real it takes away all your theological knowledge it just throw you in the arm of the father when you say papa God it makes it so real praise the Lord there's nothing nothing like the Lord's Prayer I love the Lord's Prayer I love the Lord's Prayer we we try to pray that every day in our home amen so like I said there's uh uh 13 Cycles you know uh uh um in 66 words in uh in that prayer now so we want to look at uh uh like I said Papa God as we look at fatherhood this morning and uh uh I'm stay in the in in the element of what I want to why I wanted to preach I just got into today uh uh to be able to address you on on Father's day but you realize that uh uh that was the first attribute that was God's first attribute for him to be God his first attribute was to give birth because he was the great in of spirit one time he failed everywhere without beginning Without End how will he start time to start anything you has to have a beginning so for God to begin by having a beginning he have to give birth to himself in the way of condensing himself from interal to start time because time has a beginning it has an end internity does not have a beginning it does not have an end so when the Bible says in the beginning which mean there was a time where it begins so God first attribute was was the attribute of a father it was an attribute of of of a father he's the father of the universe praise the Lord he's a father of the universe that word father just like mother uh uh uh it speaks of one that beget one that begins that was his first attribute and uh so fatherhood is is very very important and just think about it that was the reason why it was very important to Jesus coming to these men that have that from from 12 13 years old they were taught the Torah they knew the Lord and all of that but when he came to them uh to to to really give them a Bible uh you know a Bible class a teaching how to approach God the first thing he would tell them is when you come the one you are coming to is the one that you begin from praise the Lord you are coming to your beginning you are talking to your beginning the one without you wouldn't have existed you're not talking to a foreigner you're not talking to one that is so far away that came be rich you are talking to the one that holds your existence the one from whom you begin you are coming back to your beginning praise the Lord and when you can come back to the beginning you can have a new start every day every day if you can just come back to the beginning praise the Lord when you say our father you are telling yourself I'm beginning again I'm coming back to my beginning if you can come back to your beginning you can have a new start every day praise the Lord amen that was his first attribute it means a whole lot to him it means a whole lot to God that's the reason why his love there is no partiality in his love praise the Lord if God gave every creature that God gave life this day God is equally responsible for every one of them praise the Lord he's equally responsible we being in church this morning do not give us a greater portion of love than the people that are walking on the street no there is no love in his I mean no partiality in his love praise the Lord because he gave them life so he hold himself responsible for the ends for the the uh every living creature that's that's that's that's the father responsibility that's the attribute of a father he ped His blessings upon the just and the unjust equally glory be to God like we always say the only thing that make the difference you and myself have received Grace to appreciate it and we hope that they can receive Grace also because I'm telling you some of those people can do better than we are doing because people sit in church and pretty soon we take the the the attitude of entitlement we Fe that because we go to church we pay our offering we pay our time so we are entitled God must do this for me some of those people will do better with the grace that we have we must appreciate it Hallelujah we have received the grace to be able to appreciate his love and that's the reason why all everything that we will do must all come from the sense of appreciation it must all come from the sense of appreciation when we lift our hands to sink and and we and we dress this and and we live right we are doing it because we appreciate the love and the grace that he has given us for us to be able to recognize his love praise the Lord but it's not the same I mean it's it's not different it's the same same the same way he love you is the same way he love The Sinner in the streets he don't love the sin but he love The Sinner amen praise the Lord he love The Sinner our father Jesus said when we pray we must say our father that's a great attribute that's a great attribute like I said that that is our beginning that's where we came from amen that's where we came from and it's it's something that we must we must honor you see that that attribute is an attribute of headship because it was the first attribute that God that God displayed that he manifested to the universe that he was going to me that uh so so it is it it takes the place of head Airship praise the Lord it takes the place of headship and I'll share some share some things with you oh my god some things with you from the word this morning amen and uh uh and and we will appreciate it it shows a place of headship and uh let me share one that is that is very very come on now Numbers Chapter 30 let's go to Numbers Chapter 30 you know as we celebrate Father's dead and and you know we send text of uh uh you know to all of uh the men that uh uh we want to appreciate but this morning we just want to take this time to be able to appreciate our father that is in heaven amen because from him come the true sense of father you know fatherhood praise the Lord for him come a true sense of fatherhood you see that's the reason why Paul in the book of Ephesians he would give that responsibility to the man and says as Christ loved the church you know uh uh because the church in Christ is in uh uh uh uh uh relationship a husband wife relationship Christ is the husband the church is the bride and uh uh uh so also when it comes to the the place of uh you will see there even in Ephesian he did the same he says uh he say parents you know father provoke not your children children you know respect your parents because it's the first commandment you know with a promise but let's look here in Numbers Chapter 13 what I want to bring out of this is an understanding of headship so so we can be able to appreciate verse verse one and Moses speak unto the heads of the tribe concerning the children of Israel Moses speak unto the head of the tribes concerning the children of Israel headship that's what I want you to keep on your mind seeing this is the thing which the Lord has commanded if a man vowed a vowed unto the Lord or swear and ought to bound his sword with a bound he shall not break his word he shall do a calling to all their that proceeded out of his mouth a man is good as his word praise the Lord amen a man is good at his word you will see in this principle God did not make a provision for a man vow to be broken why because he's the head praise the Lord that's that's the principle I want I want us to be able to appreciate he did not make a provision for the man when the man made a vow he must keep it because he's as good as his word praise the Lord amen let's let's go down a little bit verse three if a woman also vow a vow unto the Lord Lord and bound herself uh uh uh by the bound being in her father's house in her youth why they stay there because of headship okay so if she if she if she commit herself to a vow she still on a headship that headship must be respected are we together amen watch and see you now and her father hear her vow and her bound wherewith she have bound her soul and her father and her father shall hold his peace at her then all her vow shall stand and every bound wherewith she bound her soul shall stand but but if her father this allow her in the day that he hears it so which mean if if uh if if if she goes out and and make a commitment she goes out and commit herself to something and take a vow to something and her father years it I said well I mean uh uh uh you know uh that's good she commit herself to that you know uh I'll support her I mean it it shall stand praise the Lord but when the fathers years it and say NOP NOP no praise the Lord are we together now what is the principle that we dealing with headship it all comes back to fatherhood amen sorry so when the father disallowed heard in the days that he ye that he Heth not any of her vow or of her bound wherewith she she have bound her soul shall stand the Lord shall forgive her because her father this allow her so when it comes to the father it comes to the man he don't have a way out he must stand for his his word word he must be as good as his word praise the Lord amen he must be as good as his word and God God will deal with him if he if he if he makes a vow and and and try to get himself out of faith God with thee now with the woman because she's on a headship praise the Lord her her vow her commitment is judged by her father praise the Lord now it his year it talks about a woman in the house of her father when you go down to the next verse it will now tells you about a wife so what is it dealing with what I'm trying to get get us to be able to see is that place of headship God has set the universe in an order with a chain of command praise the Lord he set the universe with in in in an order just like just like the kingdoms like I I've shared this with you before there are five kingdoms there's the kingdom of God the kingdom of men the kingdom of humans the animal kingdom the pl Kingdom and the Minal kingom praise the Lord so there's a chain of command for the least to come up to the highest the the the higher one is the one that pulled the plain Kingdom goes down to the Earth with its root to get the mineral the the potassium and all of those things that are in the earth the roots go into the Earth to draw it out praise the Lord for us to benefit we don't go and L the dust and and and you know to get potassium and get no the roots go and suck it out of the Earth the animal kingdom comes and eat the plants the human kiddom comes and eat the animal praise the Lord then the kingdom of God must also eat the Hons praise the Lord amen the kingdom of God must eat the hmer that's why we must be born again that's why we must die because uh for you to eat anything it has to die for God to get the benefit out of you you must die but God said it like that he said it like that or else we will not get the nutrients from the earth we go be laking dust and breaking rocks and you know and all of that and if you go that route you end up in the hospital amen but if you go the route the natural rout that God set by eating the plants you will get every mineral that is in in the earth praise the Lord and that is the same way God set out the family order there a chain of command the head of every man is Christ the head of the woman is the man the head of the home the children is the woman so you see we cannot get good result if we are now submitted to our headship it's it's a chain of command God is a law of God you cannot get good result if you are not honor your headship the way God required there is no books you can try there is no loud you can shout there is no amount of money you can sport the family way that we give you the result of a Godly home unless you get under your head when a man is under his head cries and and and and and the life of Christ is reflecting through him you don't need to shout you don't need to fast about it the Lord that set that command will bring the next thing on the line with you many of our problem is because we want to achieve those things with our hands we want to faction it in the way that we want it to be and that's not the way that God designed it so you see here uh this is the place of headship it's a law of God it's a lord of God and brother Steve I was thinking about that yesterday and it it come back to to the question you asked me the other day and I was thinking about that uh because it fits in right here and God talks about the the Widow and he talks about uh uh the divorce and the stranger and the fatherless see the word fatherless is all because of hairshipment the man was under the law of polygamy so God had to make a provision for the woman when she were put away are you are you getting the picture amen praise the Lord because uh you know a sister asked me that question and I think when I said you know God make provision for for divorce it looks like God said go and div no that's not what I meant I meant thatth when the woman was put away God made a provision for her because you have to realize when Jesus came and took that subject he said it was because of the hardiness of the the heart which we which we would Define in many cases it was a form of abuse praise the Lord amen I think I'm supposed to be talking about how great fathers are that's what I'm supposed to be talking about but that's that's the thing that is in that is the thing that is required of a father that is the place you know so because of headship God respects that he respects them that was the first attribute that was that was manifested so so when you when you when you when you read in the in the in the scripture you know it talks about uh uh uh you know the man first you know uh it is it is a place of position it's not uh uh uh in the place of uh you know the woman being second class no is just a place of position glory be to God it's a place of position because uh like we have uh shared with you before from the word God plac uh uh the the the mystery of redemption and I was thinking about this the other day it came out uh you know I was just there I wow man this is very beautiful and because if you look at it is that he put the mystery of redemption in a woman because he gave the woman the promise the woman had the promise of the Redeemer the woman's seed shall bruise the head of the seing praise the Lord but you see what what will God do God will also Raise A Man and give him the law of redemption even though the woman had the promise of redemption she could not redeem it's the man that redeems now look in the life of Mary and Joseph it will give you a clear picture Mary was carrying the Redeemer in her womm by the voice of an Angel praise the Lord amen God knowing what he had predestinated for that time that that was the season that uh that uh uh uh uh he was going to come on the earth and bring his great glorious promise to pass what he did he allowed this man Joseph by history that is proven you know that he was a widower amen but history is proven that Joseph was a widower that's the reason why in the Bible they told Jesus these are your brothers and sisters they they were Joseph children from his former wife they were not married children praise the Lord so God took a man that was a widower a man that that has been there a man of experience to set him over this young virgin that was going to to be so innocent why the god did there to protect the gift that was coming the Sea of redemption was coming to the word praise the Lord you think about it if it were just a young boy with his hair spinning on his shoulder he would have told Mary your angel thing is just for you you alone praise the Lord so God has to take a man of experience a man that has been there even though he did not understand it but the Bible says he was not going to make a Public Disgrace of marriage he was thinking how can I deal with this and that attitude pleased God so much that God had to send the same angel that spoke to Mary that same angel had to come to Joseph by a dream and tell him said don't P Mary away praise the Lord man you tell me when Joseph woke up that morning if he was ever Brave he was ready to fight for Mary he was ready to defend Mary because now he's convinced the Bible called him a righteous man he never even touched that woman because the angel said the thing that is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost so you see she has the promise the man must be there to protect the promise why because God put Heavenly treasure in eting vessels so he raised men the church is fragile the church is very fragile praise the Lord everybody we come to church we all are believers even in Jesus church the son of pedition was there the church is very fragile so you see God has to raise men with the experience of the baptism of the Holy Ghost men that will spend their time in prayer because that's what the gift is given for to protect the body that's the Myster of redemption that's the reason why the woman was not made the very same day that the man was made because she's a she's a weaker vessel like the Bible say she's a tender vessel but in that vessel God will P the Myster of redemption God will give her three sacri VT and now it's for the man to protect praise the lord it's for the man to protect whether she's a daughter whether she's a wife it's for the man to protect glory be to God we have a a society that has defined marriage in all of his different ways trying to get away from God's principle so that's what I'm going I was going to show you there there and another piece I I I saw that in uh uh in the scripture there when El when El Isa went to find Rebecca there's an element that we didn't pay attention to there was a guy that was in that story and that guide was the brother of Rebecca the Bible says when Rebecca ran home to tell her father about this stranger that she met the scripture say her brother rign to meet them amen and you find out after everything was done and El gave his story why he have come in all of that and he have found that this woman is the woman to be married there was one man that was considered her brother why is the place of adoption where a boy has raised to the place praise the Lord that's the reason why when when young boys are not taking position and doing things they're supposed to do your sisters cannot be protected by you they cannot be protected by you because they don't see it in you they see you like a clown they see you like uh they don't they cannot be protected by you it's a place where the boy Step Up praise the lord it's a place of adoption his voice is considered because he's interested in the inheritance of his father the Bible said they should ask Rebecca's brother the father was there he was not dead but it's a place of adoption oh the Bible is so beautiful it's so beautiful glory be to God but when when boys are just uh you know they are they they want to be like girls and you know they you know they have uh uh grow their head long Pierce their ears and do all the funny thing they want to do your your sisters will not be able to trust you she's looking for the boy that can can be able to stand up for her not a young man you just just swallow up into video games and don't even know what is happening around the house who's going to trust you why because that is the place where you grow into fatherhood the one that come to adoption is the one that is interested in the inheritance of the family and your sisters are also part of your inheritance when they can watch you and and they can look at you and you you look like an example then pretty soon they don't want to talk to Dad they want to talk to you because they know they can talk to you they can have a conversation with you you will not just support them but y'all will be able to talk praise the Lord and many times when a girl can be able to find a brother like that she would take his word it's not your size or your degree they looking at your character how you are composing yourself it's a place of adoption praise the Lord like I said I I mean uh Western culture takes things from the Bible and we don't and we don't look them through where we take our special gwn from wedding day and our ring wedding day the man giving the woman the ring is from adoption ceremony it's completely different from the from a wedding ceremony in the wedding ceremony the man crowns the woman that's why that woman was sweeping and looking for one of the thing coins that fell from from her crown the man crowns the woman he takes the veil over the woman head he unveil her and then he puts his crown on her head with all of those all of those things uh uh virtues and different things that he put there but the Western culture we have gravitated to an adoption ceremony it's an adoption ceremony where the father dressed the son in a special garment the the the story of the prodical son and take a ring and put it on his finger and his name is as good as on the check as his father's name are we together praise the Lord amen now you see Western culture we takes that for our wedding ceremony but then the woman don't want to take the man's name praise the lord we are adopting that we get a gown we get a ring but she wanted a man name we get the whole thing mess up are we together that's why I'm supposed to be preaching your father's day's message Happy Father's day anyway at least I told you happy Father's Day if I don't say anything about Father's Day at least I told you happy Father's Day praise the Lord you see many times it's a it's an attribute that we don't appreciate until we don't have them anymore praise the lord it's an attribute that we don't appreciate a young man grow up and and you know he's seing his muscles and seeing him himself and you know his train of beard is coming on his chain he keeps hauling it keeps hauling it just wait they will grow you don't have to ha it you didn't haul the first one praise the Lord and then pretty soon that you you think we can exchange words and you know we we can we can let them know what is on our mind and we can do all of that but uh that's not what is designed for praise the Lord the same way is the father that brings the son to adoption is also the father that brings the daughter to Redemption praise the Lord that's why we just read there over in Numbers Chapter 30 he brings the daughter to Redemption what is there I mean he's there he's the one that he's supposed to be there to protect her to get her ready to turn her over to the next headship praise the Lord and that's the reason why many of our home struggle because we don't think about those responsibilities we don't think about those things that we supposed to do praise the Lord with the responsibility that comes with uh with with fatherhood and the things that uh that we are called to do is a place of respect and you know I read a quot here to you from respect but uh I was looking at this word one time I came across a meaning of the word resp ECT it's actually coming came out of a Latin word from where they get the name spectacles spectacles that's what that word respect came from and read is to repeat so the word respect means look again look again look the second time maybe you have to look from a different angle but look again oh a person might do something and and and you just think that uh you know it's it's so horrible how how can you do this and just because of that act you dress the person with that action that they have done and you just despise them no look again look from another angle you know brother talks about those couple that went down there in France and they were looking at the the crucifix they went under the crucifix and they were looking at it it was looking like a horrible picture the man of the gardian told them no you are looking wrong come here let me show you took them to another angle when they look at it they saw Christ on the tree sometimes it's the way that we are looking it's what we are looking at for the moment and many times the thing for the moment do not Define the person for you to disrespect them it goes either way we must respect anybody everybody the children must be respected the parents must be respected the people on the street must be respected Christians are people that supposed to hold value of respect yes sir because we have the grace to look at things from different angle to know that we were once lost look again if not change your glasses if you are using one way to look at things that's what the prophet of God would tell us how God demand respect there in the book of Isaiah he says look unto me all ye ends of the Earth there's a verse in the book of Isaiah he said look unto me it depends how you are looking now will read something here in from the message respect brother of God says here then the man told me the other day poor man swept up uh over year in the market for a living He sweep in the market for a living he had a breakdown a very bad shape he was in a very bad shape he's a Lutheran by faith and they had they had communion he's still unable to walk to the church so he took a c said it cost him 80 cents to go down and 80 cents to come back his neighbors very ungodly seen him praying The Lord's Prayer one morning and laugh at him and make fun of him he said to the neighbor he said to this man where you go in a cap this morning said I I I I was communion I went to communion I went down to the church he said what is communion says well when we take the bread and the wine he said oh I have mine too this morning at a table with a slice of bread and a pink of whiskey praise the Lord I know of three boys one time that marked a communion in a church they went up into a hotel room and got and got some H sandwich and a bottle of wasis and had their communion up there making fun of of the communion they had at the Pentecostal Church less than three months from them one of them was dead and the two was in an insan Institute now you know some of these things they sound funny to you but uh uh uh they they they are very serious I have a I have a good good friend very good friend many years back that should be back around uh 19 1998 a preacher had a crusade he just moved to the city where we were and he invited me because most of the guys there was one time a friend came here to visit I had him to greet the church and I told you how he you know he took care of me he was just my friend many of them will come you know to sell in our in our place so uh uh uh they knew this guy because the preacher he was a Nigerian so one of the brothers uh that you would come to our church told him about me I didn't know about me know about him but he sent for me so I went to meet him he asked me and he says you know i' like for you to preach on my crusade I said okay so I preached that night and uh and the Lord really gave us a breakthrough we had a good meeting and then after them many many of the guys the business guys they will come they will come to our little Fellowship we had a very very little small Church very little small church I hope one of these days I can be able to De out some of the photos and show you made of touch and all of that they started coming so this this young man Jude good friend of mine he started coming to church and you know uh uh uh he came out of out of uh Catholic faith and and you know he was he was one of these guys that were that were very you know he was he was very rough on all of these uh Prosperity preaching and all of that so when he came to church and and you know realized you know uh uh the Lord was helping us to to present the word you know he committed himself and got baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus and then uh he will he will have his uh first communion and I mean he was a business guy you know so I mean he was he was a great help to to our little group and a great help to me so we went and got the wine we got the communion ready we did the communion that night and he was he was it blew his mind you know especially uh feet washing and all of that I remember I had a Pentecostal friend that came came with a pastor that night and uh uh uh uh and now this this guy is he's not a message preacher started a church somewhere there in Liberia so uh I mean that's that's the first time they will see you because they you know they do things that like the way to do back there you know they use their wford and their grape juice so the pastor wife that night she refused to to take the communion because she she said no this wine I don't drink alcohol you know she know all of that and uh uh uh and you know we did the communion and all of that I could tell you different stories all over there but this guy Je after after the communion service in his mind he thought that oh wow we use this wine for communion so he went back to the supermarket and bought the same exact wine and bought even a biger gallon of it and took it home and uh uh you know and you know he started every time he's having meal he will drink wine because in his mind if we can use it for communion then I can drink it praise the lord it's it sound funny to you but it had a ey end it had its high end because you don't play with the things of God if you don't understand ask question so one day I came down to his house and I was visiting with him you know he would Coke and then you will invite me with car go in and eat and and when I look I saw the so I asked him as as as said JW what are you doing he he says that's that's the wine what we use for the communion I just bought this one for my house so I told him I I said no I said no you know uh the wine for the communion does not means that we must drink wine if we only do it because that's what the scripture says and we do it at that time of the communion you know and uh and he got into a little bit of an argument and I realized that okay I think something was wrong and and that is the way with many many of our young people you know they come they sit in the service and uh uh uh uh they so eager to take communion they want to be baptized the moment they come they eat the bread they take the wine they realize that okay this is the thing I wanted then the next time they are not coming then they start fooling around they get so eager because they want to come to communion so that you know they go and tell their parent I want to be baptized I want to be baptized I want to be baptized just so they can come in line and take the communion after that to them is is it is it the thing I was struggling for communion is not party food it's it's not parul for you to think that they are leaving you out and this friend of mine Jewel his life took a wrong turn and he would die very sorry for death very sorry for death took a wrong turn I mean this guy was I mean he was he was was really helpful to the church I mean supportive and all of that when he got into that Rebellion he would come to church you know he will Evol me in all of that before you realized he started running with the wrong crowd and running you know picking girls and things that he he got himself from and I will hear that my friend Jew was sick I went to look for him I went to look for him the last time I saw him I almost I cried you know and then just in a period of time his life was taken you can dis respect God you have got to respect God if you don't believe it just keep still keep away from it or either do that or come reverent and respect it don't make fun of people in the spirit and I see that year parents is your responsibility to teach your children it's your responsibility praise the Lord if you can cry in church and somebody is crying that's not your business don't make it your dining room talk don't make it your dining room talk if you hear somebody praying and you don't know what they are saying don't make it your ding room it's so easy in reverence and disrespect is one of the easier way to take an evil spirit it's one of the easier way to take an evil spirit and it can ruin your life forever if God don't be merciful oh I could tell you I could tell you stories I could tell you things that I've seen in my little walk with the Lord I could share things with you this morning that will shake you in your bones don't make fun of people in the spirit don't talk about people that are worshiping in the spirit of God let them alone leave them alone don't say that other person they just shouting that other person that's not your business it's not your business we must have the Liberty to express ourself before our father are we together okay I realized that I've gone over my time here and uh your fatherday meal is waiting for you I just read few things here and then I close up I actually got out of what I wanted to preach this morning just to bring this father day's thing so I'm not too gear up in it that's why you see me all over the place but Happy Father's Day Israel and the church the father was the priest of the house in the old Sanctuary the old time the father always was the priest and he had to watch over his household praise the Lord he had to watch over his household glory be to God what a change today the kids wash over the Dead In This Modern word but the father was to watch over his house he killed the lamb he took the house up and and and and he put the blood on the Lage of the doorpost and that was their protection they stay in it that's the place of the father he's there to be the protector praise the Lord you might have more degree than him but God plac him there it pleased God for him to be your father and that's that's the reason why when when God help a child that is able to gravitate towards that and and and and and and can be there for for the parent parents and and and and all of that it's it's it's something that is so pleasing to the father praise the lord it's something that is just so pleasing to the father I'll take one more year and then I'll let you go yeah yeah him a man is not measured by how much muzzle he got whether he get six pack or eight packs man in the scripture is not measured that way that's just a beast I have seen men that weighed 200 lbs and didn't have an arms of men in them they would throw a baby out of a mother's arm and ravish her that's not a man that is a bro a man is measured by character there never was a man like Christ Jesus never was a character like that man is measured by character and I said man is not measured by his big arms but the bags in the knees of his pens a man is measured by his praying ground the strength of a man is measured by his praying ground his strength is measured by how much time he spent before God and cry to God some other things that we want to change if we would just spend time praying we will have time talking but his bags of knes in his pains where he's been praying that's what measured a man that's why there was no man like our lord Jesus right from his youth he heard how they call him illegitimate a child he saw the rejection God embod in that flesh yet he will find a time aside and prayed was he praying for himself he was interceding for the very people that were insulting him interceding for the very people that was rejecting him in his final days on the earth in the garden of gsan he prayed so hard until his sweat was as thick as his blood father forgave them that's what a man is not a man that's ready to vent and ready to to to to show blow and all of that that's what animus does that's not you attacked and they're ready to attack you back may God help us as we come to the close of this May the Almighty God help us you know the our society the society is getting to where it is to its lowest point because manhood has been destroyed praise the Lord all of these men that are gravitating to become women and all of that and and and uh uh uh you see the you see the weakness you see uh uh H H men that are backing off from their responsibility and many and many mothers have to have to raise their children to become a dad and man in a man in the house and all of that that that that is the thing that is destroying because the structure that God set the structure that God said the one that's supposed to be the head of the society the head of the neighborhood you can't find him he's under the bridge carried away in drugs he's giving himself over to some kind of a sexual prostitution just want to be running around with women and making children all over the place now the society is vulnerable because just like we read here in numbers chapter chapter 30 it was the head of the home the head of the tribes when Moses would meet they would meet with the head of the tribes it was it was a man of every tribe a man of every home they come there they discuss how to be able to defend their home praise the Lord and that the very same thing that is destroying the societ is the same thing that is destroying the church when the church used to have praying men you don't find them anymore you don't find them anymore we make all the excuses why we don't pray we make all the excuses why we don't come to church we make all the excuses you don't find it men that will be able to be there and says here this is our examp we will stand for it we we I mean let but the quick to take one scripture and say this is my St we are so easy to tear apart and break away instead of us to stand right there and build together what we need in our home is praying man praise the Lord Brother Bram says a teaching of Moses when Amon will come from work and he will claim in the Artic and start praying he said jaob tried to discourage him she realized she couldn't she herself started praying praise the Lord she herself started praying before you realize little maram will get down by the chair and start praying why because she had daddy praying you realize little Aon will get down and pray because he the Year Daddy praying and brother BR said it broke a Praying Revival because it was time for the
