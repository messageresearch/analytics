sing glory glory to the the Son of [Music] God praise the Lord let's take our Bibles tonight and uh we will read u 1 Chronicle chapter 7 1 Chronicles chapter 7 thank you for the music I 1 Chronicle chapter 7 I'm wrong 2 Chronicle chapter 7 2 Chronicles chapter 7 that's a scripture that is very familiar to us Second Chronicles chapter 7 we read that just for the scripture reading tonight and then we go into what we want to talk about let's read from verse 12 and the Lord appeared to Solomon by night and said unto him I have heard that prayer and have chosen this place for myself for an House of sacrifice amen if I shut up heavens and there be no rain or if I command the locers to divor the land or or if I send pestilence among my people if my people which I call by my name shall humble themsel and pray and seek my face praise the Lord so we realize that praying and seeking his face is two different things if my people we shall call by my name shall humble themselves shall pray and seek my face and turn from the their Wicked Ways then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sins and will heal their land now my eyes shall be open and my ears attend unto the prayers that I made in this place amen father we want to ask your special blessings tonight as we approach your word come Lord speak to us what an awesome God you are what a wonderful father in the name of the Lord Jesus we pray amen amen while you have your seat let's turn to uh sons of Solomon Chapter 5 sons of Solomon Chapter 5 praise the Lord again uh we greet uh you in the name of the Lord Jesus and uh when you look in Sons of Solomon chapter five which of course I thought I will uh while we were reading there in uh 2 Chronicles then my mind came to this uh couple of uh weeks back or maybe back of uh some months we spoke on the message uh seeking the face of the Lord or my people that are called shall seek my face and uh uh I had to I had this chapter as a second portion of that message and uh but let's read it together and then we will get into what we want to talk talk about tonight I am come into my garden my sister my spouse I have gathered my my with my spice I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey I have drunk my wine and my milk eat oh my friend drink yeah drink abundantly oh my beloved I sleep but my heart waketh it is The Voice of my beloved that knock saying open to me my sister my love my Dove my UND defi for for my head is filled with deal and my locks with the drop of the night I have put off my coat how shall I put it on I have washed my feet how shall I defy them my beloved put in His Hands by the hold of the door and my bows were moved for him I rose up to open to my beloved and my hands Dro with M and my fingers with sweet smelling M upon the handle of the lock I open to my beloved but my beloved have withdrawn himself and was gone my soul fell when he speak I sought him but I could not find him I called but he gave me no answer the washmen that went about the city found me the smug man the wounded me The Keeper of the worldall took away all my V from me I charge you oh Daughters of Jerusalem if you find my beloved that ye tell him that I am siake of love praise the Lord amen this is a beautiful love story here uh uh but if you look at the story as as we want to try to look at tonight you realize that you could bring this story in in uh in a picture of Christ and his bride you could bring the picture the story in a picture of Christ in his church praise the Lord amen and he is the Beloved amen he is the Beloved and uh uh the church is uh the spouse the sister the one that is love praise the Lord but if you if you look at the story and you have time you read it again you will see that uh uh uh he came to his beloved and call it to his beloved but she has already withdrawn from the day after everything that she went about doing she has withdrawn from the day and uh it was about night time she have drawn herself into where we would say maybe into bed or into rest and she locked the door and and then pretty soon she heard him knocking the door and he wanted to come in Praise the Lord but then uh she felt she said uh uh you know she heard his voice and saying open my sister my love and uh his hair filled with deal and and his coat all worth because of the night deal but uh she said I have put off my co caught and have uh she have washed my feet how shall I defy them and yet she's hearing her beloved calling to her and uh uh and her heart was moved but then when she took the time to go and open the door uh she uh realized that he was gone praise the Lord she was he was gone and and uh and her heart was broken and she went this this is the verse that in this uh chapter that really get me verse S she went into the street trying to find her beloved and and Solomon says and then the Washman and that went about the city found me you know they beat her up they wound her up there in some sense they abuse her trying to find her beloved praise the Lord and yeah she's calling to the daughters of Jerusalem when you find my beloved tell him I'm sake of love tonight I want to I want for us to speak on Lord teach us to pray praise Lord Lord Sunday we talk a little bit uh if we want to turn to Luke chapter 11 Luke chapter 11 I'll come back to that story that we have just read for Luke chapter 11 Luke chapter 11 um verse one and it came to pass that as he as he was praying in a setting place when he sees one of his disciples said unto him Lord teach us to pray if I would take that as a subject tonight Lord teach us to pray as John also taught his disciples praise the Lord amen many times as Believers or as Christians uh you know as people that been going to church you know we we uh you know we we start serving the lord and pray the soon it's easy for us to uh uh get to the place and think that we we have got our praying meted down or you know we we we know how to pray and I wonder how many times do we ask the Lord and say Lord teach me how to pray praise the Lord like we like we said on on Sunday if you realize that uh uh uh we we showed that the Lord's Prayer is both in the Book of Matthew chapter 6 and here in Luke chap 11 they are not at the same time they are not at the same it's not the same even they are not recording the same even and if you also realize if you if you were able to look at the Lord's Prayer after we speak on Sunday you will realize that the one in Luke is different from the one in Matthew there is a difference praise the Lord and on Sunday I said uh uh The Lord's Prayer uh has 13 cycles and it has 66 words that's in Matthew in Luke it don't have 66 words because in Luke there are few verses that are that are not that have not been written and if you follow the church history also you will realize that the Protestant Church head to the The Lord's Prayer in Matthew and the Catholic Church head to the Lord's Prayer in in Luke if you ever been around the Catholic uh church or being around the Catholic system you realize that when they pray the Lord's Prayer they don't say the last part that is in Matthew that kdom come I know uh uh not that kiddom come I'm sorry and for dine is the kingdom the power and the glory the the Catholics don't say that they say what is in Luke and Luke ends The Lord's Prayer lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil amen praise the Lord for some reason the Catholic adopted it used to bother me uh uh even even from a child because I yeah I'm not born a Catholic uh uh I grew up in the metodist home but I went to a Catholic school so every time we go uh into the chaper and they are saying the Lord's Prayer they always stop there uh lead us not into uh uh lead us lead us not into temptation Deliver Us from Evil amen and then I will continue so I was always think am I doing it wrong praise the Lord but I was a Protestant I was a better is protesting so from from child or from a young age not from child but from a young age that that that has been on my mind I could not tell the difference I couldn't tell why it was like that until until later it it it did not mean much to me uh real I would say real until this G weekend when I was looking at the subject to preach and then I say oh oh I see uh I see for the fact there is that I could tell the two saints were different they were not the same now and uh and just like we said on on on Sunday uh I I see what is giving here in in Luke's account as a repetition because in Matthew account Jesus never had any of the disciples coming to him to say Lord teach us how to pray Jesus was giving you know his his uh his salon on the mount on uh in in Matthew account that's when he gave the Beatitudes you know I mean Jesus on in Matthew account he was just like Moses amen he was just like Moses coming with the Ten Commandments giving the people the word of God for that age and that's what he was doing he says it is written as it is written in the Lord thou shall not do this but I say unto you that uh you know this is what you should do so we see him as the Lord giver and in that way he was instructing the people but here in Luke we see a complete different setting when you go back and just look at all the stories account there you will realize this is a complete different setting the Bible says he came he came out of praying as usually that he would go and I believe there with this setting what I can imagine in my mind is that the disciple realized that Jesus will always you know get away from them and and and find a time to pray you know he will find a time and sometimes when they come they will realize that he's you know that he's he's he's talking to the father he's you know he's he's praying and he's placing things before God they will have to wait and and and I believe also that they realized that the way he was talking was completely different from the way that the Jewish church or the syn God might have taught them to pray praise the Lord he was talking and he was communing it was almost like he had somebody sitting down with him and he was just talking to this person I don't believe that he was beating up the dust and he was kicking his feet I believe he was just communing he was just sitting in communion praise the Lord and I believe that it moved this it moved the disciple especially whoever was this disciple that came to him and said Lord teach us to to pray praise the Lord I believe it was remarkable I believe that it was something that uh they thought that they needed praise the Lord and you can only ask God to teach you how to pray when you feel that you need it if you think you know how to pray you will never ask God to teach you how to pray because you think you know it you don't ask somebody to teach you something that you already know praise the Lord you find many people on the job when they start to teach them you know either the shrink their shoulders and they don't pay attention because they know I already know that you're just wasting your time uh and it's not even correcting the person but sometimes it's a beautiful thing when you just act as if to say you don't know there are things that you might get there are things that you might learn there is there is always a benefit to know how to do one thing two three different ways than to just stay in your one definite way that you know many times it's a know it all Spirit when we behave like that praise the Lord amen no doubt I believe that these disciples have learned how to pray because I mean if they were good Jewish boys from 12 years old they were taught the Torah they were taught uh you know the the prayer of Moses the prayer of Abraham the prayer of Jacob they were taught all the different prayers in the scripture that uh you know that the Old Testament H for them at the time no doubt they knew how to but just like I said it was something remarkable I also believe that when it came closer there was an atmosphere that they have never failed and they asking how is said when he prayed it looked so sacred it looked so real praise the Lord so tonight if the Lord as we trust the Lord to help us we want to we want to ask the Lord to teach us how to pray amen I feel now to ask the Lord all the time to teach me how to pray because I always believe there is we all need a better way to get closer to the Lord Brother brandom said that's the reason why we come to church to be better to be better than what we were today amen we trust that the service will make us better than what we wear today or what we wear yesterday he said for us to be better husbands to our wives and better wives to our husband better parents to our children better children to our parents better uh H uh Neighbors in our neighborhood better workers at the job and that's what the presence of God is for is to make us better and there is one desire that we should have when we go to the house of the Lord is to be better praise the Lord amen and when we have that desire to be better the word of God never comes we we never get offended at the word praise the Lord because how can you get offended when your desire is to be better how will you get better if the word don't correct you if the word don't instruct you how you going to get better praise the Lord so so uh and and and and and the way that I look at I look at uh sons of Solomon Chapter 5 for for a long time I'm having one of my old Bible where I read the whole sons of Solomon many years back uh uh uh in the AR coast and if you look in the Bible you will see where I put the bridegroom when when when one verse is reading to the other one when it comes to the bride and I put the bride and I read down when I think it's the bridegroom that is talking I put the bridegroom and and and you know that's I did a beautiful uh uh Bible reading through the Book of Solomon and that chapter has stuck with meaning and and the way that I I I think about that chapter I've always apply it to my prayer life praise the Lord Revelation chapter 3 uh uh Jesus said behold I stand at the door and knock If any man open and yeah the bridegroom was knocking at the door he was knocking at the door to come in and if you read the verses before you realize he has brought gifts he had given the bride a lot of gifts and now she got so consumed in the gifts and yet The Giver was at the back of the door praise the Lord trying to come in so they can enjoy the gift together and that is the condition of the church the church get so attracted to you know the good preacher the good music and and and uh manifestation whether it is praying and and our prayer being answered or you know we want to do this thing for God and you know we we we we we get so excited it looks like we want gifts more than the giver praise the Lord but if we can have the giver we have all the gift amen am praise the Lord so she she's there and then and after she's finished enjoying all the gifts y say she creep to her bed she got to her rest she have washed her feet and she have taken us her cting and I mean she's uh she's coing in her bed and yeah the bridegroom comes a time for communion a time of fellowship and then he come and then he's calling to her but she just oh man no I mean I'm I'm too tired I was busy the whole day I'm too tired and and I believe that is the place where the church is fing praise the Lord that is the place where the church is feeling because we get so busy and we just have a little time for prayer we have a little time for communion and because we think we have our prayer session down or our word of praying down and and and and the things that we need to say to God to be able to fulfill our prayer life or our prayer what whatever we want to term it to be it put us in that place that I mean we can just run through a Lord thank you no blessing and we just we just get through it praise the Lord and here it said there after she kept hearing the knocking and she kept hearing and you know feeling in her heart that uh the the the the love need to have some communion with her like sometime we feel in our heart and we just you feel a little bit condemned or you feel a little bit not not most in a sense of feeling condemned but you just feel like you feel that unrest you know like brother Bram said in Christ is the Myster of God revealed he says that's the reason why we feel that way he says because it is Christ that is trying to draw you into communion and sometimes we get distracted we think oh we need to do days for you know for us to get satisfied and when you get it done you stay feel that unrest and you have to take care of this and you get it done you say feed that unrest he said all of those things are just distraction because the main thing is just God trying to get your attention for a minute if we would just stop and say dear Lord I don't know what's going on my mind mind is just going please help me praise the Lord and that's how she felted and quickly she got off her bed the cat that she did not wanted to put on she got the coat and then and then the feet that was already washed she put the feet on the ground and she when she went outside he was gone praise the Lord amen then she start running to every Revival and start going to every denomination and she got in the hands of the ones that supposed to be the Watchmen the preachers praise the Lord and they tell her about a 24 days program a 12 days program a fasting and praying program a Women program a online program and and all of these program and when she come out of it she's so confused why because as all people are running after result running after result running from one prayer B to another prayer uh group and to another thing just looking for some kind of a h uh uh spiritual catch up praise the Lord when the scripture says the Lord is even n thee that's what the Bible says he's NY if we will confess with our mouth and believe with our heart he's that's how so close he is that's how so close now the church has got our spirit so mess up the other preachers said that's the way you have to pray you know you got to imagine Jesus Christ you know you got to put the Huffman picture there you got to keep that picture in your mind you know and and the other person said no this is the way you have to pray and the other person said and it have just made our spirit you know the biggest part of the H bin that is messed up is our spirit praise the Lord because right from growing up I mean could going into a lot of things tonight and just get out of out of the way right from growing up all of the things that we have seen we have heard that we have gone through it resides right in our spirit praise the Lord and that is the reason why sometimes you misunderstand people when they say things to you it's because your spirit is so draving to to understand think this way that no matter how easy or how they try to say because your spirit is so driven that is the most complex part of the human it's our spirit man praise the Lord that is the most complex part of the human is our spirit why because that is the place that is what is birthed between Eve and the sep your soul is not birth from Eve and the sein amen praise the Lord are we together now so she's being abused she's being robbed by all these Watchers of the night and all the keepers of the night night why think about it why if she have just get off her bed that night get down and open the door praise the Lord why if she have just make that little attempt and just get in communion with God are we together tonight oh Lord teach us how to pray praise the Lord when you read church history you'll realize that there are two things that brings Revival to a people is praying and repentance praise the Lord amen when the people real get down to praying it prepared their heart it prepared them to let go it prepared them to put them in a place of repentance and when the people gu to that place praise the Lord amen then God is ready to move on the scene for the people the Revival is not the three days service the Revival is how much the heart of the people willing to commune with God praise the Lord just like brother Bram said like the ocean will do its Revival you know he says there's not additional water that is adding to the ocean is just going through that to be able to PCH itself of all the dirt that is in it so Lord teach us how to pray teach us how to pray see see what brother Brandon will say yet in message Supernatural he says prayer is a sincere thing I'm going try to take my time tonight if I we don't get through we always have uh other days to continue amen prayer is a sincere thing prayer is talking to God praise the Lord Prayer is talking to God Amen many times we are talking to ourself praise the Lord but yet God hears us the reason why I said we are talking to ourself is because we having so much of ourself on our mind praise the Lord this very thing we are praying about we are thinking about so many different ways to go about without it and yet we are praying praise the lord the devil knows that how your spirit is birthed between him and your first birth so the moment you get down to pray he gets in your spirit he start to he start to mess your mind up and put your mind on everything he knows how to to play on that ground praise the Lord he knows how to play on that ground and I can say to you tonight that he he has he has more he has more access or more control to that ground more influence to that ground than you have but prayer is talking to God prayer is not get down shut your eyes and thinking about Wasing all your work you are doing praise the Lord amen the thing about it there if prayer you don't have to close your eyes to pray there is no scriptural requirement that say close your eyes and pray the only reason why I think we CL close our eyes to pray is to avoid distraction praise the Lord hallelujah and because the devil knows that you want to avoid distraction from your physical seeing sense he gets in your spirit he gets in your mind that's the only reason why we close our eyes I I see I see I I see many men and I know many men I have a good friend of mine I I've tried to do that I just can do it but this guy I I mean we were good friends you know what in the morning he would leave me when I'm praying he will leave me inside and he go outside I mean he he goes outside he walk around 5:30 in the morning he will walk and and I mean that is the best time of praying he can ever have he walks around with his eyes open he walks in and I mean he he just have a good time I tried I can praise the Lord so it's more than just closing your eyes is dealing with your distraction whether your eyes is closed or your eyes is open praise the Lord Hallelujah so you see many of a men that that they have trained thems they have trained how to gear himself in the spirit and if you are not trained close your eyes praise the Lord amen because you also dealing with Spirit especially in the assembly especially especially when people being pray for our children must be taught to close their eyes because they are kids they don't deal with Spirits are we together but that's the major reason why I think we close our eyes prayer is not get down short your eyes and thinking about your watching or your work you are doing say Lord help me and John and and he Mr Jones and so forth he said that's not prayer that's repeating some words praise the Lord can we say Lord teach me to pray amen don't worry if you can't say it you will learn to say it I'll tell you don't feel unless you don't feel you the need to learn learn from the Lord how to pray but prayer is to come into an atmosphere where you realize that you are in the presence of God and you are moving to then in the deepest of sincerity so sometimes when we first Get Down On Our Knees we have not even started because until you can get your spirit under control and get your mind Center on God and you are just warming of the Angel praise the Lord because that flight is not going to take up until you get every distraction out of the way praise the Lord amen until you get very distraction and look at look at the beauty here the Lord says that before you even open your mouth he knows what you want to say before you ask him so you should realize that he's not looking for your many words he's looking for your attention he's looking for your attention how much you are focused on him because he already know what you want to say he know beyond what you want to say the Bible says we in ourself we don't even know how to pray it's our spirit that grown praise the Lord is our spirit are grown within us it's coming into an atmosphere where you realize that you are in the presence of God and you are moving today in the deepest of sincerity the first thing you say first you say a little worship oh Jehovah Our Father how I love you praise the Lord that's how you warm up the angel that's how you get your mind on God by praising him Lord I love you I thank you you've been so good to me trying to get your mind on him and thinking about his goodness and his Mercy In by his grace not just blessing God with all your needs Lord I really need you right now that I need you right now and and and and and and sometimes our mind is not even on that right now is not as as as life and death to Us Praise the Lord first you say a little worship oh Jehovah how I love you you see then then after the worship of prayer after the worship of prayer then you come with a sincere heart asking praise the Lord so when you take it back to the Lord's Prayer Jesus was not giving us a recitation he was teaching us a principle how to approach the father our father my Lord and my God praise the Lord making him a present tense making him one that is so close not one that is distant not one that is in the past not the one in the future to come but making him so present praise the Lord then he says when you have made him present then worship Him Hallowed be thy name that's what brother Bram called a worship of prayer where you can Praise Him and thank him and appreciate him for his love and for his mercy and for his grace praise the Lord oh I tell you when you get into pra praising God and really praising God you know what it does It cast all those evil spirit that is battling your mind it start creating an atmosphere why because the Angels start flopping their wings they start coming closer because Jehovah is now inhabiting the praise of his his son or the praise of his daughter because he inhabit the Praises of his people you want get over your mind battle in prayer learn to praise God spend more time praising and worshiping him and appreciating him praise the Lord can we say Lord teach us how to pray teach us how to pray Lord teach us how to pray CU I'm telling you prayer will change your life forever when you know how to pray and know how to commune with God it will change your life forever your walk with God is going to be completely different praise the Lord no matter how much we know you know you know or you think you know how to pray we cannot prayed enough praise the lord we need more time to commune with god let's get through this before our time is out tonight praise the Lord I been wanting to bring this to to us a little while now but uh I couldn't find the right time until after uh uh speaking this Sunday so I just think we should go in this direction hoping the Lord will bless it amen that would just now be a message like a wonderful message preach oh it was wonderful no I want it to be impactful amen more than being wonderful then after the worship of prayer then you come into you come with a sincere heart asking if you abide in me now see what brother Bram is going to to drop right in there as he teach us to pray he brings that scripture if you abide in me in my and my word abide in you he says if yet abide in me not go out from behind the curtains into the word and run around and try to get back into the curtains that's what we do when we are praying Jesus says when you go to pray shut the door close the curtain praise the Lord so he's saying that when we go behind the curtain we must stay there but many of the time we are be the curtain and then we go shopping we go running all around and taking care of our business this person told me that when I finish praying I'm going to deal with them this other person I got to make this phone call when I'm finished praying I mean we go all around and then we come behind the curtain oh Lord Jesus Lord father Lord God just bless us Lord and just bless us Lord I mean you are not abiding you are not abiding when you shut the door or close the curtain everything must stay outside it must stay behind the curtains praise the Lord you know how destructive I mean uh uh uh uh uh uh uh it can be I mean when you when you when you real having conversation with uh with uh with someone and you I mean you're talking something serious and then uh the I mean phone calls are just coming and you got to answer this person okay I call you back just now I'm talking something and and the other person called again I'm calling back before you realize you lost your thought when you are just talking with an Earthly person how much more when you are in the presence of the creator of Heaven and Earth praise the Lord our praying life should never be underestimated praise the Lord amen it must never be underestimated it's it's very easy for us to have a religious Life by just being identified with church and making sure we are in church and yet we are struggling with our walk with God we're trying to do everything the church want us to do but yet we are struggling with our walk with God praise the Lord i' rather be walking with God Amen even if it's contrary to the church order I rather be walking with God praise the Lord remember many years uh you know the uh some years ago the uh uh the the the the youth at the time went for the uh a youth meeting and from that youth meeting one Sunday we uh brother LD was leading service he came and I I think uh in the way that the Lord was dealing with him and I mean uh he prayed through the praying time and prayed through the son service and it look everybody was confused and wondering what's going on with this young man bless his heart Brother Scott came and met me out sat we talk I told him I said I'll take care of that I knew exactly what was happening Amen to me I don't I don't see what what what is out of order he's not playing regy music he's praying to God praise the Lord okay let's let's just let's just go right ahead here then and and um I might might be burning out my time here when I'm really supposed to be getting down to preaching to you tonight but I just want to talk to you I want to encourage you because look I I I'm not I'm not just I'm not just preaching to you like I'm should be preaching the seron I'm talking to every one of us I'm also saying to the Lord teach me how to pray praise the Lord because I think I can get better in my prayer prayer life than I am if you abide me not go out from behind the curtains into the word today and run around and try to get back into the curtains tonight if ye abide in me my word abide in you otherwise if you are like Aaron Rod that pull up to the shakana Glory by the golden po of man of word you can eat at any time and your soul is refreshed and and and and and blooming and yelling abiding abiding abiding if you abide in me abiding dwelling waiting being there you have to be there when you are praying you have to be there you can be somewhere else yes you have to be there if you had abide in me and my words abide in you then ask what you will it will be given to you you see the failure of the church the Pentecostal Church The Message Church the Baptist Church and all is a feeling to that abiding Grace when people can just be there be in the service be in the service be in the word be in the praise be in the worship to just about be there praise the Lord if you are not in the worship you makes it more difficult for the people that are there if you are not in the word you make it more difficult for the preacher that is preaching because what we don't realize is that uh it's it's it's it's it's more spiritual thing for us to be in this place 2 hours 3 hours there is more spiritual thing it's it's a more dimensional thing that is happening right here when we are in this place but tell Spirits congregates praise the Lord when you get up you get a group of people that are that are that are not praying through people you realize one person slip out to go shopping the other person go home to C the other person have gone to work to take care of what is at work and before you realize you you just get you get a bunch of Cups before you but no Spirit they all gone then to you the I don't know what the preacher is preaching he's just wasting time to the preacher where are the people he bus is struggling to get their attention and and draw them in he keep repeating and are you hearing me did you hear what I just said should I that again he had to do that why because people are people are dispersed that's the failure of the church being in the abiding Grace to just be there be there praise the Lord be there be in the word be in the pray prise be in the worship be in the prayer praise the Lord they don't have to call you up for you to pray before you pray with a with a with a person that is praying if they are praying for the need you take the need up also yes Lord bless our brother help our sister Lord yes Lord we are believing for her healing yes Lord you you are there praise the Lord are we together now I have a few more than I have time to read but it's not about reading praise the lord it's not about reading courts it's about speaking to you amen I could just fulfill the time to try to go through all my courtes that I want to go through but it's not about reading courts it's about getting you into the word getting you into his presence getting you to the place where we supposed to be if the people that I called by my name if they will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their evil ways praise the Lord if the people that I call by my name if they will humble themsel praise the Lord who here tonight let's just bow our hairs for [Music] [Music] for [Music] if there's anything I can encourage you tonight before we pray and be gone [Music] home when you feel that call to your heart to pray [Music] you have to realize that is the greatest invitation you will ever have the devil will never call to your heart to pray he don't even want you to pray he will never give you a desire to pray if you feel that call to your heart to pray [Music] if you never feel a call to your heart to pray then you really need to be at the [Music] altar if you go through an entire day and you don't feel a call to you heart to pray sometimes you can be at [Music] work and you feed a c to your heart to [Music] pray brother bam talks about Stonewall Jackson he said that's the reason why they call him Stonewall Jackson he said because right in the midst of a fight or in the midst of a battle when he feel that n to pray he will stand right there not hearing what's going on around him he would take his heart off lay it on his chest and say a word to the Lord [Music] because after the Holy Spirit tried to win your heart to pray and if you are not giving he you might not feed it you will just get in your religious activity before you go to bed you say your little prayer you get up in the morning you knee down you say your fast prayer and and uh uh uh and in the night you say your fast prayer you just get into a fast praying moment but you really not having communion with [Music] God you're not having communion with God why because many times he tried to lose your heart but you get so busy so many things on your mind so many things you have to do that you don't even feel you don't you don't feel it in you and you have to you have to realize that that when you lost feelings it kill any form of relationship when you lost feeling when you lost feelings for your parents you lost feelings for your spouse you lost feelings for your friends it killed the relationship so if you are not feeling if you if you don't feel it in your heart you need to take your heart to God you need to you need to repent it's a good sign that you have you have you have you have grieved the holy spirit that he he's he can't even come by to touch your heart God don't wait for you to go to bed before he touch your heart he don't wait for you to wake up in the morning before he touch your [Music] heart many of us we have just become like that lady in Sons of Solomon Chapter 5 we love our comfort then to seek his face if you really want to to seek God face sometimes you got to discomfort yourself sometimes you got to discomfort yourself sometimes you have to take the best hour of your day you have to take the time where you are so a light if it is just five minutes or 10 minutes and just say Lord I just want to thank [Music] you how can we overcome how can we really get down to God how can God trust you speaking to your heart instructing you how can he when there is no communion how will you know his voice even when he's calling you when he's speaking to you in the [Music] service we have made our own religion and it has to be the way we want it or as we don't want it it has to be The Way We Believe it or else we don't want [Music] it we have made our own God he has to speak to us the way we we we want it this is what we want him to say if he don't say it I don't believe it I don't want it except it is said this [Music] [Music] way coming this desire down in my soul God Of Heaven feed me till I want no more yes my heart f it all and make me no oh Bread of Heaven feed me till I want no more yes my heart F Lord and make me let's pray together [Music] tonight let's pray together let's just thank the Lord just like I said he knows he knows what we need he knows where we are in our prayer life he knows where we are
