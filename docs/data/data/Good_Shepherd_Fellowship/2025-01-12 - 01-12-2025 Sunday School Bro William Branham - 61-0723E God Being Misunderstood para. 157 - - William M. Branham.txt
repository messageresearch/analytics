[Music] 106 and the 7th verse I was going to read on down a piece a part of this Psalm but it's David why come to me was because of this morning's message and now get my Watcher and try to be out at 9:30 if all possible now on the 7th bir verse of Psalms 106 our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies but provoked him at the sea even the Red Sea I'm going to read the next verse nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake that he might make his mighty power to be known the Lord had his blessings I'm going to speak to you if the Lord willing on the subject of the misunderstanding God misunderstood I'll take it like that God being misunderstood amen you know misunderstanding gets us in a lot of trouble many times that people say things that they uh repeat after somebody else where they misunderstood them amen that gets a person in trouble I believe it would be good for us if we just F wait till we understood what we was talking about don't you think so I know it would be for me a very good for me to find out first and then say it but we're always seem to be misunderstood and here David is speaking of Israel misunderstood his miracles when they were in Egypt now to misunderstand is just not say well I didn't hear what he said but to see something done and misunderstand what it's for that's a that's you're missing the boot all completely then now God doesn't do Miracles just to say see I'm God God does a miracle for an understanding he God does it for a purpose and did you know notice the reading of the Psalms here in this seventh verse I think it's so beautiful I want to read it over again our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt see they didn't understand it they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies but provoked him at the sea even the Red Sea nevertheless he save them for his name's sake that he might make his mighty power to be known he see they did not understand why that God down in Egypt perform these Miracles he was trying to show them his mercies amen he was trying to get them to understand that he was God in their midst I love that in my little sermon that I preached here sometime ago uh up and Chicago and then I believe I preached it here the boys has got it on tape as the eagle stirreth up her nest floth over her young how that the old mother eagle takes her little babies before she takes them on a flight they got a lot of loose feathers in them and they've never seen her really in her V because they're all squatted down in the nest but she gets up over the nest and she spreads her big Mighty Wings what's she doing she screams she wants him to know her voice she stretches forth her big wings the female eagle is sometimes the largest they are said that Eagles sometime that big females has wings 14 ft from tip to tip pick up a calf and fly away with it 14 ft tip from tip to Wings far as across this platform right here from post to post she gets up there before this little fell because why she's going to take him on a flight he's never been out of that nest and she's going to take him way up in the heavens and Shake him off and let him up there to flop for himself to learn how to fly so she wants to show The Authority she has she spreads forth her big wings to the stut of the feathers and she screams and then she fans them oh my the feathers fly out the this and everything everything else she's throwing wind in there like of a Jet Plane knocks him backwards and he lays on his little back and looks up and think mother How Great Thou Art How Great Thou Art see how strong my wings are I can pick you up and pack you anywhere I want to I'm powerful that's what God was doing to Israel you know what he said as the eagle stir up her nest that's the same thing he found Israel in a howling land land down there and he brought him up out of Egypt and Tuck him into the promised land on the wings of an eagle see and what was God doing these Miracles he was trying to get to his people that he was the mighty Jehovah Hallelujah and that's what he's trying to do today amen he just doesn't heal people just to because he can heal he's trying to get to you that he's the resurrection he can make you well he can raise up your body he can do whatever he wants to he's Jehovah I like that but the people misunderstood him God is so easily to be misunderstood by unbelievers for those who don't want to understand many people try to understand many don't want to understand they just shut up themselves and say there's no such a thing and I don't believe in such then they can never understand but a man that that's willing to understand that's willing to sit down and come let us reason together say the Lord amen now that man is is on the line of learning something from the law but people who always are associated with God and God's power you can hardly be associated with god without being associated with his power because when you're associated with him you are acquainted to him or relative to him and then you have his power in you amen that's the reason that people cannot believe in miracles today because they don't have anything in them to believe with they've got to have something in there to believe with and when the spirit of God is in a man he'll say Amen to every word of God and every miracle of God hallelujah but as my mother used to say you can't get blood from Eternal because there's no blood in it so that's the same way you can't get belief out of an unbeliever because there's nothing there you believe with amen a man said I don't believe in Divine Healing no matter what you say certainly it's not for him it's only to those who can believe praise the Lord if you're going to get blood get it out from something's got blood in it if you're going to get Faith get it out of something that's got faith in it and that's the way God uses something that's got faith in it you go to S you're in a healing campaign when you ain't got faith enough to believe it amen how's he go to send you out in a miracle work in Revival and you ain't got faith enough to believe it he wants something that's got something in there that he can produce something with so the people misunderstood Noah was very much misunderstood in his days Noah acquainted of God a servant of God a believer in God and when youve become a believer in God you do things so contrary to what people think it's right so they think that you're crazy and Noah warned of God prepare an art for the saving of his household and the people thought that he was crazy he was not crazy he was just misunderstood because he was following the direction of God amen amen I like that Hallelujah he was misunderstood How could a man when you'd say there's never no rain come from the skies what is rain never had rain God irrigated the ground no where's that rain at I don't know show me where it's that I can't show it to you well how do you know it's going to come down from up there when there's done up there to come down no one might have said something like this God told me it was coming down and if God said it's coming down he's able to take it up there and then bring it down so that settles it if God said so that's all there is to it see he was misunderstood because he was following God Elijah I can stay on these subjects a long time but I've got several of them here I would like to come to quickly Elijah was misunderstood by his Nation Elijah was an Israelite he was a Jew and he was uh misunderstood because he was always condemning his Nation condemning the king condemning the queen condemning everything there was around him condemning him what a crackpot he seemed to be well my everything you King th sayth the Lord God's going to punish you Jezebel you so and so he was misunderstood why he was following God it was not Elijah they misunderstood it was the working of the holy spirit in that they misunderstood How could a man raise up against his own Nation blaspheme his own Nation correct it and put the curses of God up on it the very Nation the very people that he lived with his own race his own color his own Creed his own kind and yet predict the judgments of God and call a famine upon Him amen he was misunderstood because it wasn't Elijah it was God in Elijah that they misunderstood it wasn't Elijah being misunderstood it was God leading Elijah and they misunderstood that God was a holy God and he canot en tolerate sin no matter if it's on your brother sister or mother no matter who it is that sin in the sight of God and the judgment will come upon him for amen misunderstood Daniel was misunderstood when all of the rest of the children of Israel bowed down to the image but he and Shadrach and mishak and abedo refused to bow down well they said what's the matter with him the whole nation said what's the matter with this crazy guy well all the rest of the Hebrews recognize our God they recognize that they bow down when we play the trumpets and sound the trumpets and play the posteries and so forth and sound the flutes they all bow down but what's the matter with this crackpot what's the matter with him he won't do it because he was in contact with God that's what the matter he was misunderstood he was supposed to be crazy or lost his mind or there was a bunch of cranks but they were only following the leading of the spirit Hallelujah that's the reason they were misunderstood all the prophets of the Old Testament how they rose up and prophesied against their Nation how they prophesied against the people how they prophesied against the things putting curses up on them and doing things like that they misunderstood why they were God's servants they were doing the will of God they were doing the service of God therefore they were misunderstood and anybody that follows God is misunderstood amen Jesus our lord when his birth he was misunderstood the mag they were misunderstood they were following a supernatural sign to find a king that was born King of the Jews they know there was a star rising out of Jacob according to the Prophecies of Daniel and they know this king would be a savior he would be the king of Israel and they come two years all the way from India down by the Titus River and across the deserts and through the mountains everywhere and come into the city of Jerusalem one evening about Sundown screaming where is he that's born King of the Jews where is he and nobody know nothing about it it was a strange thing that the king of the Jews was born and people hundreds of miles away not about it T not you're in the city where he was born and the place he was born and what's the people he was born to and they know nothing about it Hallelujah they misunderstood the Magi they said there is no such a thing as the king of the Jews we got a king up here Herod he was misunderstood in his birth when he was born and married was to be mother before she was uh married to Joseph misunderstood they thought it was born out a holy wed they did not know that the Holy Ghost had conceived this child here but it was misunderstood it was the act of God and people misunderstood it they still misunderstand it amen an act of God is usually misunderstood only by spiritual believing people people who bleed the spirit but it was misunderstood the Magi was misunderstood Herod misunderstood it when Herod said well you tell me where the baby is and I'll will worship him too he was a hypocrite he was a lion while he was sprayed up he didn't know the scriptures that they were supposed to be a messiah come a king of heaven and Herod thought it would be an Earthly King and he wanted to kill him to get rid of him it wasn't an Earthly King he said this Earth is not his King this was my kingdom my subjects would fight for me but my kingdom is of above Herod misunderstood it he thought it was an Earthly king that's why they say they what church you belong to if you're a Christian what denomination none they don't get it see they can't understand it they think a denomination means a Christian it's Vice Hallelujah very much so but it's misunderstood by the people now we find out that Herod misunderstood it he couldn't understand it Nicodemus couldn't understand it the New Birth when he came came to Jesus by night someone condemned him I don't condemn him he's a good man you want to find out something he was busy few today maybe is at his priest's office there something that he had to come tonight anyhow he got there he done a lot better than a lot of people does now they won't come day our night he finally arrived before you condemn him have you he finally got to Jesus and let's not condemn him if we haven't been there if you get there then I don't think you condemn him oh he he got there and he but night maybe he was busy anyhow he come maybe Jesus is too busy out praying for the sick and think only time he could catch him for this interview would be at night time but he finally got there he stayed there because he got an interview with Jesus and when Jesus said him he said Rabbi we know that you are a man sent from God for no man could do these things that you do except God be with him Jesus said except the man be born again he cannot enter the kingdom not even see the kingdom and the great rabbi master in Israel said me an old man enter into my mother's wombs and be bned against it he misunderstood what Jesus is talking about am he just didn't get it because that Jesus was talking about a spiritual birth and he was trying to apply it to a national birth so he misunderstood him he didn't get it he just way people do just like Nicodemus many of us misunderstand the things of God because we just take it and apply it for a natural thing like say a doctor say oh I do not believe in Divine Healing I don't believe there's anything I heard a doctor tell a woman in an office one time said and she didn't know they want know what become of a girl she had she said brother Brandon prayed for me and Lord Heal me he said I do not believe it he said I can never I can never believe anything like that said tell me who took it all said find the scar said what did you put on it said nothing not at all said he just called me out of the meeting and the thing left now sitting right in the Next Room right sitting right in the next room listening she didn't know I was in there he didn't know I was in there cuz he didn't even know me see and there I was sitting in there and he said taking somebody else to a doctor's office it's exactly right I want to hear what he said I got I got the patient he got out of there when I found that that he didn't believe so he said I don't believe one word of it said I've never seen anything yet that could do anything like that I just don't believe it said I've got to see it before I believe it she said well what about my my growth he said I have to see it leave before I believe it see seeing is not believing faith is the substance of things you don't see see you believe at first and then it happen so the the man was not a Believer so therefore it was all a mystery to him he didn't know what he was talking about because he he couldn't understand it it was a riddle to him people say today oh I don't believe in that divine heing I don't believe in that Holy Ghost I don't believe in that speaking in tongues I don't believe in that shouting I don't believe in all this stuff like that I don't believe in it why it's a mystery you're just misunderstanding it's God here it is in the Bible here it is bringing the same results that the Bible spoke of bringing and it's got to be God you just misunderstand it that's all God is misunderstood his disciples couldn't understand his marle that night when he come into the boat and he said what manner of man is this that even the winds and the waves obey they misunderstood that he wasn't a man he was God Amen that's what's matter today people they want to make him a little mascot boy or something another uh cares that they want to make him a a just a a little fellow around the camp he wasn't a little fellow around the camp he was Jehovah God Amen they misunderstood it they expected him to be just one of them he wasn't one of them he was God among them he was more than a man I've often said he was a man when he was hungry but he was God when he fed 5,000 with a biscuit two biscuits and some pieces of fishes he was a man when he was tired on the back of the boat but he was God when he ceased the winds and waves and made him obeying amen what manner of man is this he wasn't a manner of a man he was God manifested in a man Hallelujah they misunderstood him they thought him to be a man Mary son a carpenter but he was God manifested In the Flesh amen hallelujah the Roman soldiers misunderstood him when they had him sit in the court and put a rag around his eyes and hit him on top of the head and said now if you are a prophet they all say you're a Prophet come and tell us who hit you on top of the head see they misunderstood that Jesus said I do only what the father shows me to do I do what the father shows me then I do what he tells me to do they misunderstood it they misunderstood his ministry amen the Jews misunderstood him how he come to be their friend and savior and they wanted to make him a uh something was evil they misunderstood his ministry he said the queen of the South shall rise up in the Judgment with this generation condemn it for she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon that greater than Solomon is here but they misunderstood that he was greater than Solomon they thought he was just a man many of them thought he was born out a holy way lock come up out of a bad family that had these desires and so forth and a bastard child which we just had the question that could not even why they said well we know that you were born got a holy wedlock you got a devil on you while you try to teach us we're rabbis he said you're your father the devil see they misunderstood when the Roman soldiers went back one time listen and said never a man spoke like this we never heard a man speak like this it was not a man speaking it was God H Hallelujah yes sir man didn't speak like a man tells and speaks the scriptures Jesus makes the scriptures live amen man don't live like this the scripture says this year here it is amen man can say the scripture says it but that's about all he can do but Jesus could say I my father are one my father dwelleth in me he that seen me has seen the father amen nobody else can say that hallelujah hallelujah right he that seen me has seen the father amen nobody else could say that no one of them soldiers said that there was a man spoke like this he don't speak like a scribe or a preacher he speaks with authority and even the Devils obey him and the Winds of the wav obey Hallelujah they thought he was a man but he was God hallelujah he was misunderstood said well you're you're born a bastard you're born not a holy wedlock and you try to teach us while we know you're a mad and got a devil you're a Samaritan you been over there and got them Devils on you trying to teach us us holy rabbis he said you're your father the devil yes they

Samaritan you've been over there and got them Devils on you trying to teach us us holy rabbis he said you're of your father the devil yes they misunderstood him they didn't know who he was that's what's matter today people trying to make him something that he is he's not just a man he's got in man Hallelujah no third person he's the only person yes sure they misunderstood him the Pharisees that Pharisee that invit him down at that time for a dinner a big banquet he misunderstood him he thought he just have him down there I preached on that message out here not long ago to breakfast I believe that's Chicago is that breakfast that Pharisee said now look at him sitting back there sitting back there on wash feet and everything that little woman come in and wash him with the tears and wipe with her hairs over her head he said if he was a prophet he' know what Manner woman that is that washing his feet shows he's not a prophet Jesus stood up and said Simon I got something to say to you amen he just misunderstood that was all he said I you invited me to come and I left my busy schedule to come to your invitation and when you never met at the door you never had wash my feet you never anointed my head you never kissed me welcome you just let me come in dirty and stinking and full of sweat and set me over here in a corner to make fun of me but this woman this woman she's constantly kiss my feet and she's washed him with the tears of repentance what beautiful water and wiped him with the hairs of her head I've got something against you Simon really I say unto you her sins which are many are all forgiven her Hallelujah Simon misunderstood she understood Simon said he's just a man she said he's God my savior he was misunderstood Hallelujah still misunderstood
