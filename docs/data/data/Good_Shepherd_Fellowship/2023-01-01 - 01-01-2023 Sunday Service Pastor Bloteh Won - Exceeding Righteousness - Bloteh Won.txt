the convenience service tonight we will postpone it adding that announce it in the text we send out I don't know for what reason but uh so there won't be a service this evening we'll have this service and have you go home and uh enjoy your rest and enjoy your visit as family praise the Lord Genesis chapter 38 this scripture if you if you have a coffee Bible you will see the other in his coffee Bible at the head at the top of Genesis 38 it's written parentheses [Music] it means that this this story that we about to read of Judah the Holy Spirit replaced it in Death in the in the story of Jacob and uh and his sons going to to Egypt after you read their story of Genesis 38 then 39 starts and say and Joseph was brought down to Egypt praise the Lord and uh the last verse in 37 speaks of the meeting I saw him into Egypt on to fortify an official pharaoh and the captain of the god now and it's talking about how Joseph is sold into Egypt and then out of a solving the the Bible just throw a story right in the middle of Joseph being sold into Egypt so uh it looks like an interruption but it's coffee Bible call it a parenthesis and there are few places in the Bible where you find parentheses word there's a story that is going on and then the Holy Spirit dropped another story right in the middle they have nothing to do or what is going on but we have learned that God Love Interruption praise the Lord I believe many of us are glad that he interrupted our first life praise the Lord when we thought that we were enjoying alcohol and smoking and adultery and fornication there was an interruption that took place God's love interruption foreign and I'm telling you when God interrupts you is good [Music] his Interruption is always good praise the Lord it's one of the interruptions we're going to read about this morning praise the Lord amen not you take us through all the places there in the scripture but let's uh read it from Genesis 38. now let's read from verse 15. let's read from verse 15 when Judah saw her he taught her to be a hallot because she had covered her face and he turned in unto her by the white and said go to I pray thee let me come in on today for he knew not that she was his daughter-in-law and she said what will that give me that thou mayor coming unto me and he said I will send thee a kid from the floor and she said will thy give me the pledge till thou Senate and he said what pledge shall I give thee and she said that sickness that bracelets and their staff that is in their hand now she asks for three things that are very significant to a Jewish ruler praise the Lord okay let me let me read my my brain is starting to go ahead of me stop it and he said what plague shall I give thee and she said the sickness that bracelet and that style that is in the hand and he gave it to her and came in unto her and she conceived by him and she arose and went away and laid by Avail from her and put on the Garment of her widowhole praise the Lord and Judah sent the cave by the hand of his friend they are a Dolomite to receive his players from the woman hand but he found her net then he asked the man of the place saying where is the Halal that was opened by the wayside and they said there was no harlot in this place and he returned to Judah and said I cannot find her and also the man of the place said that there was no harlot in the place and Judah said let her take it to her least we be shame behold I have sinned this kid and they all have not found her and it came to pass about three months after that it was told you that saying tell my that daughter-in-law have played the halot and also behold she is with child by Woodham and Judah said bring her and let her be burned when she was brought forth she sinned to her father-in-law saying by the man whose these are the sickness the braceless and the staff by the man who these are I'm with child and she said discern I pray thee who are these the singer the bracelet and the staff and Judah acknowledged him which means he accepted that they were his he acknowledged him and said she had been more righteous than ah because that she because that I gave her net to Shimla my son and he knew her again no more let us pray Heavenly Father we have read a portion of your word that we choose to speak Lord on this first date of the year first service of the year father we are trusting ourselves in your hands come Lord this morning take the inspiration on our hearts Lord and just uh bless us father we love you we appreciate you in Jesus name we pray amen the Lord bless you you may have your seed this morning uh after the service on Friday nights out of the morning went home I pretty much slept the whole day I would just I just lazy Myself Away praise the Lord I just lazy myself waiting and my body was just redeeming all the rest that is needed since we came back from from South Africa we really never gave ourselves some rest but then uh uh I woke up last night and and uh got something to eat and went back to bedding and I was up around 1am trying to gather my strength in and I was wishing this was last Sunday amen praise the Lord but then I was thinking uh while we were there in South Africa there's uh there's a brother from Namibia that greeted the church in the morning at what what they would normally do they would have a preacher coming and greet the sins he will he will speak a little bit and and then before the speaker comes up so he greeted a church and I brought a little greeting on uh on Christmas but then he also he also dropped a thought where where he brought what was on his mind now uh for the new year he greeted the people and wish them a Happy New Year in order there praise the Lord and then he was talking about uh uh the significance of of 23 in the Bible you know he pick up uh you know these preachers they can be oh my goodness so he took a 23. and then he started running with 23 he started talking about different things but Brandon was 23 years old when he went to uh the Pentecostal meeting in uh mishawaki you know he talks about that and then uh how brother Branham had only 23 dollars in his bank account when he told his wife that you take care of the kids I got to go and settle this thing in my life when he went down to the cage where he met the angel of the Lord he had only 23 dollars in his bank account and he started running with 23 all over the place praise the Lord but he was also bringing the father of how 23 is a very important very significant number uh uh in the scripture so after the service I told him I said brother I'm going to read every 23 chapter in the Bible when I get home praise the Lord I said that was amazing I'm going to read every 23 chapter so whatever is hiding for 2023 I have to find it but Leviticus chapter 23 this word uh the seven fisa of Israel is is written so this morning I was playing Leviticus 23 that was in my mind I was you know trying to grab my thoughts and and uh and um because I had a message on my heart to preach and for some reason I couldn't I couldn't uh you know find the time to speak on it but then my mind just went blank I was just thinking I came I really can't grab what what is the thought so I started playing a commentary this morning on Leviticus chapter 23 and just and just listening to the whole thing there but then I realized the other uh why I was playing it then uh the the commentary mention something uh you know in the scripture that helped me he actually helped me to to be able to grab what I what I'm going to speak to you this morning but let's read Leviticus chapter 23 let's read verse 1 and 2. there is something there there that I finally this morning when I was listening to the commentary I like to listen to Bible commentary you have to create a picture in my mind when when I'm going through the scripture and the Lord speak unto Moses saying Speak unto the children of Israel and say unto them concerning the feasts of the Lord wish ye shall Proclaim to obey holy convocations these even this are my Feasts now we know so there are there are seven feast days that are given to to Israel and uh [Music] and also in Exeter you see that in Exodus chapter 12 after God spoke to them about the applying of the blood and and everything he also make them to know that he was also going to give them his fees and it was going to be a holy convocation it was going to be a memoriam so what I was listening to the to the commentary I started looking through the word convocation it means rehearsal rehearsal to rehearse so that caught my mind and I was thinking wow because uh you know he give you it gives you a pause he gave you something to think about how God was actually telling them to to rehearse this now so this morning as I was uh as I was listening to death or looking at that praise the Lord I try to pull in in the message and I realized that uh brother Branham spoke and he used their scripture uh convocation and in the Feast of the trumpet praise the Lord he ran from Leviticus chapter 23 that we just read from and uh but he says something that also grabbed my attention this morning also as I was reading that praise the Lord he gets to talking about how the holy convocation was on the on the eighth day he gets talking about the Eighth Day and uh and then he says that there is something you know you know there are people that have tried to make a daughtering out of the eight day praise the Lord just like they have done with Millennium teachings and different things but uh there is there is uh there is really not something that we can establish here uh we know the eighth date is more spiritual to the Bride of Jesus Christ amen is more spiritual just like the bright age is more spiritual God calling his people to come up higher he calling out uh uh you know to something more than what uh uh the church age has has provided praise the Lord speaking likely on the same thing last weekend we were talking about the breaking of the cycle to every Revival brother Brandon faced the cycle of Revival and death has never failed all the churches have experienced death after their Revival God start using them they get on fire and then at a certain time they just die out now this age La audition also experienced a cycle of Revival and death but when God called his people out in Revelation 18 4 and say come out of her my people we know that that voice that called the people out in Revelation 18 4 actually by scripture is sounded in Revelation 3. because you see the Book of Revelation is not actually any kind of a sequence order the events in Revelation because Revelation 1 and three speaks about the seven Church ages now you will realize there were things that were happening in the seven Church ages in Revelation 1 and 3 that is also spoke about in the rest of the other ages praise the Lord because if you go over to to the territorial Church age and you start to talk about the Dark Age you will not understand uh the persecution in that age until you go to Revelation chapter 6 and you start to see when uh uh uh one of those house rather you know came and started bringing persecution on the church so that's how the Book of Revelation is rating it's written with a lot of symbols and is and and the story is kind of intertwined but uh so actually in Revelation 18 4 your year the uh uh calling out of mystery Babylon and say come out of her mind people thou voice you hear in Revelation chapter chapter 18 4 that cry come out of Harmon people the actual time it did happen was in Revelation 3 14. it was in the laodicea church age that that voice sounded now that voice that said come out of her in Revelation 3 John said I heard a knock on the door that Knack in Revelation chapter 3 was a voice in Revelation 18 that was saying come out are we together praise the Lord so I mean they are they are just a lot of those things that are there in the scripture and uh and we can be grateful that God sent us a prophet to be able to help us to see those things amen who if the Lord bless us we'll find time to look into that but it blessed my heart this morning when I was I was looking at uh [Music] you know looking at this scripture and just and just thinking about uh uh you know what what a blessing it is that God has given us a holy convocation he has called us in everything that uh we are doing here uh in our work with God the prophet of God make us to understand we are just rehearsing he says for another holy convocation that is coming so we want to we want to wish you well a happy New Year amen we want to wish you all of God's blessing good health and and strength and uh we want to pray that God will allow you to experience more of him because there is more of God to experience than just coming to church there is more of God to experience praise the Lord we pray that God will allow you to experience more of him to have a personal relationship with him and uh to walk hand in hand with the Lord that is our prayer that is our desire that this year we bring bring us because every year bring us closer to the coming of the Lord when it will be we don't know praise the Lord we don't know we know there are the signs they are all telling us praise the Lord amen when will their physical coming be we don't know but what we know is that the Lord himself shall descend amen and in 1963 there was a descending that had to do with the the opening of the world but Benham called the appearing of Christ and so we can say he is here amen we can say he is here just as much as I believe in a physical lecture returning of the Lord so uh every year bring us closer to the coming of the Lord and uh we are hoping that this year will set us full in our experience why are you you're remain in your seat I want to read my second scripture on what I want to speak on this morning and uh Matthew chapter 5. my scripture is in Matthew chapter 5. I ask that you you uh uh keep meaning your prayers praise the Lord I want to thank again every every family that has made this little assembly a home Church God bless you thank you for your prayers for your support uh financially in everything that keeps the church going every brother every sister also that have made this place a home church we want to say thank you and it's been a blessing working with you praise the Lord is being a blessing and I pray that the Lord will continue to to bless us amen and I pray that we can be more of a servant to you to be able to serve you uh in a way that would bring us closer to the Lord Matthew chapter 5 verse 17. Matthew chapter 5. verse 17. Jesus speaking year thing that that I'm come to destroy the Lord or the prophets I'm not calm to destroy but to fulfill for verily I said unto you till Heaven and Earth to Heaven and Earth pass now one job praise the Lord oh tether shall ignore wise paths from the Lord till all be fulfilled whosoever therefore shall break one of these least combining and shall teach men so he shall be called the least in the Kingdom of Heaven but whosoever shall do and teach them the same Shall be Called great in the Kingdom of Heaven for I say it unto you that accept your righteousness shot a seed the righteousness of the strife and the Pharisees yesha in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven praise the Lord so this morning for a little text I want to speak on she's more righteous than I with an inspiration exceeding righteousness what was Jesus talking about what was this righteousness that needed to exceed the righteousness of the strife and the Pharisees praise the Lord amen what is this righteousness glory be to God amen if you look through the scripture you stand it through the scripture uh very well you realize that in that time of our Lord Jesus these men they were the stripes and the Pharisees they were men there were that were highly highly respected by their people we know they were different there were different groups of them different uh assembling different Gathering of them and while I was looking in today's I was uh also had a privilege to look at some things and uh this was the first time that Jesus would mentioned in his own teaching he would mention the stripe and the Pharisees but if you look into the scripture he mentioned the tribe and the Pharisees 13 times in the Book of Matthew praise the Lord he implied there for the most part they were the that was the school of the Pharisees this man there were the stripes and the Pharisees these guys were people that uh were set aside there were men just like in the Days of Elijah the Bible talked about the school of the prophets there were men that were set aside to be able to study the strong so they were they were people that studied the strong there was another group there was a the chief the Bible would talk about the chief priests the Bible will talk about the chief priests well which of course Caiaphas was part of the chief priest and the chief priests for some reason will come out of the sahindrance the difference between the Pharisees and the Sadducees or the the chief priests came from out of the Sadducees the difference between the Pharisees and the saddresses is that the Pharisees they believe in the Resurrection The Cyrus cyruses did not but they had a great Council in their Council was the San hindrance Council beside the Pharisees and the Sadducees they had another group called The the zealots you know these guys were fanatics they were very fun activities when it came to um to the to the you know to the Old Testament straw now so as as we look into this just to give us a little background here about the stripes and the Pharisees because Jesus is establishing something here he never said never came to destroy the Lord he came as a fulfillment of the Lord praise the Lord Amen in another place he speaks about the the Sabbath which of course I will I want to look at that a little bit in when they come in terms of the Lord and uh he's saying now one now one job now one apostrophe not a point not a period not a crossing of a t where it's ever going to fail from the Lord but everything is going to be fulfilled praise the Lord if he is the Fulfillment of the Lord if he is the one that is going to to bring the Lord uh the life of the Lord to light and yeah he's telling us that this man there were highly respected in their days the stripes and the Pharisees while setting a pic of something there from mine uh concording the righteousness of the stripes and the Pharisees and no tears says the righteousness consists of outward observation they were very good in their ceremony and traditional laws these guys the the dress code was right you know they were people that respected the tradition the ceremony they offer sacrifices the fasted off thing Jesus spoke about that they pray much is also written in the scripture their oblations the attacks they are ceremony in their religious but they neglected the justice the truth amen the Holiness of heart praise the Lord if you remember the story of the Good Samaritan when Jesus gave the parable of the Good Samaritan he brought an image of Olivine he brought an image of a fire seed also into that picture so Yara said he's telling us here that except we have a righteousness that is see the righteousness of the stripe and the Pharisees but yet when you look through the scripture Jesus never spared the strap and the Pharisees he told them that they were just like the grave that is painted white on the outside but inside is full of their main bones praise the Lord but he is the very one year in the beginning of his ministering he's now telling us that we must have a righteousness that exceed the righteousness of this man that was very lawyer and they were very good in the way that they kept their dress code and kept the Traditions you know ceremony and all of that Jesus gave a parable for one of them praying in the synagogues and saying I'm not like this man you know I've kept all your Commandments and you know and all of that so they were very loud uh uh you know praying guys they love to be heard you know the love to be seen when you go in the marketplaces they want it to be greeted by the people with their titles you're talking on exceeding righteousness praise the Lord I'm sure that when it comes to all of those outward thing is really going to it's really going to cast every one of us to a place this morning to examine our life praise the Lord amen because one like me I couldn't even get my shirt price pressed right this morning so if I was among the Pharisees they would put me outside because the bones on my shirts are not standing up praise the Lord amen but just like we said in uh in uh when we were talking about Rachel weeping for her children God the almighty God that we serve he placed some things in his word just like what we just read in in Genesis chapter 38 an amazing story I will take something here from Brother Branham that would be one of the two quotes that we would read this morning and then we'll ride on the wings of inspiration to speak to you question and answer on Hebrew somebody asked brother Benham about a Scarlet thread that was on one of the hands of uh tear my voice because she had twins when she got conceived for Judah the Scarlet trade if you will notice it was Judea he had a son and one of his son Mary a Canaanite woman so Tema was actually a gentile woman praise the Lord and she was one of the three women that were ever recorded in the genology of our Lord Jesus and those three women were Gentile women it's strange that they never pulled Sarah in uh in Jesus genealogy even though she was the wife of Abraham the mother of Isaac and Rebecca and uh and and Rachel in all of those great Hebrew women but there were three women that were placed in the genology of Jesus Christ and Tema was one of them she was a Kennedy woman she was a gentile woman she was our mother and this kind of woman didn't have any children and his son died talking about Judah now then the Lord then was the next son had to take the brother's wife and raise up a seed to the Dead praise the Lord it was a lot that if a man of Israel was dead and never had a child you know uh the his wife was one of his brother would take his wife just to be able to keep his name alive so the first song will be giving the name of the brother that passed and then the rest of the children will take their father's name just to be able to keep it was it was all about Resurrection now you see if you look in the scripture also you will realize that Jesus one time he was confronted by the Pharisees because they did not believe in Resurrection they asked Jesus a question there was a brother that that Amari he never had a child he died the next brother got married he never had a child he died the next one took the woman and they never had a child in Jesus said they asked Jesus and said in the resurrection if you say there is a resurrection in the resurrection who wife would this woman be praise the Lord amen and Jesus said we will not marry or give in to Mary in the resurrection that's why he said he brought up that story you know uh because they were talking about raising up a seed so Jesus spoke in a way to be able to make them to understand that when we cross this life you know we will go back to our original state the sex law will not exist praise the Lord so Jesus said we'll be just like the Angels they will they will now be giving giving birth and all of that so uh uh uh that that was what was happening here so Judah had a son that married Tema and then the son died so the she was given to the next son and he did not wanted to raise a sea for his brother and uh and because of that God God kill him God struck him you know uh you could read the whole story there in Genesis 38 and she was given to the next boy and he also died he never had it never had a child but then the the next son was young he was he was a smaller boy so uh uh the father Judah just told Tama to go back to her people and uh you know and wait until uh this song would grow up let's continue to read him and the other man did not cooperate all do us he issue and the Lord slayed him then he had one young son so Judah said wait till the sun grow up until the place where you can marry him and when he grew up to the place that he was supposed to marry his two brothers former wife well he was supposed to take her then to raise up seed up to his brethrens that had died Judith did not give the woman the candle woman his son the boy and just let him go ahead so she's seeing there she was doing wrong so she goes out and she wrap into wrap her face in the veil and sit in in a public place as a Holland will say Judah come by and he took the woman for the wife and uh and she was a hollered and he lived with her now thinking that she was a halot but she did that she she disguised herself and put herself in a place because she wanted she wanted something let's let's continue to read he said give me the kid or she said that well give me a sign that you would do it and so she took the staff and the sickness and so forth and kept it and when they brought the kid they couldn't find the hollow cause she was in a harlot after the why she has shown up that she was to be a mother and and when she showed up that she was to be a mother they came and told you that that daughter-in-law have played a halot said because there she she used to be a mother and uh and you're both boys are dead he says well we will call her forth and burn her praise the Lord we would call her for and burn her you see that's just how strong the Lord was the Lord was very very strong if she play a halot she had to be burned she had to be stoned we saw the same thing in Jesus Ministries in John chapter 8. just bear with me a little bit here praise the Lord amen now I was reading through the scripture when you go over to numbers if we want to just turn to numbers a little bit Hallelujah why Israel was traveling there was a there was a man that disobeyed the the he kind of for disobeying the the Shabba the Bible says he went out and he was picking sticks on the Sabbath day praise the Lord amen if you look over in numbers uh that should be around Numbers Chapter 15. Numbers Chapter 15. look over to verse 35 verse 32 just I'm just trying to bring something a little bit on the law so we can we can appreciate God's uh Grace here [Music] amen verse 32 and while the children of Israel were in the wilderness the father man that gathers takes upon the Sabbath day and they that found him Gathering Stakes brought him onto Moses and to Aaron and unto all the congregation and they put him in World which means they put him in a prison because it was not declared what should be done unto him and the law said unto Moses The man shall be surely put to death or the congregation shall Stone him with stones without the camp so they have to take this man out of the camp and they had to Stone him because he was gathering sticks on the Sabbath day praise the Lord now if you go over to the New Testament one time in Saint Luke chapter 6. the Pharisees came to Jesus and he said unto him why are your servants say Luke chapter 6 verse 1 and it came to pass on the second Sabbath after the first that he went through the cornfield and his disciple pluck the ears of corn and then eat robbing them in their hands and setting of the Pharisees said unto them why do you hear that which is not lawful to do on the Sabbath day praise the Lord now this was the place where Jesus will use that statement I'm the lord of the Sabbath amen and Jesus will answer them and say it's having you read in the Lord he read so much this what David did when he himself was hungry and and there which were with him how they went into the house of God and then they eat of the shortbread now so you ever sit here in the Old Testament a man goes out to gather States on the Sabbath day whether he was gathering it to Coke or whatever he was doing they were told to keep the Sabbath day holy now follow me now because we were going to we as we're trying to look at exceeding righteousness foreign and when they saw him they arrested him they pray they put him in the praising and waited for for Moses to come and when they asked Moses Moses went before the Lord and Moses commanded that a man should be stoned to death praise the Lord amen and uh Jesus and his disciple are caught in the same thing he had going through the calm field the talk comes and he had you know caught in the up they are rubbing it they are eating and uh the Pharisees see them also then ask them why are you doing this why are you doing this why are you caught doing this why you find yourself in this place and Jesus come out and then he made this statement that he says uh they are the Sabbath that the son of man is Lord of the Sabbath amen there's a statement here what he made and says uh man was not made for the Sabbath the sabbah was made for me the son of man is the lord of the Sabbath now if you look at the two sins you you will think that uh uh there is uh the Lord was now just that that man that was picking stake on the Sabbath day he was caught and he was thrown to death but what I would want you to also picture in your mind is the other as the children of Israel were traveling with Moses there was a counter for struggle that they had under the leadership of Moses there were many times through their Journey where the murmur they complained and then Quran and Dayton Rose against Moses even Moses Sister Miriam she also spoke against her brother and all of that so there was a sense of a kind of a defined nature or defined spirit that was among the people most of the time the people will think they are some of the things that Moses brought them was just his own thinking or just his own word there were not many other people that embraced the leadership of Moses when Quran and Dayton Rose against Moses there were hundreds of the people that talked to them and God had to open the Earth and swallow them up praise the Lord so this man is somehow seeing honor accountable defined attitude praise the Lord amen because one thing you are also realize is that God took care of them on their Journey praise the Lord every morning they never had to farm they never had to go to the shopping center God gave them while the Bible called Angels food if you realize you will also see in a scripture that the scripture in the way that God referred to the manner that came down every morning there was only one time in the Bible where God called him minor because he was referring to how the people called it but the scripture over and over says how God failed them with angels food the people were the ones that call him Manu and if you actually look at it Mano was a kind of for a derogatory expression the way they described it the way they describe it they were longing for the garlic and the onions and whatever they left in Egypt and this that God was feeling them and sustaining them in the wilderness they gave it such a poor name praise the Lord they called him Mana God never caught him Mana he called it Angel's fault praise the Lord that was not the first time one time Elijah was under the Jannah portrayed God allowed the angels to beg him food and brought it for him to eat Jesus himself was lacking himself told the bread that comes down from heaven he says I'm the bread of life but the people India longing to go back to Egypt destroy what God provided for them when the neither water God gave them the water amen when Anita meet God provided swans for them to eat so what is the need what was the need that this man will go out what was he doing what actually was he doing if it was not just a defiant praise the Lord now I believe that was also a way that God was expressing that he meant what he said when he says keep the Sabbath day holy he meant what he said praise the Lord man in the I fall in nature will always love to transgress God's law to see what God will do praise the Lord so you see that God he had a very strong regard for his law we get back to the story of Judah and his sons here so as we read through a year we realize that the young man grew up and and Judah never gave her to the woman as the Lord required him too let's continue to read and after she has shown up she was a mother and she showed up there she was to be a mother and uh the cam told Judah and Judah said she must be burned praise the Lord and so she sent word to Judah and said the man that did this on the staff and the sickness all right that that was her father-in-law and he said she's more righteous than I why he make that statement what did Judah make Destiny let me just read down and and just finish this here with Robert Ben saying now when she knew that her children was to be delivered they were twins she had twins boys the first baby that was to be born the the old Jewish custom the first child was the birthright the first child to break forth and now remember uh that was her first child none of the rest of the boys had had any children by her she had never had a child till this time and and when her first child Break Forth it was just a hand it was the hand that came out and then the male wife put a Scarlet straight around it because the scholar stress speaks of redemption praise the Lord that's the first son of the Virgin Mary have the scholarship of redemption now so we we we we grab the picture here that the reason why God's like this story right in the middle of Joseph's story praise the Lord it's all because of redemption praise the Lord remember God promised Abraham that with a mighty Mighty I bring your people out they were so John now here is the beginning of Israel's Soul journey into Egypt that start with the selling of Joseph and Joseph is now taken to Egypt just at the beginning of that story God created a parenthesis and he introduced this this story of tema the bath of the mind no word no way related to Joseph that was not Joseph mother but God just blessed him and the only reason why he placed it there is because what is going to happen in Egypt is tied to Redemption praise the Lord amen God promised to bring his people out with his own strong hand and this whole thing is playing out now this was a gentile Woman by by the father you you realize that there was some stigma to it maybe Joseph I mean Judah in his mind was just trying to you know play this woman out where my first son died by her the next one couldn't hide a child by her well okay let her just stay by but God in his mind ignoring how the law will play out with the Jews and then Grace will come to us the Gentiles praise the Lord the mind of God Is Bigger than our mind praise the Lord your sitting down and and uh and and she's being obedient she sent back to her father's house she's sitting here and she's waiting and she here that that son is now an off a growing age think about the story of Ruth praise the Lord amen that's what Ruth was giving over to boys it was all in the sense of redemption she never had a a child for for none of Naomi Sons so now Naomi is now going to give her over to bore us and then when she has a child it will redeem the name of the Dead praise the Lord because the god that we serve is not the god of the Dead He's the god of the living that's why that law was set in Israel because he's the god of the living so tell my ear that she's sitting down there and she just uh uh waiting and hoping and she hear that this boy and nothing is said nobody have come to tell her anything praise the Lord you have to realize that God his plan the plan of God it's a plane of redemption something that was in God's mind and if God's if you are under God's Plan of Redemption there's a prophecy that hangs all your life is going to influence your choices praise the Lord amen God's Plan of Redemption is going to interrupt your schedule because God's plan was before the foundation of the word amen before the foundation of the world before there was a start before there was a earth that was created God had his plane in his mind amen and he thought of you so you are not coming to come to time and make your own choices and make your own plan you go right ahead amen oh God great Eternal time when that time reaches he is going to interrupt whatever play you are making whatever choices you have made um praise the Lord are we together she's righteous than I more righteous than I praise the Lord so when Jesus was speaking about the exceeding righteousness he was saying except your righteousness and see the righteousness yes the righteousness that exceed the righteousness of the Pharisees is the righteousness that goes back to God's mind praise the Lord it's not the righteousness induced and dumb because you cannot outbreak the Pharisees in that if the righteousness that goes back to God's mind which of course will see few of them through the scripture praise the Lord Hallelujah are we together Yeah Tim I'm sitting down and then she's waiting and uh and uh uh Judah is making his own plane and nobody is caring for her she she sent back to her father house praise the Lord what an inspiration from Norway now you have to know that this woman she got married into the house off into a Jewish house she knows what it is by the law to play the halot praise the Lord that's why she was not stupid she asked for an Evidence she knew what it was to play the halot glory be to God amen but moreover Redemption was driving her God's Plan of Redemption praise the Lord the scripture says in the book of uh uh Hebrew Rehab by faith now you tell me now be Earnest with me when rehab was helping the spies praise the Lord was rehab doing there by faith amen there was something that was driving her praise the Lord let me tell you behind this behind our Redemption behind our Salvation behind our deliverance there is a driving force there is nothing that drive the world and God's Plan of Redemption his Plan of Redemption is even greater than his plan of creation the one plane that God had in his mind that took him from a self-existent being right to become a hema what his Plan of Redemption is God's Plan of Redemption that is driving this word Prophet has been influenced by God's Plan of Redemption is the driving force praise the Lord is a thing that is influencing the word is the thing that is behind all the actions and reactions of Our Lives is God's Plan of Redemption is the driving force praise the Lord Paul call it the Holy Ghost constrained us he called it the constraining power amen out of our will out of our desire sometimes beyond our choices there's a driving force praise the Lord that driving force choose the family we will be born in it was that driving force that choose whether we will be male or female it comes right from that driving force God's Plan of Redemption praise the Lord everywhere we can imagine a a term at having an inspiration here and saying I'm going to disguise myself as a halot praise the Lord and I'm going to set myself up and her intention was just for one man she was not going to be a holler for all the men on the street and any man that come back it was just for one man praise the Lord Hallelujah you have to realize Rahab said she told the spies we have heard of your friend we heard how the the the the rare seed draw before you we heard how you have destroyed Nations there was something about the people of Israel in the adjoining where all the nation knew that these were special people they knew that they were only a covenant from the fire by night they can see a light in the heavens that was the pillar of fire that hang over them yes the people that never had an organized government they never had an organized Army but yet they were overcoming Nations because almighty God was India mixed praise the Lord and why was God doing it because he he amen he had promised him are we together she's more righteous than I glory be to God because Judah realized that he was acting on the natural Lord but there was something in this woman amen that was acting on the spiritual Lord of God because the bringing foresee was all about Redemption you have to remember they were all influenced by the seed of the woman that goes back to Redemption God never gave the seed to the man he gave the seed to the woman are we together so he realized that Tama did that because she wanted to be identified with the Seed of Abraham amen she wanted to be identified that was what Paul pick up in intuitive when he said she shall be saved in childbearing there was something that identified them with the with the the abrahamic Covenant she wanted to be identified with the Seed of Abraham he realized that that's why he said she was more righteous than I because she disguised herself now if you think about that in a natural way you would just think that while this woman she was calling this woman while my goodness that she would put herself out there like that but she had an intention praise the Lord amen there was something that was influencing her life in a sense that it was so pleasing to God that what the law will condemned because it was honored the Lord it was because of the Lord that Judah said bring her foot and let her be burned that's why the law says that even though the law will condemned that but it was so pleasing to God that he could place her name in the genealogy of Jesus Christ praise the Lord because God saw that as a righteousness that exceeded the righteousness of Judah even though he was born in the tribe of Abraham even though he was circumcised on the eighth day he kept all the commitment God saw an art Gentile woman amen she was not Hungary fall for filthiness or for sex what she wanted is to be identified with the Seed of Abraham and the only way she could be identified is to be a possessor of that seed that's all she wanted righteousness that exceed the righteousness of the Pharisees praise the Lord is to be able to grab what is in God's mind amen is to allow the word of God to influence our lives sometimes we come on the order you know and then we want this to be right and we want that to be right it's good to to pursue those things amen but if it is just the keeping of the Lord and there is nothing that is influencing us from inside are we together you're looking first Samuel chapter 24. if you want to turn there with me let's read a little bit because we were trying to look at this exceeding righteousness praise the Lord in first Samuel chapter 24 you will see that this was David and Saul when Saul was after the life of David this was uh the the same where David came down there and he got right into the mountains and he was able to cut off a piece of salt cloth amen praise the Lord he was able to cut off the piece of salt cloth I know the time is late here I've kept you over time but but it's important I have but but then referring to a little bit of that on Friday night and uh the Hem of His Garment praise the Lord there was a reason why David did that if you don't understand the Hem of His Garment you will not appreciate while that was done let's let's let's let's just get back a little bit I just have you for one service today so just just bear with me a little bit amen if you go to Numbers Chapter 15. we'll come back to our story but let's go to Numbers Chapter 15. Numbers chapter 15 let's read from verse let's read verse 37. praise the Lord I'm on account of a slow stat today but that's fine thank you for bearing with me Numbers chapter 15 if you read verse 37 be able to let's let's learn some things here from the word of the Lord and the Lord speak unto Moses saying Speak unto the children of Israel and bear them that they make a French in the border of their garment throughout their generation that French was a hen and you will know the man of authority you will know a man or a wealthy man by the hand of His Garment praise the Lord so they were supposed to put a hymn on their garment and it was supposed to have a blue ribbon in it throughout their generation that they put upon the French of the Border a ribbon of blue and it shall be unto you a French Dia may look upon it and remember all the Commandments of the Lord and do them and they are yes sickness after your own heart and your own eyes after which you use to go and hurry praise the Lord amen let's say for example they were supposed to do this reading and in one sense God was saying as you walk and you look you you see the the Hem of your garment you memorize a scripture you keep the lord of the Lord God my feet Lord keep me it was in a way you have to realize that they had the leadership of the Holy Ghost it was not dwelling in them it was a way for them to guard their touch it was a way for them to keep their mind on the Lord but you see as time goes by it becomes a culture and now it becomes a faction that rich man can make their bigger and put different design on it but it was something that was kept all true the lineage of Israel praise the Lord a French on the border of the agave so when a man was a king the way his brother is you know it's it's almost like when you look at uh in the military the worst tribes and all their stripes are not the same the straw that a man's word tells his rank that was the way it was amen so it will make you to appreciate the scripture when David got down there and then he caught he caught the Bible says it was the hand of sore government he caught praise the Lord because he needed an identity are we together I'll just stop right here and then go into what I was what I've what I want to read to you here so let's go back there to First Samuel I think I've already established my picture in your mind first Samuel 24 now David the Bible says verse 9 and David said unto Saul wherefore Euro thou men words saying behold David seeketh my thy hurt behold This Day verse 10 for Psalm 24 this day Thine Eyes I've seen how the Lord have delivered thee today in my hands in the cave and some bid me killed thee but man I spare thee and I said I will not put forth my hands against my Lord for he is the Lord's anointed moreover my father see see the skirt of thy Rock so he took the piece of the piece of uh that he have caught to show that because that that was where the design was if he had just caught any part of the Garment it will not really identify with the king so he got to cut the where where the the Border was praise the Lord and more all of my father's seed the skirt of thy Rob in my hand fall in that I cut off the scalp of The Rock and kill thee gnat nor down and see that there is neither evil non-transgression in my hands and I have not seen it against thee yeah thou haunted my soul to take it the Lord George between me and thee and the Lord Avenged mean of Thee but my hands shall not be upon thee praise the Lord amen now if you drop down now and you can read the rest of it but drop down to verse 17 and he said to them it's all said to David thou are more righteous than I praise the Lord a righteousness that exceed the righteousness of the Pharisees because the Pharisees righteousness was all in the dudes and done it was all in the flesh it was just all in the other Suburban called them actors but yet David having an opportunity of a man that was Haunting his life but he has so much regard for God's word he said because thou are the Law's anointing praise the Lord amen he came so close he came right into the camp for him to be able to get a hold of a sore skirt means that he came he even passed the man that were guarding him praise the Lord thou are more righteous than I for thou have reward them in good whereas I have rewarded the evil praise the Lord so you see David was honored an inspiration there was something that was holding him Beyond his own human strain a human mind and righteousness that is seed the righteousness of the Pharisees it is something that Christ was going to bring it's not something that the Lord who have provided is something that the Holy Ghost has brought on to us amen where beyond our strength beyond our weaknesses we can be fairly in strength but there is just something in our heart that is longing for more of God praise the Lord you're not going to use your your failure for excuses amen you are not going to use your failure for excuses if you fail God that there's a way out amen God has made a provision so you're not going to use something oh yeah it's in my family or it is my family and all that's the reason why the new birth is provided no flesh will be justified it's in a sense that God will take no human excuses if no flesh will be justified God will take no human excuses you cannot use somebody else's failure to be an excuse why you will not move on with God you can use somebody else's backsliding right we are asked to look unto the Lord not to look after man the Bible says the armor flesh will fail it will always fail praise the Lord you cannot even look at your own failure to stop going on with God praise the Lord because God is Not Looking for your righteousness your righteousness is as a filthy wreck he wants you to provide yourself let his righteousness flow through you and that's the thing that bad for you our mind praise the Lord just like brother Branham said he says if you have accepted that God was made sin for you you must also accept that you have been made his very righteousness that's what Apostle Paul says praise the Lord that's the righteousness that is seed the righteousness of the Pharisees it's so easy to get this Pharisees mine praise the Lord where we know the court we know everything we know what the Bible said we know what the scripture says that we can even condemn ourselves to hell praise the Lord David said you see me today that there is no evil in me because your life was in my hands praise the Lord he said because your life was in my hands Saucy my son I realize you are more righteous than I there is something that is driving you amen there is something that is driving you there is something that is keeping you there is something that is influencing your life yeah he was anointed about Samir to be king praise the Lord and that is the same thing that is driving God's people no flesh will be justified we get our use our weaknesses for an excuse we cannot use our family this thing running man no God is not going to take any excuse from man because he has given us the ultimate provision right praise the Lord amen if your wrongs in your family comes for the New Birth the new bread will cut it off praise the Lord the new breath will cut it off All Through the Ages men have always always sought to do things for God it's so difficult to provide to accept the thing that God have freely given to us amen we always want to provide our standard we want to provide our religion we want to provide our righteousness when none of them will be accepted to God praise the Lord she's more righteous then uh brother Brown says something here in is the rising of the sun I read this and find a place here to close I will keep you this entire day he says that's what he proves Hallelujah that's what is the proof he was in only the word but he was God God himself the Dynamics in the word that made the blood of Jesus Christ in the grave Shake into life and Rise Again and rolled away the stone I am he that was dead so dare Till The Sun said he was dead and the moon said he was there because they couldn't give their life their light the Stars said he was dead all nature said he was there and now the whole word has to recognize that he's alive again he was not only the mechanics God's word he was the dynamic to prove it praise the Lord and as he being the groom the bride has to come forth amen because it's part of him and it can only be the the manifestation or the Fulfillment of all all the revelation let me take that again it can own it it can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the Revelation any order has spoke of the Bride it can only manifest if it does something different from the groom it is in the brain because she is flesh of his flesh born of his born life of his life power of his power she is him praise the Lord she is he you know when I was thinking about this it just it's just it just inspired me there when uh uh Judah said she is more righteous than I praise the Lord I thought about uh uh uh a gentile bride that is going to receive Christ's word to be a flesh of his flesh a bone of his bone praise the Lord amen we are going to be the expression of God's righteousness amen the very expression of God's righteousness Hallelujah you see that's the reason why if we measure on our failure we can go nowhere with God praise the Lord yeah there is it's a balance amen because unbelief will only handle the unbeliever glory be to God amen if we measure on our own yes and just you know make an excuse on all of the things in our life we can go nowhere with God we can we cannot even understand his purpose for our life praise the Lord you see this there are people that are using their weakness you know and they are not going any father with God and they are also people that is making the grace of God a disgrace praise the Lord hallelujah because the thing that I'm saved by grace so I can live any out no but there is a little bride there is a little bride that is trying to grab what is in God's mind she's keeping herself under the word and she's been influenced by the Holy Spirit to be able to please God even when it does not seems like she's pleasing God praise the Lord amen oh she come forth and she says your strength is perfect in my weakness the devil tried to discourage her and try to beat her down but there is something something in her that gave her the courage daily to get before God and appreciate him for his Mercy praise the Lord Hallelujah she's flesh of his flesh bone of his bone power of his power she is him as a man and a woman I want and the woman takes from his side she has been taking a spirit a feminine Spirit from him the flesh from his side May both mechanics and Dynamics his wife praise the Lord the spirit of him and the Flesh of him are put together the mechanics and the Dynamics until the church all the people praise the Lord so you see that's that's that's the expression of God's righteousness you know that the Lord connect that's why Jesus says I never came to destroy it I came to fulfill it I came to fulfill what is in the Lord the Lord tells you you your your takes a woman and sleep with her is adultery I'm telling you that if you lost in your heart praise the Lord amen so you see even there in Matthew Chapter 5 when Jesus deals with all of those things he goes in the heart of man why because they all have been the place where by the baptism of the Holy Ghost by the new birth he will Express his righteousness from your heart so it's what your heart is Desiring it's not what your flesh is living out what your heart is Desiring is that a desire of God more of God in your heart do you have a desire for the Holy Ghost do you have a desire to live a life that is right what is your heart Desiring because out of the abundance of our heart now only our mouth will speak your life will live out praise the Lord Tama has something in your heart she wanted to be identified with the lineage of Abraham she knew that was a redeeming line and God will put a seventh seal right in the story of Joseph something that will speak of the Messiah he will interrupt the scripture trying to get our attention and I can show you places in the scripture where The Parting follows praise the Lord be on something that Joseph would not understand our 17 years all the Bible said he was sought in Egypt but there was a Plan of Redemption behind his life it kept him as a Young Man In The House of Spotify that he placed everything in his house in Joseph hayen do you know that 45 never even believed his own wife's story he didn't believe it because I believe for all of the years that Joseph stayed in his house they have tested him they have tried to put a trap they have tried and Joseph proved himself to be a son of Abraham why because it was a capital punishment if a 45 really believed his wife Joseph was going to be Hank because he was a Hebrew he was going to be Hank it was a capital punishment a chief of officer but fortified house examine this boy look at his life and look at his testimony that he will rise to the place that everything in his house he will put in the care of Joseph a place of trust praise the Lord but you see God by the design of the Holy Spirit please tell my story for us to be able to see the Scarlet Street and just like that Scarlet Street was behind influencing Joseph life in Egypt that scholar Street has been influencing your life from the day you were born that's the reason why there are things in your life you will not understand praise the Lord you say I should have been dead you'll see a life they're all being robbing himself against you just to grab your attention praise the Lord and if his grace has brought us this fine are we willing to surround ourselves to that great intelligence of God that have guarded our life so far or are we still struggling with our choices our you know our our Ambitions and the things that we want to achieve and and the way we think our life should be praise the Lord one hour a million brother Brahman says there was a million cells egg cells that was released from your mother yeah the media air cells also blood cells from your father he said the choice for you to be in life there were million exhales if there was one egg cells and the blood cells that met different from what conceive you you will not be alive the choice of which air cells will meet which blood cells it was God that did that choosing praise the Lord the determination whether it will be a male or female it was God praise the Lord so he make choices for us and guided them before even we were born praise the Lord why can't we trust him if he have been so good to us and have brought us this far there we are 2023 January 1st and God is declaring in his word you are the expression of my righteousness amen now the Bride of Jesus Christ is the expression of God's righteousness are we going to be like Mary and say be it unto me let me express your righteousness in my thoughts let me express your righteousness in my desire let me express your righteousness in the way I live I don't have to be looking over my shoulder they exceed in righteousness of God it's not in our choice it's not in our religious practices is how much we surround ourselves to God and says flow through me Holy Spirit flow through me live through me live through me whatever is the desire whatever is the nature that we struggle over surround it to God you go through your religious practice they don't work give it to God just to run it say Lord yeah he said I don't think that this habit is bigger than God you know do I think that this sickness is bigger

to him Lord not my will but your will [Music] see the way we understand go about the religions of the word [Music] all the religions of the world try to teach us that we have to be good we have to do good and a way to please God [Music] but if we realize that by the blood by the nature that we were born we can only do good as much as we can we can do good to the ones that do good to us that's that's the way the human nature works that's the reason why I saw who said David you are more righteous than me because I'm seeking to do you evil yet you are you go to me praise the Lord all the religious of the world the Buddhists will tell you the same thing you have to do good you have to be kind but you can just do as much as you can [Music] Jesus never said you have to be good the Young Rich ruler came to him and said good Master what can I do to inherit eternal life he never said you should be good he said you must be born again praise the Lord you must be born again because that

at a one that we think is a more righteous man or we look at another person instead of understanding what God is doing in our life and the way he's dealing with us then we start to imitate we start to impersonate the life of another person the way they dress the way they worship the way they lift their hands instead of embracing God the way he's dealing with you when God comes down and reveals something to you speak to your heart pick up something in your life to be able to cherish it and say Lord I received your word be with me Change Me Lord no two men is built the same God don't use two men the same way God will never deal with two persons in the same way [Music] they are seeing righteousness of God it's it's in Simplicity it's receiving the word of God it's appreciating what God is

mouth if God will believe believe in the heart and confess the Lord Jesus Christ God's exceeding righteousness that we can be called The Bride of Jesus Christ to be able to bring forth the Son of God

let go of our will of our ideas and that's some of the things that have that is creating a failure [Music] in the Christian church people get so stuck to their old ideas they create their own form of religion in their mind as as long as they wake up in the morning and prayed and read their Bible but when we get out there then the lord gave us a little test we get so frustrated we get so angry we
