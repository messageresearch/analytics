afraid to say in the house of the Lord he made praise the Lord well you know that you have a little distance to the church then my house it shuttle for me to get here from my house then from the church so I went through the air there and I just decided you know I brought few few cheers there and because I had a Bible Stella good brother bright yesterday night game so I took two chairs into my

praise the Lord but we are glad to be this evening so I was kept looking at my time but he didn't know that I just thought I was much closer but then when I talked to Rory I said wow there's a little distance to get him but we want to thank the Lord this evening and let's just let's just go to the world let's go to the world tonight and Genesis chapter 15 Genesis chapter 15 thank you were scared you know this uh there's a scene there is South Africa they say the wait for the preacher with a song so I think that's what you did praise the Lord and brother brother brother rather brother did you send his greetings from me and I just spoke with in one way here and I guess maybe he's following the service tonight praise the Lord Genesis chapter 15 let's read from verse 13 we'll talk a little bit on this chapter but let's read from verse 13 Genesis chapter 15 verse 13 and he said unto Abraham know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs and shall serve them and they shall afflict them for hundred years and also that nation whom this yourself will add George and after all shall they come out with great such things and there shall go to the fathers in peace there shall be buried in a good old age but in the fourth generation they come hither again for the iniquities of the amorite is Ned yet for amen let us pray Heavenly Father we won't thank you tonight and we just appreciate you for another time that we can come around your world I pray father bless your children father God as we all pour into the service tonight Lord as your wonderful blessing upon the world we thank you we love you and we appreciate you as we commit ourselves in your hands now in Jesus name we pray Amy hello bless you we have your seat well there are a few things I want us to look at tonight if I forget to say it at least I will not be in trouble happy Mother's Day on Sunday to all our sisters and this is rather lady never I want to be sooner praise the Lord amen tonight let's let's just look at some few things for the background we will be looking into the message or looking away to Jesus there are some few coats I have there I want for us to read and Bert Jordan I think we are done with our the tape we were playing for Sunday school yeah it will be good for us to pick up from from this tape like we will use it tonight so ELISA the people can be able to get a background of what we'll be reading tonight looking away to Jesus bar Branham in this a message he's will beginning non-talking on some few things that have happened over the years in his ministry and most especially is in this ministry where he kind of for pota the manifestation wish of course yeah there are many manifestation of the temple but there were five major the brother brand and pull together as the temple being identified with these five manifestation since 5 is the number of grace is the bride's number so it's very very important to us and now we want for us to look at those five manifestation that identified the temple and so we will look at we will just read some of the few things he said year and then we will we were going to what we want to talk about tonight and I hope you'll be able to see it he said that a pool has now been vindicated and I'm sure you all know what it is what is the tape home the opening of the word the tear pool is the Bryce ministry it's a ministry that's been given to the bride I will explain a little bit on there tonight the tear pool man has been vindicated and I'm and I'm sure you all know what it is now remember there will never be an impersonation today cuz it can it can be see it cannot be praise the Lord now is in existence I'm I am one of this right at this time now is it just happened so it could identify its presence ammonia unaligned death it could identify his presence among you see but it will not be used in a great way the tape on we identify his presence among you now remember when we look at Ruth in in in the gleaming season she came at the end of the harvest but Boris to his men that issued drop a battle of year that she dropped a battle look there because Ruth harvest was not going to be like the beginning of habits since she was in a grainy season she'll be getting little little but one down the row she would just find a bundle they will not all be together it's not a great harvest of manifestation it will happen in a little way God manifests his present among us but in a little bit not in a great way and I can tell you that we have seen it praise the Lord amen we have seen it I mean having prayers being answered in our miss is one of it one of the latest one is I mean we stay have sister quiche with us so I mean there's that's a big answer to pray praise the Lord he says so it could identify his presence among you see but it will not be used in a great way until this council begin to tighten up so when it does the Pentecostals and so forth can almost impersonate anything can be done but when that time comes when the squeeze comes down then you will see what you have seen temporarily will manifest in the fullness of its power praise the Lord Amen now with all this that is happening you know many asking that question is this the squeeze is this the time and we have to realize the other I mean this is is it's a plague upon the word I mean we can put that on a type of of the Exeter and and go to the children of Israel to pull the dog the blood on the linkage of the doorpost you know I mean there was there was the the talking a sign of you know they are safely going out and simply coming back in praise the Lord and we believe there we are honor they are talking amen that is the blood that is the bleeding word that we have fellowship in around now so but seeing what is happening around the world I would not I would not affirm that we are in the squeeze but I say to you that we are getting close to that time praise the Lord I mean we are moving right into it with all of the things that is happening there was something that I was thinking about I drew my mind to this and I read it to you right your brother branham see he said talking about a temple it is so sacred that I mustn't said much about it as he told me in the beginning said this said nothing of it you remember that years ago congregation says amen it speaks for itself the tear food will speak for itself praise the Lord I have tried to explain the other that's the first pool and the second and I made a mistake this will be the thing he says to my opinion I don't say the law tell me this this will be the thing that will start the rapture in faith for the girl in a way what would be the thing that we start the rapture effect the manifestation of this tape oh praise the Lord when we see Christ manifesting his word among us now let's read this also now there is coming a time in this nation the word this nation is going to exercise all the power that the Beast had before it which was pagan Rome when when it when it becomes Papa room see that this nation would do it revelation 13 plainly explaining that lamb come up out of the earth there are other beasts come up out of the water thickness multitudes of people this line come up were there were no people alarm represent a religion he says the Lamb of God and remember is speaks like a lamb it was a lamb and then after the white received power to speak like a dragon in it and exercise power the dragon high before him the dragon is room now this is word you know all of this comes you know to my mind brother branham tells us Amir as he goes down in this message he talks about way back then he talks about we been to the place word it would take generation and generation and generation to pay the depths that that the nation have and now with everything that is happening and with with what is on us present in them and I mean the country trying to manage the crisis and trying to manage all the people that are out of work you know trying to I mean trying to keep some sense of order just trying to manage a meaning and it had been a great blessing to everyone of us but this is what we should put in our mind all of this is is not reducing the debt its increasing the depth it's putting us to the place word is setting a platform for us to turn to the dragon for the nation to be empowered praise the Lord you know I'm not trying to preach a scary message but I'm just trying to show that I mean we are stepping right in line with Scripture with everything that is happening you know if years back we were at a place word I mean it would take like Berta Branham says children children children to pay the death how much more now so what is going to make this Lomb exercise the power of the Dragon is when she will have to turn to her to pay off her debts praise the Lord so we have to keep that in mind amen we have to keep that in mind now just like the scripture we rare tonight on the iniquity of the amorite I want to go into that a little bit but I want to show where we are standing we spoke Sunday on children of the promise what is our promise you know we have a promise for the day that we are living in you know and and just like Abraham and his seed now see God is telling Abraham God is affirming to Abraham that Ellie is I will not be the one you know to be your hair say it's going to be your own seed you will have a son but let me show you what is going to happen Abraham gave him a vision took him out there make the sacrifice and everything and then God is telling him your seed was so John for them to ever travel they must be born God is telling your see was so drawn into a strange lane for them to travel if they have to be born so God is affirming to Abraham you will have a seed that will be born and they will soar John into a strange land that is not yet they're going to be there for 400 years wish of course at that time was four generation so even before Abraham had Isaac God is telling him there this thing is going to happen I'm not only telling here I told you before you left your your your fatherland and you had trouble out of these years I told you about that son now let me tell you a little bit about his future 400 years and he's going to be I mean he's going to be my treated by the nation's that he would go to all of these things are going to happen to him but then after full generation I'm going to come down with a mighty him and I'm going to deliver them I'm going to bring them out and I'm going to bring them back to this land but before I bring them back to this land there is something that is going to happen the iniquity of the AMA rights I go into before so it's almost in in the same place brother Branham you're talking about the tempo and and and telling us the things that would bring the squeeze upon us you know though where we are going to get all for that before that Valka to come upon the nation you know for all the churches to be regulated where what what would actually happen now he's he's telling us now this manifestation of the temple will really come into power when we find ourself in this place now we can look at everything that is happening around us and say mine mine if all of this is happening it means that we are getting to that place praise the Lord we are getting to that place because I mean the depth is is getting to a limit word I mean we would just have to look for someone to bail us out and when the nation does that it will be surrounding all is religious right to the Catholic Church praise the Lord but brother branham here is now telling us that before we get to that time there is something that is going to happen to us we the bride members we are in this hour we are we are at this time this is this is the part of this is our this is our territory this is where we are and the things that supposed to be happening in the Manas we will be experiencing this manifestation praise the Lord Elijah came on the scene and he said there will be no rain or Dew you until I Elijah call for it now so God had to bring the nation the entire nation to a place where there was no rain there was famine in the land for not only Elijah but also the people that the the 7,000 that they now body has to build for them also to experience the same supernatural that Elijah was experiencing praise the Lord so I believe that's where we are where Branham said he says and then after a while receive power and speak like a dragon that's the that's the lamb exercised all the order the power the dragon high before him he says who's the dragon Rome always so don't you see Rome denomination a MacPro testing denomination an image onto the Beast making a power that will force all protesters like a union you have to be in this Council of Churches all you won't be able to have fellowship he said well it's practically that way you can go to a church and preach unless you have a fellowship card or or an identification now he says drop-down he says it's tightening and then when that time comes and the press comes to the place to where you press out then watch what I'm fixing to tell you in a few minute watch the tape ooh then see it will it will be absolutely told the total loss it will be for the bride and their church praise the Lord now so with this being said I want to bring us to the place for us to a few things I want for us to look at now you see Jesus in C Matthew chapter 24 when he was talking about about the Jews and about the temple according to Daniel prophecy the Jews will go back to their place of worship they would go back to their temple worship when the abomination that causes desolation it's taking away now that is for the Jews so in one sense there is something that is hindering them from going back to their complete temple worship and that is the same thing with the church that is the same thing with the bride that is the same thing I mean with the church now we have a promise here and and and and God is telling the children of Israel or tell him a brunette your seed was so John and after they will come back and he Herod this land that I've given to you but before they come and take this land there is something that is going to keep them away that is going to handle them and that thing is going to be the iniquity of the AMA rights praise the Lord now so if we are Abraham's seed if we have a promise praise the Lord then there is something also that is hindering us from their promise wish of course we have a promise praise the Lord now brother Branham in that in that message look away to Jesus he spoke about the 5 manifestations that identify the temple and is beautiful as as I was looking a to them in and looking through their messages he spoke about you you just you just think about it I kind of listed out in a way year that I think it's beautiful he talks about the scorer's wish of course is I put that on the creation because he spoke them into existing and he spoke now right after that experience he came over to sister hell ride house and he was talking about that and that was where she she confesses saber bram there is nothing but the truth and right there the Holy Spirit told him the same God has spoke those strollers into existing he said have told me right now for you to ask anything and she asks for the salvation of Hasan's so honor the temple we saw creation we saw salvation and then we saw resurrection of the little fish and then we also saw healing he says before the doctor we touch sister media you take the tumor away and we also saw what I put in my notes I put dominium but it was control over nature controlling the storm and brother branham you know so as you listen to that message you will find the Bourbon goes over there you know he kind of place it right in there of all of those things that God used to identify the the tape oh let me let me let me show something here let's go to the book of Corinthians let's go to the book of Corinthians praise the Lord Corinthians chapter 12 praise more let's read from verse 6 and there are diversities of operation but it is the same God which worketh all in all but the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit whether for to one is giving by the spirit the word of wisdom to another the word of knowledge by the spirit to another faith by the spirit to another the gifts of healing by the spirit to another the working of miracles to another prophecy to another discerning of spirit and to another devil kinds of tongues into another interpretation of tongues now a brother branham when he talks about the gift of healing him he said he said he said we should realize here that Paul when he talks here he talks about the gifts of healing now in these gifts of healing where Brenham help us to understand that God all of these gifts of healing God can heal by music God can heal by his word God can heal by medical science God can heal by hurts God can heal by praying he plays out of this honor the gifts of healing praise alone but brother Branham also help us to understand too that when the angel of the Lord came to him down in in the cave and told him you have been given a gift of divine healing for the you know for the nation now that's word is different from what Paul promised for the local church he said you have he make emphasis on that he says you have to realize the angel said you have been giving the gifts of divine healing now the way he brother honor his ministry was the first port the second port the first pool by the vibration of the of the hand he could detect the illness the second pole was by the discernment of spirit he will know the very disease of the people and the tear pool will be the word prays alone so that that gift that that God gave to brother Branham now with this gift of these gifts of healing is the gifts that is in the body now you see many men has raised of all true the century and having gifts of healing to pray for the sick brother Branham says they are seeing gift of healing the heart he says that is the same gift of healing and mother have to pray for her daughter because it's a gift that is giving to the church a child has that gift of healing to pray for their sick parent when the scripture says they will lay their hands on the sick and pray for the sick when a wife pray for her husband or the husband pray for the wife is a gift that is given to the church it's supposed to be in the body now God has blessed men with measure of faith but a gift that God has set a sign that is different from what they are postal Paul place in the church yes Roberto Branham talks about that comes that angel of the Lord told him about because that Ministry of no whirring the diseases but the touching of the hand was completely different and he says now one time it has been wrong now when he talks about a year in a message of looking away to Jesus he spoke about it he says talking to this woman and and praying for her you know that was the first time she ever saw it now brother Branham will use this now to be able to tell us how come he got to know about sister media having disease because he just touched a woman and and he told a woman this is what happening to you she said I don't have no symptoms about that brother Branham he said this had never been wrong he called another brother come and he touched the brother he says that there is nothing wrong with him he says even even media comes media is well nothing wrong with her but when he touched system media he felt a vibration on his hand and he says you have a seat she said no now watch now watch and see let's see how you know how God can afford a design this gift before when when brother Branham touched system media they only had Rebecca she had bill appalled and they had Rebecca when Sarah was born better Benham to his dieter because of why he have detected for the doctor to check sister media because system eat I gave very birth by c-section the doctor Church the doctor said I never saw anything where Branham says it had never filled one time after Sarah was born when Joseph was born brother Ben said I told the doctor to check and a doctor check and he says there is nothing dealing belly Berbera says to show how Godward never failed it would be the the the the situation word sis Emilia was stress with Joseph attitude and brother branham had just come come home and she wanted him to correct yourself and you know brother branham let it go and she slammed the door now to see that God showed this he showed this before Sarah was born before I just was born praise the Lord and even after having all of this child the doctor check and there was nothing now remember that I'm trying to to late a little place here for us to seed the iniquity of the Amorite it has to come to that place Nia so something something has to get out of other naturally says to me that they not have the SIS but as soon as she did something that she shouldn't have done where brand says what I understand she's tired she's he says he says poor woman she's tired with these children I live all the time I go in and I just I just know she's tired she don't mean it and he says and then I went outside to wash my car he says and then an injured of the law told me go and tell her to read the book of Chronicles when when Miriam you know spoke something about Moses wife praise the Lord so brother branham one he showing how that divine gift never failed and he also showing how that the doctors check nothing happened but just in the time what she did something that she shouldn't have done what he sought yes back praise the Lord where Branham says this was he said this was about I think two years before Sarah was born so what he saw years back now here is God telling Abraham years before your see was so John they would go away but when they are coming back to their inheritance before they get here the iniquity of the amorite has to rise up praise the Lord because God would not kick them out of the land God will not judge them until they get to a place to stop God's people from taking their inheritance praise the Lord now if we want to if we want to bring it in a time and just compare it there with system either health which is she's the woman she's a type of the church brother Branham is the man he's the ministry a type of the word God had to wait for the ministry that was met all of the first pool there was not something for the second pool God have to wait to the place where we have to come to the place of taking over our in everything's what is our inheritance tear pool what is the tape who for taking us back to Eden position so that way back when he was still under the first pool with a vibration of his hand but it never came out when he was discerning there were a lot of media system me that was sitting in it never came out until this time of the typhoon God is saying your people were so John in a strange Lane and then after 400 years I will bring them out with a mighty him praise the Lord amen now I want for us to look at some few Scripture let's look at numbers chapter 21 numbers chapter 21 numbers chapter 21 let's read from verse 21 and is recent messenger on to see whom king of of the amorite saying let me pass through the lane we will not turn into the fields none into the vania we will not drink of the waters of the will but we will go alone by the king's highway praise the Lord until we pass that border but seeing one who not suffer Israel to pass through his border but seeing him gather all his people together and went out against Israel into the witness and and he came to Jesus and fought against Israel now so here is where ya which were the the the iniquity of the am arise play out for for the seed of Abraham we being a children of the promise you see where it plays out the thing they handle us that is stopping us from from getting over to our inheritance the thing that is that is Henry us four completely so run into the world the iniquity of the Amorite now you have to realize that that word iniquity is a very familiar word to the believer when we start allowing things that we should not allow there would be the very thing that we handle us from coming to this terrible position from coming to this place of because we have to realize that this promise is on to us is the promise of the Holy Ghost what is the name of this promise is this land is body our land is not a physical lame because if God it will work through anybody it has to be a body that is submitted subjected to this word a body that has been surrounded - this word your body and my body brother bear them to us over and over he don't have no hands but your hands and my hands you don't have no feet your feet and my feet you don't have a mob to talk you have to use your mouth in my mouth saying what the word says so this is the land of the promise this is a land that has been redeemed this is a land where the Holy Ghost is dwelling in praise the Lord we can talk about it we can go into into all the types but we have to realize that brother branham talking about this and teaching us this he he he brought it to the place of the church I can show you coach what brother Branham says the iniquity of the MRIs he talks when the Pentecostal starts rejecting the word you know he type it to the great falling away and there are a lot of types out there that we can look at but what I want to what up what I'm trying to get us to see you is there if we are the children of the promise and the promised seed was a very promise that God gave Abraham there is a see word that has come to us and this message is that see word it has not just come to give us a title as message believers it have not just come you know to make us to feel different like like event then all the people in the world but this word has come to possess a people and to be made flesh in the bride just like the world was made flesh in Christ that is the reason why he want to have the preeminence that's the reason why I will he want to have the preeminence now if you if you look over also in the book of the the book of Joshua you will see a little bit of what we read over in in the Book of Numbers so the picture here that I want I want I want us to see is the other God confirming the promise to Abraham he's assuring Abraham that you will have the sea and he's telling Abraham what is going to happen to the seed when this seed come forth it's going to travel in a strange Lane and it's going to come back to this very place where I give this promise to you but before they get back to this place there will be people on the road to handle him God has given the promise just like we read over here in looking away to Jesus all of these five teams that brother Branham talked about that is the manifestation of the temple he said we're going to see it what we saw temporarily happening in his ministry is going to come to a time word is going to happen in this bride ministry but we need to get to that place it's not something word when the squeeze come automatically we will start who we will start a manifesting the ministry of the table no we have to be to that place and then what is stopping us from from getting to that place Jesus said because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall was called so just like how the the iniquity of the arm arise was stopping Israel from getting over to their promise that is the same way the iniquity in this age is Henry us the message is just what people caught and they argue we know all of these things but we are living in an hour what where we need it now praise Lord we saw it on an honor on Erik honor every Elijah ministry they had a time of honey and God they not only there with the messenger in their age the messenger benefited from it and the people that believed his message also benefited for me honor Elijah ministry it was Elijah and a widow and her son on Elijah ministry there was another widow and her two boys that was going to be so they benefited from the ministry the supernatural I was in Elijah ministry the benefit it is so all their vessels before they pay all their death they were able to live and enjoy the rest of the alive from the benefit of their ministry so bourbon is literally saying all the things that we have heard on tape it's not only going to be on table is going to happen in our mess but we have to be to a place for us to experience those things the other I mean the message of Christianity you know it's not is it's not just like you find out what other religion you find people they have been giving setting prayers where they reside to recite the recited recite they memorize it they recite I mean they can come to the excellent of their religion when it knows how to memorize those things right from they sleep they don't have to read it from the book but for us it's not only to memorize it the word want to live through us praise the Lord that's what the tear food is this message has created a brine out of these years this word has transformed a people this word has been implanted in us out of these years we've been hearing the message on tapes we've been hearing it from different five-four ministry the purpose the thing that God been desiring to achieve is to have a people that is pregnant with the word that is above that that would bring for the word it's gonna be Christ in bright form we are not going to bring for a son that would be separated from our body but we're going to bring a son that is going to be living in our body just like Paul said it's not I deliver but it's Christ that livery me that is the purpose of this message God has been preparing us through the different trials that we have gone through whether is our personal trial whether it's a church trial whether it's a contract trial I mean many countries have gone through their trials you know saving the Lord in the time of war in the time of farming in a time of flawed I mean the bride has gone through everything some through the water some through the fire some through the storm but we all have been going through the blood because the life is in the blood so no matter what our trial is he's putting us through the blood for us to be able to bring for that crash like nature ready for the moment what would the moment what we saw in his ministry temporarily for it to be right before us not to guess what we would do we know what to do praise the Lord we know what to do in that moment but Branham says right in their in their term in that in that room he says you could feed the presence of the Lord he said brother Ben would you were there when when sister hell you I said that you can feed the presence of the Lord she had a sick sister she had a tall mother and she was very poor her husband have died where BAM says she was just a farmer living on two hundred dollars a month because of the atmosphere because of the time there was nothing different she could ask for when she asked for the salvation of her sons that was the right thing she asked for so what is God doing he's preparing or putting us to the place word we will speak the right thing we were desire the right thing we would think the right thing because we will not be filling our mind we're also sub negative things and all sorts of foster it on the internet there right in a time of trial you want to say the right thing you would not say the right thing at that time but when we are feeding our self with the word and and and he's giving us grace to have the right attitude when we go wrong we repent we put our life in order we don't justify ourself for what we do we know that it's wrong we have to remember the thing that was keeping Israel back is the iniquity of the amoeba we're here somewhere he says he said God has to even delay the promise for two more years just to wait for the iniquity of the Amorite he said because when Moses went into into the wilderness he had to stay for two more years he said why did God did there he said because the people were not ready the people when I read what other people the people that was supposed to go to the promised land they were not ready yet so Moses will make you Josh over us you think you know that we're better than us brother branham share this and better Branham series I mean we are using the word to fight we are using the word to a hug you but I mean we are right at a place now to realize that this message is now for us to chop one another up this message is to prepare people it's to prepare people for the hour that we are living in well when the brother calls you on the phone and and you have the right word to say to him you have the right word to say to him or if you don't have nothing to say you can just listen and said let's pray you have the right attitude to be able to deal with the situation that comes before you that's why he's been preparing us for we have the word to create the right atmosphere all of those things were manifested honor the tempo the power of creation the power of sedation resurrection healing if he gives him power to control the storm and system you stay right back there and go to where you're coming from he can give us power to control touch that is flowing to our mind the storm of thoughts the storm of our natural nature you can say all devil you start right there and get out of here that is our age that is the time that we are living in if it is true that everything that is happening is raising up the debt limit wish of course is true and it's going to put us into that direction wish of course that's the direction we are going they have much more about with the bride we have to be looking into the world amen he said writing this message she said she will know what to do with the word praise the Lord she will know what to do with the word children of the promise that's the hour that we are living in this word will be made flesh once again remember that brother Branham says it cannot be person impersonated no you can put it on it's not a dress that you can worry it's not a dress that you can worry it's a nature that puts you on you can put it on a puts you on because it's a nature that Dwarfs in you for you to put it on would be a impersonation but for it support you on it's going to be a reality it's a life in you in a serious he spoke about that little group talks about missing length earrings restore how can we ever get to that place are we talking positive things are we having the right kind of encouragement are we addressing things by the word are we addressing things by the word or are we just care how we just care that we honor fear it's another thing we just honor fear all I need a hole that goes all it's a rapture girl no templates were all of these things that that's happy I mean we should be in that world praise the Lord the iniquity of the amorous what am i typing tonight her been said in feasts of the trumpet he said all those 200 million demons he said those were the spirit devils from the river you freaky he said it stop Pentacles from getting to the promise he types that just like the amorite the Jebusites and all of the nation that were there to fight against israel now you have to realize these are just common people these are just Shepherds I mean they they never had a military they were just only following the leadership of God the pillar of fire by night and a pillar of cloud by day and they were meeting organized nations all of these nations were organized nation they have the high King's Moses were sent a worse than Joshua and his men carry this word to the king just tell him we just want to pass through they were not even a nation they were not even I mean a people like other nations having King having a constitution or they were following it just a lot of God but there was something about these people the other nation we're afraid to allow them to pass through they are telling them we were not taking your land we're not drinking your water we just want to pass through the fear is there if the past rule I mean we don't know what will happen I mean they create darkness over Egypt who know what they are bringing upon us problem says that's a problem with the people today they are afraid what the Holy Ghost is going to do to them yeah they are just afraid how the baptism of the holy ghost is just going to rob them of every ward eNOS I'm telling you it's not going to take anything good from you [Laughter] it's just going to bless everything good you have when the Holy Ghost comes it takes everything that you don't want it takes it away so they were afraid of Israel but yet God please those people in your Wayne for Israel to be able to fix them to deal with them as they go on to their promise remember he gave them a promise that I will be with you I was saying on that before you he says I sent my angel before you he get them out of this promise first of all he gave them all of these promises and Israel just going I mean it they carry their young they carry their old I mean they are on camera back Shane I mean they are traveling all of these people but here there was something in the mists of them in your heart I mean you go around and see all of these nations and see how they are built and the walls that they have and if you're saying we come o people how can we get through this but God has given them a promise he said with a mighty hand that was what he said to Abraham I would come down and with a mighty him I would bring them to this promise to this Lane and that's where we are that's our promise people that will be able to experience a talking life a person I will be able to experience such a peace in their heart they can say as as much as I know to the best of my knowledge there is no evil thought in my heart against anybody can get to the place and say to the best of my knowledge there is not anybody that I'm holding anything against the people that will be able to experience that that's our promise that is the land that we are coming to is God possessing this body and that was the reason why he gave us a son of man ministry he got one man in age and he waved him over us he brought him to the level of life that there are other sons and daughters that are coming to that place we will learn how to reference God we will learn how to listen to his voice can you imagine we're branches after he didn't listen to God for the first time he had to go many years with our God speaking to him he had to go many years he was stay preaching but he just knew that there was something missing I need to get back to that place and many of us we can look in our lives and says I need to get back to that place a son of God a daughter of God I have ever experienced the grace of God in their life they know what it is when it's missing we know what it is when prayer is missing we know what it is when worship is missing we know what it is when truth joy is missing we may put up the face but we know what it is because we have drunk of that wine before so I'm bringing the iniquity of the Amorite here in a type of the things that are Henry us crisis the measure of God reveal where Benham says he want to reveal himself to us but we are letting this we are let him dead we are letting this other thing to stand in the way God has been preparing us for this hour this very hour where we are coming down to and all of the things that are happening around us we must be able to have an attitude when you talk with a loved one on the phone or you talk with a co-worker or you talk with you know just a stranger and it just like everything because everything that people talks about you listening to the news you listen to the read I mean everything is just driving to the place of being negative but you can be able to take an attitude after you have listening to all of that to be able to bring them a sign of hope you can be able to bring them a little release when you tell somebody I'll be praying for you you just see the light that goes on in the eyes thank you thank you something happy just this evening I was coming to work and with with the with the flights flying over today the people from the global markets um I mean I don't know whether it was some of the food places they had a little food in the eggs and they were giving it to the health worker so I was bathing in and one of the boys did he said well how long so I never ate their food would you like it first ice I wait I was going I said no but then I said no I would take it so I went I took it from his desk I said well I would just keep it in my car and then when I get you know on the road and and you know meet any of these people standing on the road give it to him so I kept it in my vehicle and just on my way to church in orders that's a kind of a turn up there you know from 94 I was trying to do a turn and just come on the road and I was not even thinking about it because I was listening to a message while I was driving but I just came right under the red light and a moment I turned my head I saw the young man standing across the road with a sign in his hand I mean it's just happy but scared I mean it happened in such a when I was surprised of myself I saw him I just reached them I took the bag I ain't it out he ran he collected therefrom I mean it happened so quick and and i fairly myself i said it looks like this bag was just ordained for this point because i was not thinking about it i had there there was almost like i forgot about it and it just happened so quick that is just that is just kind of a natural physical example but I'm talking about any time of need I mean when somebody is just is just trying their frustration at you and yet I mean just trying the I heard at you and they are just throwing everything at you are we going to be like Harry right you see the right word praise the Lord Berta Brennaman their storm he says I'm a god I will never be lost praise the Lord and he tried to find his way he tried to find his way and he realized that the storm was coming what he did but would be like brother branham to realize that no this thing these choices we are making this way we are dealing with this situation he said I have to come to the place where I made Lord I need your help resurrection of the little fish bird random talks about brother banks cool brother he says the night before when he met brother branham had told him something where been deserted him and he says well I think banks told him that praise the Lord he says in his mind now he says he says I think banks told him there and then verbatim says well if you think he told me in there was about last night when I man almost shot you with a gun he said nobody would know that because he was just in a situation where he what lost his life and where burns say he had to escape through the window praise the Lord I mean just giving him the right word what he needs God has been training us for this for this hour for this time that we are living in remember where benches it cannot be impersonated you don't have to make up something you can just hold someone by the hands and just weep with him you know I was listening to to something and listening to a radio program and it was saying is it sometimes when you go to - I mean - - more with somebody or to counsel someone if you if you don't have words to say just sit with them and just crying if you can crime just sit with them just that time of sitting with them quietly holding them by the hands just that time brings a lot of comfort instead of trying to make up words you know some people try to make up words and they enter saying things that hurt the person more than helping them praise the Lord sometimes people just need to digest the truth of the moment they are in they don't need to hear it again they know that God knows all about it they know that you know God allow it sometimes they just need to just slowly that just that truth then when people come over and over and say it to them over and over and say it today it's a truth or sometimes the truth can frustrate the person what am I talking about where Brenham says washed out their food then he says it will be for the bride and the church I believe that's the hour that we are living in I believe we are slowly coming to that place this word supposed to affect our attitude it's supposed to affect our response to situation I mean we have been servicing with this word and all of the things that we have been taking that I mean it's we should be to the place where things you now so easily get on our sleeves praise the Lord I forget to say I have had a privilege to speak with our local pastors today praise the Lord I just I just taught us as well I mean how can we be in the same city we can even talk with all of these things that is going on let me check on these when these pastors and see how they are coming on how they dealing with things you know I mean how we have we preparing for the hour that is right before us we have to realize that we are in this together and we're going to come out stronger that's what I believe the bride is going to come out stronger this thing is going to affect us in such a way that we would come out and we might not even recognize ourself when we are praying we might not recognize ourselves you know when we are receiving that word because you know sometimes it's so easy for us to just flow you know with the wave but boring against the current that's what is sometimes tough we want God to walk upon us but with his brother sent me agreed is better done asked me to greet every one of us but Paul also asked me to read every one of us so we are grateful I was glad to know they're all doing well praise the Lord amen but that's the hour that we are living people then that is that is just what's on my heart tonight you know just like how is really hard to wait for the iniquity of the amorite and that's the same place where we are something have to rise up for us to fully come into this but then we will not come into this if we are not prepared just like they miss it Glaus have 400 years and he was right on time 400 years moses was there but the people were not ready so moses had to go back in the witness forty years have to add on it before moses came back out so you see when God is training us and he's dealing dealing with us and we are not paying attention we are only causing a delay for ourselves we are causing the delay when you think that anger is your nature is now your nature is not it does not belong to you it came down from one of your grandfather and you don't need it you don't need it for the table manifestation you don't need it for the rapture you are not needed for the Millennial you don't need it for internet it so get rid of it now but when a person thing all you know that's my nature that's my weakness you just creating a delay he cannot move you to the next place so what God have to do he has to give Moses a sign he has to give Moses something supernatural even though the people stay hard I think that doubt in their mind about Moses but when Moses came with the supernatural that can identify them with God they were ready to follow the supernatural when he saw the plague coming down on Egypt they were ready to run run right over to Moses and Aaron and say what what did Allah want us to do Oh last night you said applied the block on the lane tail I was at the right one or the left one they were ready to ask question because they saw that he had a word of the law for the Abbaye and we don't have to look for it the word of the Lord for our day has been right before us we've been listening to eight preachers being re-echoing this word to us the only thing that is keeping us from stepping into their for promise is our iniquity of the animal rights praise the Lord that's the thing that was stopping Israel and God showed Abraham so God had is showing it to us he show Abraham in the promise why because Israel need to deal with that and whatever is stopping you you need to deal with it you need to face it their weakness is whatever it is you need to face it you need to deal with it there's no time to glorify witnesses glorify scene there's no time for that it's time were Paul say we must we must we must hate the very appearance of it David said we must hit it with pepper hate rain you must get so angry with it because all it's doing is just robbing you from stepping over into your promise this whole egos have fullness of joy that can flow through you have you ever seen someone laughing and you don't know what they're laughing about you just are laughing I mean it just they're just laughing cracking up you don't know what the fun is but it just affected you and you start laughing I mean there is just so much joy here there is so much happiness here there is just so much things we can enjoy in these holy girls in such a depressing time there is just so much in God that we can enjoy and we just give us a burden for people that are hurting out there we can think about them we can pray for them because I'm telling you when when you are in a depressed situation is hard for you to pray you know but so when you are in a place where you can be able to experience the law of the joy the happiness of God then stretch out your prayer wings for others that are out there they need it he said these things that you see temporarily it's going to manifest when you see God have to bring him through a first pool and what did brother branham say he said both for the first pool and the second pool he said I made mistakes because why God told me not to explain it but brother Branham over and over he tried to explain it to the people to convince him this life of Christ he would not be able to convince people when Christ is living his life through you you will not be able to the son comes it does not convince you it just shines you know people talking oh the Sun is too hot his son it does not matter the song is this woo well what happened is honestly it does not bother the Sun and the scripture says the heaven declared the glory of God it comes out and do what the father one is to do it declare the glory of God and that is the same way something daughter of God was supposed to be that's our promise we are children of the promise it's not just a title we have a promise we have a word for our day that we have to walk into the our word has to live itself through us and we have to be prepared for it how can we do it by giving him the preeminence him having the first place in our lives submitting ourselves to the word so made in ourselves to one another allowing God that he will live that word through us out of your belly will flow rivers of water that's a promise even before the Holy Ghost was given that's why Jesus said unto the church so that is the same thing that is before us remember those five manifestation the creative power salvation resurrection of the little fish healing those are the things that should be seen among us and those things comes from God himself it's a proof that God it's among the people Paul says if your own believer comes among you and see those things happening he would say God is in your mess and that's what God wants to be seen he told Moses build me in the tabernacle so I will come and ward among you he inhabit our praise he want to inhabit our tops he want to inhabit our words he want to inhabit our desire he want to inhabit our actions and our reactions he want to feel every fiber of our body let's go to the Lord in prayer tonight Heavenly Father we come Lord Jesus with this word of agitation
