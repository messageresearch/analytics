most of all lord we just thank you for being a sin forgiving god lord knowing that we don't deserve it but you've given us grace so lord we just want to take full advantage of that grace you've given us in the wonderful name of jesus christ we pray hey church amen amen if you have your bibles let's turn to um ruth ruth the first chapter and then from there we'll go to um saint john st john chapter 16. ruth chapter 1 verse 1. the bible says now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled that there was a famine in the land and a certain man of bethlehem judah went to sojourn in a country of moab he and his wife and his two sons and the name of the man was elimelech and the name of his wife naomi and the name of his two sons was maelon and chylon ephronites of bethlehem judea of bethlehem judah and they came into the country of moab and continued there and elimelech naomi's husband died and she was left and her two sons and they took them wives of the women of moab the name of the one was oprah and the name of the other roof and they dwelled there about 10 years and maelon and chaelon died also both of them and the women was left of her two sons and her husband saint john chapter 16 saint john 16 let's let's read uh verse 21. the bible says a woman when she is in travail have sorrow because of her hours is come but as soon as she is delivered of the child she remembers no more the anguish for joy that a man is born into the world and you now therefore have sorrow but i will see you again and your heart shall rejoice and the joy and your joy no man taketh from you amen amen one more verse of scripture saint not saint john psalms 116. psalms 116. 116 and verse 15. and i'm going to take my title out of this verse right here psalms 116 verse 15. precious in the sight of the lord is the death of his saints amen may the lord a blessing to read of his word amen you have your seats and tonight my subject is precious death precious death and for a subtitle i want to use unlocking the mystery of the believer you know church right now we're in very very strenuous times you know but what does that mean for the believer if you're really a believer it should be a happy time for you because you know and understand that the lord is soon to come see we don't look at these times like oh what's going on no we look at these times like thank you lord because we can see so much prophecy being fulfilled we can see and understand that we are in the days of sodom and gomorrah we are right back in noah's day so we can see the word of god that was once written on paper now being manifest in the lives of creation what should that do for the believer you know it should be a very very happy time but when you when we think about you know uh if we can ask the question who is really a believer you know because a lot of people have the word of god and there's a lot of people even have the message of the hour but that don't make them a believer what makes them a believer hallelujah is how the mystery of their life is unlocked and once it's unlocked what's the manifest out of that hallelujah but if we look at the unlocking of the believer hallelujah how does god unlock the mystery in our life normally church it comes in a way that we don't want hallelujah it y'all mind if i move this to the side or do we need it no no we need it okay amen praise god cause i'll be swinging my hands and everything you know i i hope this is kind of sturdy [Music] but you know church when we think about us as believers and if i can make a statement today uh that we all should we should we should understand this by now and we should have a hold on it that god is in control amen and there's nothing out of order with god hallelujah and if you look at your life and you say well brother jesus i'm going through this and i'm going through that are you a believer amen and if you're a believer you have to put god in control of your child you have to put god in control of your tribulation you have to put god in control now this goes just going to be a hard one you have to put god in control of your pain hallelujah hallelujah you have to church because if you don't you say the devil is in control of your life so when you go through things and you have struggles and trials and tribulation you have to say thank you lord you have to say god you're in control you have to say god you don't make mistakes hallelujah because if you don't do that you're literally saying the devil is in control of your life hallelujah so we want to we want to take back every claim that the enemy has made that he's in control of our lives which he's not god is the one doing it all amen and even if we look right now in this season of the covet and and sickness and all these things we can't just say that this vaccine is of the devil now i know that's a struggle for some of us but let me say this the enemy can't do nothing but what god allows hallelujah and i'll challenge you the only way you can get sick is if you accept the sickness first hallelujah because you have the power to receive or reject amen so church we look at the believer's life and how god uh uh shows and proves who we really are now if we just take ruth uh the story of ruth now this was a household of of of a father his two sons his wife and his two daughter-in-laws but then all of a sudden tragedy struck the house oh my very uncertain tragedy you know elimelech he died very uncertain and then after elimelech died his two boys died but let's look at something you know elimelech and naomi the prophet of god said their names meant pleasant worship eliminate and naomi their knees meant pleasant worship so their children they grew up in a house where they saw pleasant worship amen so even though the father had died holy those two boys did not stray away from what their father believed but church then tragedy came and then the two boys died here now let's look at the wives now all the wives are sitting there they're they're they're if this is a word their husband lists now they have no husbands it's just them they got to do everything on their own but you have to be able to look at your struggle and say god is in control now the thing i love about this church you know we know the story that naomi said okay i'm going back she told her to two daughter-in-laws i want y'all to go back where y'all came from and listen what she was saying go back to be a heathen [Music] because the motorbikes that start was very illegitimate amen we know the motorbikes came from lot in one of his daughters amen and now he's telling she's telling her to daughter her two daughter-in-laws go back to your origin go back to your own belief go back to what you came from and offer said okay all right my husband's dead i'm gone but now ruth a mystery hallelujah hallelujah who she really is is now going to be unlocked how by death it was death that unlocked the mystery in ruth's life earlier it wasn't a good song it wasn't a good praise it wasn't a word coming from god it was the death of a husband the death of a brother-in-law the death of a father-in-law it was death hungry that sent her on a journey hell yeah so in her pain she was growing up [Applause] how many of us can look and say right now that we're growing in our pain that god is using our pain hurry up to bring out who we really are and nobody knew who ruth was nobody knew how connected she was to the kinsmen redeemer but it took death it took death to bring out the revelation of who ruth was now her own husband didn't even know who she was he thought he was just marrying a girl who looked nice or whatever no but she was a type of the gentile bride hello she was the type of a woman that in the midst of a struggle she would choose god's way she would choose christ hardly because the only the only example she had of god was naomi hallelujah now husband is gone her brother her brother-in-law is gold her father-in-law is gone so the only example she got hurry up truth is naomi and she was willing enough in her pain to be led by somebody else hungary to the truth how many of us when we're in pain we quit church how many of us when we have pain we stay home how many of us we're in pain we're complaining about what we're going through real saying not me your god is my god [Applause] your song is my song earlier your church is my church when you eat i'll eat when you sleep i'll sleep when you die i'll die hallelujah yo god it's my god hallelujah in the midst of her pain she was willing to be delivered see this this this this looked like just reading it that it was a very bad time for ruth but no this was our greatest moment oh yeah this is our greatest moment because the man she really married hallelujah didn't mean anything in the scriptures you hear nothing else about him you don't even hear history talking about him hello but when she allowed hallelujah to let her pain hallelujah unlock the mystery in her life and be led by naomi see the bible says when a woman listed let's let's read that again it says a woman in saint john 16 a woman when she is in travail have sorrow holly see when she's in travail travail of what something coming forward in a lot of times church our pains and our sorrow it's just god fit to produce something because you take a little baby how does a baby learn he learns she learns about her pain hallelujah you know if a baby falls down what does she do she has to fight through that struggle get back up and learn how to walk hallelujah and she doesn't if he or she never adapts to just that little fall they'll stay calling hallelujah but that child has to adapt to the pain hollywood to get back up and try again hey man don't let the pain stop you honey but the pain is making you stronger hungaria and even the mother when she has the baby in her womb hallelujah until the pain comes she don't even know that the baby is being delivered it takes pain for her to realize that there's about to be a birth but you know what now just like christians now and hours a doctors are trying to take away the pain give her epidermis give her a little give her that let her go through it with no pain that's not scriptural hallelujah god said that a woman was gonna have pain and what childbearing that's scriptural hallelujah now i ain't telling nobody what to do when you're ready you do whatever you do whatever you got to do but i want to show you that suffering and pain is a part of the christian journey hallelujah amen even in the church book paul said hallelujah that god has left a measure of suffering for the bride hallelujah but church we look at the mystery being unlocked she's like anything else again i go back to the baby how does a baby learn you tell the baby you have you have a healer or you have something on the stove and you tell that child don't touch that but you know curiosity they look at it and then they wait do you leave they look at it whether you leave and curiosity makes them touch it and they touch it and they get burnt hardly what stopped them from touching it again pain they learned by their pain they learned oh this is a good one they learn by their mistake hallelujah so church we need trial and error hallelujah we need sufferings we need tribulation we need pain [Applause] because without experiencing pain there are avenues of god that you would never get to know hallelujah so he allows things to happen so that more of him can come out amen and you know church when we look and we think about the scripture it says a woman when she is in travail have sorrow because her hour is come think about this hallelujah anybody going through something hallelujah if you got sorrow the bible says because your hour has come thank god for my pain thank god for my suffering thank god for my tribulation why because my hours come i'm about to enter into a rapture hallelujah i'm not worried about the state of this world it's right where it's supposed to be and i'm right where i'm supposed to be in this world hallelujah you know we're looking at him we say oh man we can't travel and we can't go here oh i got to come to church with a mask on i ain't coming no holly adapt to the pain don't let the pain control you adapt to the pain hallelujah you overcome the pain we got scripture for those that paul said uh uh um how does it go um um death is swallowed up in victory hallelujah death is swallowing victory why because your pain became a triumph how does god get the mystery out of you how does god unlock the secrets in your life holly nobody knew who abraham was until god took him through something he was called the father of faith hallelujah but how did he become the father of faith by overcoming challenges that's right hallelujah see yeah a title is good i'm bright i'm a message believer how do i know that unless you manifest hallelujah this message in your flesh hallelujah through all the struggle through all the trial and tribulation now look god told abraham holly you are the father of faith and you know what you're gonna have a son it's not gonna be isaac you know and none of this stuff looked like it could happen hardly so abraham and sarah had to go through some suffering they had to go through some trial hunger but that trial made him the father faith hallelujah look church first things first god makes him separate from his family hallelujah but you know he wants to bring along people that god wasn't intending to use god has no purpose for life harley but he brought lot on anyway hallelujah all light ended up doing was making more of a battle for abraham hallelujah so be careful who you try to drag along in your battle hallelujah be careful who you trying to put in place let god do that hallelujah and you know church from there amen he struggled he struggled this abraham he got a promise from god that you and sarah are going to have a child and now abraham is struggling with the promise of god as it's coming to pass you say how is he struggling he's looking at his wife and you see her beauty and he got afraid he should have been happy he should have been rejoicing but what did he feel he felt pain he felt struggle in that moment hallelujah when he should have said god is answering my prayers god is keeping his promise he should have looked at his wife and say man you look very fair you look very beautiful the bible says that she he he was spoken with he was walking out there and everybody saw and saw her beauty and everything and the first thing abraham says now he's gonna go through a struggle he says man you're so pretty they're gonna take you and kill me he was looking at you looking at it all wrong hallelujah he found pain hallelujah in the revealing of god's promise oh my church and right now we're standing we're sitting we're going to church we're living here in this in this state hallelujah in the revealing of god's promise but how many people are looking at the word coming to pass as pain and tribulation that's right we look at that oh lord what are we doing and you know me me me me and brother juan talked about this a little bit not much and i ain't gonna i don't go too far on it but we look at the political situation and we were like oh god what's going on we wanted him in oh no lord we wanted him here i won't end who god won't end yeah i'm not connected to no party the only party i'm connected to is jesus christ he gets my vote every four years and even the years when they hate voting hallelujah because god is in control and it just blows me away how people get so caught up in the natural moment and they produce pain over their lives when we ought to be looking at the state of this world and we ought to be rejoicing we ought to be rejoicing that there's no more trump and now there's a bite in hallelujah why why rejoice because it goes from one puppet to another god is still in control but you know what we say we say oh bless god ronald reagan was a good president oh bless god george w bush senior was a good president oh bless god clinton was a good president oh bless god obama was the devil oh bless god for trump he has his comedy back moving oh bless god we just give us four more years i want what god wrote and what blows me away is why is the first pig god and the last pig not god if god is in control of the universe let's stick with what's been revealed and if abraham were to stick with what god said he would have caught the promise in that moment look church he probably had to wait 25 years because god didn't wait 25 years to turn her body back hallelujah look church right here in this moment he's turning back to a young beautiful woman to a young king looked at grandma and said i got to have her what but abraham looked at the fulfilling of god's word and saw pain saw hurt tribulation all these things we should have been rejoicing look at how god lay roof in the midst of a pain it took a death hallelujah for for her to leave that safety zone hollywood took a dab for naomi to leave that safety zone here and go back down where she could be redeemed but you look church you look at naomi naomi says okay now hallelujah ruth is not redeemable what i am the church we weren't redeemable but god put us in the tree he made us a part of the promise he just originally died for us but we were grafted in hallelujah because of the jews pain now we're accepted [Music] hey look she's following naomi naomi's the one with the revelation all roof is doing is just following she don't know what's going on she's just doing everything naomi say dude hallelujah and by doing that every moment every moment she listens to naomi every moment she gets closer and closer hallelujah to [Music] why because naomi wants to be redeemed and she knows naomi is basically saying hungry i'm incomplete without roof because this can't be redeemer don't want me he wants this young bride [Applause] hallelujah think about it church oh yeah the love of his life was the jews but he pushed him aside for this young gentile bride [Music] this young gentile bride who didn't know anything oh hallelujah how precious is the is this is is it it's the death of the lord of the saints of the lord saints in his sight the beauty of death hallelujah in a moment where her life was just so jacked up god was using the death of a loved one to bring her closer to god oh my listen i ain't gonna be too long y'all know about the clothes listen listen listen what the prophet god says he says now we notice that it's always he said my thought now to you it takes pain distress discomfort he said look how the pharisees died to that law through pain to stress discomfort he said but it must be see he said we've got to have these things in our christian journey hallelujah what does it do church you know hungry some of us won't even pray unless we're going through something [Music] so god allows things to mess up sometimes why to put you on your knees just to get closer to him you know what bro scott what i'm trying to do i'm trying to i'm trying to be like paul paul said if i glory i'll glory in the things i suffer now that's a revelation because look at it he knew who he was he didn't say our glory you know what paul said grievous was gonna come when i'm gone because they know who i am they ain't gonna challenge me because they know god is in me he didn't glory in that hardly he said he said he said the bible say don't rejoice because you can cast out the devil he said rejoice because your name is written in heaven hallelujah think about the church paul he spent a night and day hallelujah in the sea hallelujah bit by viper whip uh with with stripes over five times hallelujah thrown over the wall stone one time but he said of our glory our glory in all my pain glory being able to go through all that and say i love you all being able to go through all that and then paul tell fastest and i forget a to the fastest and agrippa for this purpose i can't yeah oh they said you gonna go to rome and you might get killed he said for this purpose how many of us are running from it when the very thing you're running from is unlocking the mystery in your life we don't want no suffering we don't want no trial on or tribulation the bible says and jesus became perfect how by the things he suffered the lord jesus christ was made perfect by the things he suffered wasn't he suffered think about it church him being god he had hallelujah people that despised him and he was god he in his heart he no he never did anything wrong he had people lying on him he had people call him beelzebub chief of the demons hell yeah church look at what he's suffering hello the bible says he was whipped and marred more than any other man honey to the place to where he got unrecognizable when he hit the cross hallelujah church he died for something he didn't even do what was it sin he didn't commit any sins he didn't tell any lies he was the king of the jews [Music] but he was made perfect by those things he suffered what is god doing in your life what are you running from you might say oh british i'm in a bad relationship making you perfect [Applause] making you perfect [Applause] they're hallelujah wayward making you perfect [Music] and in my case oh god it's so cold up here making you perfect because what does god do see god already knows what's inside of you so he puts us in position where that mystery that nobody else knows about can come out like i said nobody knew that abraham had to power the spoken word in his mouth but god put him in a position where he had to speak yes hallelujah he says i the lag gonna go and i lag on return why because he was standing firm on the promise but it didn't stop there now he's gathering up everything because god wants you to go through it god don't want you to fake it out he don't want you to dodge it holly if you're an eagle you got to go through the storm this ain't a time to turn around this is a time to go through the storm hallelujah if god will take you through it he'll meet you on the other side [Music] but you know our problem brother juan hallelujah we don't want to fight we don't want to fight we won't we want a vision we want a dream or we want somebody to speak something in our lives no god wants to labor for us god may want you to push the plate back a little bit a little bit go on a fast or something hallelujah get a prayer group hug you and and maybe somebody in your house and show god that you really mean business where is that church prayer can unlock the mystery in your life [Applause] you know some of my best times in church is when i've been going through something and god drops a song of revelation in my heart and i get to church and sing that song it's like i'm in a it's like i'm in i'm i'm in a building all by myself holly and everybody looking at me and saying why he's so happy why he's so stirred up hardly because there's nothing like knowing god is with you in the midst of a trial i know how joshua fell how did joshua feel he went in every battle with a promise he went into every battle hallelujah with an attitude of victory and when he lost he said something wrong yes why because he wasn't used to losing too many of us have gotten used to losing so we accept whatever the enemy puts in our face death have a perfect work in your life hallelujah let that beauty of death hallelujah come out and bring something so wonderful hallelujah that god can say well done my good and faithful servant this he says now we're fine he says now we find that the rain which begins which brings forth fruit upon the earth it's born he says the poor said in the fields of thunder in a ragged jagged sky he said but if we didn't have thunder in the ragged jagged sky hallelujah he said the little distilled drops of rain that's been lifted from the seas and distilled from salt it it would not be born it takes that lightning and thundering blast hallelujah ragged rugged tearful fearful things to bring forth the soft pedal drops of water in the midst of all that on a real real hot day just a drop of water will refresh you if you can get past the scare of the thunder and lightning and wait for the soft drops of god's reign in your life hallelujah oh my church trouble is good because through trouble god reveals more and more of himself oh yeah he said it takes pain to bring forth birth it takes dying and as the clouds die rain is born because rain is a part of that cloud ma as the cloud dies rain comes forward hallelujah church as the tree dies what happens holy life begins to come forward all over again oh the beauty of death how sweet and precious this is hello you look at that tree every year this season right here the tree dies it looks ugly but it's really a beautiful thing because there's a mystery going on what is it it takes that cold how many have ever had real maple syrup real maple syrup hi i'm about some good old stuff from quebec i ain't talking about this stuff processed in the store until my real good holiday maple syrup you know what makes that maple syrup good cold cold cold winters cold cocoa what i think i mean cold cocoa below zero 20 cold because the colder it is hallelujah the better the syrup is the colder it is the more goes down to the root so it takes a real real real good good cold honey looks like the tree is dying to bring forth that sweet maple syrup that you eat in the morning on your pancakes so out of the trees pain oh yeah you have a sweet breakfast mama i hope you understand what i'm saying where i'm going with this because i don't know about you but uh and we'll probably deal with this in the morning but there's things that have happened to me i can't explain while i'm a christian why i've been serving god with all my heart holy there's things that happen and i'm like lord what is this and he's like go through it i got a purpose in it go through it see the problem of god say god is not the other confusion hallelujah amen he does all the confusion so there has to be a purpose in everything you go through my look at it even when the king hallelujah came and took sarah there was a purpose in that hallelujah what was god doing god was giving abraham even more blessings in his wrong in his lies he received more blessings in the midst of all his trouble in the midst of all his tribulation and struggle god had blessings lined up for him my we just have to accept the fact to go through it earlier listen he said that might be just fine he said but you know it takes death to bring a life hallelujah and we got to die until then we are so dead that there that there can be that there can be a new life coming in hallelujah listen when you really die to yourself that's when the new life of christ comes up holy when you die to your ways when you die to your thoughts then christ comes forward and lives out of us but this is the part i like when he says he says then our wings will be valuable you're no good to me you're no good to this church until you are dead that's right i don't get it mistaken i ain't talking about you yo yo your physical being i'm talking about your spirit man hallelujah into your spirit man hallelujah is reflecting christ and christ alone you're no good to any of us oh my this is what he says he said then our wings will be valuable and our experience here that we have will be valuable to others and to ourselves you're not even valuable until you die what good is a seed unless it dies because you will never get the life out of that seed again until it dies oh my jesus christ but if i can before i close i want to just let you see how trouble and tribulation and trial brought out the best in some of god's servants you know you remember abraham c was put in bondage for 400 years but they had a promise that he was going to send a deliverer how does that deliver or get there how did he get in his position what caused moses first step in his position death he killed a man and he everything was fine and easy he was living good everything was all right you know he was next in line next in line would be pharaoh you know he has the best of the best best goals best teaching best training best life best house best everything but one day something started to happen inside of him he couldn't he couldn't understand he started to feel for the slaves he started to be identified with the slaves what happened he started to be identified with suffering he started to feel their pain hurry up he didn't even know what was happening to him hallelujah he started to identify with the pains and the sufferings of the hebrew slaves and now he's looking at them but how was he going to get connected with what he was feeling how did he get connected he killed a man other than that he was just looking in the window saying man they just keep getting beat on they just keep getting whooped on what happened he decided to do something about it he decided to enter you know the prophet god said you could never pray for somebody until you enter into what they're going through and now moses is going to enter in to what the hebrews are going through how how did he get there by death once he killed that egyptian he began to think different he was like man i got to get out of here i got to go he started running as he ran for his life hallelujah what was he doing he was running into his position and he didn't even know it hallelujah one put him on track it was death it was pain it was suffering out of that church and moses had to give up the throne like you can believe what you want to believe but i believe in that moment when he killed that egyptian he realized what he did he felt bad he felt sad because now he had to give up everything that he ever know he had to give up the palace he had to give up his dreams of of being the next pharaoh he had to give up uh the next woman he had in line to marry whoever the case was he had to give all that up and enter into the suffering of the hebrews but that death put him in position to get a personal relationship with god because until that time he had just heard about god heard about how great he was from his nanny aka his mama he had heard about how good god was and and she hadn't even told her moses you're a deliverer god's gonna use you you had a special birth this and that all that was just talk the prophet god said all of that to moses was just in the intellectual realm he heard it hallelujah but he wasn't a part of it yet what changes your faith from real faith to intellectual faith when you become a part of what you heard that's when it's real hell yeah and now church he gets to the place hurry up where he kills the egyptian he runs for his life and now what happens hallelujah he meets his wife he meets his father-in-law he meets his position as a shepherd earlier all these things that he didn't even know was a part of him how did he get there the death of one stinking egyptian and the scripture says precious in the sight of the lord is the death of his saints know moses from that one place hallelujah but we would say one mistake killing an egyptian now he's left everything he's running from his life but i was right where god wanted him because you know before the foundation of the world back there on the back side of the desert the backside of the mountain god had a bush with moses name on it i don't think he just put that bush there that bush was there waiting on moses hallelujah god is perfect in his ways now remember the bible says when god created everything he rested and he said it was good so he didn't have to come back and create that bush for that moment that bush was already created think about the church god don't have to create a scenario for your life he just has to put you in position for the scenario in your life don't you realize he already has blessings set up for you he just got to get you in the right place that's right it's already been waiting on you you just got to get in the right place and what drives us there pain sorrow struggle tribulation hallelujah discomfort see all of moses discomfort now he's on the back side of the desert he's a bush saying moses moses i don't know about y'all but i never heard a tree speak i ain't never heard a bush speak a day in my life and i believe the same god moses do so that moment was ordained for him that moment was already created in the mind of god for moses hollywood so that bush was sitting there waiting on moses and nobody could call his name like that bush and it was god speaking out of the bush but what i want you to realize moses had to be in such a place that he could receive that next step in his life think about it if he was still in egypt and he heard a bush come out of it he probably took a stick and started but now he's in a place where his spirit is sensitive enough he's gone through things hallelujah now he can hear god oh my god sometimes god let us go through things just so we can hear him praise the lord glory brother amen and god did that over and over and over in the scripture hallelujah he let his saints go through things wide so they can hear him in a clearer manner oh my what made damon a good king his sufferings yes his battles his try and struggles all those things made him a good king look at how god started him out god anointed him hungry to be the king and then he let the king uh try to kill him anointed to suffer now you think he's the king he should have went to the palace no he's a king back out there with the sheep praise the lord he's anointed hallelujah but he didn't step in this position why he hadn't gone through nothing yet hallelujah he didn't go through nothing he has a fight he has to fight a bear he had to fight a lion and he had to fight a goliath all these things that everybody else was afraid to holly god let david go through it hollywood but in the midst of him getting to that point when he got to that point all of his triumphs his trials was going to make him get persecuted yes praise the lord amen y'all know we do that in church you know somebody's singing a good song and you know the saints just love to hear him saying it then jealousy start moving why they always got to sing every time we contract she's saying i'm special he doing it he doing that don't worry about it don't worry about it you just keep doing what god tell you to do and you look at david hallelujah god wanted him to be a king what was he he was a man of god's very own heart but david had to go through something that's right hallelujah he went through things the average king didn't go through hallelujah ma can you imagine having god in your ear holier being friends with the prophet holy and the prophet come and tell you exactly what god says when you're doing wrong the prophet come and tells you exactly what god says but look at how god started david out david wasn't even in the kingdom good yet and saul's got a spirit on and david come in playing this music when the spirit of the lord dares like david damn so i'll say do a javelin at him and all david was doing was playing the music the bible says when david played for saul saul was refreshed god using his gift and you're being persecuted at the same time amen but what is he doing he's getting closer to god amen praise the lord listen at least three times saul tried to kill him with a javelin what was god doing god was showing david what kind of king not to be amen think about it he was living with saul at one point earlier and saul was trying to kill him he's running for his life and and even god honestly put saul back in david's hands now that's when you're manifesting the heart of god because god has his enemy right in his hand and you still don't tell nobody praise the lord yeah jesus right there in the church with everybody else told the church when he was the devil and still ain't telling nobody else who he was talking about amen but us he sub-received i saw him do this i saw him do that let me tell you something a lot of times when you find out something about somebody it ain't for that person it's for you they already know what they're going through so when you find out now the trial becomes your trial because this is the whole key how you going to treat that person now knowing what you know see that's our mistake hallelujah we don't realize that god's love is elected love we don't realize that god's love is chastising and sending you through a trial that's god's love he said who he loves he what rebuke and chase anybody in love with god [Music] is anybody being loved by god hallelujah i know i am here because i get chastened hallelujah but church you look you look at david i ain't gonna be too much longer but you look at david and you look at all the things he went through all the triumphs he had all the victories he had but god was still molding them he went through pains and suffering you think and listen to this a man after god's very own heart was given over to adultery what was that it was a teachable moment that's right god didn't just let david had do that for pleasure no because when he messed up nathan came back with the word of the lord when the lord told david he said if you to ask me i'll give it to you so it was bigger than it was bigger than you just having some pleasure david it was a teachable moment god was trying to show david something but because of what david did now he's got to go through trial and struggle for the rest of his life with the heart of god praise cause this the lord biggest question what we got to do what we have to see did david commit adultery yes talk to me church yes did you take a man's wife yes did he get that man killed yes now this is the question did he still have the heart of god he had to because that's how god chose him but when god chose him adultery was inside of him murder was inside of him sneaky and lied all that was inside of him so god put him in position where he could deal with that we won't have to deal with it no more but from us literally outside we look at somebody's mistakes and we're saying they're not of god when god is the one who allowed it to happen so he can keep him clean that's right god is in control sometimes we just got to sit back and let things live let it play out but you know i got i i think i might have said this to y'all one time before my oldest girl she's married now and before she got married i was about to act the food because i ain't know the young man and i was like this ain't going down you know how we fathers are we think we know everything because we head and all this stuff and blah blah blah but sometimes god don't show you everything sometimes he wants you to just submit to his will in prayer so god gave me a new ministry hallelujah dealing with my oldest girl you know it was kind of hard but i finally got it and brothers i want to spread this ministry around to you it's very easy even some of the sisters but this ministry we all can adapt to is one of the best since i've been a christian one of the best elements of ministry i've ever experienced in this new ministry brother scott took me to a whole nother level and this new ministry is called the shut your mouth ministry and that's what god told me shut your mouth i got it first of all he started with me he said hey didn't you dedicate her to me i was like yes lord he said why are you trying to take him back you dedicated to me you go pray and i'll take care of everything else shut your mouth but you know that's hard for a daddy especially when you're looking at something and it ain't going the way you think it ought to go y'all father y'all know we want something for our daughters we want a young man message believer with a garment on with the word on and all that stuff he come riding out the sunset it don't happen like that all the time it may happen for some brothers but it don't happen like that all the time why because god is in the growing business we have to grow hallelujah now they said as a father you let your daughter go i didn't get any kind of hula holiday but what i'm saying is sometimes you have to step back in prayer and pray and let god orchestrate amen because as long as we're here god is going to be giving us teachable moments that's right and david he had a teachable moment hallelujah luke church he took another man's wife had the man killed had a baby by the woman all these things with the heart of god now that and that's the power hard for us to swallow because we look at it and say that couldn't be no he cut the bed oh he could have been now did the bible change or did he say when he chose david he chose a man with his very own heart a man after my very own heart so when he was doing that he still had those same desires for god right but there were things in his life god had to deal with in that stage and once he swiped it off he never had to deal with it again amen praise the lord church jesus we might well be honest as christians even with the holy ghost god has done things in our lives since we've been saved hallelujah right i'm telling my fees that we can't take to heaven i'm telling my fees that shouldn't even walk through the doors in this church but god being the deliverer that he is he delivered us so we can continue to go on hallelujah oh my why so we can die to our ways and grow in christ and you look what comes out of this trial psalms 51 created me a clean heart restore unto me the joy of thy salvation see god had a purpose in all of that hallelujah when all that came forward he dealt with david david never did that again and i'm sure we all can testify we've made mistakes we've done things which were teachable moments and once god delivered hallelujah we were so broken hallelujah see that's the sign of a real believer when you do things hallelujah that that are contrary to the word of god you don't stay there and waddle in it hell yeah but you enter in hallelujah to worship with god with godly sorrow true repentance hallelujah see holy why didn't david ever do that again you know why because he repented when you repent the spirit has to lift up off you hallelujah because repentance brings in the truth of god's word hallelujah and church from that moment once david hallelujah came through that struggle hallelujah him as a king he just got better and better and better the way he ruled his got better and better and better although he had his own personal struggles from the things he did so if we could just see church that we have to die but dying is something beautiful to god yes i'm gonna close this up because i don't wanna keep going dying is something beautiful to god because like i said with ruth it took death to get her on her journey praise the lord the death of losing a loved one now i know in this whole colvin area you know it's like a bunch of doom and gloom this one died that one died this and that let's not let's let's let's let's not uh uh let's not put this in the wrong perspective satan does not control death god does hallelujah remember he says when i see the blood i'll pass over he didn't say when i see the blood the devil gonna pass over he said i'll pass over so who's the deaf angel who's controlling that amen hallelujah he says nobody can take you out of my hand so we lost loved ones to uh you you might want to say to the covet or to the season you have to say it was the will of god that's right just like people have lost uh loved ones to the flu or to diabetes or to high blood pressure it was just their time and this season is no different hallelujah god is still in control [Applause] [Music] and we're not we're not trying to be insensitive hallelujah but church hallelujah don't let the media hello orchestrate a narrative that ain't true that's right i don't know about you i can't go until it's my time to go and i'm gonna keep confessing it holly all right hallelujah and i know you know we walk around with man so praise god we got to do what we got to do according to the uh caesar and the laws that they they put out and everything but let's make it real clear that law that that mass ain't protecting you the blood of jesus is hallelujah hallelujah the blood of jesus is protecting us church when you did like the bible saying i'm closing the bible the bible says the wisdom of man is foolishness to god that's right hallelujah and the wisdom of god is foolishness to me now let's just take i can't say this word my daughter laughs at me social distasting i can't say it but social discs they should say it like that right distance social distance right let's just take that what is it six feet gotta be six feet right let's see six feet now me and brother one in line but one six feet right there i'm behind but one keep your discs at six feet now i'm next in line what am i gonna do i'm gonna walk in one six feet if he left behind the germs it's all over me right so what good is the six feet if i'm walking in the wisdom of man is foolishness to god and if you behind me when i walk up you're walking in my contaminated six-feet church there is no hope or salvation hallelujah in the field that may have dished out our hope relies in christ in here we live and move and have our being six feet i'll be laughing at that stuff all right make sure you social dancing stay but stay away six feet this and that if i walk in your six feet his disease is right there if if it's like they say it is oh wear your mask with your gloves don't touch everything if if you've been walking around if you've been walking around and covered all day every time you touch that mask you get covered on your hands why why are you saying this because i want you to see that your safety is in christ you say well i just got i put some gloves on well how you take the gloves off one way or another you're coming in contact with what they say exists right but how far are you going to carry it up here this is the power this is the power zone right here this is where things come alive in the mind you allow it to live in the mind you allow it to grow in the mind see to me honey so this don't mean nothing it's just just some marks they want to put down on the ground so that's a nice little design right there don't mean nothing to me because what am i doing i'm walking hallelujah in the grace of jesus christ hallelujah now don't get me wrong y'all y'all go see me hey i'm like some of y'all i got one of them big dog vader masks too i'm gonna walk around and walk around my mask oh you know because it's the proper protocol hallelujah but my faith ain't in that my faith is in jesus name hallelujah put your faith in jesus holy and you know what you know while we hear brother one what gets me is for the people who don't want to come to church because we're all trying to be protected and that's the crazy part right there you say i ain't coming because they weren't mad we should have enough faith well if you got the faith come show us how to operate in don't stay away from us come show us how to operate in this is the devil fooling people really they want to stay home let's just be honest any kind of reason to get away that's what happens holly and you know hallelujah you all are blessed that you're still able to come there's something on the inside that says there's church tonight i want to be in the building hello there's church tonight i want to be in the building hallelujah because some of my friends holly i know a church where they uh uh uh the government put out orders where you couldn't go couldn't go out the building could go to church had to do all streaming so when that ordinance lifted they were voting to go back to church and the people said no let's stay home and stream what happened they got conditioned they like watching brother diggs on the monitor the flat stream on the wall they pull out and rotate but also they got a remote where they can fast forward brothers [Music] i don't like what you talking about oh that looked a little hungry let me go make a sandwich see people love to be in control that's why a lot of people don't have the holy ghost because they still want to be in control when you get the holy ghost god is in control come musicians come musicians i'm close but we see the lord precious precious is death in the sight of the lord it's a beautiful thing god when god sees us dying to our own will our own way do you realize jesus had to do that he got to a place where he was headed to the cross and he was feeling so much pain and so much agony so much struggle churches one part of the scripture say he fell down hallelujah somebody had to come help him told the cross but church there was a there was a a scripture where he says lord if it be thy will take this cup away from me see the pain and agony in his flesh he couldn't bear it no more but then he said nevertheless not my will thy will be done amen and see and that's when the truth of who christ was came out hallelujah well he being god of glory hallelujah him being the alpha and omega could lay all that down and take on your pain take on your suffering take on your lies your cheating your stealing all the sins that you ever committed christ took him on his shoulders he became deaf so that we could experience life how sweet and beautiful it is let's pray lord god father we love you tonight and we thank you for the measure of grace that you've placed in our lives lord lord we pray that tonight something was said to help your people on to know lord that our sufferings our trials and tribulation they're not by chance or coincidence lord it's the leading from the most high god lord that you put us in position to unlock the mystery of who we are and it takes struggling trial and lord you say it in the word remember the lord lily how it grows and how it goes through all that it goes just to get above all the dirt and muck and mary clay [Music] and in the presence of his son the real radius of what it is comes out after it goes through a struggle for those of us that may be struggling let us lay it all at your feet lord and most of all give you praise and give you thanks for being able to come through it lord just help us to follow your lead bless this church pastor saints of god in the name of jesus christ we pray church amen [Music] yes [Music] oh yes the blood like is misread from bed to death praise the lord amen i want to thank the lord for his word tonight praise the lord [Music] you know i was sitting there and just listening to the preaching of the word a few things going through my mind and i'm saying to myself you know we we are living in such a time i think we write in uh malachi chapter four the bible says before the great and the dreadful day now we are having the the great and dreadful date is right before us we are going through a dreadful situation but god has sent us an elijah god has sent us an elijah that has that has given us a message and i'm sitting there then and uh but this re reading his strength hurt and you know pressured is the death of the saints and uh to realize that uh berscat and his family just laid their loved one to to to rest and and he's talking about now meaning he's talking about rule thing and and he's talking about different situation and uh you know that you know the different ones are dealing with and and and i'm just saying how the holy spirit can come in its simplicity i never even met brother dicks this evening until i came to the church we just spoke on the phone and and and and then when we get to the office we're just touching base with one another we have a little time to fellowship and life and and to see that god will place on our brother's heart to come and speak to us to come and speak to us in this way i mean in social simplicity praise the lord in such a simplistic and we just came through a series of speaking about knowing no man after the flesh and is that mystery of death i mean it's just it's just the lord and you know what god don't wait for the crowd to show up he looked for the hearts amen the house that are ready to receive i think we all can be identified with the word that was preached tonight praise the lord if we just [Music] look at all of the things that the lord has brought us through the different things that have been happening in our lives we can all identify to the word that was preached tonight praise the lord pressures in the sight of the lord is the death of his children brother branham said death is just it's just a medium to take us from one place to another what a spiritual death or physical death it's just a vehicle to take us from one place to another [Music] i won't come behind the preacher to preach tonight but what i want us to do is to just worship the lord tonight [Music] as we just think on on the word and think think about you know the way the lord is dealing with us let's just worship the lord let's just water the world with praise tonight praise the lord we thank the lord brother god bless you for pouring out your heart on a cold evening tonight and and you know god speaking to us you know church we we are beyond the emotion we are beyond the emotion it does not take the emotion to see god moving praise the lord god is becoming so personal to his people that if the preacher don't even move and he just stay in one place and preach the word the hearts that are ready to receive we hear from god he the half ears let him hear what the spirit says unto the church amen [Music] you are my strength when i am weak you are the treasure that i see you are mine [Music] all [Music] lord to give up i'll be a fool you are mine [Music] oh jesus god worthy is your name [Music] jesus of god worthy is you're me taking my sin my cross my again i bless your name you [Music] me [Music] oh jesus

every situation god gave me bless the consolation that my dryer only comes to make me stronger yes i'll learn to trust in jesus [Music] [Music] one more time [Music] god is [Music] you know why we've been going through uh the time of uh uh the chaining uh proud of chain that we've been having all through the week and we still going through i was thinking during the week you know i was playing this testimony sitting in my car of different believers suffering and i said sometimes you think about that and you you feel sorry for those believers that are imprisoned and it looks like they are suffering and and you know and the holy spirit started ministering to meaning and actually reminding me to keep praying for those that are suffering because of the gospel but really you know whatever we are going through you are not suffering you are just partaking you are partaking of christ's suffering he is making you to partake [Music] he has called you he has invited you for you to partake
