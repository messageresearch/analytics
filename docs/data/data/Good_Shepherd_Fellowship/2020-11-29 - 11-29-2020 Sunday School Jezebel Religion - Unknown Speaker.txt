to make a double line here yes you can make a double line right here be [Music] fine that's good now turn this other way brother turn around this way I'm going to bring the people right through here now some of you get on this side of me right in here if you stand around this side that's it now to the audience you see these fine men here they're a man who will stand right up here and stand for this same gospel that I'm preaching they come here because they believe in it I you are be proud of your pastor they'll show himself on this platform here hard strong preaching these are men who have Revelation who know that there not anything against a man sometimes we get hooked into systems that makes us them systems is what we're against not the man God's servant now if we had discernment forever walk here how long you think I'd be here I collapsed when I got about after about six five or six 10 a little more maybe half quarter of the line I'd be gone the rest of them would be pray ball we can't do that if but you you don't have to have that you know what's your trouble you know what you've done now confess your sins if any of you out there has one Speck of doubt in your heart take it out right now and tell God to forgive you if you're not right with God tell God to forgive you if you don't and you're not right with God it ain't going to do you one bit of good to come through here you're just wasting your time that is true is that right brother that's look here here stands brother kid here I like tore the cars off my car to get to him about a year or two ago that he was dying with cancer go to die that day his wife told me said hurry he said he's dying now when he got there the Lord healed him here he's still standing I think he's gained so much weight and everything an old veteran back under that the kind of man I was talking about years ago that preached and laid right on to that word and the people laughed at him and him and his wife walking railroad tracks and everything else and we up in the mountains and coal mines and run out and throw it in jail everything else that's the man who fought to win the prize that's the kind Hallelujah now Brethren I say to you you probably would not have the spirit of discernment that don't have to be see that ain't necessary the first thing you're a man of the word you're far better more preachers than I am because I'm I'm not much of a Preacher but I but you you're anointed any man that's called to preach the gospel is called to heal the sick the general orders is going to all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature he that believeth in his baptized shall be saved these signs shall follow them and believe if they lay their hands on the sick so forth they shall recover amen if you're called to be a minister you're called to pray for the sick and the reason I do this is so this audience that they might see that they don't have to wait to some special person or Roberts Tommy Hicks Tommy OS myself somebody comes by for healing service I want them to see that you are man of God see you're a man just as much right to lay hands on any of them as as I or anybody else after all other than you all know us as ministers it's their own faith in God that does the work is that rightl we just offer a prayer part now you say brother Brandon is the spirit of the Holy Spirit there with you certainly yes sir now to you in the a in the line there if you believe with all your heart that God's going to heal you raise up your hand I'll accept now come here let this let this lady come here this I don't know you have never ever seen if the holy spirit will tell me so my brethren here in the presence here like this so they're all standing here around me and not only that my brethren are here and my lord is here it's their lord too now if he will tell me something wrong with you whatever is wrong with you you know where it's the truth or not I want them I want the audience I want the people out there to see that the Holy Spirit you're at the platform to give discernment but that don't heal anyone but if he will tell tell me something about you that you know I know nothing about just like it was the woman at the well not the same kind of case but I mean a man and woman meeting for the first time Jesus kind of a middle-aged man and this woman probably is a young woman maybe like you and if he would could tell me what you're here for your trouble would you believe that it have to be his spirit that would do it you brother believe that that the same Lord Jesus stand here you audience believe the same thing would you in the prayer line believe the same thing and know that these men would I call them up here if I thought they wasn't after preaching like this and saying the things I have and I call man up here that wasn't worthy I wouldn't do that I'd be defeating the very thing I was fighting about see I believe them I believe they're a man of God now see if the Holy Spirit stands close just to speak with you I'm trying you say what are you doing brother brand the same thing Jesus done the woman said bring me a drink you just try and talk to her man to find out what her trouble [Music] was your trouble is nervousness that's what you're suffering with if that's right raise up your hand now she sure doesn't look it does she bre she doesn't but that's what her trouble is she's been that way a long [Music] time always crossing your Bridges before you get to them so forth that's true it's your makeup just made that way always imagine something's fixing to happen doesn't sometimes the devil tells you there's nothing to it you backslid you're cross the line I'm not reading your mind but I'm reading what I'm knowing what he's talked to you about because to see what's crossed your mind now Jesus perceived their thoughts is that right well that's what's happening right now is that right here let me tell you something that you might know you're really standing here for somebody else that's right that's the thing you couldn't catch it till land now if the Lord will reveal to me what you're standing here far for somebody else would you believe me to be his Prophet it's for your mother yes you believe God can tell me what her trouble is yes well she has heart trouble high blood pressure yes Gall ston complications that's right isn't it the Lord see now that's the Holy Spirit isn't it now there's something here on me and on these Breen see something here now the Holy Spirit now you believe you as we pass through the line let us all bow our heads while we pray for these people now Heavenly Father we're going to lay hands on these people and I'm praying for them now here's your Royal servant standing here and we're all going to lay hands on the sick because you said do it we're going to do it in the name of Jesus Christ May the people not just drag through but may they come through being healed through Jesus Christ's name amen the
