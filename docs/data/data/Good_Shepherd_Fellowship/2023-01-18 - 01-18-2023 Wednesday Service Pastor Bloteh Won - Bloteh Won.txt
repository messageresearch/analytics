the Lord we will first take the the praise report a brother area in Sister Naisha praising God for their baby medical report there's there's a knee there they were praying for and trusting the Lord and and after seeing the doctor today it proved that God answered prayer amen so we want to thank the Lord for there and praise the Lord amen and uh sister Annette also act so the prayer request but first thanking God for saving her from what could have been there a federal accident and and she's experiencing pains it looks like the the the shock from the accident is beginning to to reflect through her body so she's feeling pains in her body and she want us to to remember her in prayer tonight last Wednesday after service uh on our way home from church the family was going in and there was uh a gentleman that was still getting my wife and while they were driving and and then all of a sudden he left from behind them and hit the van in the front and it was it was a little bit terrifying for the children and all those that were driving but we thank God that uh nothing worse than that happened amen and uh so we want to thank God for keeping them safe the kids are a little bit under the weather and their Grandmom is not well so that's why they are in for service tonight we want to remember them and uh [Music] we want to pray for them many of you saw the text that came true or brother Max mom passing we want to remember the family continuously in prayer there is a dear sister from Liberia that is dealing with pains in her body that seems to be a little bit overwhelming for her the cost is not it's not fully known uh just from the increasing of the pain is almost like a kind of fall paralyzed State she's beginning to feel a little bit of sensation in her body Sister Evelyn and text me in uh today with the with the increasing pains that she's experiencing in her body so we want to remember her in prayer that's a prayer request here my neighbor has a prayer request for her niece Angie she had a snowmobi accident that was pretty bad we want to pray for that too another neighbor is in the hospital appreciate your prayers too and I would guess I guess this is from Sister Naomi yeah okay okay so we want to take those knees and and that's another prayer request here for the dear sister that came through the service on Sunday uh for some reason I think the deacons were taking care of something in they came into service so we didn't get her name to to greet her properly but then after the service uh brother Ben stopped them to talk with them and and we also had a privilege to talk to her she asked that we pray for her she's finding her way back to the Lord uh after believing the message and a lot of different struggle she's getting back to the Lord and just with our prayer request there's uh that is something that is becoming common uh and we expect to see more of that we expect to see more there are many people that have sometimes people will make some ugly choices thinking that if they do those things God we keep them out of the Kingdom or if they do those things it is done it is finished with them but all you are doing is that you will just be building regret for yourself because when God get a hold of your heart it is not by your choice and not by your choice will he let go it is by his choice so we're beginning to see a trench of that many people finding their way back to the Lord and uh so this dear sister want us to pray for her that God will will be able to help her that she can be able to find that peace Within and so we want to just take those knees to the Lord tonight while the musician plays Softly Jesus [Music] lie more of God Worthy is your name [Music] Jesus [Music] Worthy is your name You Are

atmosphere that is here amen praise the Lord and the hymn of Mind Beauty is all the colors and shape but with God is the atmosphere praise the Lord tonight for this prayer meeting I want to I want to take uh thank you a couple of few times since last Wednesday we we've been reading Saint John chapter 9. I want to take a quote that I came across I was listening to to uh the message the Messiah and uh so let's let's go back to Saint John chapter 9. I don't know why the the holy spirit is keeping us there but I show he has a reason amen but there is there is just uh this this uh there's a quote yet I'm going to read a testimony actually and uh and to me it's a little close to what is happening here in Saint John chapter nine so for a scriptural reading let's read um verse 1. and as Jesus passed by he saw a man which was blind from his birth and his disciple asked him saying master who did Sin this man or his parents that he was born blind and Jesus answered neither have this man seen known his parents but they are the works of God should be made manifest in him praise the Lord the Lord bless you you can have your seat so we will go right right into this now and I would just read a few quotes and then we will we will call it up for the service tonight so you can be able to get home before the weather coming upon us now Birdman is talking about a testimony year he was preaching over in in Shreveport and just before he got into his message he says this little woman standing there her baby died over in Germany her husband was a captain and they call up long distance about five times through a day and night to ask me to come calling from Germany said they know that God would raise the little baby up I said let me go pray and I went and prayed pray that afternoon that night and I will show you whether the doctor believed or not when she did already give the doctor a book to read I believe it's called Prophet this is South Africa something like that she said God will raise the baby up the little mother said God will raise the baby up and and the baby have been dead before uh before they know it about four or five hours and saw the God the Father were down to the base because he's a military man where he was and the baby have been dead died in the night and saw the doctor said all right tell you what we would do said we will slip over and turn the oxygen the oxygen back on so they have the baby on the ventilator if we were if we would think about it that way and uh and he let the baby lay there for two days with the oxygen turned on waiting and I was over here praying they was going to fly me in a cross in a jet I could live here with an army Jack and be back the same day to Germany and one morning praise the Lord amen I think I did something here my hands might have moved and one morning about daylight I got up and the wife went out of the room she went out of the room are they just waking up and are laying there a little bit directly I heard something coming into the room and I look there was something moving in the room and I jumped up and I said Lord What would what will you have yourself known he said don't rebuke that that's the hand of the Lord see so I got her on the phone I said no God has called your baby and so when she come over to see us left her at the house when when I left yesterday she said what was it brother Brennan my weakness of faith praise the Lord now this is the place that caught me in Saint John chapter 9. what was it praise the Lord why was he born blind is it because of his mother saying or his father sin or in his father line or his mother line this woman is asking brother Brandon what was it is it because my faith was weak amen my weakness of faith I said you got great faith you pray for your baby you and your husband head on God to raise your baby and he refused to do it because he knows what best till you love him praise the Lord amen it's hard to see that as a great faith praise the Lord I know if the courts will have gone in the other way then brother Brandon prayed and the baby race or we always shall Hallelujah but it looks like the court goes another way that you don't expect so you are still dealing with the shark how can that be great faith how can that be great faith praise the Lord I love it like that when you are dealing with the shock of the word you have great faith you pray for your baby you and your husband head on to it God to raise your baby he refused to do it because he knows who are best and still you love him that's real Faith so I talked a few calls tonight on real faith that we will read for this prayer meeting amen he says that's real faith that is real faith when you can't explain it praise the Lord when it's not in your favor but yet it holds you on praise the Lord it makes you to realize that you are not the one holding on to faith is faith that is holding on to you that's real Faith anybody when mountains are moving and things can have faith but let it go backwards one time and see how it works that's when you prove whether you got faith or not praise the Lord that's when we prove whether we got faith or net every Psalm that comes to God must be testing and tried of God so remember our trials work at patients and patient work at Hope and so forth so we just hold on to God whether he bless us or not we are right there to believe him anyhow can we say Amen tonight I want to help you recover from your shock amen we just hold on to God whether he bless us or not we are right there to believe him cause he promised it and to see how it does amen praise the Lord so brother bam says that's real faith when situation comes backward and we can stay hold on to our testimony praise the Lord amen he never changed their position to stay flat from Germany and come to see brother Brennan praise the Lord they never wrote an article in the newspaper and say he's a false prophet right praise the Lord they were believing for him to pray and get an answer from God and he prayed and he got an answer and told them that the Lord rebuked me from taking their uh uh or the Lord told me not to rebuke death off of the child because the Lord Knows Best praise the Lord so I believe that is the same situation here in the life of this young boy the Lord knew best it was not because the parents were Sinners Jesus allotted it to that the work of God should be made manifest are we together and we are living in such a time where we will trust the Lord that God will help us there are more of these real faith will be seen amen praise the Lord because I believe where we have the word a lot of the time has been intellectual faith right amen well we reason things out in our mind and sometimes it's far from the reality but faith never tells lies brother Brown says here also how the angel came to me and he says now the devil don't care how much you kick and stream he just said right there he knows what he's doing but he knows how much Authority he got he hasn't got none when real faith is standing there amen his trip of everything he's got but you have to know that you have to be revealed to you praise the Lord they have to be revealed to you fundamental Foundation of Faith he also says now we hear so many people well if I only have faith he says faith is or faith is unconscious thing you're real faith you are unconscious of it you don't know that you have he says uh you don't know that the faith you have got is an unconscious matter with you could you imagine Jesus Jesus questioning whether he have faith or not to stop the wind or steal the wave or have faith enough to raise Lazaro up he never questioned his faith the first thing before we can have faith we got to have some Foundation of faith praise the Lord and we have to realize that Faith don't rest on our emotion praise the Lord amen Faith read solidly on God's promised word he said we have got to have some foundation for Faith there's got to be something behind it let's take another one tonight from expectation you know some people has great big Faith like that he's measuring it they can be healed in a moment some have that much they can be healed in a week some have muscle see fat Faith takes them a long time but just follow it it's genuine praise the Lord it will bring you to the light just hold on to it and keep moving it will bring you out just keep holding on to that faith it will bring you true if is a real mustache you know must I see don't mix with nothing is genuine praise the Lord you can miss God in Spanish and so forth but you can Miss Mustard see with nothing Master C stays Master C and when real Faith takes a hole in the heart is not intellectual it's not reason normal is real is the spirit of God witnessing through you God's word is truth I stay right with it yes sir and that brings the result amen what we need today is some real Journey of Faith into action we need real Faith a man who dared to put God's word to their heart and apply it to themselves you try to apply it uh to the generation gone by the Bible says that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he's forever God he never fails he's the same in principle he's the same in power he is the same tonight that he was when he walked on the banks of Galilee and appear and appear nightly on this pulpit and prove himself alive from the dead what I was studying at I I felt blessed reading that and and the way that I felt blessed of it is that I believe that there seemed Jesus that walks the the banks of Galilee appeared every time on this Pulpit how through his word praise the lord we must be able to see him in his word because he's the same yesterday today and forever praise the Lord Hallelujah you don't have to take any history about it is it is right now present time facts that we see it amen I'll take another one there's a real almighty God that's a real Holy Spirit there's a real Faith there was once delivered to the sins they are seeing faith that was delivered to the sin will operate through God's holy word praise the Lord it has one China to operate he must come back through the word amen that's the way it did then and that's the way it will do now praise the Lord Hallelujah okay I have a few more minutes uh okay let me take this one and then I will just uh show you something and then we will close until something comes down it is this is from belief from the heart until something comes down on the inside of you that's just said it's so and there's all there is to it there is not enough demons out of Tom and whoever shake it from you is something on the inside called the half there is where real Faith find is resting place intellectual we try to reason about it now let's just be reasonable but faith has no reasoning is is just has one thing and that's God's word it has one thing that is God's word is right all this word the soul set its feet and rest internally right there for God says so praise the Lord let's turn to us chapter 17. and then we will close the prayer meeting tonight ask chapter 17. as chapter 17. verse 2 and and Paul as his mother was went in unto them in three Sabbath days reason with them out of the scripture I want for you to notice that Paul passing through and amphipolis he went into the synagoguese this is in thessalonica and he spent three Sabbath reasoning with them out of the scriptures praise the Lord opening and alleging that Christ must need have suffered in raising again from the dead and that this Jesus whom I preach unto you is Christ and some of them believe and consulted with Paul and Silas and all the devote Greeks a great multitude and all the chief women not a few but the Jews which believe that move with envy and talk unto them setting low fellows of a base sought and gather a company and said all the city on an uproar assaulting the house of Jason and sought to bring them out to the people and when they found them that they drew Jason and setting brethrens onto the ruler of the city crying Beast that have turned the word upside down I come hither also what a testimony amen water testimony what an accusation to accuse them that they turned the word upside down praise the Lord wherever they have that turn the word upside down is able to turn our word upside down amen they were holding to the Revere word of the owl they were holding to the truth of that day so it turned the word upside down is able to turn your word upside down now so you read this and uh and we can go on here and uh whom Jason verse 7 receive and these also do contrary to the decreed of Caesar saying that there is another king one Jesus and and they troubled the people and the ruler of the city when they heard these things and when they have taken uh security of Jason and and all of the other they let them go and the brethrough is immediately sent Away Paul and Silas By Night onto barium ooh coming here went into the synagas of the Jews these were more noble than those in thessalonica aimed that they received the word with all Readiness of mine and search the scripture daily whether those things were truth praise the Lord I want to end right there now I was I was looking at this and what I saw here is that I saw uh two group of people here praise the Lord Paul down here over in in thessalonica went down there into the synagoguese and the scripture says three Sabbath day reason with them on the scripture praise the Lord amen he went back and forth taking the Old Testament and what was happening in their day you have to realize that the New Testament was not written at a time so he have to show them what is happening today let's go back to Isaiah let's see it amen let's go back over to the Psalms when when David said my God my god what have thou forsaken me that was the same thing they said Jesus did on the cross so he was going back and forth whatever that was happening he was trying to show them in the scripture three Saba Bay he reasoned with him praise the Lord and what what was the result that it brought we know there were some that believe and and few of them that believe there but we see that a broad and uproarth and uh and which of course they testify these men that have turned the word upside down has come into our place that they have to send Paul and Salas away they have to have them Escape by night but then when it came down over here to this other City to these Berry and brethrens they realized that as we see in the scripture these other men had different attitude to the word praise the Lord these people on this other side was reasoning with courts going back this is in the synagoguese that was where the Pharisees sat I mean they did a lot of argument with courts the scripture says that but Moses also said this and then and the prophet also said this free Sabbath Paul had to go back and forth reasoning with these people but when he came to this city this man the Bible says there were more Noble than those intestinal the Bible gave them such an honorable place and the reason why the Bibles gave them an honorable place is there them they listened to what they heard they receive it the Bible said with a red mind and not only that they took what they heard back to the word praise the Lord they received a word with a red mind and they say the scripture daily whether those things were so right they were not just satisfied with what they were hearing a faith a faith the resting place of faith is the word then whatever we are hearing we must take it back to the word it is not just enough to give us a good feeling amen thank you so much that the holy spirit says these men are honorable God says we are honorable when we can take what we hear back to the word it's a great honor to God not not to be satisfied my pastor say or my church say no that's how we get real faith we take whatever we hear in the world back or whatever we hear preach back to the word because the word is the foundation for faith we can have some a situation we we can be caught up in some sensation and and some feeling you know that you know God Did It Before yeah you know and and we can go through all the testimonies in a different things but that genuine feeling in your heart have to be resting holy and solid on God's word praise the Lord I have a feeling in my heart that uh uh uh uh those people that have that situation where not just people that were caught up you know because they were seeing miracles in brother Branham Ministry right because it's hard to to believe a person brother Branham says that's one of the difficult things that you know God have ever had for one motor to believe in another mortar praise the Lord so when the ones that we trust and we believe has to fail they break our confidence so I believe that the the harder place where they rested their faith on God's word concerning brother Brandon Ministry praise the Lord now this is not just uh uh uh you know this is not just uh a child that was sick you know after reading a Prophet this is South Africa and year and about the little boy that was raised in Finland and now you ever see they have a child that is in it it's easier to hear those things and uh you know uh rejoice in it and testify but when when when such a situation come home to you how do we deal with it and that situation was home to them praise the Lord barbam said she even took my book the prophet visits South Africa give it to the doctors say read this book The testimony in this book will happen before your eyes but when God Speak there was something in them to rest their case on God's word praise the Lord so you see it as we as we as we uh uh you know listening to to the message you take notes you go home and study your notes or you're even in your own uh private devotion you read things in the message or hear things in the message you know it's it's good to pause and and make sure that those things are building solid foundation for your faith praise the Lord because we we will need real faith for the hour that we are living in and not just some sensation we will need real faith praise the Lord so that's my comparison of Saint John chapter 9 you know when when when I heard that I was I was I was listening to that in the morning getting ready to get out of the housing and and and and and and I heard that it just it just caught my mind but a band of so she said but Brandon why was there was it because my faith was weak the prophet said no you are having real faith amen don't blame yourself don't blame yourself see what is your reaction after you have received God's will for your situation what is your reaction let's buy our house together tonight foreign father we just want to thank you thank you Father for just this little time of praying Lord and to be able to share from your word we can read these things in the scripture father Lord and it is good to see it in the light of the message it is good to see it father around our life Lord God precious Lord in many of us will go father like brother Branham says we can rejoice in the moving of the mountain but when things return back to God what is our

they receive your word and faith comes by hearing of the word receiving the word your Prophet said acting upon the word dear Lord help us to God help us father help us Lord Jesus that we can take things back to the word that we cannot be a strange to our Bible we cannot be estranged to the message we can just make up things in our mind but we can take it back to the word [Music] foreign such an hour that we are living in and all the things that is that is that is coming Upon Us Lord help us help us so father it is Honorable to you oh God when we can take things back to your word it's pleasing to you not just to be arguing Lord or be wandering a double-minded man is unstable in his ways [Music] foreign [Music] talk about the different Measure of Faith some have faith to be able to receive it right there and then he says some have faith they can receive it after the weak and but some will hold on and hold on for a longer time but let's keep holding on let's keep holding on [Music] foreign father you know where we are Lord you know where each and every one of us are you know where father God our heart is Lord you know the reasoning in our mind so God father Lord Jesus

be able to do it unless we are searching the scripture unless we are reading the scripture unless we are listening to the voice of God in our day precious Lord father there is no way we can grow in
