musicians let's go right to the world we want to talk on his abiding presence tonight you see what i sing we hear about amen because that's what we need exeter chapter 33 exodus chapter 33 amen but jordan i would keep that photo for another time i uh there were a few things i needed to put together i couldn't do it so i would just go into this i will use that another time and i hope that i don't take long before i lose the thought of it exodus chapter 33 exodus chapter 33 let's read from verse and moses said to the lord see thou shared unto me bring up this people and thou have not let me know whom thou will send with me praise the lord so it give us a thought here that moses is looking for he's looking for an abiding presence let's read yet yet thou have said i know thee by name and thou have also found grace in my sight now therefore i pray thee if i have find grace in that sight show me now thy way that i may know thee that i may find grace in that side and consider that this nation is thy people and he said my presence shall go with thee and i will give the rest is that what we need tonight amen he says come unto me all you deliver and have heavy leading and i will give you rest let's pray together heavenly father in the name of the lord jesus christ we just want to commit ourselves in your hands now lord we pray that father something of internal value will be shared tonight lord the the assurance lord father that the believers need oh god yeah your seven moses lord he saw the red sea open he walked through a father he saw the plagues falling to god he could call for flies but he's at this place needing an assurance of your abiding presence father and that's what we need in this hour so we just ask now come and bless the word father lord and as we uh speak tonight give us utterance lord jesus and we also father god pray for many of the saints that are following us tonight also we love you we appreciate you god in jesus wonderful name we pray amen amen the lord bless you you may have your seed and if you just we just continue to read a little bit uh it's it's such a beautiful beautiful reading that is is hard to get away from amen or maybe i can have you read the rest of it and he said unto him if that presence go net with me carry us not up hands if you're present don't go with us if your presence is not here with us this evening let us just go home amen paul says let's eat be married for tomorrow we die if that is just order but life let's just eat mary tomorrow we die there is i mean there is nothing to think about but that is now all for the believer amen praise the lord that is not all for the believer everything that the believer is doing he or she is doing it for their future and our future is not in this world the rapture is our future praise the lord the way people plan for their future and get degree for their future we want more of god for our future praise the lord because we have a rapture to go in we have a millennium and we have eternity praise the lord amen glory be to god uh we have eternity so tonight we want to continue uh on our thought from sunny we were talking about uh in his presence his fullness of joy and what we were trying to do is to to uh look through the word and see how his presence you know as the scripture talks about it and yeri's year is uh uh moses year just like we said he went through the red sea and and uh you know he he called the flies the fleas and darkness and uh and even death in the land and all of those things but yet he came to a place he needed an assurance of his abiding presence he says if you will not go with us then i don't want to take the next step praise the lord i don't want to take the next step and just like we were saying on sunday that's the place where the believer need to come because we have to realize we are not dealing with an idol that we come and worship in church and we leave here and we go home praise the lord amen oh it would be so easy to do amen shut the door cut the light off your eyes you said can i see so when you make it dark it works for him it would just be so easy praise the lord and you see that's the reason why all of those other religions has to come up with rules and regulations and things to discipline uh their people because the god the worship don't go with them amen the only way they can contact the god they worship is when they get in line with their rituals that's the only time they are in contact with the god that they worship out of that they are free their god you know he don't know much about what they are doing until they get to that place but it's not the one that we worship amen praise the lord and uh so uh uh and if if ev ever the time as we get as we get close to the rapture the changing of our body going home and getting away from here it is it is how much conscious we want to be of his presence praise the lord is how much conscious we want to be of his presence you know i was i was meditating on that today and i was just thinking about men that god has called to a higher office look at the lives of the prophets of all the people that god has called to sacred office the life on this earth was not what you would call fun your life on this earth was it was not what you were called fun the men that were going in the presence you know the other day i was i was looking i was listening to uh rebecca smith uh a testimony brother branham's daughter and uh and in in her testimony she showed brother branham office you know brother brown was talking about over robert and uh you know and went to overall office and all of that i wish i could be able to get that picture and show it to you when when i saw it i i just sunk in my stomach it is this small mobile home very small mobile home i just i felt so i it just sunk in my stomach because i mean you hear it on tape you read it in in the message but you don't have a picture of what it was the bed that brother branham was lying on before he went behind the curtain of time was not a king-sized bed it was not a king-sized bed praise the lord and you can see why god will have to make their life that way i was just thinking about that today as i was driving i was just thinking about that i see you look through the scriptures like like even men men like moses moses grew up in pharaoh palace moses knew better life than many of us we had some of us have never even visited the governor house yet moses was in the king palace the king of egypt that's where he grew up he was served as a prince but because he was born for a higher calling god had to strip him of all of that he could never find joy in that and let me let me give you good news tonight the bride of jesus christ she's born for a higher calling she's born for a higher calling glamour is not going to be your prosperity god wants you to prosper in his word prosper in health just as your soul prospered and the only reason why you need good health is to be able to live a good christian life that's the only reason why i think i don't know but it's gotta am i wrong oh praise the lord amen glory be to god that's the only reason why i would think we need good health but yeah you see even some of those men paul he had an eyes problem two minutes he had a stomach problem and even some of those men i was i was that was in this higher calling that had a closer walk with god they had they had i mean they could go in the presence of god man like isaiah get in the presence of god the glory of god came down he i mean he was he was transported he was he was off his feet on earth but yet off his feet in the presence of the angels amen and when it came to the last moment his last movement on this earth they had to saw him asunder they had to saw him asunder cut his body into two paths now i'm not trying to scare you tonight praise the lord amen we have the word of god we don't have to preach you know fearful gospel for god i'm not giving up the spirit of fear amen but i'm trying to call you to consciousness barbarian says whatever you do he says don't miss it because only perfect love for god will enter there amen so uh uh i will talk about about impressions and uh uh and sunday we were saying that uh the presence of god is is is associated with his name and his word because he's an only present god amen is every word we know that and uh but you know it's it's just like you know you you leave the service and you and you start meditating upon the word and sometimes it comes clearer to you even the even the preacher i don't have full authority over this world i'm just only a china and sometimes i preached him i go home and then because before it became it even struck me and i said wow praise the lord and i was thinking about this that god in the old testament would give the people a place where he will meet the worshipers i mentioned that on sunday and he says that's the place where i will put my name that's the only place where he said he will meet the worshipers that was the provided place of worship praise the lord and we we we can even see in the old testament tabernacle how the how the holiest of holiness was preserved in so much that when the priest is going behind there he have to he i mean he has to be dressed right he has to walk right he has to be anointed right because one thing out of other god will not take it you have to remember now when we talk about the sacrifices there is nothing of the flesh god don't take nothing of this flesh amen so in all the preparation of the priests was not the cream he used on the on his body or the spray or the the deodorant he used under his arm no all his preparation was to prepare his spirit to prepare his mind the emphasis was more on his spirit man not glory in that presence of the lord with no anger no vestation he had to make sure when it was time for sacrifice he confessed his sin and the sin of the people praise the lord and what this age want to give god as a as the presence of god is disco light and people come dressed anyhow with chewing gums in their mouth they come with their soda pop and set it down their coffee cup and and it's just all about them and nothing about god that's that's what this is want to give god and that's what we call the presence of god we just show up to keep our church membership but the age in itself is completely absent why are they absent because they don't have the word with other words you are absent from the presence of god if your desire is not the word if your praise is not the word if your sacrifice is not the word praise the lord amen we'll refuel close to you tonight and we'll let you go but i'm thinking about that and just like i said as a church we are moving in a direction it is not just to get a good salmon to make you feel good it's to find the man of god is to find the leadership of the holy spirit because he's the pastor of this church you see that we come here and mean business with god or we just forget about it are we together even solomon we'll find a time and talk on the book of ecclesiastes but the beautiful thing there is that when he started the book he first started with the natural life of man when he came to the end of the book then he stopped he started going to things that are very important i thought on that book as i read through it and said it through it i says i need to preach a semmel out of this book and i will tie to it the only thing worth living for i don't know what kind of title i give it but uh it's the things that you do for god that will last as he started getting to the end of the book he said it's better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of feasts he says because that is the end of every man wash your fourth step as you go into the house of the lord consider your youth he started talking about things that matters well we're not in the book of ecclesiastes tonight abiding presence brother graham said in supernatural he says abiding that's one of my scriptures i will read tonight if ye abide in me my word abide in you then ask what you will it will be given to you amen now you can see jesus was not joking he made what he said but a requirement for you to have what you asked for the requirement was to abide was to abide praise the lord the requirement to have god in your business the requirement to have god right there to do what you say you think about it this is almighty god that you're just going to give komento or ask him and he sent his angels to do it praise the lord see how serious it is i mean a person that don't even know what they are doing they don't even have a a good grip of sense of what they want to do with their life the church world especially the care master church is just breeding arrogant people people that are arrogant they have no respect for the word of god nor regard for the presence of god they just get arrogant the god of the universe is my father whenever i ask him he will do it whatever he asks you are you doing it that abiding presence asks what you will we talked about the terrible it never took our brother branham to just get there by the snap of his finger it takes discipline church it takes discipline we have to be disciplined in every area of our life every area of our life that's what it takes you think about that priest coming from the presence of god and as soon as he come outside he made that sacrifice as now he steps outside says oh i thank god then go i made it oh you just go take out his clothes and chunk it down and take her everything mary thank god i made it today my goodness praise the lord oh oh then he's just going about and and living the careless life waiting for the next ceremony when he comes out of that place the way he takes his clothes the way he preserve it when he comes out he's preparing to go back in he lived his life daily thinking about glory in the presence of god praise the lord well tell the minister to church before you start looking for your shoes and your clothes and i don't want to get down that road i just want to give you a little bit thing to think about that's why we get to church late as he comes out of the presence of god he lived dearly thinking preparing himself to go back in what would it be i mean uh uh 10 minutes for him to go by he realized that uh uh his little son came and touched his robe and oil is on it and the people are waiting for him to make sacrifice is that the time that you will be mira will be washing the clothes bring the iron let's press it john why you have to do this don't you know i had to go all in no his spirit has to be right his spirit has to be right even when he's walking to the to the tabernacle with his family they're not arguing in the car because argument just turn your spirit up wash your foot as you go into the house of the lord it's not entering this door it's leaving your house the preparation you make praise lord i don't know who's carrying me there it's not part of my notes somebody should be the one pulling me in this direction glory be to god i'm not guilty of there because i don't have it in my notes let's go ahead abiding if you had abiding me my word about in you then ask what you will it will be giving to you and that was one of the things i thought about through the week and i hope i can come back to data and all a long time ago we spoke a little bit on that but uh i was thinking about their discipline discipline that's what preeminence is all about christ having the preeminence in his church is all about a life of discipline you see the failure of the church the pentecostal church the medivis the baptist and all all all all means all all means all which means it don't even stop to the denomination there it comes over the message oh it's a failure to that abiding grace of god it's a failure to that abiding grace of god coming time when god is blessing us with our prayer life we enjoy it and pretty soon we think that we are spiritual above everybody and and and now we want to regulate it and we just abide just above the failure is to that abiding grace of god tonight you will shout clap your hands dance in your eyes speak in tongues he says that's gift gift is no good unless you are abiding in the shackana glory is not only the preacher that wait on the lord the son-servant leader must find time to wait on the lord the musicians wait on the lord the people wait on the lord that abiding presence that abiding grace a time to just say lord ye i am he says that's the failure gift is no good unless you are abiding in the chicana glory seed those things are fine i have nothing to say against them they are of god shouting and blessing god is wonderful speaking in tongues or translation of tongues and and and and all i mean interpretation of tongues is the same and all these other things gifts of healing prophecy you know and and the church today just focus on that they just focus we want manifestation what brings manifestation what brings manifestation the bible talks about the beast of revelation 13 that uh he will he will he will he will he will perform miracles even though brother branham said his miracle that he will perform is to be able to bring all the world religion together that would be a miracle that they all will agree yet they are divided from one another that's a miracle that is only the beast can do he's the only one to have that anointing to do it all these things gifts of healing prophecy all these things are marvelous but they are no good they are not fruitful they are not fruitful if they are not fruitful they are what prideful they are not fruitful they are just prideful i have the gift of healing i can pray for the sake they are not fruitful they can yell the right unless you are living in the presence of the shakana glory atmosphere around you is galling praise the lord are we saying don't go to work no am i saying don't go to school [Music] no if that's the way you understand me you're listening to the devil you're not listening to me that's not what i'm saying living in the presence of the shakana glory we say his word amen and what was the second thing sauna we said his word in his name we sing the song take the name of jesus with you everywhere you go breathe that holy name in prayer as long as you are taking the name with you you are in his presence unless you are living in the shaking glory the atmosphere around you is going that's the reason that men and women are not permitted to these things to what things gifts that's why they are not permitted to to the supernatural because it takes a life to be able to stay in that presence that's why men and women are not permitted to these things because they go out here and call a blessing over something that god has cursed or cursed something that god has blessed why because they are not disciplined i heard brother branham using the word today in the message paradox he said he said how we need to be schooled we need to be schooled we need to be taught and one of the hardest people to teach is the message people message people are hard to be taught you say one the line of 20 courts verbum says that's why we are not committed to these things abiding presence we have to realize with all of these things happening all of the confusion that is in the world and the chaos god is calling his bride away but branham says there's a secret going of the bride she's being called away into his presence daily she's been called away into his presence daily in his presence is fullness of joy amen he says is an abiding presence to know the will of god what a confidence it gives you and says if god tells me to go in and and and and raise abraham lincoln up i will invite the entire world it was an abiding presence jesus right there to the grave of lazarus he wanted more of the skeptics to come he wanted more he wanted them all to come all the ones that were gossiping and talking in the ears of mary and martyr and talking inward about him he wanted them to come praise the lord at times he would come and he would just sneak back and visit but this time he was he was talking in the street making his voice loud so everybody can hear it where did you lead him what what what what let's go show me where you lay him i'm the resurrection and the light because it was a vision it was doubt said the lord it could have never failed that's the confidence the abiding presence gives you it gives you such a faith that you know and you know and you know and you know you can say like shadrach meshach and abednego even if our god don't deliver us abiding presence it's an abiding presence to know the will of god then don't look what the word going to say about you is what god thinks about you then you are living in his presence let the people think what they want to think like the church says what they want to say i mean it will soon stop putting you in three counts of believers there was a quick message believer i've ever quit with that there are three kinds of believer but what you want is that inner assurance the lord is my shepherd i shall now one that is an abiding presence that is an abiding presence verb talks here in jehovah jarrah he brings lord out here in the picture he said there was lord walking right along with abraham who was a believer but he didn't have the constant abiding presence means he was in and out in and out in and out he did not had a constant abiding presence so what did it do it affected his choice because he did not had a constant abiding presence it affected his choice abraham said look left look right choose wherever you want to go praise the lord amen okay i have a few minutes he didn't have that constant abiding presence of god so when the hirst man got to iger and abraham said we are veterans let us not have any more argument he and he said you take the east i would i would take the west or if you take the west i would go east which way you go i would go vice versa that's the way to make decision god you do the leading god you do the leading now god this is what i want to do but god you do the leading amen he never had that constant abiding presence and that's what abraham had the constant abiding presence now even when he went down to egypt he went down to egypt yet god came to his defense because he had the constant abiding presence it does not mean that you will not make mistakes you will not make wrong choices but the blessing of that constant abiding presence is that mercy and grace his grace and mercy will follow me all the days of my life and i shall dwarve in the presence of god are we together in his presence his fullness of joy let's take let's take a few more year and see how the law will help us okay actually it's the last one i have on abiding presence but i've i added i added something on on constant so so uh uh yeah let's let's just take him let's look at this one brother branham says and we pray that you will all together gather us tonight under the wings of his abiding presence you see jesus said israel jerusalem jerusalem how i would have wanted to spray my wings over you like a hand due to her cheek how a desire to draw you into my presence but what took them away from his presence it was the religious system of that day it was the teachings of that day it was the religious leaders of that day now just like i said the last last wednesday i think that thing became so strong to me because that was the the first time that scripture really came to light to me that jude i mean barabas was not just a murderer he was not just a murderer he was a religious fanatic he was just like paul that went and talked a letter from the sahendra's council gave me the bit of right that when i asked any man to be executed the council would stand behind me and speak to rome he was not just a vacable and i was just joking people with knife in the street he was doing it because he thought that if i killed just just like out of these uh islamic finances who do po bomb around them and say if i go and blast people off god would give me seven virgins what why is he doing that he's doing that with a religious concept in his mind that's the kind of a person that barbara was because that even the council even the religious people of of of of uh the sanhedrin's council will stand there and say give us barabbas that is the reason why they always shout for barabbas we pray that you will gather us together tonight honor the wings of his abiding presence as a hand gather her cheeks may we be gathered this night and may the holy spirit visit us with great power amen may we be gathered this night and may the holy spirit visit us with great power and that's what we are laboring under we want god to gather us in his abiding presence that whether we are in church or out of church we will be so disciplined by the word so disciplined those are those are the things that when the holy spirit achieve in in an assembly it makes it so sweet to save the lord but it's now when people come to church to come with their own mind it's hard for them to take instruction they get angry for every little thing i mean when such a discipline comes among the people it pleases the law so much now even if we spend 30 minutes in his presence or we spend an hour or two hour it will make no difference some people just think the long service means that the anointing was there no sometimes this preacher is just struggling through atmosphere just to be able to get us to that place because it took five minutes in the presence of god for moses to be changed from an angry man to the most meekest man we don't need a two-hour service five minutes is enough but there's a lot of background work needed there's a lot of background work needed for us to come to that place but bram says this it's it's a little bit off but you you you enjoy the blessings of a position in christ he says and he called him and and and he sent jesus that his blood might be on atoning blood i to me to make a propertation or exception or a cleansing a cleansing process to constantly now that work constantly uh many years ago i kind of picked this up studying studying adoption series and uh it helped me to see why god wrapped adam and eve in the bleeding sheepskin because as they were walking the blood was dropping so as they were going they had constant atonement they were walking in their sacrifice because he was driving them away from his presence but he made a provision for them to always be in his presence because every step they make blood is dropping so our constant atonement make a provision for an abiding presence amen what does that mean to the young people if you made a mistake get on your knees ask god for forgiveness if you have to apologize to the person that you're wrong apologize to them because when you walk in that constant atonement it will put you back in abiding presence but if you feel so proud and and stubborn to stick in your ways then you will go just like king away from the presence of god are we together cleansing process took constantly not just one time at one revival but living ever living everywhere you are if you put your eyes on the wrong thing oh god forgive me what a sinful world we live in god have mercy what what what you have done you have pulled on your attorney and because you have pulled on your atonement abiding presence come closer not just one time at one revival but ever living making intercession that the christian is kept clean day and night because we have a constant attunement there is the blood of jesus christ that makes an exception on the cross there in the presence of god that cleanses us constantly constantly if you walk in the light as he is in the light the blood of jesus christ claims us yes constant to me and what is the light the word so you see the presence his name his blood all of those things are the element of his presence to be constantly in his presence you need a constant atonement praise the lord are we together tonight but abraham says this we read this one and we close he says by faith you are safe that's your faith in god i love this i just i just put this one in because it's something that i love amen and i love to share with you what i love praise the lord i hope you love it the same he says by faith you are saved that's your faith in god the blood keeps you clean from sin your faith saves you the blood keeps you clean not the chemical blood but the bleeding world amen we are watched by the watching of the word of god your faith saves you but the blood keeps you clean because it makes a sacrifice the blood doesn't save you i plead the blood of jesus i plead the blood of jesus it doesn't save you what saves you is your faith in god the blood doesn't save you the blood keeps you clean by faith you are safe and that's what god's full knowledge calling you you are safe by faith and the blood makes an atonement constantly keeping you clean that's why the christian reads their bible and pray every day praise the lord amen and pray every day just just just just imagine it like this if we were asked to use the literal blood and put it over our head this thing is not close i'm wasting water on my head that's fine and and and pull it over our head we will not get there every morning and try to understand oh let me understand this no sometimes that's where our struggle is just read the word read the word of god because you love the word of god yes because the devil comes in and makes you frustrated you're not even understanding what you're reading then you get bored because he want to take you away from your atomi just read the word of god because you love it and then by one spirit you are baptized into the holy ghost into the fellowship of the believers into the fellowship of the holy spirit to be led by the spirit doing signs and wonders so your faith your faith saves you the blood keeps you clean amen and by one spirit we all are one body praise the lord musicians you can come for tonight let's buy our heads and pray abiding presence there's a brother just before we pray let me let me share this with you there's a brother and a dear brother and his wife he's uh he's like a uh a senior brother to us he's he's a uncle to brother brother daley uh brother felix perhaps he and his wife following the service tonight and uh they've been

to be uh uh over there that's where to go to church and uh i mean and he and his wife i mean since the being there uh i mean he got in touch with voice of god and and and it's it's it's just beautiful
