chorus there take my hands all the way take my hands all the way [Music] every hour every day [Music] from here to the grace let me stand [Music] let's let's do that again take my hands all the way every hour every day from the air to the grace take my hands let [Music] stands let's try that again take my hand all the way every [Music] lord take my paint [Music] stands alone praise the lord that was a good practice amen we'll trust the lord too to pick on that again let's stand to our feet tonight praise the lord let's take revelation chapter one it's going to be in the house of the law we want to say thank you to each and every one of you that uh were able to make the fellowship on sunday pleasant with all the heat but the food was good amen if you have good food under the heat you'd have no complaint praise the lord amen yeah if you are hungry under the heat there is death praise the lord amen so we we want to say thanks to all of the different fingers that we got a taste of we were very very grateful praise the lord revelation chapter 1 revelation chapter 1 praise the lord amen this is my personal note it's not supposed to be let's read from verse nine what i want to do with this revelation chapter one tonight if the lord can be our help i want to i want to just encourage you and uh as as we did you know encouraging you to pick up your church age book uh since we got to playing the the the revelation series of the seven church ages and for our our sunday school we want to use there to encourage you like i said if you don't have one of those books we have some back there that we have for library purpose and if you want to buy one we would be glad to sell it to you we sell it the price that we bought it so we're not making no money out of you praise the lord amen and uh uh uh and yeah just in the introduction it says that uh this book holds all the major doctrine of the bible praise the lord and i think as as a church as we beginning to grow we must get off the milks and stairs to eat the food what is the church what makes a church is what this stands for and what this church stands for is it is its doctrine praise the lord the prophet of god said the doctrine is the backbone of the church and uh we you know we really never decided to approach things doctrine uh on on a doctrinal matter uh all because we we were trying to be nice praise the lord because sometimes when you start well you start taking doctrine of things that's when people sign up you know because sometimes they want to stay the way they are but uh i think we appreciate changes with growth so uh it would be good especially you young people uh get one of those church each book and read it the the internet edge is taking books away from our hands you know we can we can take our cell phone and scroll it down if you if you get on your cell phone you want to read it i mean that's nice you know you want to read it on your ipad it prays a lot of good as long as you are reading it whatever you want to read it on you know you want to read it on the chuck ball i think you will learn better after you finish writing all of those pages on the chalkboard they're going to stick in your head [Laughter] praise the lord but i want to encourage you pick up the church-ish book pick up the church-ish book brother branham let's read the scripture now have you said before i get into my talking tonight revelation chapter 1 verse 9 let's read verse 9. i john who also i'm your brother and companion in tribulation and in the kingdom and patient of jesus christ was in the eye that is called patmos for the word of god and for the testimony of jesus christ i was in the spirit on the lord's day and i heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet i was in the spirit on the lost day and i heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet saying i am alpha and who means the first and the last and what their spirit write in the book and send it onto the seven churches which are in asia onto ephesus and onto samnet and onto pagamus and onto territory and onto saudis and onto philadelphia and onto laodicea and i turn praise the lord i heard behind me and i turned to see the voice that speak with me and being turned i saw seven golden candlestick and in the midst of the seven golden candlestick one like the son of man cloth praise the lord cloth with a garment down toward the fort and gather about the pipes with golden and get them let's stop right there let's pray together father we have just read your blessed word and oh god we pray internal thoughts that can never be exhausted aligned on these pages lord father this page is whole things the lord we will talk about all true eternity and here we have 30 minutes before us lord if you don't help us our coming year tonight will be for nothing but precious lord take our hands so father yes we want to stand to the place tonight where no one stand alone come and break your word to our hearts father we love you we love you we appreciate you in the name of the lord jesus we pray amen the lord bless you you may have your seed if i take a little talk tonight i want to speak on i turned to see the voice i turn to see the voice that speak to me praise the lord i turn to see the voice that speak to me we love the lord tonight and oh what a wonderful wonderful savior trying to look for a comparison some chords on it would not be in my notes tonight because i compiled some quotes and in these quotes brother brown was talking about uh uh commentaries you know commentaries he said uh uh and the reason why i'm i want to refer to this is because he referred to the seventh church age book as a commentary that he has written on the book of revelation praise the lord he said the 77th church each book was a commentary that he has written we know that he asks brother the bill to help him write it but uh [Music] and and i mean there are few few places where where he sits dead and okay i don't have much time tonight so i won't take take off all the time but you you can check that out you will see that you know that uh he referred to dashing he talked about writing another commentary on divine healing and all of that well so uh i'm just i'm just saying that you know to to kind of give you an appetite to to be able to pick up uh the church each book and read and you want to you want to read it in a group you want to read it as a family you want to read it you know uh my husband and wife it is it's just a wonderful book to read you know with all the subtitles it makes it easy you can just you can just fight your way from one subtitle to another and close it but it's a wonderful book i'm sure that the lord will bless you and you begin to see things that that you will appreciate are we together praise the lord amen i was i was playing the message on my way here to uh arrived from work and i was playing the message proving his word and and you know when and and brought branham shares something i almost preached proving his word tonight because i was just so inspired when he said that and and and what inspired me is that he was talking about jesus coming to the to the jairus house when his little girl died praise the lord and he says and he went to that minister's house and he that ministers that minister little daughter died and he said uh but when he got there they said they get is dead and he said but jesus said to get is asleep she's not dead so he said i just enjoy this he said and then he put them out to prove his word that she was asleep yes praise the lord he said she was asleep so he had to prove his word by waking her up amen praise the lord amen if you just think about it with with all with all the the the bad news they had about jesus and all that you know the the thing that the scandal that was in the papers you know uh uh if they uh behind any form of internet those days they have all sorts of lying information how he was born of illegitimate child and you know uh and and and i mean the people the people that believe in jesus they they had a personal experience that's right amen they had a conviction for them to be going against the order of that day going against the system that they were raised under the church system and all the different things and to be following the man that had such a social scandal made made of scandal praise the lord they might have had an experience something that they cannot explain praise the lord even nicodemus came by night and said we we know we the sahendra's counsel know that no man can do these things yes except god be with him praise the lord amen and i heard brother bran saying today on tape he said these things were not done in a that's corner these things were not done in the corner i'm going to speak on something tonight but uh uh uh i'll just i just leave there for another time but what i was going to speak about is that that's what i want you to get in the church book because i mean you you're really going to learn many things there scripturally this is a scriptural order and that is the reason why people frown at gift in the church because we are living in such an age where there is a proud spirit that one of our digital age is a proud spirit for the person to be blind and you don't know it it's because they are too proud to realize what their situation is and because of this proud spirit that is in the church it make the people they re they they don't want to be corrected they resent correction and when when you resent correction god can use you you know why i say that because i call into the book of corinthians when the gift comes to the church every birth is a mess and if you have a gift and you mess up the world must correct you and because people don't want to be corrected so even if they have a gift they either shot away from it or they suppress it or they quench the spirit they greet the holy ghost and and all of that because they don't want to be corrected that's a scriptural order paul said if one prophesied and uh that this will happen and it don't happen that person must immediately realize it does not have anything to do with your salvation you will just honor a wrong influence and you must be delivered from that spirit now let me say this let me say this because i i've i've i wanted to preach this thing in in in the talk that i had that's the problem with all of these people that have been following this message for 20 30 40 years if you come to the place and realize that all of these years you've been wrong if you really have the holy ghost you will sit down and ask god to deliver you you see the reason why people are fussing against the message is because they are under a wrong spirit the scriptural order i realized i've been deceived all of these years sit down push yourself yes sir right you're not going to start digging in the scripture and brother branham said that he was wrong here you are just honor a wrong spirit you are honor a wrong spirit if they really believe the bible they will follow the scriptural order praise the lord he will follow that's that scripture or order goals for for for every everyone if a man is preaching and he's preaching the wrong doctrine and he realized that he's preaching something contrary to the word he must push himself he must sit down because if you don't do it you will go from one error to another error to another error and then when you start manifesting in your flesh it just become a mess that just might advise for these brothers some of them are good brothers they love the lord you know they they are trying to be concerned for their soul but if you have gone 40 years and that now you realize you were wrong sit down you don't have nothing to tell sit down and push yourself that's exactly what the apostle paul did three years at the back side of the desert to push himself yes he did yes he did and that goes for every gift whether you are a song leader you are a preacher you are a musician if a man is wrong on a wrong anointing you will sit down and push yourself that's the scripture or it's good for you you don't have to be preaching you don't have to be it does not have to be a public gift that's right when you realize you've been entertaining the wrong spirit push yourself of it you'd be entertaining the wrong thought thinking about a brother or thinking about a sister and you just think that person don't like me or that and you just keep feeling on that keep feeding them push yourself here because if you don't do it it's going to harm to you praise the lord it's definitely going to haunt you and before you realize you start feeling better that person don't even know about it you just start feeling ugly in right brother yourself yes absolutely sometimes it don't even have to be something major i mean that's the reason why christians take time to concentrate themselves are you doing you just pushing yourself yes lord if i'm hovering anything that i don't know flush it out of me lord amen amen and if you come in to tell us for 40 years you've been preaching wrong thing then tomorrow you want to come on the puppet to start preaching what you think is right what time did you have to verify what you think is right okay okay praise the lord okay before i get i get carried away and preach my message that i didn't give title to tonight but we will get to it if the lord help us here i want to talk about this this uh revelation you know but like i said brother brown was saying that i i was just i was just so blessed when he said that he said the girl she's sleeping and if what he said is truth he had to prove his word amen if god said there will be a rapture he will surely prove his word if he said he would get a bride in this age he would surely prove his word praise the lord he's the lord god that healed our disease he proved his word over and over amen i was just so blessed by that thought amen i want to look at this tonight and what this will help us to see it will actually put us to the place for us to realize uh where we are because john here is representing the bride he's representing the church john represented the bride of all the ages amen from the first church age to the last church age sunday we were trying to talk about the home landing and we were just trying to bring something memorable for independence but uh uh we realized that our land is not a physical lane our land god gave israel a promise he gave israel a natural promise amen and he gave us a spiritual promise praise the lord and and that's why we read there in the book of ada that this promise is unto you and to your children and to many as the lord our god shall call because our promise is the holy ghost the holy ghost is our homeland amen praise the lord if you don't have the holy ghost you have not arrived yet the holy ghost is our homeland i would love to go to jerusalem but that's not my homeland amen i love to go to tucson and uh and and you know go on top of all of those mountains they are just talking to brother jordan sometime i says in the future when things gets better you know you plan the trip in unless let's take the young people out there and see some of those areas i love to go there but that's not my home lane jeffersonville is not my homeland my homeland is the holy ghost if you don't have the holy ghost you have not arrived that's the reason why don't take an experience for the holy ghost don't take a thought for the holy ghost don't think because i'm in a message i mean the holy ghost praise the lord amen you must enter in you must enter in and like joshua said when you enter every put the place that the soul of your feet so which means you enter you start conquering every step amen you don't just go from one revival oh i received the holy ghost it was wonderful no you take possession you keep taking possession until you leave this body amen you keep identifying things in the world in your life and let that land possess your body praise the lord amen let it possess your body you will have battles but there is a sweet experience that is inside praise the lord amen i mean every battle what a victory or defeat you know that you are the man that is in the arena you know victory you no defeat we might lost some fight but we never lost a wall so we just want to look at this tonight yeah john is saying here i want you to watch this now he's talking here i was in the spirit on the lost day and i heard behind me now for john to have her behind him he might have either passed or his back is turned to where the voice is coming from praise the lord now what this will show you is that it will show you the position of john before the church ages was revealed follow me now a little bit he says and and i heard uh behind me a great voice as of a trumpet i'm the alpha and omega the first and the last this is this is an introduction of a man amen me alfa romenga the first and the last he says and he's giving john an instruction what their series write in the book what you see where what what you see where what you see behind you follow me a little bit now what does syria write in a book and send it on to the seven church churches which are in asia onto ephesus until laodicea he says and john says and then i turn now to see the voice that was that was talking to me praise the lord amen so in in in one sense john is looking back to see the voice let's let's let's just go a little bit he says i turn to see the voice that speak with me and being turned i saw seven golden candlesticks that represent the seven church ages and one in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks that represent this man that is introducing himself so john is in a position between the church ages in some way as he's looking back at the church agent he's not in the edges right he's not in the mess of the seven goal in canada he's somewhere he was going somewhere and he heard a voice sure and he turned around and then when he looked looking for the voice he saw seven golden candlestick and he saw one in the midst of the seventh goal in candlestick and this one is instructing him that everything you see in there right so john is in a position where the seven golden candles take is dead and he's he's he's going somewhere praise the lord amen my goodness i really didn't thought i would preach tonight but it looks like there is enough pulling here tonight amen you love the lord you can see the picture amen now this book is written by jesus himself he's the writer of this book you'll find all of that in the church ages as you read you'll learn that but i i just want to show you john position i want to show you john's position john is standing he's standing on the bridge or he's standing in the bridge he's standing between the church ages and the rest of time standing between the church ages and and and eternity now watch here now in revelation chapter 4 the revelation series the preach series now the church book the preacher version chapter 4 we read here now we we find that after these things after means that after the church ages has ceased then john was summer to come up higher now so what what is that pointing us to revelation chapter 4 amen that's why revelation chapter 4 verse 1 says praise the lord revelation chapter 4 verse 1 says after this after this so that's what brother branham is referring to after what after the church ages now you see that that that is that is the wonderful thing about a prophet ministry people just think a prophet being an interpreter of the world he's going to bring some kind of interpretation from a far blue end that you have never heard is just to be able to pick up those the between the lines praise the lord and by the grace of god i will show you i'll show you a few of those between the lines uh uh you know between the lines things but uh because i could run what i want to say here tonight after that so that's what he's referring to here he says after distance after means dead after the church ages has seized then john was summer to come up higher after these things unlocked and behold a door was open in heaven and the voice which i heard was as it were of a trumpet the very same voice again that called john here to turn to the seven goalie candlestick is now calling john on this other side okay the same voice that caught him yet and said turn he turn and lock write all these things as soon as he finished the voice call him on the other side come up higher are you seeing the picture are we together which means come up he showed him all that were going to happen in the world of the church ages then after the church ages was over we find then that john was a type of every true believer now so he showed him all the things that was happening in the world now you see you see the wednesday night is not enough for this but we try [Laughter] now so you see what i want you to see and understand and appreciate is that uh john is now shown all the things i want to say this way john is showing the flashing red light john is showing even me clever prophecy john is now being shown the world is falling apart again the condition of the church john is shown all those things praise the lord are you understanding what i'm saying tonight amen it will help you to understand that those those inspiration besides the the the the healing services that brother branham had right those inspiration that he had when he was burdened to preach a message recognizing your day and this message that's what the angel was doing to john to recognize where you are john talking about birth pains those were not just titles those were the things that john was shown the word in its condition the church in its condition john was pointed back look at that praise the lord because you see the thing about it there is that is it's hard for you for the person to really be able to identify their ugly state when they are in it most of the time they don't even agree nothing wrong with me what wrong with me what do you see amen it's after when they come out of it and it looked out wow wow was that the kind of a life i was living wow wow but when you are in it nothing wrong with it everybody is foolish to you amen they are just they are just wacky their brain don't work they don't see anything you know you want to catch up with the faction of the world you want to you know it's you are in it and see that that is the reason why john had to be out and now he was shown the word that's the reason why revelation chapter 18 4 say come out of her my people brother branham said the same voice that called revelation 18 4 is identified in revelation chapter 3 after knocking at the door it was that voice that was saying come out are we together that's the reason why this revelation could could not has come in the first church age because john was part of it he was in the first church age the second church is it could not have come unto laodicea church age which is the pentecostal age it had to be after then now the bride is now shown see where you came out of see the system you came out of are we together are you seeing the picture what i'm trying to do tonight i'm trying to show you a movie i want to grab your attention so you can be caught up in this picture praise the lord so john the church traveling from ephesus to laudisha he comes out of laodicea he's on his way and the voice turned around he said look back you think about the preview of the bride when the first church was marching that's right that was the episode church sure and then when the days of the nicolaitans and all the false teaching entered they started dancing to rock and roll dancing to rock and roll taking off their clothes little by little when it got to laudisha they were completely naked and they didn't know about it and brother branham crying that vision and say is this what we have is this what we have lived for then the voice says the bride would come again praise the lord so you see that that shows john from ephesus walking he's the bride he's he represents the bride in every age praise the lord you represent the bride in every age now the bride has walked through the seven church ages and the voice call said look back seven golden candlestick amen and there was one in the midst of the seven golden candlestick and since now everything you see you write it so john is standing right here now writing everything he sees the messenger of uh ephesus the messenger of uh uh philadelph all the church ages and the voices the message to the ages john is writing all of that are you getting the picture young people this message don't stop it to just your dress call and think because you dress in decent you are in the message don't stop it this message is more than dress code it's more than dress code this message is a person is the person of jesus christ is the person of jesus christ are we together so you see here uh let's let's read here uh uh now we find after these things after means death after the church ages has ceased then john was summoned to come up higher come up higher which means come up here he showed him all that was going to happen in the world of the church ages then after the church ages was over we find then that john was a type of every true believer that will be summer by christ on high summer come up higher and we find out that the voice we speak we we spoke to him was the voice of a trumpet now so you see over in revelation chapter 1 the voice was a trumpet over in revelation chapter 4 1 the voice was a trumpet so it was the same voice just speaking from two different direction because what what is a trumpet giving for to assemble the people so a trumpet called john to look back look at the church in his condition and everything you see right yes are we together now so uh uh we find that the voice that spoke to him was the voice of a trumpet clear distinguished and it was the same voice that spoke to him year on earth so one voice spoke to him year on earth and another voice spoke to him from heaven praise the lord oh my goodness i can run down the eye with this one brother jordan praise the lord but it's a wednesday night it was the same voice that spoke to him here on earth see as long as he was in the midst of the seven golden candlestick he was speaking to or from or i i like that speaking from the seven goal encounters not john speaking now but the alpha and nominee the one in the midst of the seven golden candlestick amen as long as he was speaking from the church he was speaking on earth [Music] see he was in the seventh he was in a candlestick speaking speaking from them to his church then when the church ages seized he left the earth and move up into the heavens and call his redeemed up with him praise the lord that's the reason why seven angels had to bring the rapture message because the bride was no longer going to year from earth christ was kicked out of the church she will now be hearing from heaven praise the lord so you see you cannot you cannot start another pentecostal church with this message you will fail sure praise the lord you will fail you you try emotion you will burn out i mean you will burn out because you will go with such a speed and you will lose your breath and there will be no strength and that's that's where many people are coming home out of it i mean they have done all of that right i was uh on the weekend i was i was studying and i was just listing all the doctrines that have come out of this message and they have all filled away the word christ is still standing strong praise the lord the word christ is still standing strong people have tried to you know bring us to worship brother branham it fit away amen people have tried to uh uh i mean the broad millennium the broad polygamy the broad uh uh uh how you call it now i'm kind of looking for the the greek word here but uh uh two souls and and and two laws and i mean there's there's no time for that tonight seven thunders and i mean in all of that they have brought it and they have all failed right everyone came with with its you know emotions and grabbed the people and they thought it was it you know millennial and all of that that's the reason why you have to fall in love with jesus christ fall in love with jesus christ fall in love with this word let it be so precious to you don't worry if you don't know what about those doctrine then there is nothing good for you to know about them anyway so don't worry about it amen but i will have if i have if we have time i will take you through some of them in and and just exposed what the devil was trying to do praise the lord amen then when the church aged sees he left and moved up into the heavens now bible said this let me just get through this quickly and i think i've i've given you i've given you a picture now for you to look at so when you're reading the book of revelation see what he says here he says feast of the trumpet his first quote he says that the first three chapters of the book of revelation reveal all the happiness onto the church we just read where john was showing all that was happening so all that was happening is right here in the first three churches in the first three chapters praise the lord all that was happening i mean every doctrine every cut every evil spirit that have ever hanged around the church is right here in revelation 1-3 praise the lord when you read history you realize that when when when when luther got the inspiration that the just shall live by faith and and and and and he was standing against the church just just imagine he was a catholic priest he was a catholic priest and god just gave him that inspiration and and and and and there there were there were there were a lot of people i mean it just opened people's eyes people started saying i mean what what i mean what have we been reading you know i mean the bible was was i mean in in all sorts of different forms praise the lord you go into all of these different groups there's a group there now in in in indiana where the grace of god has god among the amish people and many of them are coming to the lord jesus christ they are because why they are getting their hands on the bible and realizing that all of these years what they what they talk was the bible something written in in one old faction german that they can't even understand only the elders can understand so whatever interpretation they give them they just swallow it one old-fashioned german yeah the guy says they don't they just they i mean they just chewed their mouth when they are reading yep they can't even pronounce it they can't even understand it but because they are other they have to perform praise the lord and you know what could have happened if we did not have this message on tapes for you to be able to listen to her people will tell you things that brother branham said that's right it's still on tape and it's trying to confuse us how much more if it was not on tag praise the lord yes sir a person can just say one paragraph and explain it the way you want to explain it and there is no footing in the bible he cannot trace that thought back to the bible praise the lord i've i you know i've used to say this years back i said we didn't have this message they will have to whip some people to get the holy ghost praise the lord amen most especially the ones that love laying on hands they will have people lay hands on them with a king so the first three chapters of the book of revelation reveal all the happiness onto the church and then from the 10th chapter on to the 19th chapter of the revelation there is no more sin of the church praise the lord amen do you know that people in this message that believe brother branham says this so we must not preach from any of those chapter because it does not concern the church a complete misunderstanding right the church goes up at the fourth chapter of revelation and return back at the 19th chapter of revelation the bride and the groom together come to the earth and then from the 19th chapter to the conclusive of of the 22nd chapter and it's all it's all on the millennium and what will be in the years that is to follow praise the lord but that's what i wanted to grab grab your attention to show you how where all that was happening the flashing red light of his coming amen and right in revelation chapter 2 he kept saying behold i come quickly that was the flashing red light of his coming before i come praise the lord let me just read one more quote here to you very important so uh uh just listening and then we will close here feast of the trumpet again he says this is the complete revelation of jesus christ and the seven seals how the mystery hit of what it all was and it's supposed to open in the last day now you see that's the reason why i i was talking about the loosing of the seals the releasing of christ amen just trying to find the best word so you can be able to understand what what actually it is because here is it take take for example yet now john going through the first church age remember now he was part of the believers in in pentecost okay he was part of the believer at pentecost the birth of the church he saw all of that you know going from the first church age and he traveled through the church ages and did not even understand until the voice called his attention the one in the midst of the seven golden candlestick now start to tell him in the ephesus church age start started to point out things to him praise the lord that is as much as people that can walk in this message and still don't understand what it's all about they take it to be a church they take it to be another form of religion they can walk all these years around this message and still don't understand what it is wow in this message we can play this this message it's not just for everybody this they try to make it like something he went from the first age and walked through a representation through the church ages and never had an idea what the seven golden candlestick meant he never had an idea never had an idea until the voice called his attention and then he turned around and a voice starts to show him everything this thing is connected to this world war one was the first war world war ii was the second war and the voice started to explain all of that to john are we together this is the complete revelation of jesus christ and the and the in this and the seventh seal how the mystery hate of what it all was and it's supposed to be open in the last days to some preachers this message is just to condemn denomination they just condemn nobody will be saved they just condemn anything they just condemn a smart religious way to to be rude any sought a very soft religious way to be arrogant that's why they call the message of the hour right we are in the message yes sir this is the complete revelation of jesus christ and the seventh seal how the mystery head of what it all was and it's supposed to open in the last day at the laodicean age at the end time now let me give you another picture now watch very closely so john year at ephesus going through with all of this what is happening everything that is happening here is sealed to him because he does not understand it it's a mystery it sealed to him he had to come to the end to the end of time for him to understand everything that happened back there and that was what our voice called him for to open his understanding just like jesus did those men on the road of emirates opened their understanding at the end of time he walked with them from the beginning he walked with them just talking about scripture they were blind wow oh wow separate wow praise the lord everything that wow amen predestination wow i can live and i'm predestinated by any evening time when he came to the end of time the end of the day he took a breath and he broke it yes then they remember they remember the eyes were open the bible says then he raptured vanished from them when the last elect comes in the rapture we go when the ice is open will be raptured when we find our place and stop playing church when we find our place the rapture we go our eyes comes open oh this is what we were supposed to do all of this why oh wow oh lord the rapture we go this is the complete revelation of jesus christ the seventh seal had the mystery head of what it all was and it's supposed to open in the last day at the laodicea age at the end of time thank you to god that finishes the message to the church let's see now that i finished when they look back and see what has been when they look back and see what has been what is he putting us he's putting us exactly to the place where john was right oh my goodness oh praise the lord oh thank you jesus amen that finish it when they look back and see what has been and see where it all brought up to that finish it the age of the church that was what the seals holds it was to explain all of these things that happened throughout the church ages it was to help us to look back and see where trinity came from where sprinkling came from where church hierarchy came from church denomination when we look back and see oh wow not to be critical but to be grateful oh god thank you jesus yes thank you lord yes musicians you can come when we look back and see all the lord has done
