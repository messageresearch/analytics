thank you for holding the the service on sunday all your children were gone praise the lord and uh we appreciate you they appreciate the grace of god constantly upon your life and uh and we greet you all again in the name of the lord jesus it's going to be back home amen and uh a few of us were gone on on on the weekend to support our brother ariel and sister naisha their wedding when all well praise the lord and we we pray that the grace of god will will bless in and keep them they should be traveling back home soon so we just ask god's mercy to be with them praise the lord but uh we all have a had a safe travel for those that flew in and we that were on the road we had a good time praise the lord amen the wedding went well and i believe you were the church was well represented with all those that had to uh but simon was one of the ushers putting people in place and so i think we were represented praise the lord amen and then after the wedding we had to stay and uh uh pray for the the sins the fake tabernacle in husky brother larry in the church so then right after the service then we took up and started coming but we had to stay on the way sleep praise the lord brother stephen ajiros and his greetings and many of the other brothers that we met they wanted to make sure that we send their greetings to the church praise the lord amen so uh we got in there on uh on friday we stopped an hour away from from raleigh because we were tired so i got a calling and then i was told that i was going to i was going to preach before they officiate the wedding now i was thinking how we are doing an entire body but then i remember that you know this is the grace of god it's not the man amen is the gift so we just prayed and and we just trusted the lord [Music] i took a little subject you know not being fond of preaching on wedding i always like to use sometimes acronyms to preach especially when it comes to weddings so there's a talk that i had on my mind long time ago uh i was i was uh i pick it up from somewhere i was either reading something or listening to something and i picked that thought up uh rest in brokenness which of course i talked from genesis chapter 2 when god took the rape i used that word rape and broke it into acronym rest in brokenness so we were showing a little bit how marriage was rest and brokenness but then you know sometimes you take those thoughts and you speak on it and then after a while you realize that there is just there is just more to the word of god than just a taut amen and so i started i started uh thinking on it and and and the night i went back in to the i mean in north carolina there was hot i mean it was about 90 degrees terribly hot out i mean i almost fainted during the service because i felt tired dehydrated and then with the heat so i was just holding them for my dear life i said i said i was not going to be emotional i was just going to speak quickly and turn the service over before the whole thing came from the marriage to a funeral so so i was just i was just hauling to the pulpit and just moving back and forth and making sure that i get done quickly but uh the the the program was was was was nice we thank the lord so what the thought actually there was uh that that kind of caught my mind uh actually the the night when i thought i was going to preach even though i had that thought of my mind but i mean the lord started ministering to me in a completely different way then i saw it and i said i said well this is this is very interesting it looks like it's something to talk about more than just a wedding you know and the talk that was on my mind was how this this great god that we serve and this great almighty god that we serve how how he condemns himself you know and and also he condescended praise the lord which of course is represented in the communion i was hoping that we will have a convenience service in in july we are planning to have a have a weekend service that july that will be the july 4th weekend so we should have a service on on saturday night and sunday morning and then also uh brother jordan has reserved a park where we can be able to spend july 4th together somewhere there in saint paul and we will give you all the details as as we get as we get close so july 4th we want to open july 4 for a time of fellowship and where we just come together fellowship and visit with one another and just spend that time together praise the lord so we thank the lord for that amen and next week hopefully our friend brother daley will be around from from nigeria he should be visiting with us preaching for us on wednesday night i hope we will come in and support the service and then uh he should be here until sunday now uh uh since we don't want to we don't want to be selfish we would love to have our brother and enjoy him uh we are kind of thinking on you know what to how to arrange the week if he will have to go and visit or minister for some other brothers you know so uh i'm really really kind of for thinking that for now but the program is that he'll be with us yet on wednesday night and then on sunday morning praise the lord amen so uh uh in this and this weekend by god's grace we will we will also be speaking for brother uh brother flint and brother andrew boscow there in alaska we will be be speaking for them on the weekend he's having his annual service i think since the past two years they really never have anything like like a fellowship coming together and having having some meetings so they want to open this weekend up and then brother flame asks if we can come and and and speak for them so i'll be leaving on friday morning and uh leave eight o'clock get that 10 o'clock am and just ready for the service meeting starts tomorrow actually but andrew boscow speaking tomorrow and then friday we will be there i'll be back on monday so uh just keep us in your prayers praise the lord just keep us in your prayers and uh that the lord will just give strength to our worry body so just like i was saying i was i was i was thinking on that uh i know i started i started looking and studying on the condescending of god you know i started studying on the condescending of god and and the subject started becoming very interesting very very interesting to me how god condescended and and and and he uh he came from being the great internal spirit one time that fill all space he have condescended to do it in our hearts praise the lord that's the greatness of god the mystery of his greatness that he's able to break himself to break himself so that's where that's where my thought was for the wedding that we only find rest in brokenness as god's word as the great internal spirit even though he feel all time in all space but in one sense he was restless it's it's strange to say that it bothered the human mind to say that the almighty god was restless it also bothered the human mind to think that god needs us more than we need him praise the lord but yara said he can do without us we cannot do without him even though he needs us more than we need him because without us he cannot manifest his attributes praise the lord but you have to keep in the back part of your mind brother branham says in marriage and divorce he can do without you why because he's a creator he can whip you out and create another another word and go on with manifesting his attributes sure yes so that's a balance day are we together so that i mean yeah the thought was just on my mind and i said oh my goodness this is this is this is beautiful you know it's it's beautiful so we we talk genesis 7 i mean genesis 2 27 you know god uh uh talk from adam you know a rape and and and make eve uh so we were talking about that and and and trying to center it down on on marriage how you know god would take the male and the female from different background and different family bring us together and that union is actually a modern wheel he put us on ezekiel wheel the wheels in the middle of the wheel and he used marriage to break us from our upbringing from our way of thinking from our selfishness self-centeredness he used marriage to break us to be able to make another image that would reflect him right that's what that's what marriage is all about it's it's not uh for all all of these things that we see hollywood is trying to present that's why their marriage cannot last you know because it's all in glamorous in in you know in uh in all of that but god's purpose is to be able to break us because he his his uh his reflection will rest in in in that in that image that he will achieve from the brokenness that he would get from a man and a woman and now so that's that's what we were trying to to uh encourage uh ireland and asia you know and charge them with those few words that uh you know is is a place where god will uh as as the minister bless you and pronounce your husband and wife you you get right on god's wills and he starts to break you from there praise the lord you'll get financial problem you'll get all sorts of problems [Laughter] amen you start crying i don't know why i got into this world my life were far better [Laughter] but it's beautiful it's beautiful it's beautiful there's there's a thought i have in my mind but i won't say it because i'm uh i'm still looking at different things on there so i will keep it keep it for now so yeah so so looking at that thought you know it took me back to go and start looking at how god broke himself jesus before he departed he took a breath see this is my body he raised it up he breaks it praise the lord amen he breaks it so that was a symbol but it was also representing how god right from time like i said right from eternity he breaks himself breaks himself condemns himself condescend is the same sense praise the lord 120 was in the upper room and everyone then had a lake of fire over their head it was god distributing himself so he breaks himself he breaks himself a little bit was was was we saw a little bit of him in in in joseph we saw a little bit of him in david we saw a little bit of him in something we saw a little bit of him in abigail we saw a little bit of him in roof we saw a little bit of him in rahab praise the lord praise the lord amen so it's a it's a thought that we are cooking so just keep praying for me when it's finally done we will all share it together amen [Laughter] praise the lord we are cooking that talk so just pray for me when it's finally done we'll all sit down and enjoy the word of god amen praise the lord but tonight we will we will take a subject that we have we have dwelt on before saint john chapter 16 let's stand and read a portion of the of the word of god amen he breaks himself uh what a what a powerful thought yes you know that that god have a little of himself in each and every one of us i mean it's so it's so powerful that if it's i mean it blows the the mind of the devil you know it keeps him in his track even though he's uh you know he's a guy that is never discouraged you know he's uh he's uh he keeps fighting even though he know he's defeated but he keeps fighting but i mean if that thought can become a revelation to you praise the lord the devil can fight all he wants is not going to move you because you know that uh it's not a breaking part that is given to you now but it's a breaking path that brought you here you travel through that condescending of god praise the lord even when we baptize that's the reason why we must be baptized into the water because that baptism we are identified with the condescending of god in baptism mine they thought it's on my mind he can't leave my mind so praise the lord but i just don't feel fully prepared to speak on that tonight amen amen john chapter 16. we read this talk a little bit about it let's read from verse 7 in john chapter 16. nevertheless i tell you the truth it is expedient for you that i go away for if i go not away the comforter will not come unto you we just sank the comfort tower by that's another thing that has been on my mind you know just a thought of the abiding spirit of the lord that has been promised to the believer just been having that thought of the holy ghost on my mind for a while the comforter will not come unto you but if i depart i will send him unto you and when he is come when he the comforter is not just a feeling it's a person when he the comforter when he the spirit of truth is a person when he is come he will reprove the word of sin and of righteousness and of judgment of sin because they believe not on me amen praise the lord [Music] jesus says that you he will reprove the word another another uh sense of that word is that he will convict the holy ghost is the convicting power he will convict he were convinced brother used his very scripture when he preached a message convincing concern he preached he used this when he preached a message to god he used this when he preached what is the holy ghost giving for of sin because they believe not on me of righteousness because i go to my father and ye see me normal of joshua because the prince of this world is george i have yet many things to say unto you but ye cannot bear them now how be it when he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come praise the lord let us pray heavenly father in the name of the lord jesus christ o god we pray tonight that you will come with father lord and and just pour your blessings lord upon your word oh god i pray father may the holy ghost the convicting power lord the one that convict and convince lord and make us concerned of the hours and the time that we are living in we pray that father may that spirit come with god and lord jesus just capture us for the moment dear lord father capture us who god may we now be carried away oh father we thanks on our minds and oh god we pray father even for our invisible audience of god that your grace law will also be with them o god father we ask the lord god you will also capture them with father we pray we ask your blessings now to just be with us in the name of the lord jesus we pray with faith and thanksgiving in jesus name amen praise the lord the lord bless you you may have your seat amen praise the lord praise the lord are there people in the house [Music] amen praise the lord we thank the lord for being so kind to us for being gracious amen he's uh he's a merciful god amen so hallelujah brother brandon said this in the message the guide i don't have that above my my notes i just sent i think one or two codes back there that i want to use tonight but he said this he said he says now i wish to read tonight a portion of scripture found over in the book of saint john now this little scripture that we read and referred to to give us a basic for what we are trying to say and always i have never one time as i ever remember of ever coming to the pulpit to try to just say something to be sane i've always tried to wait watch steady pray i've always tried to wait watch steady pray and i believe that uh you know a man has to has to be in this channel you know it's not it's not uh you know just to find the opportunity to come and and thinking that in talking something will come on my heart i will say it praise the lord you have to wait amen you have to watch you have to study you have to pray praise the lord he says until i feel that i have something that will help the people if i can be a help then there is no need of me to be standing here praise the lord if i don't have a message we would just pray we're having 1000 plus messages we can find a portion and and play it for you praise the lord amen if i can be your help then there is no need of me to be standing here see try to help and now tonight cause the the bigger part of our crowd has moved out from this morning oh okay he's referring tonight to that he says but tonight i told you if i stay over we will try to have just about a 45 minutes talk on something that i hope will help us now whatever he was going to talk about was not this now what i'm going to talk about but i'm using that context that will have a 45 minutes talk on something that i hope will help us but i believe they are all in the same channel amen because it's all going to be talking about the holy ghost you can never underestimate the holy ghost you can never get talking you know there is i believe that there is no message must be preached without making the emphasis of the holy ghost with without reminding us how important that holy ghost is because that that is a captain for the mother of father the holy ghost is the preacher praise the lord he's the preacher and to make more emphasis the holy ghost is the believer amen the holy ghost preaches the word the holy ghost say amen back to the word amen are we together so tonight i just i just uh wrote a kind of a long uh uh uh sentence there he reproved the word of sin righteousness and of judgment i want to take a a a little time and and just talk on that i i try to speak on that one time and uh uh you know and and now we we uh we want to go back to to the top of that he reproved the word i think i was talking on conviction you know i was talking on the power of conviction when we when we read that scripture and never really never had a time to to be able to to to rest on it but he will reprove the word he will convict the word amen he will bring such a conviction that is the reason why the holy ghost is saying he will bring such a conviction brother abraham says not on the the cost mode of the world but to the people of the world three things the holy ghost would do the holy ghost will convince us praise the lord that we are all born in sin and shipley in iniquity amen and how much we need a savior praise the lord the holy ghost will convince us of that if we are relying on our natural birth or uh our family that we are born in or the the nation where we came from or our tribe whatever we are if we are still leaning to death then we need more exposure to the holy ghost we need him to deal with us we need him to speak to us because jesus said that's the reason why the spirit of truth would come he says that's the reason why i must go for the comforter to come because when he come he will be the the the final one that will nail this thing down he will convict us he will he will convince us uh uh uh brings us to the place to realize you know how much we cannot rely on our first birth how much we need a new birth praise the lord and after he have done that then he will also bring us to an understanding amen he will bring us to an understanding of righteousness he will also convince us of righteousness how we have become the righteousness of god the people that were not a people amen a people that were born in sin that that that struggle with different habits and and and different desires uh uh he will he would convince us of what christ have done in our life or what god he will convince us uh in a sense that he would take us back to see uh uh how he watched over us how he protected us you know even when we did not know him in in any instances where we would have died and in and die in that situation our life will be lost praise the lord he will convince us that he's not playing game with our life praise the lord he will convince us that there is no influence that have harvard over us there is no habit there is no nature or or how you can call it inbound tenancy there is no family traits that the gospel cannot deal with he will convict us of that that there is there will be nothing in our life we will limit god at all amen amen he will he will convince us of our first birth he will convince us of our new birth and then also he will convince us that which of course is is joshua now jesus says that the prince of this word is josh so in one sense he would deal with the the the unbeliever he would deal with the believer and he would de-wave uh uh the prince of the power of the air the man that started you know it's almost like brother bram says you know is is the 3s is uh is uh since seph and the devil satan amen so it's right in there since seven satan so he will he will deal with us on that so we want to we want to look at we want to follow that a little bit year through the scripture and uh you know and and uh trust that the grace of god will will help us tonight amen we trust that the grace of god will help us tonight hallelujah you love the lord tonight amen praise the lord we love him tonight we love him every moment of our lives amen so he will reprove the word of sin he will reprove the word of sin in many places brother branham uh uh talk about sin he defines sin and we will take one tonight administrative spleen he says what is sin what is saying not drinking not smoking not gambling not rejecting church sin is unbelief praise the lord amen sin is unbelief now so you see jesus jesus there he he actually he says when he is come he will reprove the word of sin in verse 9 of sin because they believe not amen it is said he will he will he will reprove the word of sin because they were smoking or they were living in adultery he said no he will reprove the word of sin because they believe not are we together amen so the last time when we talked on this we were trying to show through the scripture how the bible uses sin and sins and in the way the bible uses the two words is to be able to show us seeing its own belief and where the scriptures point to our mistakes the bible uses the word saints with an s praise the lord amen so we we we try to show there because uh uh uh by by the grace of god if if if you know if if if the lord can help us to understand that if he can convict us of that then uh a uh understanding brings strength it brings victory man you know it it helps the believer it does not give him a license you know for him to to you know to says well that you know i've made a mistake it seems it's not it's not unbelief it does not give him a license it's just it's just helping because it gets him to the place where uh uh he's not constantly on a condemnation from the enemy praise the lord he's not on a condemnation because uh uh uh he uh gulfed these with that uh uh power that spirit of condemnation that haunts the believer that's the reason why jesus said there is no condemnation to them that are in christ amen that's the first thing where the the holy ghost comes to deal with us it comes to take us out of condemnation because you don't leave the fish in the water to clean it you got to get the fish out first amen you got to get the fish out then now before you start cleaning it to get a good fry fish so he have to take us out of condemnation praise the lord amen but because the the the devil is is is uh you know he's very good in his game he's called the accuser of the brethrens amen so he keeps going back and and and reminding us of of you know of things that we do just just to keep poking on that spot because he knows there is no way we can fully stand in justification there is no way we can fully stand as the righteousness of christ if we are condemned yes sir praise the lord no this is not this is not hair knowledge it is it's not it's not just an intellectual thing that you know in your mind the bible says i'm i you know what there's no condemnation unto me no that's that's not only that but god wants us to to be free he wants to get in there and deal with the guilt praise the lord amen and see that the where that notable statement was taken from you know a pattern is not a pattern until it had been received as a pardon the pattern was given to the man the reason why he did not receive it is because he was still dealing with guilt right amen he never felt that he could be forgiven of the things that he has done praise the lord he never felt that he could be forgiving so uh uh uh he he he never accepted the pattern you see so the the the word comes like like jesus said uh there in revelation to lose us free us from guilt amen thank you lord jesus christ it comes to free us from guilt but because we are we we are finished being and one thing about our finite nature is that we don't forget we don't have that ability to just completely never remember it we don't have it we just we constantly try to put it away so of course the devil knows that we have that ability that we can't forget so what he does he remind us amen he reminds you and when and when that when they are taught when that sense of thought comes it connects in here to look for a guilty feeling praise the lord you see that's the reason why we have to get down there and and be watched by the watching of the word amen we have to take the word and and let the word be applied down the letter word just just receive the word amen what are you baby what are you drinking whatever you do let the word just get right in there and deal with every feeling of guilt because no matter how much you com you confess there is no condemnation unto them that are in christ if guilt is lying down there if the holy ghost have not got down there and deal with guilt praise the lord whenever the devil reminds you you will feel guilty praise the lord but when the holy ghost have dead with guilt amen when the devil reminds you you say thank you jesus for setting me free every time he remind you you say thank you jesus instead of going to guild you start to praise you go to place you say oh thank you jesus what a horrible person i was oh my god praise the lord man see where you took me from lord hallelujah praise the lord yes oh but i mean you can you you can you you can you can pretend it you can you can try to play it but when guilt is not there with when guilt is not dead with all the devil has to do is just remind you praise the lord then your mind starts traveling in that realm praise the lord then the sense of guilt starts bringing the sensation of lust the sense of guilt right there start bringing the sensation it stops it starts reminding you of the feeling of what it was oh man then he just he had just made the water muddy then you're just miserable now your whole mind is just blown and then oh god have mercy then you just oh man lord god lord i need the holy ghost praise the lord but when he deeds with guilt when that when that when that uh uh holy ghost fire gets down there and deals with guilt praise the lord no matter how he reminds you i mean you can you can even meet the very person you committed the art with whether you were smoking together or whatever you were doing whoever it is you can meet that very same person you can greet them with a with a warm greeting praise the lord when the sense of guilt is dead with there is no condemnation praise the lord you don't feel embarrassed to say look this this guy was my smoking booty right my friend you better stop that thing that crazy thing we used to do you better stop it you don't feel embarrassed because there is no root there is no connection you don't see they come oh that guy we used to smoke together let me get away from here are we together well all of these were not part of my nose i don't know where it's coming from amen i just want to just do a little little uh kind of a bible our status tonight amen praise the lord what a wonderful jesus we sell amen we love the lord because he's a wonderful god amen one of our one of our our our favorite scripture that we love to read on this is first john first john let's go to first john [Music] the apostle john there with this he there with it uh in a way that we we we want to follow yet a little bit this is this is very this is very the first john to save time verse 8 if we say that we have no sin amen uh let's let's drop back a little bit verse 6. let's take verses if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lied and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanses us from all sin so that's that's what we're talking about that's that's what we are dealing with that sin nature that's what we are talking that's that's where the guilt is amen that's what the guilt is [Music] that's in nature the blood of jesus christ cleanses us from all sin so even with this thought there there uh there are there are few things that are that are related here we see the uh the apostle paul is is relating walking in the light amen walking in the light with uh uh the blood of jesus christ the son of god that cleanses us from all sin someone said oh preacher said he says this is this is the gospel by the soap he says this is the christian body of soul are we together and if we say we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us if we confess our sins praise the lord he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins praise the lord and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness so right here we see how the apostle uh john brings that out in a way that uh when when the when uh when when the when the believer is safe or when when when a son of god or the daughter of god is saved when god has got down there uh to to convince of our wrong and to capture our life what the word what the blood does because the blood here is the word amen when we walk in the light the light is the word of god jesus is the light of the world amen the light of god is is the word of god and we realize uh uh uh uh revelation chapter one you know uh he have seven golden candlesticks so it comes down also to the light of god for every dispensation and you know all of that i know you know that i'm just going over that a little bit so we realize here there's a word for every age to be able to to to get right in there not to make you uh uh a religious person but the word of the age is to be able to go in there it must it must be able to to convict you amen and address that same question that unbelief question praise the lord so the word goes to to to to to capture you capture your mind and and and starts to address that unbelief question are we together because it has to deal with the same nature it has to cleanse the believer so he says that if we if we say that you know well there is no unbelief in us he says you know we are telling lies it's because the truth has not come in yet you are just practicing religion you have just make your own religion to convince yourself that you are pleasing god but when the truth comes in amen it goes right in there to be able to pick up that unbelief nature amen now so you see the thing there is that the word do not start working from outside the words start working from inside because it's an incorruptible seed the seed must go into the earth so the word goes right inside and and and why you i mean you are you are believing the word look look for example the first thing the word shows you that baptism is in the name of the lord jesus christ oh glory be to god you you are happy what is he doing it's it's growing inside there amen that there is not three goddess only one god that was manifested in in in uh uh uh three manifestations this sensation whichever way we want to call it oh praise the lord amen a little light of the world comes and and you see the uh uh you know uh uh uh uh the word uh requiring us to to to live right you rejoice in it so that very very truth that word of the hour or that truth on the scripture they have now comes to you go in there today's the wave the same question praise the lord it goes in there to deal with the sin question now a conflict starts you know the godhead you know the truth about water baptism you know that a woman must not preach you know what the strip how much the scripture require you to dress decent and live decent you have you have all the knowledge of that but yet in the members of your body you are struggling praise the lord amen now so you will see you will realize here is that it is it is the truth that you have received the truth of the word that you have received right there there is there is there is that where paul said with our controversy great is the mystery of god that mistress be beginning to open to you now so it is that mystery now they have that that that is now open to your eyes that is also now making you to realize how much all of these these uh uh uh uh scenes this this mistake lying is that truth that you have received that is not magnifying this to you because one was living on a false doctrine praise the lord living under the false doctrine let me take take take for the example if if a man is believing that uh you know uh uh i mean you have to you have to oh i mean this this this is a very very powerful deception powerful deception that have i've been i've been kind of for uh uh reading uh recently uh i've been reading the ball cane and uh uh for the brandon read that book and uh and it's it's so powerful this is the way that that that the catholic church got the people into the mirror washing it makes you to realize that uh uh it brings the scene just like solomon and his brother the one that wanted the damn that was at the feet of david he couldn't go to solomon to ask he went to solomon's mother praise the lord why because the the the deception there is that the mother have the heart of the son so if the son is angry with you talk to the mother praise the lord amen that's what are the feasts of kenneth the disciples they were went to the mother oh yes right right praise the lord amen but what happened there the word corrects the error jesus right there says woman because there are spirit there is there is something i'm looking into and we would deal with uh i mean very powerful deception that has run through the church it has run through christianity praise the lord it has run through every revival and it's even incompetent around this revival men that preach legalizing and and and want to have control over over the people instead of exposing them to the holy ghost are feeding from that same root so you just think about that now somebody that believed that that if the son is angry with you you talk to the mother every mother knows how to go to the heart of their son so that is one of the principal deception of catholicism that is ruling over even the protestant church praise the lord that is one of the most now so no matter what the person do because now they have been taught they have access to the mother they can just go to the mother and because the mother also now has the power to hold the wrath of the sun so it's easy it's very easy 12 o'clock i just go and tell the mother i'm sorry that i did this i know i can go by three o'clock again to tell the mother so you see there is no desire there is no will to get out of that sinful life why because there is no word that magnify the wrong but when the true word of god comes praise the lord and that word drops down in your heart it haunts you to know that you are living wrong [Music] so it keeps you it keeps you in a sense of guilt not to condemn you is only identifying there is something there that we need to deal with amen that's the reason why the scripture call it here the light if we walk in the light what the light does it exposes everything that is around everything that is in darkness praise the lord so then when that is a spouse then it brings us to the place now where the scriptures say if we confess our sins why we confess our sins is because the light have exposed our sin the light has brought us now to the place to make us to realize because we are born honor the sinful nature that's why we have the tendency of telling lies and doing things that we're not supposed to do praise the lord so in us in as much as the light now starts to uh uh uh uh starts to become bright it starts to uh brighten or shine around that thing and we are drawn to oh my god is that really what happened in the garden of eden it was adultery so you means that that thing runs through the blood of every breath every breath is something that happened between eve and the serpent praise the lord now you see as the word starts to expose and and starts to shine on that and you're understanding what it makes you to hit your first birth no matter whether it was male clinic or wherever you were born i don't want to be identified with that because when you run it back it goes right back to eve and the serpent are we together he will reprove the word of sin because they believe not amen they believe not in me but branham says sin it's not drinking smoking gambling rejecting the church sin is unbelief is that right he that believeth not is condemned already you are not destroyed or separated from god because you are a sinner you are separated from god because you refuse to walk in him to walk in his provided way which is the light he that walk in the light god provide a light of every age yes praise the lord the same way that's the catholic belief that you have to go to the mother to soften the heart of the sun is the same thing that just settled down in pentecostal speaking in tongues is the evidence of the holy ghost it's the same thing so as soon as you can say you are you can speak in tongues you can live any way you want to live because now you have the holy ghost you see that deception it does not deal with the same question it does not go in there and take out guilt because now you have something the church has given you you have no reason to feed guilt because now you you felt the spirit you can shake a little bit and speak in tongues praise the lord not casting down the the the gift of god because it's a gift of god it's a true gift of god but you see when the church give it to the people as an evidence that's all you need to do then it does not these wave the guilt problem right praise the lord and just like we were saying i mean if you believe the message amen if you believe the message of the hour you have it it does not deal with the same problem you are only taking what the church gave you are we together so you see the holy ghost the spirit of truth has come to convict us of sin praise the lord to de-wave the same problem to bring an answer to the same question praise the lord to bring an answer to the same question what is the same question we talk about it you know he brought an answer to the same question what is the same question the same question is in the missing link the same question is in the missing line how how did a man that was made in the image of god how a man that was made in the image of god he made man male and female praise the lord he came right out of god as son of god how how did how did he now have to deal with a contaminated blood when god was the creator of every nails of his body god was the creator if adam had blood in him god gave him blood that's right the same question is how did that blood got contaminated how a man that was made from the great fountain of truth how did he start telling lies because his blood was missed praise the lord are we together that's the same question now with that blood now being missed a man is becoming another breed it looks like more of the contaminated blood is beginning to run through his vein that he's losing the pure blood that he had from the beginning he had more desire to do evil and live wrong then to do right now the question is how will he get back that's good brother that's very good yes how will he get back praise the lord how will he get back will he ever get back to the state of of innocence will he ever get back to the place where he will remember no evil will he ever get back to the place where he will live in pure conscious and if he would have ever how will he get back [Music] glory be to god [Music] jesus said that's the reason why i must go when the comforter comes he will deal with that he says many things i have to say to you but you can't bear them now you can bear them there praise the lord i can i can tell you about a separate sea because you can't bear it i can tell you about a high breed that took place in the garden of eden you can't bear it now but when the comforter comes he will guess right there in your heart he will start from just a simple godhead subject praise the lord thank you jesus just a simple understanding of godhead trying to straighten you from from from trinity teachings just that simple truth he will use to waver his way down there to start dealing with that same nature hallelujah praise the lord that's the reason why every time the word is revealed to you and you rejoice in the word praise the lord glory be to god the word drops right in there it it it breaks out some of the guilt amen every time that truth drop in there you praise god thank you jesus the word drops in there it breaks some of the guilt praise the lord and the things that used to bother you and make you feel so guilty they don't make you feel guilty again every time you think about it well thank you jesus lord i'm very grateful and i'm so grateful that you have changed my life you see so the world do not deal with us from outside that's the reason why brother abraham said christ in the mystery of god revealed he says that you cannot make converts by government you cannot be changed by laws don't do this don't do that no what changes you is the truth of the world that is preached when you rejoice in the word praise the lord amen if you want to change you better learn to start rejoicing in the word amen you better start learning to rejoice in the word and learning to say amen thank you jesus and say god is nothing but the truth praise the lord we try to be smart we just sit down there and i really want to understand this and all you want to do is just go and prove that you have understand better and you want to teach somebody so because of that the word just sticks here and it can't get down here praise the lord hallelujah [Music] but that's how we get watched that's how we get cleaned it's when we rejoice in the truth praise the lord and say thank you jesus hallelujah oh my are we together oh praise the lord what a wonderful jesus we serve amen glory be to god amen glory be to god yes but warren it's a wow amen it's a wow it's when we stand in our of the word that's when we say wow when people say wow which means they have seen something that you have not seen some kind of a picture has been created in their spirit wow they have seen jesus in a new way lord i've never seen you like this wow you are beautiful praise the lord now so we we see this i'm going to come back to this again i'm going to come back to this to this subject again and praise the lord [Music] now because uh uh i'm i'm kind of for taking this in a way now to to uh to to deal with the believer but uh uh um after after the believer is uh is is convinced of his wrong praise the lord and after that word starts to deal with him and starts to cleanse him then now then now the word push him over down into chapter into verse 10. word jesus said he will reprove the word of righteousness because i go to my father and you see me normal praise the lord amen even though you don't you don't you don't see me normal visible but he would he will reprove the word he will convict the word of righteousness let me bring it in this way so we will understand it he will convict the word that there was one that was born amen whose blood was not connected to the contaminated blood from eve and the serpent praise the lord but how will he convict the world of righteousness when he's gone and we see him no more because that life will now be reproduced in the life of a bunch of people on earth hallelujah yes praise the lord even though their first birth they are connected to the contaminated blood amen but a new life starts to spring through them and now they are having a desire to worship god they're having a desire to read his word praise the lord amen that's right they are living a life that is contrary to the contaminated blood cells amen just like the pharisees said it's not his father joseph and his mother married or they can print to your father and your mother but yet your life is your life is is is is it's a paradox to them they know your family background from a bunch of drunkards from a bunch of drugs either but this one praise the lord are we together let's read this from from from uh from the prophet of god he says pointing to this very same scripture brother brown is now reading john chapter 16. he said jesus said the things that i do shall you do also is that right the same thing that i do you will do even greater for i go to my father and he said a little while and the word won't see me no more that's the unbelievers the customer the word other will see me normal yeah yet you will see me the believers for i will be with you even in you to the end of the word now listen to this he says now the attribute of that one perfect christian life the attribute of that one perfect christian life that was involved in one man praise the lord will be in a group of people and will be laid till the second coming the attribute of that one perfect christian life that is not connected to the contaminated blood cells will be in a group of people that's the reason why it will convict the word of righteousness amen to show that we are serving a resurrected christ it's not just a history of a man that came and spent three years to say he healed us say he raised the dead now what they said is what he's doing now praise the lord the resurrected christ live in us hallelujah amen praise the lord he will convince the world of righteousness because they will look at your past life they look at your present life they cannot compare the two they can't find they can't find a joint link as they couldn't find the missing link now they can't find what joined you through your past life we know how to be this but this one we don't know which eye it is we don't know where he came from or where she came from are we together you see that's that that is that's the reason why the holy ghost is our principal team that's what the holy ghost is giving for amen that's why we cannot just make the holy ghost at taught we cannot make the holy ghost a feeling is he is he the holy ghost he's a person it's a person i want to come that want to move in a new tenor a new tenor want to move in kick the old guy out he's been breaking the lord [Applause] enjoy yourself [Applause] praise the lord amen [Music] oh praise the lord hallelujah what a wonderful girl we serve amen let's give the lord a hand of praise let's turn to our feet tonight and just worship him amen amen praise the lord hallelujah amen let's just sing that song together uh uh high grade is our
