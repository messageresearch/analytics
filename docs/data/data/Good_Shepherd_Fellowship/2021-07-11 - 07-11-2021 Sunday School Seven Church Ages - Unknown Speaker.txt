========================================

[Music] whoever heard of a son being eternal sons have beginnings but that which is eternal never had a beginning he is the eternal god jehovah manifested in the flesh in saint john's gospel it says in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us he was the true and faithful witness to the father's eternal word he was a prophet and could say what the father bad him say he said my father is in me that is what jesus the tabernacle said my father is in me god has many titles our righteousness and our peace and ever-present and father and son and holy ghost but he has only one human name and that name is jesus don't be confused because he has three offices or that he has a three-fold manifestation on earth he was a prophet in heaven he is the priest and coming back to earth he is king of kings he that was that is jesus the prophet he that is that is he the high priest making intercession one who can be touched with the feelings of our infirmities which is to come that is the coming king on earth he was the word the prophet moses said of him the lord your god will raise up a prophet like unto me and it will come to pass if they don't hear the words of that prophet they will be cut off from amongst the people notice these facts about jesus on earth he was prophet lamb and son this did not make him three these were but manifestations or offices of the one person jesus now there is a very favorite portion of scripture that the trinitarians think proved their point of more than one actual person in the godhead it is revelation 5 6 through 8 and i beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent forth into all the earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them harps and golden vials full of odors which are the prayers of saints indeed these verses if isolated would seem to prove their point you notice i said these isolated verses however read revelation four two through three and nine through eleven and immediately i was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne and he that set was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone and there was a rainbow round about the throne in sight like unto an emerald and when those beasts give glory and honor and thanks to him that sat on the throne who liveth forever and ever the four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne and worship him that liveth forever and ever and cast their crowns before the throne saying thou art worthy o lord to receive glory and honor and power for thou hast created all things and for thy pleasure they are and were created carefully note in verse 2 it says one not two or three but one sat on the throne in verse three it says he not they was to look upon as a jasper stone in verse 9 it says that the beasts gave honor to him not them in verse 10 it says that the elders fell down before him not them in verse 11 it says that they cried thou art worthy o lord not lords also in verse 11 it says this one on the throne was the creator which is jesus john 1 3 which is jehovah spirit god of the old testament genesis 1 1 but let us not stop there read now in revelation 3 21 to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also overcame and am set down with my father in his throne also read hebrews 12 2 looking unto jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of god notice that according to jesus himself who wrote the revelation he has sat down with the father the spirit in paul which spirit is the spirit of christ for that is the spirit of prophecy whereby the word comes says he is set down at the right hand of god but when john looked he saw only one upon the throne and it was not until revelation 5 6-8 which follows revelation 4 2-3 in sequence of time that we see the lamb taking the book from him that sat on the throne as indicated in revelation 4 2 through 3 and 9-10 what is it it is the mystery of one god he jesus came out from god became manifested in flesh died and rose again and returned to the bosom of the father as john said the only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father he has declared him john 1 18 it was now time for god messiah to come back to claim his bride and then present himself make himself known to israel thus we see god again stepping forth to assume a physical relationship to man as the son of david king of kings and lord of lords and bridegroom of the gentile bride it is not two gods but simply one god manifesting his mighty triune offices and titles the people knew he was a prophet they knew the sign of the messiah which could come only through the prophet john 1 44-51 now philip was of bethsaida the city of andrew and peter philip findeth nathanael and saith unto him we have found him of whom moses in the law and the prophets did right jesus of nazareth the son of joseph and nathanael said unto him can there any good thing come out of nazareth philip sayeth unto him come and see jesus saw nathanael coming to him and saith of him behold an israelite indeed in whom there is no guile nathanael saith unto him whence knowest thou me jesus answered and said unto him before that philip called thee when thou wasted under the fig tree i saw thee nathanael answered and saith unto him rabbi thou art the son of god thou art the king of israel jesus answered and said unto him because i said unto thee i saw thee under the fig tree believeth thou thou shalt see greater things than these and he saith unto him verily verily i say unto you hereafter you shall see heaven open and the angels of god ascending and descending upon the son of man the ability to discern the hard thoughts in men made the elect of god to understand that here was the messiah the anointed word of god hebrews 4 12 for the word of god is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart when the woman at the well heard him discern the thoughts of her heart she acclaimed him a prophet declaring that messiah would be known for that great ability john 4 7-26 there cometh a woman of samaria to draw water jesus saith unto her give me to drink for his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat then saith the woman of samaria unto him how is it that thou being a jew ask us drink of me which i am a woman of samaria for the jews have no dealings with the samaritans jesus answered and said unto her if thou knewest the gift of god and who it is that saith to thee give me to drink thou what is to have asked of him and he would have given thee living water the woman saith unto him sir thou has nothing to draw with and the well is deep from once then hast thou that living water art thou greater than our father jacob which gave us the well and drank thereof himself and his children and his cattle jesus answered and said unto her whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again but whosoever drinketh of the water that i shall give him shall never thirst but the water that i shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life the woman saith unto him sir give me this water that i thirst not neither come hither to draw jesus saith unto her go call thy husband and come hither the woman answered and said i have no husband. jesus said unto her thou hast well said i have no husband for thou hast had five husbands and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband and that says thou truly the woman saith unto him sir i perceive that thou art a prophet our fathers worshiped in this mountain and you say that in jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship jesus saith unto her woman believe me the hour cometh when ye shall neither in this mountain nor yet at jerusalem worship the father ye worship ye know not what we know what we worship for salvation is of the jews but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship him god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth the woman saith unto him i know that messiahs cometh which is called christ when he has come he will tell us all things jesus saith unto her i that speak unto thee am he in revelations 15 3 it says and they sing the song of moses the servant of god and the song of the lamb saying great and marvelous are thy works lord god almighty just and true are thy ways thou king of saints do you see it the lamb the high priest holding his blood as an atonement on the mercy seat for our sins is the lord god almighty that is his present office that is what he is doing now pleading his blood for our sins but one day that lamb will become the lion of the tribe of judah he will come forth in power and glory and take his authority to reign as king he is the coming king of this earth of course that does not say he is not king now for he is our king king of the saints right now it is a spiritual kingdom it is not of this world system even as we are not of this world that's the reason we act different from the world our citizenship is in heaven we reflect the spirit of the world of our rebirth where jesus is the king that is why our women do not dress in men's clothing or cut their hair or use all those cosmetics and other things that the world likes so much that is why our men don't drink and smoke and carry on in sin our dominion is the dominion over sin and it is enforced through the power that is in the spirit of christ that indwells us every kingdom on earth is going to be torn down but ours will remain now we've been talking about the offices and manifestations of the one true god and beholding his glory in a scriptural study but he is not to be known intellectually he is known spiritually by spiritual revelation this same one who was known as jesus after the flesh went back to the pillar of fire but he promised he would come again and dwell amongst his people by the spirit and on the day of pentecost that pillar of fire came down and it separated itself in tongues of fire upon each one of them what was god doing he was separating himself into the church giving all those men and women a part of himself he divided himself amongst his church just as he said he would john 14 16-23 and i will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter but he may abide with you forever even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye see me because i live ye shall live also at that day ye shall know that i am in my father and ye in me and i in you he that have my commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and i will love him and will manifest myself to him judas saith unto him not iscariot lord how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us and not unto the world jesus answered and said unto him if a man love me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our abode with him he said that he would pray the father who would send another comforter who was with them the disciples already but not in them that was christ then in verse 23 speaking of himself and the father he said we will come there it is the spirit is coming the same spirit of god that manifested as the father and as the son and will yet manifest in the many one god who is spirit that's why no man can ever come along and say the holy man is a pope or the holy man is a bishop or priest the holy man is christ the holy spirit in us how dare the hierarchy declare the laity has no word to say each one has something to say each has a work each has a ministry the holy ghost came at pentecost and separated himself on each that it might be fulfilled whereof christ said at that day ye shall know that i am in my father and ye in me and i in you john 14 20. the great i am the almighty god has come as spirit to fill his true church he has a right to move anywhere he wants to and upon anybody he wants to we don't make any holy men amongst us but the whole true congregation of the lord is holy because of the presence of the holy spirit it is he the holy spirit that is holy not the congregation of itself now that is the revelation jesus christ is god the jehovah of the old testament is the jesus of the new no matter how hard you try you can't prove there are three gods but it also takes a revelation by the holy spirit to make you understand the truth that he is one it takes a revelation to see that the jehovah of the old testament is the jesus of the new satan crept into the church and blinded the people to this truth and when they were blinded to it it wasn't long until the church of rome stopped baptizing in the name of the lord jesus christ i admit that it takes a real revelation from the holy ghost to see the truth about the godhead these days when we are in the midst of the perverting of so much scripture but the prevailing overcoming church is built on revelation so we can expect god to reveal his truth to us however you actually don't need a revelation on water baptism it is right there staring you in the face would it be possible for one minute for the apostles to be led astray from a direct command of the lord to baptize in the name of the father and the son and the holy ghost and then find them in willful disobedience they knew what the name was and there is not one place in scripture where they baptized any other way than in the name of the lord jesus christ common sense would tell you that the book of acts is the church in action and if they baptize that way then that is the way to baptize now if you think that is strong what do you think of this anyone who was not baptized in the name of the lord jesus had to be baptized over again acts 19 1-6 and it came to pass that while apollos was at corinth paul having passed through the upper coasts came to ephesus and finding certain disciples he said unto them have you received the holy ghost since he believed and they said unto him we have not so much as heard whether there be any holy ghost and he said unto them unto what then were ye baptized and they said unto john's baptism then said paul john barely baptized with the baptism of repentance saying unto the people that they should believe on him what should come after him that is on christ jesus when they heard this they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus and when paul had laid his hands upon them the holy ghost came on them and they spake with tongues and prophesied there it is these good people at ephesus had heard about the coming messiah john had preached him they were baptized unto repentance of sins looking forward to believing on jesus but now it was time to look back to jesus and be baptized unto remission of sins it was time to receive the holy ghost and when they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ paul laid his hands on them and the holy ghost came upon them all those dear folks at ephesus were fine people and if anyone had a right to feel secure they did notice how far they had come they had come all the way up to accepting the coming messiah they were ready for him but don't you see that in spite of that they had missed him he had come and gone they needed to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ they needed to be filled with the holy ghost if you have been baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ god will fill you with his spirit that is the word acts 19 6 which we read was the fulfilling of acts 2 38 repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost see paul by the holy ghost said exactly what peter said by the holy ghost and what was said cannot be changed it has to be the same from pentecost until the very last elected one has been baptized galatians 1 8 but though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you let him be accursed now some of you oneness people baptize wrong you baptize for regeneration as though being immersed in water saved you regeneration does not come by water it is a work of the spirit the man who by the holy ghost gave the command repent and be baptized everyone in the name of the lord jesus did not say that water regenerated he said it was only an evidence of a good conscience toward god that was all first peter 3 21 the like figure where unto even baptism doth also now save us not the putting away of the filth of the flesh but the answer of a good conscience toward god by the resurrection of jesus christ i believe it if anyone has any false ideas that history can prove water baptism in any other way than in the name of the lord jesus christ i would advise you to read the histories and find out for yourself the following is a true record of a baptism which took place in rome a d 100 and was reproduced in time magazine december 5th 1955. the deacon raised his hand and publius deseas stepped through the baptistry door standing waist deep in the pool was marcus vasquez the wood cellar he was smiling as publius waded into the pool beside him cradies he asked credo responded publius i believe that my salvation comes from jesus the christ who was crucified under pontius pilate with him i died that with him i may have eternal life then he felt strong arms supporting him as he let himself fall backward into the pool and heard marcus voice in his ear i baptize you in the name of the lord jesus as the cold water closed over him right up until the truth was lost and did not return until this last age this is from nicaea till the turn of this century they baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ but it has come back satan can't keep the revelation down when the spirit wants to give it yes if there were three gods you might very well baptize for a father and a son and a holy ghost but the revelation given to john was that there is one god and his name is lord jesus christ and you baptize for one god and only one that is why peter baptized the way he did at pentecost he had to be true to the revelation which was let all the house of israel know assuredly that god hath made that same jesus whom ye have crucified both lord and christ there he is the lord jesus christ if jesus is both lord and christ then he jesus is and cannot be else but father son and holy ghost in one person manifested in the flesh it is not god in three persons blessed trinity but one god one person with three major titles with three offices manifesting those titles hear it once more this same jesus is both lord and christ lord father and christ holy spirit are jesus for he jesus is both of them lord and christ if that doesn't show us the true revelation of the godhead nothing will lord is not another one christ is not another one this jesus is the lord jesus christ one god philip one day said to jesus lord show us the father and it will suffice us jesus said unto him have i been so long with you and you don't know me he that has seen me has seen the father so why do you say show us the father i and my father are one i quoted that once and a lady said just a minute mr branham you and your wife are one i said not that kind she said i beg your pardon so i said to her do you see me she said yes i said do you see my wife she said no i said then that oneness is a different kind for he said when you see me you see the father the prophet said that it would be light at the evening time in the hymn it is written it'll be light in the evening time the path to glory you will surely find in the waterway that's the light today buried in the precious name of jesus young and old repent of all your sin the holy ghost will surely enter in the evening light has come it is a fact that god and christ are one not too long ago i was talking to a jewish rabbi he said to me you gentiles can't cut god in three pieces and give him to a jew we know better than that i said to him that's just it rabbi we don't cut god in three pieces you believe the prophets don't you he said certainly i do do you believe isaiah 9 6 yes who was the prophet speaking of messiah i said what relation will messiah be to god he said he will be god i said that's right amen you can't put god into three persons or three parts you can't tell a jew that there is a father and a son and a holy ghost he will tell you right quick where that idea came from the jews know this creed was established at the nicene council no wonder they scorn us as heathen we talk about a god that does not change the jews believe that too but the church changed its unchanging god from one to three but the light is returning at even tide how striking it is that this truth has come at the time when the jews are returning to palestine god and christ are one this jesus is both lord and christ john had the revelation and jesus was the revelation and he produced himself right here in the scripture i am he that was which is and shall come the almighty amen if revelation is beyond you look up and seek god for it that is the only way you are ever going to get it a revelation has to come from god it never comes by human natural endowments but by spiritual endowment you can even memorize this scripture and though that is wonderful that won't do it it has to be a revelation from god it says in the word that no man can say that jesus is the christ except by the holy ghost you have to receive the holy ghost and then and only then can the spirit give you the revelation that jesus is the christ god the anointed one no man knows the things of god save the spirit of god and he to whom the spirit of god reveals them we need to call on god for revelation more than anything else in the world we have accepted the bible we have accepted the great truths of it but it still is not real to most people because the revelation by the spirit is not there the word has not been quickened the bible says in second corinthians 5 21 that we have become the righteousness of god by our union with jesus christ did you get it it says that we are the very righteousness of god himself by being in christ it says that he jesus became sin for us it does not say he became sinful but became sin for us that by our union with him we might become the righteousness of god if we accept the fact and we must that he literally became sin for us by his substitution for us then we must also accept the fact that we by our union with him have become the very righteousness of god to reject one is to reject the other to accept the one is to accept the other now we know the bible says that it can't be denied but the revelation of it is missing it is not real to the majority of god's children it is just a good verse in the bible but we need to have it made alive to us that will take revelation let me drop in something here that will both amaze and help you there is hardly a student that does not believe the new testament was originally in the greek language all are great bible students have said that god gave the world three great nations with three great contributions for the sake of the gospel he gave the greeks who gave a universal language he gave us the jews who gave us the true religion and true knowledge of god through the savior he gave us the romans who gave us a unified empire with law and a system of highways thus we have true religion the language to express it to many peoples and the government and roads to spread it physically and historically speaking this seems to be exactly right and today our greek scholars say that the greek language of bible days is so perfect and exact that if the student of the greek is a refined and accurate grammarian he can truly know exactly what the new testament word teaches but is this not only a theory is this true is it not so that every greek scholar of repute from one denomination debates another student of another denomination and is it not so that their arguments are based on identical greek words and identical rules of grammar certainly that is the way it is even back there in the pergam age just prior to the nicene council of 325 there were two great students arius and athanasius who became locked in doctrinal combat over a greek word so intense and so worldwide did their debate become that historians said the world was divided over a diphthong the sound of two vowels in a single syllable now if the greek is so perfect and so ordained of god why was there such a dispute surely god did not intend us all to know the greek right today we are having arguments over the greek take for instance the book christ's paralyzed church x-rayed by dr mcrossen in it he sets forth numerous quotes from many renowned greek grammarians and proves to his own satisfaction that the unchanging rules of greek grammar prove conclusively that the bible teaches a man is baptized with the holy ghost subsequent to rebirth he also states flatly that women can take over the pulpit because the word prophesy means to preach but has he convinced other students of the greek who are as able as he never all you have to do is read those students who hold the opposite view and hear their learned quotes now not only is what i have just said true but let us go a step further today we have some students who claim that the original manuscripts were written in the aramaic which was the language of jesus and the people of his day it is claimed by them that the people did not speak and write in the greek as is so commonly supposed and the fact is our historians are divided on that for example dr schoenfield a most brilliant student has from research proved to his satisfaction that the new testament was written in the vernacular of the greek speaking people of that day he builds up a fine case for his beliefs based on the various documents [Music] so [Music] you
