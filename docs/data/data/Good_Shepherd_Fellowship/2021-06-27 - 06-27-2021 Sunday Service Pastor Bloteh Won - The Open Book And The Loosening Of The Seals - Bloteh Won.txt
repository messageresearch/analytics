at the back here where we can have some food to share with one another but one other thing about it there too it kind of affords on the first sunday which is our convenience service and so i've been

those that want to stick around we'll stick around eat the food that is uh that is that is brought forth and uh maybe it around 40 it will come back into the building and then we will have a time of praise and prayer and if it's uh if we can get ourselves ready we might just have a communion service that evening praise the lord i wanted to speak a little bit uh on that but it's something that is very familiar to us so we will we will just trust the lord we hope that we'll visit this announcement again on on wednesday night praise law but that's why we're planning for the service next weekend and uh let's just play only believe while we take this uh prayer request to the lord this is a prayer request from brother wesley and he wants to remember his wife sister carrot uh she'd been having

father jesus is here [Music] jesus here all things are possible now that is [Music] jesus says all things are possible jesus is here [Music] jesus here jesus is here all things are possible that he's here praise the lord amen and now we want to just give this time to our young brother orlando he came over for work and his work is done and he was supposed to travel head back home yesterday over to the great city of texas to go and meet his wife and family did and being in church and this morning but uh i think the lord allowed for him to stop biting so we want to give him this opportunity to just uh come and say a few words before he leave us uh you know we are expecting the rapture to break in the morning amen so if we don't see him again we meet in the air praise the lord so brother llano you come forth amen jesus is here [Music] jesus [Music] is [Music] jesus [Music] amen and according to his word that is exactly where he is as he says in his word where two or three are gathered in his name there he is in the midst you come in his name i come in his name i greet you all in the name of the lord and savior jesus christ the opening scripture i think it was hebrews in chapter 11 and it talked about faith and i can truly say that i stand here today by faith i i wasn't planning on being here today uh because of my job and the way it is and the way the way it panned out it's been really hard on me to get here every sunday i work a lot of hours i think i had like almost 80 hours last week and 80 before that and 74 before that and it's really hard but by god's grace he's always allowed me to press through to get here every every every sunday since i've been here and so i spoke with a friend the other day and i told him i said you know everybody else that works they get a chance to get rest and i'm on the road going to church he said in my room my little room my apartment i mean just a disaster i mean just clothes everywhere and you know everything's clean but it's just you know i hadn't i never stopped take time to you know putting my things here and putting my just coming in and and uh so i said i was gonna stop today and i was gonna stop today and maybe stream services and take time and just you know see about see about me and um so he said yeah that's i think that may be a good idea and so that was friday and so saturday morning i woke up and an inspiration hit me and it says you know i got to get to church and uh you know nothing else matters in this world but being in god's presence and it's hard it's hard out there you know when you go to walmart when you go here and there and to find and be in his presence i mean there was a sermon that was preached here about how god cleaned us up and he washed our back and i remember that day god washed my back and he did a good job on it but then rubbing shoulders with the world throughout the week and and if i can't get here then i know what's going to happen you know because this is god's provided place this is where we come to get our power and our strength and i i encourage each of you do all you can to get to the house of god even if it kills you because i i'd rather god kill me then you know and so i got up and i packed my my little my little um car i said well you know i don't know how it's gonna work whether or not i'm just gonna drive all the way down or stop by the euro dolls i don't really know it just depends on what time we get off today i said but i'm going to church i'm not going to i'm not going to stop and and i just listened to a brother say if you take care of god's business got to take care of yours and and and and me coming here probably has a whole less a lot less to do with me than it is anything i don't really know how me coming here may affect you but i know me being here is really been a blessing and um and so so we had some accidents several accidents at work that i really thought that was gonna can our old job or our crew but it but it never happened and so and so we had an accident that happened that took place um friday and uh and uh but some kind of way you know god protected us and they they allowed us to remain and they fired one person instead of the whole crew and so um and so the next day was was this saturday in which i showed that i decided i wasn't going to let the devil hinder me from being in the house of god today and so that's when they told us first thing in the morning that we had to work today so my crew is working today and and so i i didn't get a wrong spirit i just praised god i said hey god knows and he knows and i went on and but before the end of the day panned it out my job was done i mean not just done for that day but done period and so and so it was disappointing because things didn't work out the way i planned um money money to be made i spend more money coming up here than i made you know and you know getting myself together but uh and so all of these all but you know all of a sudden i realized that god put something on my heart to be here this morning and so he'll bankrupt heaven to make sure that his word will not return to him void so if i if my job had to end however in the way it ended just for me to be here today glory to god and so i'm on my way now usually when my job's over with the first thing i want to do is get home to my wife i don't i'll drive 17 hours to get to my wife and she knows it and so when i when i packed up my car when i got off work i packed up my car i forgot all about that i had my suit already packed to come here my mind was going south and so my wife was on the phone and she went to talk and she went to saying you know baby um you know i don't really you know and i was just like i got to get off the phone you know i got to get out the phone so i got out the phone and i i relaxed myself i surrendered myself to god i i i surrendered my desires everything that i wanted i surrendered it to them right then and then something told me to call brother brooks so i called brother brooks and and i was just telling him some things that took place and so i asked him if i could pass by his way because i passed by his way on the way up here and so and so and i told him i said because i really want to come by and see i want to come to church today and so while we were talking and i had made up my mind through in the conversation that i was that i was that i was coming to church i was going to still make it to church regardless and right while i was speaking a bald eagle flew directly directly over the top of my car and had three eaglets behind it and it flew directly over my car and i'm on the phone and i'm like wow and so and so then you know and then we got the phone and before i called brother one you know um i'm gonna tell you uh if he ever got he weighed on you and issues you know when you get into the house of god he takes that away and and and and and this is the house of god as well but let me tell you something there's a little family that i visit brother your dog and they don't have to say nothing they don't have to tell me nothing i may not even see her when i get to her house he walks me in the door and sends me downstairs but when i enter into the house every time i i know i know i'm at home and i'm in a safe place and i'm talking about it all the cares and all the worries and all the problems and frustration they immediately dissipated just by stepping into their home so i don't know if you've ever been to their home if you got issues or whatever but i just say you better call them and say can we just come and spend a day at your house please you know it'd be worth the trip to going up there and seeing all that they have in the plants and you know the botany life that they have and that that they see about and i just want to say thank you for you know blessing me since i've been here and uh and so i i so then i called brother juan and i you know just told him what was going on and uh last night was last night was rough sleeping last night and uh but i got up this morning and my wife she just goes preaching and she goes to she's shouting and she's all happy and i'm glad you stopped and i you know she's just going on and on and and so i just knelt down to pray and um since i've been here i've made i've i've i've i've made a full surrenderance to the lord jesus christ i mean there's things in my life that i've held on to not necessarily simple things but the the way i was raised and the ways i was raised and some of the history that i have and i listened to a brother that says when you put on the whole arm of god you got to take off whatever clothes you got on where you come from you know where your character and how you are and the way your family raised you you got to let that stuff go that that stuff you can't have that on and have on the armor of god right you can't fight with god's armor and yours too right and you know since since i i'm since the day i've come here god has been god has been he's been peeling that stuff off of me peeling that stuff off my habits and my ways and my desires i had a chance to go down to when i first come come from the media here from first service something just kept pulling me down to the george floyd where the man got killed and i've never i've i've never i've never ever had any feelings about that you know as far as being a black person or anything like that and i've been around people that have just oh man just amazing how they got into the spirit of that thing and and i've always said well i've never seen nobody march around the crack houses i've never seen nobody march around at liquor stores and they've killed more people than anybody so let's let's have a million man march around liquor stores around the crack houses you know why you're not doing that you know that's right and so and so but something just kept pulling me i said what you know i don't want to go down there i don't you know i'm not even i'm not a black man i'm not a white man i'm i'm a son of god you know god god didn't god god didn't god didn't come down here to join a particular race god came down here to join to start his own race [Applause] and so because of the way i was raised and some of the things i've been through in my life it it caused me to have a callous in my hand against my own my own perhaps race of people and uh and it's just the way a lot of it is the way i was raised by my grandfather and it helped me to be able to to be able to get in a certain level in the industry in which i work because unless you're you know but anyway and so even that uh so i so i went down to the and took pictures and i couldn't believe how people that was coming all different nationalities of people that was coming and they was weeping over this over this you know over this this this place where this this this man died you know and it was just amazing to me and i'm just looking around at all these flowers and all these places and and so it just man it just it just really it made me really just take a look at look at me you know and um so i i come back and i come to service and um and i was staying in the hotel the brother had put me in the first time and i was i listened to this this um this app lifeline and the next morning brother branham he was speaking and he said that he said that um somewhere in chicago somebody got killed and uh how the people wouldn't walk over the spot where his blood was shed you know how they reversed that spot where his blood was shed he said he said he's saying it's amazing how we want reverence to spot of a man that died but yeah we'll walk over the blood of jesus christ every day you know and um and it was like wow okay i knew i was supposed to be here i know i was supposed to be here and so it helped me to come in contact with brother branham also said that he talked about jfk and he said that you know regardless the way he was being catholic or whatever and his demeanor and how women voted him in and all of these things the way we understand and he said but still no man had a right to die like that right and and even even this this george ford guy you know regardless of what kind of person he was no man had a right to die like that and so we live in a world that that that that that it talks about how how they'll die for how give your life for you know a sinner and perhaps even a righteous man but the way the way people are in the position to where they are even though we understand we're predestinated we understand we have the seals and we you know we're we're waiting on a rapture and so and and so and we understand that only to predestinate it you know or perhaps we'll make the rapture but then but but then there is a responsibility that we have as bride as christians to go out and witness and and to live lives to show because we have no idea whose bride and who's not that's right we have no idea who's so this this and i listened to this this preacher brother bill ivey he's preaching about i can't really pronounce what he said it's like sarticism but it talks about us for and no more okay so if it's us four and no more and if they're if we're waiting on a lost seed to come in then it can't be just us four it's got to be some more yeah and so and so and so and so i can't go out and witness to to some more if my heart is if there's no love in my heart i mean i gotta have i got because because christ died for me while i was smoking dope that's right christ died for for you and you know while we were yet sinners he died for us and so and so through that situation and through coming here god opened up a part of my heart that i didn't even know was locked and it was just a heart for for people that are not like me [Music] and and and when you understand the thing you know how to deal with the thing and i just i just thank god for for how he's allowed me to come i mean every single step that i've come here has been supernatural super how they call me for the job how my place of residency was set up how your dogs were here i mean the minister you're the ministry that you have i mean i don't want to say you you don't know what you have i don't want to say that because i know i know that you do but i've been blessed to travel all over the united states and i've been to probably more churches i've been to a bunch of churches and i've met a lot of ministers and i've lit i've sit down a lot of pastor meetings and i've and you have an eagle here and uh and uh that's very very rare that's very very rare i know it's not about money it's not about prestige it's not about fame with him it's not it's purity it's purity it's purity only only an eagle recognize another ego right only only those that have been filled with the holy ghost can recognize those that have it and it's it's rare it's rare you find so many splits and so many separations in this message so many so many scruples and so many so many error and god allows error to come to split because if we're all in stuck in one spot the gospel can't be spread but man this the splits that caused this place to come man is is greatly divine it's greatly divine and i don't know where you're from and why you come here and how you ended up whether you were made to come here or not but i searched the scriptures as i was a methodist pastor in and out of prison and searching i ended up ended up with um i practiced islam i moved to utah and lived two years with the mormons and just on and on and on and finally i told god i said hey the methodists don't know you are the baptists don't know y'all the presbyterian don't know the other jehovah witness don't know everybody everybody look at the same book and see something different but you say you're one god yeah i say so you know what i'm done i know who the devil is he he he there's no confusion about who the devil is yeah so i told him i said hey i'm going until you finish this and and make this complete in my life i'm done so i sold myself over to the devil i went out and sold and i did everything that did that you know that the devil would you know everything and uh and and like i told you when i first got here january the 16th 2006 he showed up hey [Applause] i wasn't in church service i wasn't looking for god i i wasn't looking for for religion i would i was done i had been through that because you know when you know every every time when when this denomination or this religion starts out and they're good but as soon as they go left i'm gone because i i i understood the scriptures i knew what god placed in my heart before i was even born and so and so and so when i met him that day i was still out in the streets and i went right back but i but but my birthday fell in february of that same year which is the 28th which is the same day february 28th is the same day that that the picture was taken of the other angels and that's i mean that's that's divine to me you know i mean that's i mean you can't take that away from me that's my birthday you know what i mean you can't you can't take that i don't care you know i mean i've had preachers tell me man there's no way you got the holy ghost and you've done this and you've done that and i just tell them you know you might be true i might not have the holy ghost and i'll just say that today but whatever i got i'm gonna hold on to what i got into whatever it is and so and so and so my first first act of repentance was i had to turn myself in because i was on the run and so i turned myself into and it just happened the prison that they took me to i wasn't going to church i didn't heard t.d jakes and creflo dollars i've been through all of that i've been through all of that so i wasn't going to the church so i would go to the table and i was well i wouldn't even i wouldn't even really just i had my bible you know and i would just study because because because i met him it caused me to search again in the scriptures for god and so i so i opened the scriptures and i would read and i would go to i would go to the table and sit there at the table in a dormitory full of full of prisoners and um and so eventually people would start coming to sit down and ask me questions and ask me questions and ask me questions and i would just do this religiously at a certain time and and eventually it became a bible study i mean it became a big bible study and uh and so in our bible study this this one this one young guy he was on fire for god and and uh you know god was blessing me to teach him some things and uh and then all of a sudden he said man you you got he said but it's one thing you missing he said the bible say forsaken out the assembly of the gathering of yourself he said why you don't go to church and i explained to him he said well still you you still got to go to church you know and our prophet says you can't get to church you go somewhere and you know because he said he like uh cherry pie and then and so but anyway i had never even heard of brother branham at this time and so and so i went i went to this i went to so i said okay the next time you go to church service i'll go with you because he hit me with the word there was nothing i could do yeah i said well i'm gonna go to church i'm gonna go listen to some of this you know some of this what i've heard that ain't never helped me out i'm gonna go anyway and so i went this man was talking about uh eve having interactions uh with a monkey you know and i'm like man i never heard that before it was weird but i've heard everything else i've heard everything else so you know and nothing else stuck so now this is something that i didn't make sense but i never heard it before so every friday i i'd get up and go listen to this man because he was talking about something that i've never heard before and so and so and so there was a prisoner that was leaving he was leaving prison and uh he came to me and said man it's a lot of preachers in here and there's a lot of christians he said but you're the only one i see you don't smoke you don't gown but you don't get into any other things he said man i got these tracks he had been in prison for several years and he gave me this big old thing all these tracks and notes and stuff he had collected over the years so he said man i don't want to throw this stuff away so i'm gonna give it to you because i want you to have this you know i don't want to throw it away so i didn't want to cause an offense so i took it and i mean as soon as he hit the door i went straight to the trash can you know tower you know all of these things i just started chunking them in the chucking them in the mail chucking them in the trash can i was just throwing this stuff away all these religious tracks it was that he gave me and and and all of a sudden i looked at one and it says jesus christ is god i've said that all my i've life that even in the methodist church and people was like man he's not the he's he's the son of god but this said jesus christ is god and that's what i knew from here i've always known that you know but i couldn't explain it and so i grabbed that track and i set it to the side okay i started that chunky so so so out of all those tracks he gave me there was only one that i kept so i took that back and i opened it up and it talked about baptism and i still got that same trap too it's it's in one of my bags and um and uh and so i read it baptism well hey i got that because i have been baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ i've been baptizing a whole bunch of names but i but i had that when i had that open up under my belt i had that water and and so and so um and so so i they became so i i i and so i seen you know william branham named eroded and then i seen on the inside of it they had it had a stamp on they said evening like tabernacle which is a church where brother tim pruitt preaches down in mind in louisiana and um i was like okay you know so i'm going to this so i'm i got this and this almost became like my new little bible because it's something you know so now i got my bible and i got this right here and this my study with the focus is it on what i was what i was being taught here because it was something that was that was within me that was pulling me to this and so at the same time i'm going to the service about and so anyway all of a sudden this guy jumps from from that he goes over to uh church age he starts preaching about uh the first and second third fourth church ages and so and so i go to him i said man where you get this literature from where do you get this stuff from man well you know he said well i'm gonna bring you something so he brought me a church age book and a seal book and so and so i mean i opened up i think it was the church the seals book and the lingual the the the way it was written the language and how it was written i was like man this is like some kid wrote this you know what i'm saying all these broken english and how this guy got i mean what is this you know how you gonna get this to me i'm a methodist i'm a methodist i taught my mom's my mom's uh adult sunday school class at the age of 13 years old because of the just i was just able to read the scriptures and give advance so but anyway but so i just kind of and so i ended up going to the back of the book both of them just because that's just me i'm hey i just go to the back you won't read the story let me just see how many i know how i begin let me just see how then all this stuff don't even matter so so so i got to the back of the book and and bam i seen a stamp in the back of the book it said even like tabernacle so this man that was preaching about these monkeys was the same was was come from the same church that passed out the tracks that said jesus christ is god and i say man i find another group i find another people i find something about another religion that i ain't never heard of you know what i'm saying i've been through everything else hey this is some i look i i and see i had seen god i had seen him face to face so i knew what i was looking for now i had seen him in the world i knew i was looking for but when i met him that day i knew i knew exactly who i i knew what i was looking for that's right i knew what i knew because that that was a former melchizedek that that i saw when mayor kennedy showed up everywhere all he did was show him the the perfect plan of god that he was going i can't i can't handle the word i can't i'm not going to pray i'm not going to preach and i don't i don't handle the word because of the way i'm married you know i don't i believe according to the message and according to what i've been taught that uh no man should handle the fire of god if he married to a woman that's been touched by another man so that's just that's just that's that's my thing i'm gonna stay with that what other people do that's that that's their business but anyway but i can still tell how the fire got lit so that's what i'm doing today so um man i just tell any young man and any young woman you know you keep yourself because there's a greater work for you to do down the road don't miss your life up to where you can't god can't use you in the fashion that he really want to use you so keep yourself clean it'll be better because if you're here because if you because yeah if if you end up if you end up with this power and you can't do nothing with it it's it's a burden on you it's a real burden but if you if you're free to be able to operate in the ministry that god can give you it'll it'll assure your relief just keep yourselves young man and um so so uh this brother this this this brother he was preaching and so i latched on to it i latched on to to the message and unless i didn't i didn't understand a lot of it you know i didn't understand a lot of it but i latched on to it and um and i ended up on now i was married before and my wife and i had divorced to be divorced and she remarried so this is kind of my story here bob and so she remarried and i that's when i married the streets and uh five years we were separated and she was remarried and so in this five years she got another divorce because he and i told him i said man you never when i first met my my my wife's uh anyway the dude she married i told him i looked and i said man you're never gonna be able to love her the way i do i said nobody can do that because this is my wife i told him that and i went on bible business and um and so you know when when god sends you a wife can't when god sends you one you don't have to worry about whether or not it's yours you'll never you'll never ever ever lose her either it don't matter if you try to stay by your side if she's the one that god sent you and so and so and so i'm going i go to prison and i get out of prison and so all of a sudden and i wanted to go to the church brother tim church but but but my friend the guy that preached that was ministering he said hey just stay where you're at until god moves you so i went back to the methodist church and before i know that i was a pastor i had two churches i mean just because of my and i was preaching the message what i understood about it you know and the people was like man they was just cause they you know they've heard these things that i'm speaking about you know i never mentioned brother branham i was just preaching some of these some of the mysteries that i that have been revealed to me and so and if i'd have kept on if i'd have kept on i'd be on television right now i'd be rich right now [Music] i'd be i i'd be i'd pull up in a bentley this morning that's what they do but anyway and so and so um listen and so ended up my wife ended up when i first got out of prison my wife ended up bringing my kids to see me two boys and so it was a thanksgiving and uh in my and they asked me to say the prayer at home so i prayed and my wife said she heard something different and so we began to talk and uh i was in instead of getting into the uh the holiday with my family i steal away to my to my room and study because that's what i was doing in prison and so i was just studying and so she come looking for me wondering where i was at and i was studying so we began she said now we begin to talk about you know without the message that i understood and so it interests her and it opened up a door and so i began to build fellowship with my family and my kids again and so before i know it we got back remarried we've been battery married now for almost 18 years my wife and i have been together since we've been we've been together not together but for almost 30 years right now so and it's been better now than it's ever been ever ever been so that's one of the reason why i can't wait to get home so um so and so so so i introduced my wife to the message i started working and we got together and everything and so one day one day i come home from work man she's crying she's crying and i didn't know what was wrong what the problem was you know and uh she gave me she gave me a a book and it was a marriage and divorce and i had never read it before so i said okay well let me she said you need to read this so i listened to it i read it and i listened to it and i read it and he got down to correcting the situation i turned the tape off i said man i don't know what this man about to say you know if i'm about to divorce my wife again or what i'm about to do i said but but i knew vertebrae had been vindicated i was driving down the road at work and all of a sudden i would listen to absolute and this woman screamed and this message absolute and her scream went through my headphones like pouring milk all the way down and i looked in the mirror and i said it's true i found the messiah [Music] i've searched through every kind of denomination you can think of and the only way god's going to come back for a bride do without spider-man he got to send a word is what i spotted not a methodist word not a baptist word not a presbyterian not a pentecostal word but a god word and a translation and an interpretation of god's word and god don't need nobody to interpret this where he interprets his own words and so and so and and and and and so you you're gonna follow some man you're gonna follow some man everybody i don't care who you are you're gonna follow some man but you look at the life of this man and you compare it to any other man that ever walked this planet you look at his life you read his life story you read william branham's life story and you and you challenge that to any other man in this world nobody's life for scratching not even right right on up to the life of paul or even the very life of jesus christ god god did more through brother branham's sinful flesh than he did through his own flesh in jesus christ so i'd rather take his advice than my own right i really take his device i ain't never seen t.d jakes or none of these people uh write in the fly leaf of your bible a little boy that's going to get crushed and feeling in england and then all of a sudden months later and he tells these people if this little boy he crushed by our car man if this little boy up on his feet in the next 10 minutes i'm a false prophet she saw a little boy playing you you yeah so somebody doing this right here i'm gonna listen to what they're talking about how about what i'm saying you you you listen to be because it was it was the sign it's the sign it was the sign that even moses that the guard gave to moses for the two i went from the following man out of each time i was going to leave pharaoh in the army and we're going to go across the bridge somebody like that but but he was working with something right that's right because they've seen the signs of the hand i think with them with the hand they come out of leprosy and they seem to the staff you know come up they're seeing these things so when you see people doing supernatural things these are people that you get behind [Music] you know you listen to listen to these tapes and you hear brother brown oh your name is yeah i can't do it i mean i i would love to be able to say your name is lydia and you live at 1776. you know but i can't do that right but he did every time and it never missed that's that's the thing you got people mad people that hey find that you know find out his father having and we'll see her next week and then i don't know where she lives and you know you got people preachers that do that now they you know do all this whole fall stuff but this this was this was this was back in the 30s this was in the 40s they didn't have all this technology we have now where you can see people through satellites and all this stuff their images can't they couldn't do that so we knew it was real and so the pastor asked me you know to come and just tell what was on my heart and and maybe to encourage you know and uh even to encourage the believers and and the unbelievers even the make-believers because this is them three people exist inside of this church whether you're a believer an unbeliever or a mate believer all i can say is this message that we we believe and the prophet william branham he he is the noah of our day when noah was preaching get in the boat and everybody else was preaching all other kind of religion it was only one man that god ever uses only one man he ever uses at any time he never two prophets on earth at the same time never you can look at it through chris scripture and so as it was in the days so shall it be and so if he's coming back he got to send something he did in our day and we handled him we feel him every day and that same holy ghost amen the same holy ghost the same power that lived inside of by the william brown they live inside of mode the same light we look for pillow fire up in the sky no no no no it's right here it's right here it's right here so get to the house of god get into this message learn what it means believe it's true listen to the sign listen to listen to the listen to the voice of god through a prophet that speaks people's names out into existence and then and then once you realize that this is god's voice then all the other stuff don't do this and do that and do that do that you know it's god speaking to you and then it's easier to make a full surrender to surrender even your very eyes to god and when you make a full surrender to god it don't matter what the devil will throw you away there'll be an eagle gotta fly right across the top of your windshield [Music] that he cares for you [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] yes let the church

praising to them that are bound to proclaim the acceptable year of the lord in the day of vengeance of our god to comfort all that moon to appoint unto them that mourn in zion to give unto them beauty for arches the order of joy for mourning the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness that they might be called tree of righteousness the planting of the lord that he might be glorifying and they shall build the old waste they shall rise of the form of desolation and they shall repair that we're sitting the desolation of many generations what many generation things that we have inherited from our great great grandparents the grace of god has come in this age for us to rebuild there praise the lord we know this is a 2-4 prophecy many times we get stuck and we just you know we just we just stop to uh you know the the day of virgins the day of virgins is not fall the the bride but there is a promise for the bride amen and the promise for the people that receive this is to turn your arches to beauty to give you joy for mourning and he will put a garment of praise on you for the spirit of heaviness that is burning this age people talking about depression suicide it's a spirit of heaviness but god is going to give you a garment of praise that no matter how torn up you are you can still lift your hands and praise the lord father bless your word bless your word is afternoon and we just want to thank you for your presence that you have poured upon us lord father i pray to god lord that not one soul under this anointing that is in this building father lord gabriel when i have

testimony of our brother and speak to us we love you father in jesus name amen the lord bless you you can have your seed praise the lord last week uh talking about the opening of the book and the loosing of the seals i gave i gave i gave uh i gave you an assignment and i don't know how many went and did that assignment i'm going to ask you to pass your assignment in this morning praise the lord we spoke about the tenth from judah that's supposed to be david so i don't know how many went in and really searched the scripture uh on that i thought that i was smoking a little bit on there on wednesday night and uh but uh i was a little bit tired so as per dan to speak he testified also of god dealing with him to pray for the spirit of love and and that we we thank the lord for that praise the lord and [Music] but just before then now sister evie called me and uh and i took the phone call and says bro i just want to share something with you i said go right ahead praise the lord you know and uh uh there are some things you know the same share with you you just you just get under the burden and and i mean your spirit is just going out there you know as a pastor and and there are some things that they share with you you know it edifies you you know uh so when people call me and if i can i'll pick up the phone praise the lord because i don't know what is coming i just i just see the phone call i said lord whatever it is just help me and she called me and she said and you know and started to share with me and she said brother one you know you remember that you said and i really wanna check on it i knew that she will you know because it all comes down but uh the nature of her career and her personal nature and sometimes i would do that you know if i if i need some some historical things i call sister heavy assisted stuff please check on this for me whatever you get just send it to me you know so she has been a great resource to me and uh you know so uh she she called me and then she said you know she she said brother wanna really check on daddy you know and you know yeah and and then again she said uh do you know that uh i think uh uh tama you know uh one of the children of david named their daughter you know after tama and and uh you know and and that was that was a blessing and what happened is that uh you know i i wish of course i never even read that uh i didn't read you know going down and digging their history but then after we spoke a little bit it started being on my mind and then i says what i have to i have to i have to look at that you know and i went back and and i i searched upon it but then one session upon it reading it upon it then other things starts to open you know then the word just starts to open and you know and just and just start going on like that praise the lord but i mean it's right in the book of matthew chapter one matthew chapter one uh you know if you read there you will really see that uh the tenth from judah is david you know because this is the generation this is the book of the generation of jesus christ so if you if you read there you will find that the 10th you know from from judah is uh is is david and and the way machi wrote his book let's let's look at that the book of the generation of jesus christ the son of david the son of abraham why would matthew put david before abraham when abraham was before david is because the holy spirit here is going to address the kingship the holy spirit is going to major on the kingship praise the lord don't you think there is an error how can you put david before abraham so you see over and over the things that are written in the bible they are not just the concept of men there was a great intelligence a great divine intelligence they were inspiring those men for the things that they wrote abraham lived before david why should matthew says this and a person will read this bible and right here it would just be stumbled at this the son of david the son of abraham that he made a mistake no he did not made a mistake because the holy spirit honor matthew testimony was going to address jesus as a king and you will see them on the full gospel matthew is one of the persons that make emphasis on the kingdom of god because a king rules in a kingdom are we together the wise man matthew gave a testimony on that how they came to jesus even from his birth the crying in his king so you see that is the reason why the holy ghost designed this the son of david the son of abraham abraham beget isaac and isaac beget jacob and jacob beget judah and his brethren and then you read there from judah uh pharaohs you have judith and uh pharaohs and ex-roman aram and iran beget abinada and now but now that we get nessum and and he beget salman and samuel beget bores of ruth and the balls beget i know bores of rahab and boris beget obele of ruth and oberdiki jesse and jesse bkl david so that's the tenth from uh and what we were actually addressing the abroad of this whole subject is because uh uh judah has went into an abominable act with his with his daughter-in-law tama uh because uh tama disguised herself and and he said you know she's more righteous than i now so uh in addressing that we realized that that was the reason why the kingship was hell because judah under the prophecy of jacob he was promised the kingship that the scepter will always be in judah praise the lord so god never had a king until the time of david because when the people desire the king and and and and and the the the tenth generation has not come god gave them salt we know the story about that but david was a man after god's own heart so while i was looking at that then i realized also as we've been speaking for a period of time now taking these three gentile women that was ever placed in the uh you know in the genealogy is never like that in israel it's always the man the psalms women will be referred to when a son gave birth to days you know uh but yet uh we found that there are three women named tema and and rahab and boss their name is right here in the uh genealogy of jesus christ and then i started to look close and i says well you know if you look here you will see also that from abraham now you have to realize that boss married ruth and ruth background was from the two daughters of lord sleeping with their father which which of course is also an abominable act praise the lord so how kubos ignoring that the moabites ignoring their history how could boys go and take roof but if you look right in this very same uh uh genealogy you will realize that from abraham the 10th generation will come down to the general the married rehab uh what am i talking i'm kind of missing here now you realize that let me let me just stay right in place you realize that from abraham praise the lord now what i want to build you have to realize that abraham unlocked there were cursings amen so from the time that lord had that abominable ad with his daughters if you count 10th generation down you will get two boss so if you go from isaac jacob judas ferris you will come to boss and and and it's all stay in the commandment of god because it's just after 10 generations that there will ever be brought into the congregation so you see boaz was the 10th generation since their act was committed amen are we together amen praise the lord and then as i was looking at that also then i said to myself i said there's there has to be something about rahab also you know it's it's is it is this thing is it's kind of a funny i don't know whether you have experienced it but if i want to be earnest about you to you i will tell you that i've experienced it you're reading your bible and you get to those genealogy just a lot of names these are the sundays or some high names and sometimes it's so easy for you to think that you know let's just keep it adjust names but there is always a message sometimes god hides the simpliest thing if it was not important god will not put it in his book praise the lord so i stopped a while and i said well i have to look at this closely here because if we can bring tema uh i mean if we can bring david you know the tenth generation from uh from from from tema and and we can be able to bring ruth and then there should be something about rahab also so you will see that uh uh remember now it was from the time of abraham genesis chapter 15 where god make a covenant with abraham and says your seed shall shall join amen and i will come down with a mighty hand and bring them out he gave abraham a promise that he would bring them out into the land of canada yes sir to be dear lane amen praise the lord amen so if you look closely from abraham to to the the military general simon that married rahab is also 10th generation praise the lord it's 10th generation so you see uh uh uh just like i've said before joshua gave them an instruction to go around the city every day one time and how many times they went around the city seven times but the seventh time they had to go around it sixth time so you bring all the numbers out it's 13 and 13 is the number of a woman that's right and there was only one woman that was saved from that city praise the lord so you see there is this word of god like our brother said it's of no private interpretation there is a divine intelligence behind this book that's the reason why it remains they're unsatiable it does not means that you can't search it it means that you cannot exhaust you cannot exhaust searching this book you cannot exhaust it yeah every time you flip the page there's a voice to speak to you there is something that will come new that you have never seen you have never heard before that's right because this is god in print form that's right amen praise the lord yes sir so as i was looking at it and just just sitting there through the week you know i came across uh something that i've looked at and steady back before from a good uh a hebrew friend of mine you know uh uh and uh he actually made me to look at look at genealogy very closely and the message that would behave in it years back i saw that but i i never i never got into the death about it because you read some stories in the book of uh uh like even if you read let me let me give you on another assignment so you can check it out you read in the book of first samuel and first time you talk about the sounds of eli and what they did and and it also talked about the sons of of samuel praise the lord but it tells us the end of the songs of eli and never said nothing about the songs of samuel until you come to the chronicles then you realize the sounds of samia they repented and they were brought into their work with ahabs or assaf praise the lord you find them serving in the principle so you see some of those things god just designed it like that yeah think about it also why the bible is not written in a chronological way right from the garden of eden and to just the way things happen but it's kind of a split out that nehemiah's and ezra talk about the rebuilding and the prophets that was with them hegel zechariah's mother that comes to the end of the old testament all of those prophets were right in the time of nehemiah's in ezra yeah why the bible did not just make it so easy because it's not the words of man amen it takes revelation isaiah said yeah a little and dare a little girl praise the lord sometimes people read through the bible and it says i i get confused because uh uh uh it's all because it's not something that you can learn amen amen it's now for you to learn and master yeah it's something that want to become part of your life praise the lord amen so as i got into this whole generation thing i want to take you to the book of genesis chapter 5. praise the lord amen i mean god has spoken let the church say amen praise the lord amen our brother testimony was just a blessing so uh i'm just trying to come behind it amen the enemy tried to fight me all through the week i'm telling you yesterday at that finger of my head was just pounding me and i came here and you know tried to try to rest him prayed and man i just couldn't get through it slept woke up around 3 a.m in the morning i said glory be to god i jump out oh i'm feeling so fine just driving to church i start feeling the pain in my head so praise the lord but it's all because god had a way to speak to us amen so we just appreciate our lord uh for having our brother you know bring that now you guess to genesis chapter five he also tells us that this is the book of the generation of adam in the day that god created man in his likeness in the likeness of god may he him now it brings us to another generation now like i said before talking about the generation of jesus christ and the revelation of jesus christ there is a history that is that is hidden in every generation in your generation there is a history in a generation of this country it is a history in every generation there is a history praise the lord now it says here the generation of jesus christ glory be to god are we together before we do that let's go to the book of jude let's go to the book of jude sometimes just like i said you get to the book of uh of genesis you read the the the beginning of the creation of the word you read adam and eve you get to genesis chapter 4 king kill abel in genesis chapter 5 is just a bunch of names and then you jump over here and get right to genesis chapter 6 when god called noah but i want us to look at something here very closely jude the 14th verse there is only one chapter there the 14th verse says and enoch also the seventh from adam praise the lord now the bible says enoch the seventh from adam i mean if if you really own a conviction reading the word you will have to stop and to really get there you have to go to genesis chapter five and count from adam to enoch praise the lord now so if you count from adam to enoch what is hating in this message enoch the seven from adam it kicks king out a proof by this that king was not in the line of of adam so enoch the seven from adam will be adam seth that replaced a bell that was killed are we together and enos and kana and malhila and and joel and enoch will be the seventh from adam are we together watch another thing again and he not also the seven from adam prophesy this saying behold the lord cometh so inna was a prophet amen he prophesied about the coming of the lord the coming of the lord jesus christ and the prophet said go on and say behold the lord cometh with ten thousands of his sins praise the lord now so you can also see there in genesis chapter 5 you can see in a prophecy because before the floor came this was four generations and we know what fourth generation means abraham isaac and abraham isaac and jacob praise the lord and then the patriot joseph and his brethren you know that makes the full generation four generation we all we all we we we see that through the scripture and realize have been talked about a prophet that's that's when god starts watching over an event god started watching and started being interested in you from your fourth generation back because fall is the number of deliverance praise the lord but this is what i wanna i want to bring us talk as we look at this together in the scripture if you go back to the bible and you see enoch the seventh from adam you will realize from enoch to noah is four generation praise the lord from adam to noah is 10th generation praise the lord amen just follow me here it will it will there is something about this number 10 you know in the scripture the number 10 is the number of election is the number of elections an election is when god elects or god set a thing aside and that's the reason why the children of israel were were told to bring their tenth onto the lord amen which comes under the principle of tithing and as i was just saying this you know i was thinking about it and and you realize that uh you know people talks about the principle of tithing and where a install is just money you know but the the principle of tithing is not just on the money amen because even god told the children of israel that the land should rest amen after they have gone through a time of farming and harvest they must have a time of rest so the tiding goes back and connects to the sabbath praise the lord amen now so you will realize that as i was just thinking about this i i taught about it you know and and the scriptures you know uh that that line of the tenth was just in everything in everything and i also believe it's in the 24 hours that god gave us we have to give him a time of the 24 hours it come up to two hours maybe about 40 minutes god expects you to give him two hours and 40 minutes if you want to keep to the lord two hours and 40 minutes of your every day it's not just sitting down two hours and 40 minutes being confused and don't know what to do praise the lord amen well in whichever way that god will deal with you and if you realize it as a child of god you will realize that your worship your prayers your meditation in the day that you do unconsciously if you bring it together you might either give god a correct tie or you might cheat god on your time like people do with money so you see it's a principle it's a principle if you just lay it down to a law it becomes a religion when a person just pay you know detain from their check it becomes a religion it's principles are something that's supposed to be part of our life amen now even if you don't have money you have something to give us a tie you all god tends in everything that you have amen praise the lord even before the law the commandment was written and god through the prophet moses gave the people the stature go back and see god meeting abraham he came down and met abraham after abraham has on his house to go after his fallen brother looked machized came down to serve communion to abraham and the bible says abraham gave him a tenth praise the lord so this is not just uh uh an old testament you know uh thing that we tied to the church and pool on people for money i personally believe that it has to be a revelation to you if it does not if it is not a revelation that i mean there is no way i can help you amen i'm not going to be running behind you you pay your time you pay your tithe i i get a whole bible to preach from i get a whole bible to preach from praise the lord amen then to be hunting you down for money if god cannot take care of me praise the lord if he cannot take care of me then uh praise the lord you know so that's that's the principle here and you see it in these in this in this generation how god is bringing out something here but let me show you something amen and just just to encourage you praise the lord so we we realized that enough was the seventh from adam it teach us a lesson there and enough also prophesied about the coming of the lord how did he prophesy in our prophesied when he had his son mentula amen so even the floor of noah was part of enoch prophecy he names him benthusila and in the hebrew mentisla means his death shall bring his death shall bring now you will realize why god kept this man for 900 and some more years because right after he died there will be a judgment praise the lord if death shall break you see the hebrew as we know the the hebrew mothers on a prof on on an inspiration named their children whenever they were in birth pains and whatever name that mother would cry out or whatever she would cry out would turn to influence that child life so uh the hebrews don't look at names like the way we look at it every name is very very significant amen every name of a child is either something that god was doing in the family or the time that family was going through some trial of the lord or something was happening praise the lord so you can see that right from the time of enoch and god was using this man like the scripture said he walked with god and things he was saying just like job of his days the bible says job would get in the marketplace and people would come to job and ask him for counsel those were men that people could tell by their life there was something special about them so enough name his son mantusila praise the lord can you imagine like my friend chuck says he said can you imagine when that child had a fever knowing that his death shall break at joshua when he had a fever the whole time was concerned everybody was kind to him yeah everybody loved mentula because the new dead his life not only his name his life had a very significance are we together praise the lord now so you think about this even the the the jews they still struggle until god opened their eyes to be able to see the plan of redemption they altered us jews still struggle to embrace our lord jesus christ as their messiah they know that their messiah had to be god in flesh praise the lord amen but yet they still struggle but think about this hundreds of years before jesus came to the earth and this is from the hebrew you know after the babylonian captivity gentiles started being involved god started using different gentile kings you know like we know in the scripture cyrus and in the different ones of them gentiles started getting involved but the hebrew language got a change before then the hebrew language the original hebrew language was was was more like every letter had a significance you know it had a drawing you know that identified that letter but after the babylonian captivity the hebrew that's when it took the box form you know the box forming ship that it has but so this is back if you go back and check this the root there in the hebrew you will realize that there was a message of the messiah that was hidden in the names of the genealogy right from adam to noah adam will mean a man and said means appointed in genesis 4 25 eve said god has appointed me another son instead of king in instead of ibel all kings kill said means appointed inners means it means mortal afraid or mortal miserableness that's what her name means kenneth means sorrow means either the praise god or the blessed god because you see the el at the end l means god and jail will means come shall come down enoch means teaching mantusula means his death shall bring lamech means that's where the word lamentation is taken from the root word lamentation comes from that word lamech it means lamentation or it means despairing and noah according to genesis chapter 5 verse 29 it means comfort praise the lord so if you just take your time and read through those names and the meaning of their names man appointed mortal frail or mortal miserableness that we end in sorrow but the blessed god shall come down and his teaching the blessed god shall come down teaching his death shall bring despairing and comfort the bible says in a prophesy praise the lord you know i just got caught up in these generations things but you think about it think about it that the coming of the lord jesus man is appointed mortar fail that would bring sorrow job said it he's a man of few days and full of trouble man is appointed paul picks that up he said disappointed unto men wants to die man is appointed that's all we can get out of this life man is appointed mortal thrill but the blessed god shall come down amen the blessed god shall come down teaching and his death will bring us despairing and comfort praise the lord you don't need a theological argument to prove that jesus is that's god you don't need a theological argument because it's written right here amen praise the lord and this is in the original hebrew even in their own language is prophesying that god shall come down and his death that's one of the things that the hebrews struggle with isaiah 53 the struggle with isaiah 53 because isaiah 53 described his death are we together i'll just share these things with you because sometimes that's some of the things i get caught up in but this morning last week we were talking about the opening of the book and the loosing of the seals i just want to bring something to you from there and why i think it's very important praise the lord it's very very important you know because just like our brother testified we read here from going beyond the camp and listening to this as allah can preach across the nation i watch the people i'm fully persuaded that people are not getting to christ and i believe that is the enemy that's throwing this hindrance because the reason i believe this he is not the object that they are pointed to christ the living word the resurrected christ jesus he is the object that we worship amen the word god means an object of worship every worship must have an object that you are striving that worship tool and the one that we worship in this building is nothing but this word coming out of the pages and becoming real to you oh may god help me not to give you anything then this word coming out of the pages but people are not getting to christ they want to join a church they want a religion that they can accept and that is popular because he's not the object that they are pointed to they have either been pointed to a dogma a doctrine a party an experience a sensation you know my body's shaking and all of that is argued but don't stop at that experience don't stop at that sensation let christ become real and the person to you amen not just that day but every day of your life that's right because he's a living christ they either stop at a sensation or something like that instead of being pointed to christ the word christ their word paul said in hebrew one god in sundra times spoke to us through the prophet but in these last days he has come to us through his word amen praise the lord that's the reason why when paul had an experience on the road of damascus when he said lord who i down referring to the old testament jehovah that experience have to point him back to the bible i'm jesus because the old testament jehovah was jesus of the new and that's what i think they are resting their internal destination upon some dark matter or some sensation like some says i dance in the spirit i speak with tongues fire fell run over and do and do you know all these things can be impersonated by devils there is just one thing that he cannot impersonate that's the word that's right amen in a debate between he and jesus each time jesus defeated him it is written the word and i believe today that's the reason that people are not coming to christ is because they appointed many of them to a denomination you come join our church praise the lord and i'll tell you today you can never fit in this church until you are born again i don't care how you tr how much you try to be regular praise the lord how much you try to spread your influence and make everybody to recognize you the church of jesus christ you can never fit in amen until you are born again that's right it must come by at birth amen that comes from the word the sea incorruptible hallelujah they have pointer to our denomination you come join our church oh you read the catechism and believe our doctrine or some system of some sort praise the lord you know it it breaks my heart but yet you just have to trust the lord and you're just praying and you are there you know you you you you sit around you know the people you know that uh that you preach toward and all of that and yet you find people wonderful people they just they just they just they just enjoy hanging around praise the lord i mean they fight so hard to come to a birth they don't want to lose their personality you know they fight so hard you see them fighting and jacob thought one time he could fight you can go to the gym do your weight lifting but you you are not you don't neighbor this word amen praise the lord this word is stronger than you yeah amen praise the lord and sometimes it breaks your heart but you just have to be there you just pray say oh god help this brother help this sister lord bring them to a life of surrounding he said god get ahold of them send the holy ghost and let it arrest him when you ever get to that place you will never play church in your life because you will realize that this word is the breath that you breathe amen yeah are you a pointer to a denomination come and join the church and read catechism believe a doctrine or some system or something they are pointed in the wrong way and the action and life that they live without christ proof that they have not met christ no longer what what they claim the action you have to know that god is the one that says the rings and the heart you cannot impress him you cannot deceive him amen he knows your heart no matter how much you think you are sincere it's going to have the skill he weighs sincerity amen because every man is right in his own eyes but it's god that weighs the spirit amen and know how much sincerity is are we together amen the life the life the things they get themselves into just on a covering of a system or the church and i mean they can fight for their religion they can argue and all of that they are pointed in the wrong way in the action and the life that they live without christ proof in their own life is vindicated by the very thing for instance he says i don't want to hurt anybody but i've gone back and forth across this country condemning women for cutting their hairs and the way that they dress wearing shots and all of that praise the lord amen and people were crying and streaming how much to love god but it can never come in suggestion to the word of god he says that just a clear sign that people have been pointed away from god praise the lord in the message the holy ghost i've always loved this because they have it kind of taught me something he says i believe that we are so close to the coming of the lord jesus and it behold us to do all that we possibly can to bring every soul to the kingdom yes sir and to bring the kingdom to the people praise the lord you can bring souls to the kingdom and they can enter in and you don't enter but bring in the kingdom you have to carry yes sir i said oh god help me to bring the kingdom oh you can bring people to my house and they can go in and say harris's house you know that church you know this message you can print people to the kingdom they can enter and you can enter but it's a different thing when you bring the kingdom amen when you bring the kingdom it's a complete different thing praise the lord amen berliner i'm just coming behind your testimony i'm so tired and this this headache don't want to leave me but it's under control amen praise the lord amen don't worry let's go and see luke chapter four we want to look at isaiah prophecy yeah i was so close up here when we talk about the opening of the book and the losing of the seals we read from revelation chapter five that no man was wanted to open the book and to lose the seals amen no man was all walking to open the boat and to lose the seals that was what we were talking about last week amen all praise the lord you love the lord jesus he's so precious to us you coming in in very in luke chapter 4 and we all know from the message this day this scripture is fulfilled what historically happened you know when when brother branham was reading from this book but i want to bring your attention to something here amen and and and this will help us to get a glance of what john was looking at in revelation chapter 5. revelation chapter 4 let's read from verse 16. and he came to nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was amen as he was accustomed to praise the lord just like our brother said jesus was accustomed to this whenever he goes to a city he makes sure he goes to church what his custom is not a tradition is something that he was accustomed to yeah right i tried amen and as his custom was he went into the synagogues on the sabbath day and stood up for to read praise the lord amen and we were told in the jewish synagogues right beside the high priest they always have an empty seat believing that that would be the seat of the messiah when he comes he will come straight to the synagogues and sit in that seat but this setting there jesus came to the synagogues he went right to the platform the high priest was sitting down and all the guys and then all the you know the priests and all the men in the synagogue everybody went to their place and jesus went straight there on the sabbath day he stood up and he read from the book of isaiah where it is written verse 17 and there he and there was deliver unto him the book of azai and then he flipped the page and when he had opened praise the lord so watch here now he comes in the cinegas he comes straight behind the high priest pulpit and he hand him a book and if they have hanging above for him to open it it has to be a closed book so he closed the book think about revelation chapter 5 now they had in the book and the bible said he opened the book praise the lord amen he opened the book and found where it is written he flipped the pages of the book oh thank you jesus and find a place where it is written the spirit of the lord god is upon me because he have anointed me to preach the gospel to the paul to send and he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captive the uncovering of sight to the blind to set a liberty them that i bros to preach the acceptable year of the lord praise the lord and what he did he closed the book and then he gave it back to the minister and the scriptures say he sat down he went right in that seat that was kept for the messiah [Music] and he sat down and the bible said oh ice oh he sat there in the eyes of all them that were in the synagogues were fasting on him now remember now he have opened the book and he read from the book and what was he doing he was identified he was identified his ministry so what was he doing he was losing a seal because what isaiah said he prophesy but it was filled and jesus opened the book revelation chapter 5 and loose the seal that's right losing the seal is identifying his ministry with what is written in the book our eyes were fasting on him and he sat down and he looked at those very eyes that was looking at him and he said this day this scripture is fulfilled amen praise the lord amen he said this day this scripture is fulfilled and that's what i was talking about last week the bible says that the book was sealed with seven seals and no man was wanted to open the book or to lose the seals so you think about it the losing of the seals supposed to come before the opening of the book amen if the book is sealed you have to break the seal before you open the book but when the holy spirit wrote it the bible says no man was able to open the book and no man was able to lose the seals just like how david comes before abraham a lost line is out of place the seal is supposed to be broken before the book is open amen it does not work that way with god the book is first opened before the book is open and ministry is identified and then it's released to the people the releasing of the ministry of jesus christ in every age is the losing of the seal amen praise the lord the bible says and he closed the book after he have identified his ministry he closed the book and handed it down to them there is no way they could have seen him because he gave them a close book until god opened this book to you you can go to every school go to every church you want talk this book will never be opening to your understanding [Music] [Applause] that's right praise the lord oh that's the reason why too many this might sound funny but we're reading from an open book we're reading from an open book because a ministry has been identified and that ministry was released to the people of god bride today a rapture [Applause] this is not a message of do's and don'ts praise the lord if you've been whipped during the years with legalistic preaching you have not entered yet this is not a message of do's and don'ts this is a message where christ is released from an open book he want to be part of your life he want to go to school with you praise the lord he want to be on your phone with you he want to be on your cell phone with you praise the lord glory be to god no way they could have seen him no matter how he identified his ministry and said this day this scripture is fulfilled the state couldn't see it why because he gave them a close book praise the lord at the end of the book of luke after the resurrection of jesus christ the bible says when he appeared to those disciples on the road it was close to them he said what are you guys talking about [Laughter] [Music] he said they say are you a stranger are you a stranger don't you know what has happened and this man jesus and he went on talking and he went on talking that was supposed to be the messiah and the bible says from the prophets to the psalm when he started to talk he says this is what he says in the book of genesis chapter 3 he was supposed to be the seed of the woman the bible says through the scripture he identified christ from the prophets to the sun and they were just enjoying it they were enjoying it but yet it was not open to them that's why many people sit there and enjoy the word but it's not open enjoying the world and say oh that was a great preaching i love it it still does not mean that it's open to you they enjoyed oh my goodness when he goes to simon says when david said my god my god he was speaking about him he said wow oh my god wow oh my wow that's why people do wow preaching wow preaching you are just admiring the word it just sounds good in your ears but when this book is open it changes life it changes lives it changes your habits it changes your desire it affects your ambitions it brings them under control when this book is open because it's a person and while the evening shadows were falling they said coming god come in about with us we enjoy you man this guy talking about the prophets and the time you know just identifying christ and all of this till then their eyes were still closed finally a supper time the scripture said he took the bread just before his crucification the same thing he did that night at suppertime he lift the bread up and bless it and then he broke the bread another type of the opening of the word he broke the bread the word is open and then he release it to them so the opening of the word comes before the losing of the seal the world has to be open to you for you to be free from guilt because when it's open to you it looses you revelation chapter one he have lose us with his own blood amen amen amen the opening of the word is christ being personal to you you don't tie him to a church you don't tie him to a preacher his person amen praise the lord oh that's the reason why you can read some things in the world you just get excited about it amen but that thing needs to be open it needs to affect you because the word is not for your intelligence the word is for your soul and when the word comes in your soul there it becomes your intelligence oh praise the lord my goodness oh my praise the lord amen have we given the tithe to the lord this morning are we over two hours amen praise the lord that's the reason why i thought 40 minutes service would not do you have not made that time don't complain about we wasting time we are giving tithe to the lord take the 10th of the day you are in trouble when you give less amen you are blessed when you give more [Music] oh just forgive me i'm not going to give you a one-hour service i tried to stretch it out to three hours because i want you to be blessed you can take your church order and meet me at the george mumbai glory be to god deacons if we have given the tithe just bring me a note you love the lord praise the lord are you not grateful that you can give over two hours of your time to god don't you realize that it's an internal it's intent of tithing amen steady your message on nintendo tidy it's internal tiding yeah when you are able to set up time in your life all your business schedule you give a little year in the morning a little in the afternoon a little on your break a little in the evening you lay it on your pillow and then you give the rest antenna tiding is more than your money [Music] that's why people gave tithe and they get so crushed about it all the just singers hey the pastor eating our money it's not a revelation to you because god wants something more than your money amen if your heart is on the altar no matter how much you give to god when you leave for me why are you going to do praise the lord you tell me there's a man that have about four plus hours to drive home to see his wife he have all right i give it to you brother lionel slip out get in your car and go may the lord be with you he have all right to slip out praise the lord but he just loved the lord it's a reality glory be to god i've not got one report of the deacon stopping anybody to leave amen amen praise the lord after we opened up for service memorial service we were going to have and and uh we we we have a farmer preaching for us that we can and we said when we come back to the building you know we i mean everybody should wear max you know because we we just want to keep this place safe we have such a small space amen i'm afraid i want one of these this building will just break down and then we'll just have service in the open air because sometimes the anointing is so strong in this place it looks like it's going to explode and i was sitting out there we had a tent we put the tent up and we say if you don't want to wear max you just go under the tent we have we we were streaming the service from there and all of that and then the dear brother came to church at girlfriend and then uh he was just all wrapped up in this thing can you know max and all of that and and and that and he just got so he he just got so cross he got so angry and they feel like well how can we wear max in the house of god and he walked out you know what uh just throwing that match down and i saw him going i could see on the on the string him walking out of the service i just prayed and just committed him in the hands of the lord but you see when a person has that kind of arrogant spirit in the house of the lord praise the lord amen if you think about having your wife and your little children in this building in a time where we where where they have not even found a vastness for this coronavirus and we don't even know where it's going and where it's going to end and we still want to gather together and think that this is a safe way and you think that your revelation is superior to anybody praise the lord glory be to god i mean there are people i drive on lake street every day every morning i see prostitutes on the street i see people all toast up in drugs there's a guy there he just so drunk up he comes cleaning people window water you want your windshield weap on that he counts out of that you know and just to get a dollar assault and sometimes i would just i would just give him a dollar but i put a prayer behind that dollar and said lord you have that man praise the lord amen because i know i mean until god help him he might take that dollar to go and buy another drugs also but i put a prayer behind and i'm not just doing it because i feel sorry for him i'm doing it because i'm making contact and so and and all of that i'd rather go on on the street and look for somebody that is so fed up with drugs that nothing will make sense to him than to deal with a person that has a religious spirit yes sir i'd rather go talk to somebody that is so drugged up and they can argue to me about jesus if there is a jesus let him change me i will rather deal with that person than a person that will come and sit down here with a religious spirit praise the lord we have one box that we are submitting and that's the holy spirit amen you might have your own ideas and what you think is best for you and you want to make suggestions you want to do what whatever you want let me get back to my message i don't know who put him into all of these things let me find a place to close up here praise the lord on on uh uh the on uh last sunday we uh we we read a quote from statue of epiphan let me read that and then i'll find a place to close here now these people peter is saying listen to this closely now it's reading from the book of peter about the statute of the peppermint out to your faith attitude and and knowledge and and temperance and godliness and all of that peter is saying yeah how that we must be partakers of his divine nature now each one of us are trying to grow into the stature of god the scripture says being partaker of his divine nature that's the purpose of the word of god is to change our nature that's where you should look for the evidence of the holy ghost is the change of your nature amen the evidence of the holy ghost has nothing to do with the changing of your closet all the changing of your hair style [Music] is the changing of your nature being partakers of his divine nature now each one of us are trying to grow in the statue now after we get through with the seven seals then at that time of the sounding of the seven seals the losing listing now i read this last week we know what a seal is is to lose the ministry praise the lord what isaiah prophesy was sealed when jesus came he was loosening that seal by identifying that scripture and seeing this day what isaiah said 700 years ago is fulfilled praise the lord think about this jesus has just come down from the mountain being tempted by the devil even before he went into his ministry so he came before the religious people of that day look that could have break the millennia on earth but orlando if those people could have identified that that was their messiah he could have just started the kingdom of devi before he went into his ministry right from the mountain of temptation straight to the synagogues and he's identifying his ministry praise the lord amen you know that's why paul says every man wait on your ministry amen you have to wait you have to identify what god called you to do amen glory be to god praise the lord we are a bunch of preachers that don't even know where they are calling us they are just preachers well let me let me leave that let me stay right here amen i'm safe when i stay right here glory be to god so we see here he was identifying his ministry to proclaim liberty which was the jubilee to set the captain free but you see there was another part of the prophecy the day of virgins that he did not read when he talks about the acceptable year he just closed the book so jesus himself was identifying that this prophecy has twofold it has a second part i'm now identifying the first part [Music] i'm identifying to you this part the acceptable year of the lord today is the day of your visitation when he knocked at your heart don't hide in your heart amen praise the lord do you think that those pharisees and sahindrans allow a man to have not come in their system to move there and sit in that royal seat that they kept for the messiah but you see god was in control god was in control that nothing they could have done because it was a day for god's word to be fulfilled and that's the scene where god was in control when brother brown was preaching birth pains god was in control that he could not find his scripture from a new bible god was in control when a catholic priest handed him his bible and said my son be steady god is about to move god was in control [Applause] oh praise the lord praise the lord brother branham you me a catholic priest i was just listening to a broken system because broken system was the message that he preached before he preached birth pains and verbal was talking about how that catalytic predicate of the priest was sitting right there he says the man came to me and he says our dear brother stanley he came to me he says he said he said he said brother branham you mean that this businessman can i see what you're talking about he said i see it. he said you mean a catholic priest identifying that that's there that should be administered among the people and this businessman couldn't see it oh my goodness but god was in control amen god arrested the situation yeah because one his seven was talking about birth pains which of course birth pains what is birth pains birth pains is a time for a baby to be released when a mother goes through birth pains amen a seal is about to be broken and a life is about to be released [Laughter] oh my goodness oh my goodness and that's why he was talking about how the ages have gone through birth pains and every time there was a birth pain god released a ministry to the people amen the ministry of jesus christ a life of christ is released to the people yes sir oh my goodness praise the lord are we together let's just read this let me close here amen we know that what a seal is is to lose a ministry to lose seven seals and we will see that right in the chat is losing a message something that's seal up something that was sealed throughout the ages is about to be released to the people god has to release something to change our body for a rapture creeds and darkness will not do it that's right amen all it would do is just adjust break start another church and go back to the same failure break start another church and go back to the same failure praise the lord amen amen glory be to god and i don't know i don't care what you think about it but god has always had his men in his hands talking to a dear friend of mine in a week here good friend of mine best friend of mine we were just talking and then he asked me this is he says brother i don't know what is happening you know he says you know how we africans get fanatic about things he said this press play is becoming fanatical that people are using that to continue in their way of life because they don't want to submit to a ministry they don't want to submit they don't want no order they don't want anybody to tell them anything so they think they can press play to go in the rapture he said it's just getting crazy and most of the people that are feeling into that are backsliders people who will drink their alcohol and still press play that's right because they don't want to submit to a ministry may god help us he says last saturday night i preached on the key this was the key to the door he says the key is faith the faith holds the key and the key is the scripture christ is the dawn see so fit takes the little hinge of the scripture and unlock the glory and the goodness that's that's that is the releasing of christ is to bring his glory upon the people praise the lord because what the isaiah said was going to happen in the second part of that prophecy he want to change your your your your your access to beauty yeah he want to give you a garment of praise now no matter what you are going through no matter how the devil blasts your mind you know christ is seal in your heart you can still live for your hands and praise the lord [Music] and this church will be the beauty of the lord the planting of the lord that he might be glorified oh i just believe that god want to put the glory on his people amen we just get sometimes so stuck in our personalities and we have our own ideas and we have our own revelation and i mean we're just so still but the fact about the matter that is that all of those things are just up here but the way that god deal with us is down here he deeds with you from here outside he start changing you from the inside and it's reflected on the outside so he said faith it takes the hinges of the scripture and it unlocks the glory and the goodness of god out to his people it unlocks a release glory be to god you see that's the reason why god is releasing himself to his people because when this church come on a persecution he want to be with you praise the lord when we cannot gather back anymore he want to be with us in our different places praise the lord and you can still take your bible and still have church with god amen you can play the tip and still have church with god amen praise the lord he wants to unlock the glory and the goodness of god out to his people see so his fit holds the keys that unlock christ told the people is the reason why a faith was promised to be restored in this day that's right and the reason why is to release christ to a people yes not to bring a people to a man but to release christ that's the reason why that prophet god said the gift is for the people amen that's right amen god is not a hysterical god he comes out of the pages of this bible amen is to release christ is to lose christ to the people faith holds the keys that unlock cries to the people he unlocks it yeah it reveals it yeah it's the same word revealed unlike loose is the same old word praise the lord that's the reason why a true revelation will affect your life amen when your revelation only gives you knowledge and cannot change your life there's a problem with that amen fear holds the keys and the like cries to the people unlike it revere it so today we are going to to take time and see there to unlock the way to become a veteran's christian in the statute of a perfect man and to be a living tabernacle for a living god now see what brother branham was teaching here in statute of epiphany trying to tell the church how christ is released to us and we grow in that stature from faith to virtue this just this subject went on the far end and became a doctrine of 777 veterans and people trying to measure where are you in the statue of the peppermint are you a godliness are you a it's not something you can measure it's not something this is as this is as spiritual as supernatural nutrients that comes to the believer you can't come to the place said now i have faith tomorrow i have vet you glory and then after one week you don't know whether that you go back again so tomorrow i got to stop by from faith because i got to grow in it it's not for your physical body it's spiritual nutrients it's almost like having a child and every year you got to go shopping for new members of the child body amen now you are two years old we got to get two years old i'm for you and two years old lag for you no it's a food that in you eat the atmosphere it gives you the nutrients for you to grow how many times people have practiced to have statue of the perfect man you can't practice it yeah that's right because it's a spiritual glory it's a spiritual nutrient that comes from the word of god it bears you from faith to faith it gives you strength in the hour of temptation amen amen amen and you grow every step of your life you will need to grow in faith every step of your christian journey you will need additional strength vet you every step of your christian journey you will need knowledge to turn certain conus in your life so it's not something that you get one day amen that you have to practice yes sir musicians you can come if not i'm going to preach until 2
