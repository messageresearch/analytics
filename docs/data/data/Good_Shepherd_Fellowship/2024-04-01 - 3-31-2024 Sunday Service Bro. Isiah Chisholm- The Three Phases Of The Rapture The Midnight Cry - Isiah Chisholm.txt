atmosphere that the Pres of the Lord could be in this place man I'm not going to hold you long standing amen we're turning our Bibles to first Thessalonians the fourth chapter uh we start from verse the 13th verse first Thessalonians 413 through Verse 18 man you have it by saying amen now Apostle Paul says here he said but I would not have you to be ignorant Brethren concerning the concerning them which are asleep that we sorrow not even as other others which have no hope for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain that there going to be a lot of people that's going to be alive church but they're not going to to be remaining What Remain with the truth truth unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are alive for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout and with the voice of an archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first amen then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord amen wherefore Comfort one another with these words let us just byow our heads again father God we thank you Lord Jesus for the reading of your word now sanctify it to our soul in Jesus name amen you may take your seat praise the Lord amen before I forget amen I just want to take my time but I want to hurry up at the same time my thought this morning is uh the three for purpose the three sorry the three phases of the Rapture amen the three phases of the Rapture that would be my text and my subtext would be the Midnight Cry how many you thank God there has been a cry that went out amen how many you thank God that you was able to take heed to the cry oh my praise the Lord amen I'm so happy to know amen that I was was able to hear and while you sitting with let's turn to Matthew the 25th chapter and we start from verse one Matthew 25 and verse one and here Jesus said then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be like unto 10 virgins who took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom and five of them were wise and five was foolish now f 10 there was 10 virgin five of them was wise and five of them were foolish how many you that foolish that wise version this morning amen amen and they that were foolish took their lamps and took no o with them we know that the oil signified the Holy Spirit right amen but the wise took allil in their vessels with their lamps while the bridegroom Terri they all slumbered and slept and at midnight there was a CED made that's right behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him then all those virgins are rose and trimmed their lamps and the foolish said unto the wise give us of your o give us of your Revelation for our lamps are gone out but the wise answer and and answer saying not so letest there be not enough for us and you but go ye rather to to them that sell and buy for yourself now where can you find all a at a late hour at midnight most of the stores are closed hallelujah amen amen that's why you better get it while the door is being open can the church say amen and while they went to BU the bridegroom came and and they that were ready somebody say and they that were ready and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut afterward came afterward came also the other virgin saying Lord Lord open unto us but he answered and said verily I say unto you I know ye not mine let me just pause that for a second I think the Bible said there's going to be many that said Lord I've cast out devil I've done many works I've been faithful going to church I I pay my two my dues and my don't and and I've been good to the pastor and I was his right-hand man but then he going to say I don't even know you in other words and then you you will say Lord you you got to know me I've been faithful for 40 years I've been in the message I was born in the message and amen and I I I I I know all this but the Lord said I'm sorry I don't know you and you said Lord can you please just just look in your record book surely my name has got to be there and the Lord began to look he says I'm sorry your name is something na in there and he said depart for me I never knew you in other word you were never ever in my mind oh my I'm so glad today that I don't have to heard those words amen I believe that he will say Well done thy good and faithful servant enter into that R I believe with all my heart that there's a a a a a table I believe there's going to be a marriage Supple in the sky amen I believe I will be sitting there at that that that table with all of my loved ones that have gone over amen but he will answered and said verily I say unto you I know you not watch ye therefore for you know neither the day nor the hour wherein the son of man cometh can the church say Amen you know the day nor the hour when the son of man coming Christ first coming the Mart he comes three times Christ is in three see watch how he come he is the fourth watch Christ first coming he come as a mortal to bled and die is that's right amen that's his first coming the second coming is the rapture we meet him in the sky IM Mor his third coming he is incarnated God Amen Emmanuel amen the Earth that's right so we see the coming of the Lord now let me just read something Amen to you this morning morning as we just move along now I'm I'm ministering the three phases of the Rapture now the brother brother Brandon says three things happen the shout the voice now I know you know those things but you know I love to hear those things rehearse over and over can you say Amen how many you listening at a song you listen at it over and over amen so sometime we want to keep hearing these things rehearse these things in our ears sometime people forget what time that we are living in and I found so many people got to a place they got discouraged because they don't understand the phases of the Rapture three things happen the shout The Voice the trumpet has to happen before Jesus appeared now as shout Jesus does all three of them when he's descended a shout what is a shout it's a message going forth first the living bread of life bringeth forth the bride the first thing come when he start to descending from Heaven there's a shout what is it it's a message to get the people together the message come forth he says and now by his Spirit descending from Heaven under the blood that was shed the calvary come down amongst us to make himself manifest listen now to make himself manifest in human flesh are you hearing me he come down to make himself manifest in human flesh are y'all hearing me now those precious people who has accepted the blood of torment and the Holy Spirit takes unto there being God represent in human flesh amen do you thank God for that this morning when when you talk about the Rapture if you will uh let's turn to another scripture amen as before we just get to going here amen you see Apostle Paul uh he records here in 1 Corinthians the 15th chapter and then as a little boy as I would go to church I always hear that and you know you know how we saw those movies left behind we talk about a twinkling of an eye and you you look at movies and sometime you get those things lock in your head where you drive you driving your automobile and all of a sudden it just goes over the side of the road or over the bridge or are are you sitting at the table and you know and and you get up and uh your wife gets up and she she walks over to the refrigerator to get a a cold glass of Beverages and when she come back all of a sudden she vanish and it just shocks you you know that's the way the world has paint a picture before us amen but Apostle Paul said I said to you in in First Corinthians the 15th chapter that's right and make sure I got it right amen are y'all with me you know I I last night I I noticed you you're you you you listen very well and that's good you know uh uh and I love that I I I really do love that I you know how many You Ever Raised chickens chickens okay thank God one and the more chicken Raisor amen so let me ask you something I remember as a little boy when I used to feed the chickens you know it didn't matter what I throw in the in the Barnard the little chicken looks up and see who throw it just just eat it up right you can just throw coins in there go what you know you could you could you could take some chewing gum and throw it in there they don't look to see where it's coming what they do but I I'm so glad today you're Eagles and you're not chickens right you're just not eating anything that a minister would say are you hearing me just because he's a minister amen amen you know and I I'm glad because I know you're trained because if you're not trained I could easily get you all pumped up and I can say Jesus is coming on a helicopter ah glory to God right Hallelujah and you takeing note Jesus coming on a helicopter after the church I'm going to ask brother chm what type of helicopter is he coming on but I thank God we know better than that amen I I thank God you know uh brother Brandon said uh predestination it's not a good word to you I feel real good this morning brother Brandon said predestination is not a good word to use before untrained audience yes sir that's right he said predestination leans on the full knowledge of God and it looks to election oh my how many you thank God that you've been elected amen so brother Brandon say predestination is not a good word to use before an untrained audience because some people people think because they are predestinated they could do anything they want they they can stay out of church they don't have to come to church they they could just just stay home to do what they want and still go into Rapture no brother that's not true amen the Holy Ghost would love to go to church right oh man somebody said brother CH you acting like evangelist now amen I'm going to preach you amen the Holy Ghost can't wait to go to church a lot of time people think because predestinate predestinated they feel like well I could slide a little bit you know I you know I could do it it's okay God understand you know I'm weak and he understand and no no go no God there's a higher calling now God is calling for Perfection amen see the Bible say he that knoweth uh to do good and doeth is not to him what it is sin so the bride she's being predestinated she know what predestination is I pray I pray you understand me this morning now Paul wrote here in First Corinthians uh the 15th chapter he says he said in verse 50 it says now this I say Brethren that flesh and blood cannot uh flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God neither do corruption inherit corruption but watch verse 51 behold I show you a mystery a mystery is something that has not been revealed right right but behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep now I I know the the world you know when I was in the system you know that especially at a funeral you know I just SP to mind M there's a there's a lot of funerals I've been to in the last few days I mean funerals every every week I'm going to funerals funerals and I were here and we went to a funeral the other day was at a nomination to church and the preacher got up uh uh he got up he said well Saints he said we all got to go that way and folks get to look on their faith we all got to lay in the cast that's not what Jesus said the Bible said that there are some that won't even taste death so how could everybody be dead and the Bible said the dead in Christ shall rise first and we that are alive and remain so there's going to be some people that's going to be alive are you hearing me there's going to be some people that's going to be right here on this Earth and I believe that I'm talking to people that's going to see amen the coming of the Lord I'm talking about the going way of the church as I said last night you know we we I hope you understand those you understand but you know a lot of people they're they're looking for the Lord but let me tell you what he has already come yes sir amen you know and people say everybody got to die well son son died you know brother everybody got to die you might as well get ready cuz we all got to lay in the casket too everybody is not going to lay in the casket everybody is not going to amen there's going to be some people on this Earth that's going to witness a body change there's going to Oh Glory to God and I look church now I believe I know if you heard it for a long time but I believe that we are at the threshold I believe we're so close it has got to be and you you think about the prophet of God those seven visions that he had and he talk about melum and stall them and then he goes on and he said right before the end time you young people write it down see if it don't come to pass if it don't I'm a false prophet he said just before the end time there'll be a woman or perhaps the Roman Catholic Church she either be president or vice president he said Mark that down church let me tell you what that was in 1933 and 87 years later kimela hars are you hearing me stepped into office and swear as the vice president of the United States of America and let me tell you what that was the sixth Vision if if I'm right amen but the last vision is what America is blown to peace and you think I'm going to play Church no you think I'm going to miss church no you out of your mind you think I'm going to stay home amen and take it easy no if I go on a vacation my vacation I might go somewhere and enjoy myself but you better believe it somewhere on a Sunday morning on Wednesday night I'm going to be in the church I'm not going to be laying in a hotel with my wife enjoying life I'm going to be in church I may not be here but somewhere I'm going to be in the presence of the Lord man during the co time I went down to Florida and I wanted to go to a church but believe it or not the churches was closed because of the co it was miserable that Sunday I didn't go to church I felt like I took step backward you don't feel like that sometime some people miss church and they feel like they're okay you know this out of church a couple sunds you know amen but I thank God I'm going to church amen Oh Glory to God hallelujah but let me tell you now I heard a lot of folks say well we don't have to go to church we are the church you keep on keep on believing that okay the Bible that don't nect to S yourself are you hearing me yes sir we are living in in in the phases of the Rapture but he says behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed how we going to be changed Church in a moment in a twinkling of an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead be raised Incorruptible and we shall be chained for this corrupt must put on incorruption and this Mortal must put on immortality amen can the church say amen amen so you look where Apostle Paul said we are changed how many you think God we had a prophet Amen to go into the Revelation and give us hope amen because when when you think the Bible says we're going to change what in a moment of a twinkling of an eye and brother Brandon said it's just like quick as you could blink your eye we'll be changed gone so so so is that's going to catch us by surprise we know what's coming if you don't understand the phases where you at then you're going to get all scribbl up now reason I said that you said brother and children where are you going with that I know for a known fact for about six years ago I was ministering at this church and like three or four sisters came up and the last sister came up and when she came up there was no you know last night I felt like everyone that came up they were sincere I really do all my heart and I believe if you believe it's going to come to pass if you don't doubt in your heart it's going to come how many you believe that it's going to come to pass and it's already working now so I feel like everyone that came up here I believe that you was touched by God but let me tell you what when those sisters came up the last sister she came up with her arm dropped down and her head hang down in the laps of her shoulder and she looking all sad then I come down to her to know her and I says my sister I said what what is your heart desire she says I don't know I said what does your heart desire sister she said I don't know I said I said what you mean she said I don't know she said y'all said That's supposed to be a Rapture and we're still here and she said I don't know anymore and she turned around she said I don't know no more I don't even love my husband no more and I'm like oh my God so I was making sure my microphone wasn't on then I look back at the the husband he was on the up there on the platform praising God and she said I don't even have feeling for him anymore and I wonder today how many spiritually losing feeling right for your husband you you lost that desire you're not looking for him anymore he's he's going on a journey but you're not looking anymore you're not you're not waiting for him so people don't understand the the phases of the Rapture now brother Brandon said when the angel descended what with the book in his hand when a mighty angel now Church of the Living God I didn't know and I'm sure you didn't know amen the coming of the Lord was in a way that no one ever imagined it would be the Lord descended from Heaven what he veiled himself in human flesh he stepped right into a prophet and he did that Ministry of Christ on the earth William Brandon was not Jesus Christ but the spirit of Christ was in William maram brand and what was it to do it was to get a people ready I don't know about you amen but where was you when that cry begin to take place let me tell you church I thank God that I have a ear that I can hear I thank God that I got a heart my brother that I can receive amen let me tell you what when I heard that call you know where I was at I wasn't born in a message Church no there's a lot of people in the message church but the message Christ is not in them oh my we don't want to hide behind a quote we don't want to hide because you got the hman head on the wall you better make sure that you know that you know that you know amen that you're ready for this change amen let me tell you what brother and sister it's the coming it's the go the way of the church he has already come whatever you do don't cool off amen hallelujah hallelujah you know can I just ill illustrate something you know

beginning you ever heard people say that people don't hardly preach to Rapture anymore cuz they themselves has got tired saying it you know people now when you mention the word rapture people just look at you like but see it excites me because we know the word rapture is not in the Bible Paul talking about being called up Sir being changed and you know the Bible say in the last days the anointed ones at the end time brother Brandon said there'll be anointed one anointed crisis anointed on and what they would do they would preach to the people and tell the people you in the Rapture

descended y'all making me want to preach when a mighty Angel descended with the book in his hand amen he had the book of redemption that was the same book that Adam had and my name was on that book

want to have the three-fold purpose of God Christ The Mystery of God reveal God God first he manifest himself in flesh are you with me Rose up in the Book of Luke as a young boy died amen a lot of people say for God so loved the world that he beg gave his only that Jesus died for everybody I said no he did somebody got mad with me you off the word Jesus died for everybody I said you you you you you looking at too many pictures Jesus didn't die he only died for the lost sheep of Israel he only died for the lake are you the lake of God that's why the Bible said in 2 Timothy 2:9 it said nevertheless the foundation of God standards are sure the Lord knows them that are his how many is his him that know the name of Christ depart from iniquity oh my if you know not to do it don't do it that's iniquity but let me tell you what the sh the the voice is in the bride so Christ is in the bride huh Jesus said the kingdom is within you don't even realize oh my goodness you don't a lot of y'all don't even realize who you are ah my but there are some in here that realize who they are amen let me tell you what if if if my father was the president of the United States you would know that

talking about the Lord Jesus Christ He's My Savior and what is the church God has got to get the church he want to have [Music] preeminence God was in Christ and he had full control everything Jesus said I would do nothing except the father shows me and that's right so brother Brown say second purpose was to have preeminence and his bride in other words God want to have full control God want you to become a a love slave can I use that word that he got full control of your mind your thought like he had Paul he had such control of apostle Paul and Paul said I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live the life that I not live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave his life for me and that's the way we got to be in this hour amen I'm living because Christ is living in me so let me tell you what church when God could get us to a place brother brownon said what he want to do he said the Bride of Jesus Christ is waiting on the revelation of the Rapture what is a revelation it's something that has been revealed to you A lot of people don't have a revelation on thing they know they going to church amen they said I believe that God sent a prophet amen and that's the only thing I found out brother Steve in this message people has come out but they got to a place the only thing they can see is a prophet right cuz the way that some people present it yes only thing they can see is a prophet they can see as a prophet they can see as a prophet so the minister can't take them beyond the face of a man that show what the man came for yes he came to what to turn our hearts not to him but to turn our heart to Christ do you hear me Church how many you thank God your heart has been turned amen oh my a lot of people had been turned but their

but I'm turning purple right now are you hearing me I'm all excited amen because I know I don't care where I be amen if if Lord de started to take me into the sixth Dimension I'm going to depend on you all are you hearing me because they without us cannot be made perfect that's why William Brown have preached the finals everything of the seven seal and the bride she is resting on that and she is the final voice let me tell you what they without us cannot be made perfect amen amen we talking about a perfect Rapture for A Perfect Bride hallelujah amen and I thank God I'm a part of the Rapture I

God put me in his mind I thank God that he put love in my heart how many you got true love in your heart Hallelujah you know something I was telling my my brother yesterday God will test you every every son that cometh to God must be must be proven people say they're ready to go in the Rapture and a lot of people say well I'm in the top of the pyramid with that Capstone love really okay amen but God said I want to test you right right about a year ago I had someone to threaten to kill me I've never had that in my life and I'm not going to go into full detail it was close and you you could ever imagine and it wasn't my wife okay and it threatened to kill me but the thing about the Lord showed me that years ago show me the person face how they raised up against me but that day when I was threatened it bothered me a little bit and I said to myself I don't even want that person around me anymore let's keep them far off keep fall off are you hearing me amen but then after a while I start thinking about the stature of a perfect man when you talking about faith virtues knowledge temper patience and you talking about brotherly kindness brothers can't hardly get along with one another and they talking about we in the Capstone I told a lot of preacher it's okay for you to preach the seven seal a lot of churches I go to not a lot of church but sometime when you preach the mystery we don't need all that right that's because they don't understand and I feel if you got the Holy Ghost I believe you are able to preach the mystery why why talk about the mystery when you got Envy in your heart why talk about the open of the seven seal when you got Envy in your heart are you hearing me you need to get that right first amen somebody say amen amen you talking out of rapture but let me tell you what we was coming home it was like year before last it was in winter time the Lord spoke to me and to tell my wife said tell her I told my wife I said honey I'm going to let that go she
