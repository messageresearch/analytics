========================================

time up in in the samaria the city of sakai had been forgiven of every sin and she realized that that might be an opportunity for her so how is she going to get to him now she seen he was needy and she wanted to serve him and couldn't get to him that's about the way it is so she thought what can i do he has no anointing his feet's dirty nobody's paying attention oh if i could only get in there that's the real pin at heart if i could only get to it now she think get her mind catches something you know what i believe i'll do i know down the street she goes just as quick as she can down through the alley up this little creaky steps and opens the door goes in there and gets a stocking top you know and pulls it out counts how much money she's got she said is that enough to buy some anointing oil let's see if it is there's 20 pieces of roman dynamia perhaps that's enough but wait i can't do that he's a prophet and he'll know where i got that money he'll know how i got it i just can't do it so she perhaps laid it back again and once she laid it back it was something kept speaking to her heart but would you let him sit there dirty like that would you let the only man that can take away your sins set dirty when you can give him service so she says to herself whether he knows or not i'm going and down the street she went and run into a store where his little hook those fellas sitting in there and well what do you want to hear she said i want the best alabaster ointment that you got not the cheapest i want the best she had a special reason and that's what we ought to do we are to give him our best everything we are our youthful life not wait you were old and dying give the best we got to him and there she got the very best he went up said let's see how much money that is and he got the money first he knew her also so i said yes she had the money so where you going with this i have it for a special occasion so she goes up now she has no invitation but how's she going to get in but somehow if you want to do a service for jesus he'll make a way for you get in somehow another she got in and there was jesus sitting there yet and she happened to think which got in there heart beating real fast oh my what if he'd happen to turn me down there's a lot of things to think about what if he'd come up here and say say you foul woman what are you doing here in my presence know you not that i'm a son of god you shouldn't be here in my presence her heart almost failed and she thought what can i do but i've got to get to him i can't pass this time this may be the last opportunity i'll have it might be yours too look down and her heart begin to swell up she knows she's in his presence that something happens when you get in his presence she noticed the tears began to fall off of her cheeks and she was standing there shaking with this box in her hand and she fell down at his feet and she thought i can't look up i'm so guilty and dirty i can't look up so she started crying they began to fall upon his feet and she began to wash him like with her hands white and trying to wipe the tears off of his feet and washing his feet with her tears and after a while she didn't have no towel to wipe his feet with so her hair was hanging down and she began to wipe his feet with the hair that was on her head more than our sisters have a time doing that they'd have to stand on their head to do it our sisters today what if you one of the women realize that god keeps all his promise i wonder if you realize that it's totally impossible for you to get in like that he keeps all of his promises do you realize what you're doing when you're doing that you're denying virtue the bible said that if a woman kebabs her hair is even a common thing for her even prey and she dishonors her husband in doing so and remember it was a woman that broke one commandment of god that caused all this to do that do you think one breaking one will get back in think of it maybe sometimes ministers hasn't gotten nerve enough to tell you this is one time you're going to hear it it's the truth someone said why don't you leave off that women a great man told me that not long ago said why they believe you're a prophet you teach them how to receive the holy ghost and get these great big things and how to to be prophets and so forth i said teach them greater things i said how can i teach them algebra when they won't even learn their abcs it shows the outside expresses what's on the inside but you're going to do it anyhow why you're not conscious of it amen there she was with her hair she began to wipe his feet with it and drive his feet off she was scared to death that's why she picked up this bottle of ointment she broke it and she tried to hit it and break it and put it on his feet just crying and every time she'd cry she'd reach down and kiss his feet she got hysterically when you get in this presence it makes you hysterically i got hysterically any man ever gets in his presence that's believes him and has faith in him it'll make you hysterically on the day of pentecost when he come in the form of the holy ghost they got hysterically when you really believe and you know and recognize that your opportunity and you're in his presence you're sure of it she'd kiss his feet and cry and wash him whiten and kiss his feet again you know jesus if he'd have moved one foot she'd have jumped up and run out there you know he just said let her do it you know if you want to do something for he lets you do it it may be all out of order but he lets you in anyhow and he's doing him a service and she was washing his feet and he just sat there and looked at her she was afraid to look up because freddie would make her scat and see she was washing his feet his opportunity to do something boring and she was just i see when he when jesus spoke back to the pharisee he justified her by her works but when he justified her to herself he justified by her faith thy faith is saving he showed pharisee what her works was because your works expresses your faith now let your hair grow out now see it expresses what you believe or not that's god's word there's no scripture in the bible but what that's the truth why do you do it now notice too much hollywood in pentecost that's what's the matter amen now we find out that's the truth it's just too much hollywood you watch these things and pattern yourself a lady said to me not long ago she said little tight dress on i said why don't you take that off of being a sister and she said well brother brandman don't make any other clothes i said they make sewing machines and they got goods i think you just want to i'll tell you why let me tell you sister thank you one of these days you're going to have to answer for committing adultery you say well brother brown i miss this pure to my husband as i can be i'm just pure to my boyfriend that might be so too but jesus said whosoever looketh upon a woman to lust after her half committed adultery with her already in his heart and if you've presented yourself out there and that sinner thinks that about you because you presented yourself that to the other judgment when he answers for committing adultery who is guilty think of it that's exactly right oh women come home back sisters come back to christ brothers you do the same and you man let your wife do that and call yourself a man head of the house notice we're in a terrible time friend and we noticing here was this little woman kissing his feet and washing his feet and whitening with her hairs of her head and all at once old pharisee within a corner he happened to notice it oh my his righteous ignatian rose and his his big chin swelled out his face looked like would burst oh ma he said come here look here look over there and he said within his own heart now in his in his mind he said if that man was a prophet he would know what manner of woman that is touched him see if he is a prophet or not see he perceived the thoughts that was in his heart and all at once she moved and the little woman raised to look up her eyes blaring he looked over and he said simon he said i i got something to say to you here you are simon i got something to say to you you invited me here i'll come on your invitation you invited me and when i come to the door you never wash my feet and when i come in you're never anointed my head you let me come in dirty and you never kiss me welcome though you invited me but this woman here let her be whatever she may be she has washed my feet with her tears she's wiped him with the hairs of her head and she has anointed my feet and constantly kissed my feet ever since she's been laying there amen he found out what he's a prophet or not then he said simon i want you to look at something he said what kind i'll give you a riddle said when one much is forgiven much as love and he gave him the saying and simon answered him back notice simon didn't give him anything to wash his feet with but he had the best water that could be just think the tears of a repented sinner washing the dirt off of jesus feet tears out of a sinner's eyes washing the dirt from his feet oh man and women tonight when you see the reproach upon the gospel and we're so starchy would take all the makeup off of our face if we cried a tear we look horrible and get on the street what are you going to be when you face the portals of heaven on her and there she was she washed his feet kissed his feet and would anointed him and doing everything as she could because she wanted forgiveness and all of a sudden she she wonder what he's going to do now he had showed simon and that backfired on him the thing that he said he was the prophet was prove that he was a prophet that he was the word of god now he's standing there with his face swelled out of you he'll grab that little woman thought her out of the church but she got what she asked for amen imagine what the rest of them said she got what she asked for now he turns to her her little heart begin to beat real fast now what's he going to say there she is all of her pretty curls is hanging all down over her waist chair and her her eyes are streaking with tears and her face and lips are all greasy where she's been kissing his feet and actually put that all on him she sure looks messed up but then great big eyes looking to see what's going to say he said and i say unto her all her sins which are many are forgiven [Music] that's it all her sins are forgiven that's what i want to hear oh that's the words that i want i don't care what the rest of him says i'm ready to stand in his denomination and declare that he is the word of god i don't care what they say penny turn on if you want to send a mind reader fortune teller whatever you want to i'm ready to kiss the reproach from him it's his word certainly he promised that he is the word just as much today as he was then he said so now friend there may be people sitting here that can't agree that he's the prophet you might not agree that he's a healer but there's one thing that every church member should agree he's a savior and i want to say this before closing not long ago a attorney friend of mine was trying a case of a man and woman that it was going to him uh separate and attorney was a fine christian gentleman he said don't don't separate he tried his best to keep him from it but not this determined there was going to be something come up between them after a while he said well if you got the home down there you better go down divide the spoils because if they have to get them down and lawyers and things get into it you know what's going to happen they'll take every bit of it so they went into the rooms to divide up what they had they went into the parlor they fussed and stood obliged this and i had this and they went on in the next room and divided in there and finally it went up in the attic they had a remember they had an old trunk up there they got in there and began to say well this belonged to my mama this was my mama's like that and it got down in the trunk a piece both of them kneeling on the floor with the trunk right open dividing up what was what they couldn't agree that belongs to me i paid for that i've done the work i stayed home when you did it fussing finally they raised up something else and both of them grabbed the same time what was it a little pair of shoes from a little baby that had been born to that union that god had taken they couldn't argue that had something in common as he held their hands he remembered that she was a mother that baby he remembered she was a mother she remembered he was a father as they help the little shoes in their hands they pull one another to each other put their arms around each other the divorce case was involved why they found something they had in common you might have disagreed with me this week to see the holy spirit come in confirm these words and things do you might disagree with that you might disagree with the sick being healed but we do have one thing in common that's the blood of jesus christ that saves us from sins will you wash the dirt from his feet tonight let us bow our heads just a moment remember he keeps every promise he keeps every promise he promised though your sins be a scarlet they shall be wise know all your sins are forgiven you if you'll just believe it with our heads bound i wonder how many here will raise your hand and say brother branham i want to rest in my life i want to not let him sit and be disgraced and i have an opportunity like the little woman did i want to with my testimony to wash the dirt from him that his precious name will you raise your hand say pray for me brother random ah god bless you god bless you that's fine now heavenly father there were many many hands that went up here just now and we see that the name of jesus christ has been stomped into the dirt and everything in heaven's name that everything on earth is named that every every church member every member of the body of christ is miss jesus and we pray heavenly father that we'll see and understand that tonight may your grace come upon these people now and forgive every sin that they know that in your presence now and know that you're here let your holy spirit teach us all now and may we be forgiven of all of our sins and our mistakes and from tonight on may we be new creatures fill with your spirit granted may we be conscious of your presence for we asked it in his name and while we have our heads bowed i wonder tonight now i'm talking to sinners and to church members and the backsliders and to those who have not the holy ghost i'm talking to you why didn't pharisee accept him we'll keep calling for him oh lord will you come when your baby was sick you called for him he was merciful no doubt when he's about to see that wreck out there you called on him he let you get out of it but i wonder just wonder well all these things that we ask him and we invite him then when he comes to visit us like this i wonder if we're just ashamed they'll say well i've been a member of a church but i want to find him the baptism of the holy ghost tonight i want him i need him i don't care what the rest of the world says about it i want him would you like to have the baptism of the holy spirit if you would i'm going to ask you to do something i want you to come up here right here where i am now come right down here and stand right at this pit right here behind me every person in here every unsaved person first will you walk up here and stand here just a minute if you believe that he hears prayer will you come here and stand here just a minute now while we sing one verse of a song what is that

that night to come to christ and she wouldn't do it and then afterwards she met me outside and said don't you never embarrass me like that again a year later i pass through the streets she's an
