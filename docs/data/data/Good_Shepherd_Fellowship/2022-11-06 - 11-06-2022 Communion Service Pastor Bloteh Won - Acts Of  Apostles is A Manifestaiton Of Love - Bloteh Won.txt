Bibles and go to Saint John chapter 5. it's in John chapter 5. [Music] it's in John chapter 5. that particular verse we spend almost a month on it but I want to take it tonight for for uh a part of our our type praise the Lord Saint John Chapter 5 Verse 3 verse 19. between John chapter 5. I was not able to get to the hospital this afternoon because the loved one I was supposed to meet there I was not picking their phone and then they called back when it was when it was late so I just couldn't go and so as you make contact with them right after the service to see if we get down there but I talked to a thing is is a sister to the young man and uh he was having a kind of a high blood pressure you know I think he was somewhere over 200 or so or more and I think it shoot into his brain you know shoot into his brain and then I think it kind of for bringing out the the brain cells for communication so the doctors are not communicating with his brain you know even though he's he's showing signs of of opening his eyes but there is just no communication you know there is no communication so and that's that's one of the things that is difficult in medical science is they cannot communicate with your brain they don't know how to help your body you know they don't know how to help your body because it is that communication that tells them uh where they need to treat you know so it's it's a tough thing so they are they are leaving him uh you know in the hands of God's mercy you know they are leaving him in the hands of God's mercy so we will we will keep there in prayer I know there was a deacon brother in Liberia their brother uh Stephen wood brought a prayer request for he too was experiencing that that high blood pressure too and and they had to rush him over to the hospital and so uh it's uh it's a trench that we beginning to see that is happening among people whether it's because of stress or whatever it is and we want to make sure that we we take care of ourselves amen we have to realize that brother Branham says this age is the age of of letting off the pressure yes amen and this is a good way to let off the pressure to come in the presence of God Amen praise the Lord because we are we are living in a world where there are extreme pressure you know extreme pressure as the holy ghost live off of the earth I mean they are just they are just all sorts of things that is pulling into this three-dimensional world that we are living in so uh I mean let's let's guide ourself and and keep under the blood so John chapter 5 verse 19 tonight then answer Jesus and said unto them verily verily I say unto you the son can do nothing of himself but what he serious the father do for one thing so ever he does also does the son likewise for the Father loveth the song and showeth him all things there himself does and he will show him greater work then this the year may Marvel let us pray Heavenly Father we just want to come to you Lord father approaching you by the reading of your word tonight and we will just ask Lord a special blessing upon the the community service tonight we just want to just our father take another type Lord in continuation of what we were talking about this morning and and father we will pray that God you will bless it to the heart of your people what an awesome God you are what a wonderful father in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen the Lord bless you praise the Lord praise the Lord you know what is one of these things where you are you you you are I remember I was over there uh on this trip that I was and I was speaking on something how you see in a day and age that we are living in and people says oh wow you know I mean it's just the love of God we just need to love one another we just need to love one another so uh uh you know uh sometimes when people have issues instead of dealing with the issues you know sitting down and dealing with the thing that is the problem they just says well we just need to love one another it's just the love of God you know you know God so loved the word and then it starts to preview the gospel of love and uh so I was I was I was speaking in one of the services there and I know I've looked into this before but then I went into that trench of talking about uh uh about that and I and I told the the Saints I says if you look at the early church the the emphasis of the early church and I'll give you I gave you an assignment to challenge you in the same way if you go and read the book of Arts from the first chapter to the last chapter the last verse strange enough strange enough the word love is never mentioned in that book I know some people won't sleep tonight I know some people will sleep tonight it's all it's all it's almost like the Book of Esther it okay you you know we we say that over and over you know that the name of God is never mentioned in the book but actually if you look at the Hebrew Monastery the name of God is there I'll take I'll take some time and bring that to you it's it's right it's right in uh it's it's hating just the word god G or the is not mentioned in the book and it's the same with the book of Acts now the Bible says they sell everything that they have and brought it to the apostles feet it must be love that constrain them to do that right amen the Bible says they were Distributing to the poor and helping you know the Saints the the poor it might be law the Bible talk about Dockers that was making blanket and giving it to to all uh you know the people until when she died everybody remembered that it was the love of God that was on her heart so don't misunderstand me that love was not in the book of Arts it's just that the worst spell out was never used in the text why because the emphasis was not on the the feelings of the people the emphasis was on the life projected The Life of Christ reaching out foreign forces of the early church the emphasis of these people have just witnessed the death and the burial and the resurrection of Jesus they have just experienced a baptism of the Holy Ghost the pillar of Fire coming down in the upper room and baptized and giving every one of them an experience that they have never had in their life since they were born so their emphasis was not well you just love me or we we just need to laugh no their emphasis was not in a sense of looking for human sympathy or trying to sympathize with people they are emphasis they believe in a resurrected Christ they believe in a living God you know so I was I was uh I was I was talking on this and then after this after the service I was I was relaxing and I says well I think I need to look at my challenge let me go back let me go back before because I've thrown out challenge and I've come back in and encouraged myself and say I'm wrong I'm you know I'm guilty so I went back and and kind of look at that in and I realized yeah now for once the word was used in the book of Acts but you do the same if you finally let me know in that way you can help me it's the same it's the same also of uh of Revelation chapter 10 that we read praise the Lord if the emphasis of the early church was not on sympathizing with people or appealing for sympathy those people wanted to experience they wanted to experience the new life they wanted to experience just imagine those people they had a hope in their heart that the Messiah was going to bring them a Jewish ruling in Israel he was going to stem out the Romans that was why they had in their heart so they were looking for someone that would bring a revolution against the Romans praise the Lord but Jesus brought them a new birth he brought him an Exeter bringing them out of Judaism and bringing them to the knee birth bringing him to an experience bringing him to a kingdom they were looking for the kingdom of David on Earth but he was bringing the kingdom to their heart and after the resurrection of Jesus they were all desperate they were only atours when they get down to pray they wanted an answer because this man that he saw that raised the dead and healed the sake they saw him being crucified on the cross they witnessed them taking his body down and laying him in a tomb and then before three days his resurrected he comes stepping through the wall and spreading your hands and said Put Your Hands here see the nails I'm alive so the the early church they were not looking for sympathy they were now looking for sympathy when when Peter and John were arrested they never had to choose their words they never had to be politically correct they said well we we learn to obey men or obey God praise the Lord they were desperate to see a living God among among them the Bible says that God together to pray until the house was shaken I don't believe that it was it was a physical shaking of the house but they broke into a spear they broke into an atmosphere they were not looking for him on sympathy they were not looking for oh oh yeah yeah everybody don't like me nobody like me nobody loved me nobody called me nobody oh my God we will not have a book of Arts if that was their attitude praise the Lord as chapter 5 when he got right down there Peter did not choose his words praise the Lord I was just looking at that I was standing on the subject called Acts chapter 5 return back to the church I realized that brother Branham uh uh uh through the message he he Associated Acts chapter 5 with the gift of discernment the same gift that was knowing the secret in people's heart brother Branham says it was the same manifestation that took place in Acts chapter 5. so ananias and Sophia came to church and just like brother Branham would say you set him back there with that thing in your heart that was exactly what he did yeah say you down there what what are you lying to the Holy Ghost through the spirit of discernment back in the church when Simon the Sorcerer thought that he can bribe and and you know he has he has he has lived this way praise the Lord amen he had lived by his magic tricks and all of that he has make name for himself and now when he heard that the the the the apostles and and what they were doing he was trying to associate himself with them so he cannot lose his status because pretty soon the Holy Ghost was going to expose him in which of course the Holy Ghost exposing praise the Lord so you see the early church they were not they were not on he must sympathy to to build their Church the Bible says it was just one move of God three thousand people added to the church and the prophet of God said that's where they had their problem because there was a mixed multitude that came in men that creeped in unaware to spy the liberty of the church so let's get away from this thing of appealing for sympathy right appealing for sympathy the attitude of the early church was to see the resurrected Christ see the resurrected Christ moving in your corner you won't care if anybody call you on that because you know Jesus said I will never leave you I will never forsake you you know that resurrected crisis with you are we together now so what what I wanted to do uh this evening was just to to just uh take another portion of my types we uh we went through this uh uh we went through this this uh this subject when we were talking on Harmony the the the the we were talking on the harmony between the father and the son I mean we we deal with this for almost a month if it is now more than that brother Brandon Pagano's Church age notice the harmony of the father and the son Jesus never did anything until it was first shown him by the father John 5 19 he said this harmony is known to exist between the groom and his bride he show her his word his Word of Life she receive it she never doubt it therefore nothing can harm her not even death amen death only promote her death do not harm her amen it promote us it sent us to a a higher dimension for if the seed is planted and what and uh and water will rise it up again here is the secret of this the word is in the bride as it was in Mary the bride has the mind of Christ for she knows what he once done with the word praise the Lord amen all that was saying God he committed to Christ he put it in Christ all that was in Christ he pulls in the church so the the the the bride has the man of Christ and she knows what he won the word to be done with amen now so we would take that that type tonight and goes to first king first king chapter 2. first king chapter 2. are we together first king chapter two first before we read first king chapter two let me back up with the story here before we read first king chapter two if you look in second Samuel chapter 16 you will see the story of where David when he was rejected when Absalom his son has has taken the throne and David was rejected we come across this story in the second king chapter two from uh uh no chap second king chapter 16 sorry second king chapter 16. and it is the story word David is now living the city as a rejected King and we see this benjamined ah [Music] let's let me read from verse five and when and when King David came to bahura and behold thence came out a man of the family of the House of Saul who name was their son of jira he came forth and and cursed still as he came cursing David and he cast on a David and and at all the seven of King David and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left am I reading second Samuel 16. reading from verse 5. if I did not confuse you okay so I'm reading from second Samuel chapter 16 from verse 5. amen so I'm down to verse seven and thus say when he cares come out come out thou bloody man and thou men of belie the Lord has returned upon thee all the blood of the House of Saul in who still there there has Reign and the Lord has delivered the kingdom into the hands of Absalon thy son and behold thou I take him in thy Mischief because thou are a bloody man praise the Lord and as You Follow the story that was word David man says I will not allow this dog to cause my king he wanted to use the spear Davidson or leave him maybe the Lord has told him to do that amen maybe in bearing this I might be able to find Mercy before God praise the Lord in bearing this I might be able to find Mercy before God Christ is the mission of God revealed brother bam talks about a story with he and brother Neville you know and he says he says Branham why why were you just you just sit down there and allow people to just say things about you without without reacting he says he said there he said but Olivia was a man that was very quick on the trigger amen he gets back you fire him he fired back at you you know and then brother Brandon referred to this scripture and uh just at that time brother Brown was was was praying about something and uh and then he said he said brother nivo you remember in the story in the Bible where David allowed you know she mailed to curse him and then uh he you know he just he just allowed it to go and uh and and just in having that attitude you know right after that conversation the prophet broke into a vision and then he have he had an answer of something that he was waiting for now so you see yeah uh it's a great principle now so this this took place this took place shimaya has has cursed David to the face and uh you know and then he's he's gone now let's go over to our chapter that we wanted to read which is uh first Samuel chapter two no first king chapter two first king chapter two I think you might have an idea when I'm going with this but uh just bear with me now the days of David Drew 9 that he should die and he charged Solomon his son saying I go the way of all the Earth be thou strong therefore and show thyself a man and keep the charge of the Lord thy God to walk in his ways to keep his statures and his Commandments and his joshmen and his testimonies as it is written in the Lord of Moses that thou mayor prosper in all that they are thus and whether so ever that turneth thyself that the law may continue on his words which he speak concerning means saying if that children take heed to their ways to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all they are so there shall not fail thee he said a man on the throne of Israel praise the Lord now as David tried to instruct Solomon here he says you know take charge to yourself do all of this and you know walk in the Commandments of the Lord don't turn from the a to the right don't turn from it to the left now we will see him moving into something as verse 5 moreover they'll know it show up now joab was David captain of the army praise the Lord he's going to give Solomon an instruction because there were two captains that job killed when Absalom was the king uh uh what is his name Abner was uh the captain of the army of of Absalom draw up make sure that abna was that you know was killed in battle and then uh Amisa also so David here now is reminding Solomon now refer back now to Saint John 5 19 okay uh David yeah is re uh uh reminding Solomon that uh Joe up did this to me you know he killed this Army and uh and he says verse 6 do therefore I call into that wisdom and let net his hurt head go down to the grave in peace praise the Lord over in verse 9 verse 8 David is also picking up another case and that would be the case of shimir but what is beautiful here is that uh before we get to this place when uh David returned back to the kingdom has come to ask David for pardon and David have given him an instruction praise the Lord he promised she mailed if you read the story he swore unto him he swore unto him that he will not kill him but David never put an all to it just like David swear I saw make David to swear unto him that he will remember him in all of his sons David accepted it but David never put an ought to it praise the Lord so if you continue in a line of talk that we were that we were speaking on this morning if there is not an art there is a possibility for the promise to be broken praise the Lord is only now if you go back to Hebrew chapter 6 you'll realize that uh when when uh when Paul speaks about that how gods were by himself Paul used there to be able to introduce the mechevelop priesthood then he goes into it in chapter seven and on and on and on now you will realize that when God gave uh uh Finnish and and and a promise that he will be a priest forever there was no artwork praise the Lord because if you read uh through the history of Israel you will realize that in the time of Solomon the one that from the lineage of Philly has that was priests was compromised so if God promised the priests who forever until Fini has there was a place where it came to an end why because there was no art to the levitical priesthood God never put an alter it why because there was a priesthood that is an internal priesthood the priests who after the other of magazinek it's such a beautiful story when you just take the time and look through the scripture over in the time of of of of David uh zadac also was brought into the priesthood and uh that that priesthood in his lineage continue on to the coming of the Messiah praise the Lord and also if you read the book of Ezekiel you will realize that God promised the priesthood from the family of Zara to be over in a millennium now you will see why in marriage and divorce when brother Branham was referring to things from the levitical priesthood He also mentioned Ezekiel praise the Lord that is just something completely different but let's come over here to what we were talking about uh uh uh this David and this young gentleman so David you know what uh uh make make a swear unto him that he was not going to kill him but here is David here at a time where he's about to leave he's telling his son remember him the son of jira a benjamite of bahuram which cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to uh mahina but he came down and met me at Jordan and I swear to him by the law saying I will not put thee to death with the sword now therefore hold him not Guiltless praise the Lord so that that that's where the principle is that's that's what uh you know what we we I I want you to see because you know brother Branham in a message marriage and divorce he speaks of the continuity of the scripture even in the light of the types there is a place where a type holds in the life of Joseph he was a perfect type of Jesus Christ but when it came to the place of where he's telling lies that type breaks he he's not representing Jesus in that praise the Lord David was a perfect type of Jesus Christ you know crying or going up the hill you know and all of that but when the king told his transgression with Bathsheba the tie breaks praise the Lord amen because when we just take these thoughts of times and things in the scripture and don't know where it holds and where it breaks then brother Branham said pray the song we have a house on top of the house eating grass right you have the picture completely out of other here is David swearing to this man that he will not kill him but what what happened here now that he's instructing his son uh uh uh Solomon to use wisdom and deal with this why because there was no art to it there was no art to it where David had an odd was to janiton in his sons right he did not have he did not have an ought to to saw when he promised and swear unto him he did not had an heart out here also to Toshiba so Solomon is instructing him instructing his son like Jesus says the father committed all judgment to the son so that is the time here David is committing all judgment to his son are we together then when Solomon came to power we see here that uh Solomon sent for him and Solomon instructed him and said you remember all that you have you have done uh unto my father he told him that don't go out of the city of Jerusalem praise the Lord so you see what he's doing is the other he's keeping the promise he made to his father he's Reviving The the uh the the Covenant if you call it he's Reviving The Covenant he's putting a condition to the Covenant because when God makes an ought you are on an unconditional coveting no matter what you do God cannot break it right praise the Lord amen when God swore by himself and put an all to it is unconditional God hold himself responsible but if there is no ought to it then it becomes a conditional Covenant so yeah Solomon is giving a condition he's Reviving The Promise of David I would like I swear I will not kill you but yes the condition you got to stay in the walls of Jerusalem praise the Lord are we together and when you read uh the rest of the story you'll find out that uh uh shimia had a problem with one of his seven and the Seven was running out of the city of Jerusalem and he forgot and God on the terror and ran out of the city and when Solomon found out he broke the Covenant so then Solomon executed him so you see the place of the scripture you see those things are they are placed there like like Paul said for our examples a lot of those types and shadows are placed right in there for our examples praise the Lord so when God make an art when God make an order after the service this morning there were there was something the other that I was looking at when I read Revelation chapter 10 and I just I just believed that was the grace of God I did not have that in my notes like that but uh I mean the spirit of the Lord led me that way so I went back and then I started reading and I was and I was looking at uh uh the way the the way that uh you know the the entire chapter was it was designed with all the conjunctions that is in the the scripture and then I realized that end is just a conjunction as but but the difference there is their end is a conjunction of continuation but what is a conjunction of a contracts praise the Lord so that they're just it just kind of for it just kind of Fosters something you mean and and I think the law kind of forgive me strength from there praise the Lord amen so you see uh that's the reason why that gods were by himself he has brought us honor and ought of an unconditional coveting praise the Lord there is nothing there he's looking up to us to do but to accept all that he have provided amen so just like when we come to the communion tonight as we are here a few minutes will be changing the order of the service this is this is an instruction of God's word praise the Lord it's an instruction of God's word and like we read this morning bird branches as we approach the table I'm saying to my brothers and sisters and says I believe the Lord Jesus Christ I believe all he have done for me to the best of my knowledge I'm living a Christian Life praise the Lord I'm living a Christian Life I'm not living a life of of uh of impression I'm not living a life of our service I'm serving God with the earnesty of my heart praise the Lord amen if there is anything that that uh that you know a way that I'm stepping wrong if God made it noon to me I'm going to make it right praise the Lord you see how much pressure that that takes from over us we are not we are not uh uh trying to live to the expectation of one another or the impression of one another go that was what Saul was trying to do when he killed the giver Knights and they caught seven of his sons praise the Lord like I said before and uh and there is there's a reason why I'm continuing making this statement as I said before the only thing we have as we as we said before the Lord is the faith in Jesus Christ that we have in our hearts and Grace that is taking us day by day to live for him if God should take that Grace away from us we will be no different than the people in the world and if there is anything that we must appreciate and always keep to the back of our mind that it's a finished work we are looking at a finished work let's bow our heads this evening foreign we want to create our own self-righteous approach to God and we want people to conform to our our mind of what we think it is instead of praying for one another provoking one another to Godly love and Sheltering our differences if there is any walking by faith trusting the grace of God put in the name of God first in our life and things that we do if we if we if we are escaping from there then we are putting ourselves on a condition of covenanting and every conditional Covenant will be broken because that's that's that was not the Covenant that God gave to Abraham when God will institute the element of faith to his people he would bring Abraham in an unconditional Covenant as we buy our house tonight foreign [Music] Jesus let's thank God tonight let's express our gratitude let's bring Thanksgiving unto him foreign let's appreciate him for what he had provided for all that he have given like the prophet of God said everything we need for this joining is already provided [Music] yes world again make me home again nothing but the blood oh Jesus Jesus oh precious is the floor God makes me wide as normal I know nothing but the Blood of Jesus we sing all precious yes the floor died [Music] wide eyes know [Music] father found I know nothing for the blood musicians play softly let's go to the Lord in prayer tonight let's just thank him for his grace let's thank him for his Lord let's thank him for all his provision let's thank him that he's he's the one that has he has made an art over our life he has brought us uh honor a promise will he make an order putting his foot on the land and putting his foot on the scene he swear by himself that time will be no longer that no matter what you are going through just like the Lord told by the brand I mean in on the wings of a snow white dog it's only six inches long sex is the number of a man no matter what you're going through it's just it's just six six inches long it could be six minutes it could be it could just be just it's in a human brain in a sense it's just in a human right it's just this flesh it's just your mind it's just your present condition but don't Define yourself don't Define your life by what you are going through look at the
