that we can be together and uh uh we just want to take our Bibles Matthew chapter 17 Matthew chapter 17 Matthew chapter 17 just for the scripture reading tonight let's read from verse one Matthew chapter 177 we'll read from verse one to verse 9 praise the Lord this just 10 minutes after it8 so we'll try to get you out of here before it gets late praise the Lord Matthew chapter 17 Reading from verse 1 to verse n and after six days Jesus taking Peter James and John his brother and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart and was transfigured before them and his face did shine as the sun and his Ren was white as the light and behold there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with him then answered Peter and said unto Jesus Lord it is good for us to be here if thou will let us make year three Tabernacle one for day one for Moses one for Elijah while he yet speak Behold a bright Cloud overshadowed them and behold a voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved Son in whom I am well placed yeah him and when the disciples heard it they fell on their face and were so afraid and Jesus came and touched them and said arise and be not afraid and when they had lifted up their eyes they saw no man save Jesus only pay attention now to verse 9 and as they came down from the mountain Jesus charged them saying tell the vision tell the vision to know man until the son of man be raising again from the dead praise the Lord let's pray together Heavenly Father Lord we want to thank you again for the privilege Lord we can be able to read nine verses out of uh this chapter we don't need uh nine verses Lord just one it's enough Lord father for our meditation just one is enough to change our life just one is enough Lord father to affect us in a positive way but Lord we are grateful that we stay have privilege to have your word and father we can we can be able to read it especially in this age uh this information age where we have your word on our phone in the Bible on our iPads and the CD uh and and we just such such Lord father uh uh an assess that we have Lord we pray that God we will make use of it Lord we make use of it precious Lord and bless this portion of the word that we read tonight and uh May something be said of internal value that will encourage us tonight in Jesus name we pray amen amen the Lord bless you it's good to be in the house of the Lord amen good to be in the house of the Lord praise the Lord amen amen now we read from Matthew chapter 17 to tonight that was just uh uh uh for scripture reading uh so uh don't thing I'm leaving mine in the beginning was the word uh I'm I'm stay on that subject but I just want to share something with you tonight uh that will that will encourage you you know we we spoke on uh uh Sunday and we were talking about uh uh parenting how the word parent us from the beginning how God parent his first children and he has been parenting us uh uh all alone trying to get us away from uh from all the the the the the the Cru of parenting I would say or the man uh uh all the ways that men have established to to parent in this word and uh uh John is trying was trying to be able to grab our attention to look back and see uh how God is parenting his children it's by the word it was it was from the word he never parent his children with Commandments he parent his children with love praise the Lord and I always believe that uh when the person is going through their worst moment that's the most time to love them it's a contract praise the Lord because we we term as human to be more comfortable when a person is going through their best moment yeah you know it's that's that's that's the way it it floats it it looks like the current flows that way when the person is going through their best that's the time is easy to love them but uh uh God had to come down and uh Genesis chapter 3 he has to take a lamb and uh uh he has to to sacrifice the lamb the expression of his love to be able to bring his children back into fellowship and continue parenting them by the word so that that is that is the that is the best time you know uh that we we need to we need to step up go beyond all our senses and all our feelings to be able to express love so God parent by love he don't parent by Commandments he don't parent by rules he parent by love because his end goal is to discipline us not to punish us God don't punish his children he disciplined Us Praise the Lord amen so strange enough after speaking that uh uh uh Strang enough um I think it was Monday I was I was uh you know uh listening to a tape and uh I figure out there that I share this with you it's my own a secret you can it can benefit you or uh you just take it as mine you know every every date in the calendar there is a message that was preached so I normally go over to the info base and and just put a date in whatever date it is uh and and and just be able to take up a message so I did that and and uh uh uh I I took the message approach to God and and and strange enough I just took there to meditate in the morning get myself ready for whatever I had to do but strangely enough brother Brandon in that message was talking about Job approached to God for his children and I mean the Lord just got me to a place you know he was talking of how job approached God through the burnt offering and uh uh for his children uh uh uh not noring you know that his children will go through the things and then brother Brandon started talking about our children and the which of course he said we must be grateful no matter what our children are going through they are far better than what other children are going through amen we must always be thankful because uh and and then he brought in uh a story uh of about uh Billy Paul his his young boy you know he started talking about when uh uh his son Billy Paul started struggling and started going with the wrong crowd and all of that he said Bel you will have you will have to go over the prayer of a righteous father and uh you know and then he started talking out of there but the the the focus you know where he was driving is the approach you know is the approach that we take to God and uh uh uh you you know when when our family when our church when our loved ones are going through through uh different things and it was it was so it was just so uh uh unique I mean that uh the Lord just CAU me with that thought so I had a good time fellowshipping on that and uh and and there was a whole lot to learn from and uh so uh I think uh the Lord knew that uh uh you know uh uh we needed that so uh and then what I was I was I was trying to get myself uh uh ready you know preparing just looking into things uh that we will talk about tonight like I promised we were uh speaking on uh uh from the beginning but before we uh we go to there let me read uh a question and answer here from from from Hebrew uh there's there's a question and answer from the C uh let me just read question here something caught my attention and uh so I went back and and and pulled this quote up I want to share that with you and that thing you know took me into the direction that we will go tonight so let's share that quote tonight Hebrew uh part three a quote from from cood someone is asking uh brother brand a question who are the 24 EDS I think every one of us know if you don't know you'll have the privilege to know tonight who are the 24 others now that's just simple he said we could get to it the 24 others was sitting Before the Throne Revelation the 4th chapter the the 10th verse that's right we will get to it and the the four and 20 others fell down before him that sat on the throne and worship him that lath forever and ever and cast their Crown Before the Throne saying thou are worthy oh Lord to receive glory and honor and power for thou have created all things and for that pleasure they they are and were created now the 4 and 20 others an other is an overseer now notice they they were 12 Patriots and 12 Apostles now pay attention now there were 12 Patriarchs and 12 Apostles and and they were sitting 12 on one side and 12 on the other side they were the TW the the 24 Els which were the 12 Patriots on one side the Old Testament the 12 Apostle on the other side of the New Testament so the 12 Patriarchs go back to the sons of uh uh uh uh uh Jacob praise the Lord and uh and uh the 12 apostles you know uh uh the the the men there with our lord Jesus now so as I was as I was uh uh studying and uh uh and I I I read this something caught my attention you know talking about John and and and everything thatth we've been talking about the Book of Revelation so so I went back and then I started looking at something I started hunting for something if you remember in the seals brother Brandon was talking about when the seals were open Revelation chapter 5 now the the the 24 ERS is is listed in Revelation chapter 4 John spoke about the 24 others in Revelation chapter 4 but he also mentioned the 24 EDS in Revelation chapter 5 now the Lord will help me to see something and uh maybe you have seen it but I had a privilege to see it today and I will share it with you if you saw it you didn't share it with me praise the Lord I'll be kind and share mine with you amen now so uh uh uh but what what what what caught my attention is this uh uh the 24 ether is is is spoke about in Revelation chapter 4 Revelation chap 5 the Bible says no man was worthy to take the book and to loose the seals thereof and John started to weep because no man was worthy to take the book then uh he heard that one of the he one of the 24 he said unto John we not for the lion of the Trap of Judah has prevailed to take the book and to lose the seals thereof are we together amen pay attention now the cash is right here one of the ERS said to John weep that for the lion of the Trap of Judah has prevailed to take the book and to lose the seals thereof and and when John turned around he saw a lamb praise the Lord and when he saw the lamb the lamb took the book and the lamb loosed the seals of the book then brother brandham in this seals make us to understand when the seals were open John saw himself praise the Lord he saw his name on the book are we together praise the Lord are we together are you paying attention John was part of the 12th Apostles right okay he was part of the 24 others right praise the Lord amen and now he's in this Vision seeing the 24 others it did not capture him that he seen himself he never identified himself until the seals were open that's what brother randam says when the seals were open then John saw John and that was when he he yelled and he says everyone hear me why because the opening of the seal brought an identification what he could not understand under Shadows because the the the Book of Revelation was all symbols in chapter 4 he saw the 24 ERS around the throne but it was just a symbol are we together amen are you seeing the picture amen amen that is the importance of the open of the seal are we together because no man was wed to take the book and to lose the seals thereof now so you see the what caught my attention what caught my attention is that and I'm not trying to bring anything is not a revelation because the Revelation comes to the prophet what caught my attention is that brother brandham said John saw John now it's it's easy to just take that as uh you know as uh uh you know oh wow you know the the the prophet uh I mean uh what a revelation you know brother Bram said John saw John but it's right there in the Scripture it it's it takes a prophet because a prophet is a Divine interpreter of the scripture so it it takes a prophet to be able to help us to see be h h h right in the middle of the pages why because if the 24 ERS are the 12 Patriots and the 12 apostles and John is part of the 12 apostles definitely he's right there when he's looking at the 24 ERS he should be among the 24 ERS praise the Lord but because the vision from the beginning the seven Church AG the seven goal cand all of those things were symbols praise the Lord are we together amen are we together amen can I preach amen praise the Lord now when they C man attention then I started I started uh reading some things some other things and and I just want to share some of those things with you tonight are we together let's let's read our our next quote I mean in just just the other is in Revelation chapter 4 a few days after this is going back to the the the the scripture we read a few days after that he taken Peter James and John up into the mountain apart to be a witness Peter James and John this is the very same John that had that experience on the island of pmos this is the very same John that we've been talking about now watch you're taking Peter James and John and they seeing the KY K om of God coming power and the seeing the coming of the kingdom of God rehearsed amen oh they br they were brought into view of watching the kingdom of God be rehearsed as it countes the issuing in of the Millennium the the rehearsal so I I decided to title what we're talking about tonight rehearsal praise the Lord now if you go back to uh uh uh St John chapter 17 after they heard a voice that said this is my beloved Son the Bible says they fell to their face praise the Lord amen amen they fell to their face and uh uh uh and and and after Jesus came and touched them and when they lift up their head Moses and Elijah was gone Jesus was alone praise the Lord now Jesus will help them to be able to understand what have just transpired Peter out of zeal was says it is good for us to be here let's make one Tabernacle for Moses one for Elias one for the you know and all of that and then Jesus would tell them what you have just witnessed is a vision yeah praise the Lord but don't tell this Vision to no man until the son of man be lifted up praise the Lord now the vision that they saw brother Brandon is making us to understand that that Vision was God way of doing a rehearser God was rehearsing to them they were looking at things that will happen in the future praise the Lord you know the the the big thing of rehearser when we talk about rehearsal everybody think about wedding praise the Lord but I will tell you tonight rehe wedding is not the only thing that we do rehearsal for right are we together are you with me amen let's continue to read let's take the next one I thought for us to just do a little prayer meeting tonight I'll share this with you we'll pray it and then we be we go home Revelation chapter 4 we continue John called and summered by the Lord Jesus Promised by God back there that he he did see the coming of the son of man Peter James and John and them standing present when Jesus spoke to them and said there is some standing here will not taste death till they see the son of man coming he didn't say all that was standing there but some and they and and they went a few this after death and saw the order of the Resurrection rehearse so brother brandham is saying Jesus is going to give this man a rehearsal of how things would happen as the sequence of order praise the Lord he's doing a rehearsal and he and in and and and and and to do this rehearsal he he breaks them into a vision praise the Lord the Lord is rehearsing his uh his his future work are we together amen now watch now follow me brother bam says here and and and and there went a few days the Bible says after six day on the seventh day and uh they saw the order of the Resurrection rehearse and the coming of the Lord Elijah represented the dead sin brother B said No Moses he said Moses and being resurrected Elijah represented the translated sin all right but remember Moses was first and then Elijah okay Elijah was to be the messenger in the last day that with him and his group will come the resurrection well it will come the rapture praise the Lord I mean Moses brought in the resurrection and Elijah brought in the Rapture groupall and there both of them represented right there now Peter saw the vision he got excited oh wow and you can you can now now realize now he was able to identify those men he never Liv in the day he never lived in the day of Moses he never lived in the day of uh of Elijah but because he was transported praise the Lord he was able to identify that it is Moses and Elijah praise the Lord but he never understood the vision say oh W lord is good for us to be here we can make three Tabernacles praise the Lord amen now Jesus told them tell no man about the vision until the son of man be uh H lifted up now so we see him now yes's the prophet of God now the uh the the The Interpreter of the word is making us now to understand the vision that Peter did not understand he saw the vision he was able to identify Moses and Elijah but he never understood what was happening praise the Lord and because he never understood what was happening he wanted to build his denomination right let's make one for Moses let make one for for Elijah but what was happening here and uh uh like the prophet of God saying is that God was rehearsing the the having a rehearsal of the the the the resurrection and the rapture showing that uh uh uh uh the the ones that that are dead in Christ will rise first and we that are alive will be caught up in the twigling of an eye and and and to go and meet them up in the air praise the Lord now you have to remember he was coming to the end of his uh of his ministry on earth right and there was there was just a whole lot of thing that he he wanted to he wanted to to to to speak to this to this gentleman Reve to this man and and and they were not getting it praise the Lord amen they were not getting it they were not just uh you know in tone so here is uh uh uh uh uh Jesus here now and saying okay you know I I spoke to this men and if you look at the sequence of other that's what brother Bram is saying now he's putting it in the sequence of other Jesus have just told them few days ago that some of you here will not taste death until you see the son of man coming in power six day after he had said that he took them up up on the mountain and gave them a rehearsal yeah let me let me give these boys a taste of what I was seeing yeah wow praise the Lord and he told them tell no man about it until I'm you have to realize that the Holy Ghost has not come yet praise the Lord and lot of the things that uh that Jesus uh uh was revealing to them they will not understand until the Holy Ghost has come in the church are we together amen are we together yes amen now what I want to get your attention to tonight is uh sometimes sometimes and many times we over spiritualize things but then when we look in the word brother Bram says God never makes his way his word is never complicated it's always the complex mind of man that try to complicate the Simplicity of God follow me tonight this is just a little prayer meeting here is almighty God almighty god of what he would do in the future you will see that brother Brandon would take this thought right into Revelation series we we will get there here is almighty God taking this you know what he was what he was going to do his resurrect the the the resurrection of the Saints uh you know that are died in Christ the the Rapture and brother Bram says even even onto the Millennium the things that will happen let's read one more quote and then that would that would that would kind of emphasize that uh to to us tonight praise the Lord let's go to the next one let's go to the next one he said and and and Jesus said to them what is it to you if he if if if he TI it until I come till I return what is it and the disciples made a mistake they said that Jesus said that he was uh going to live till the coming but Jesus didn't make no mistake mistake right here in Revelation CH 4 now you have to know now Revelation 4 verse one what was that a translation come up higher amen praise the Lord Revelation 4 verse 1 let's let's read Revelation CH 4 verse 1 I don't want to get you in the whole uh verse there there is just one one thing I want to I want to grab your attention yeah I pray that the Lord help me I don't lose my trend of thought and then get into a a Bible study that's not what I want to do tonight I just want to I just want to encourage you and and and show you the Simplicity of God okay this is what I wanted us to see verse Revelation 4:1 after this after this after this what is there what is this this we have just gone through the church ages so John is saying after this he's looking back to the church ages and saying after this so it it brings us to the place that's where brother Bram in Revelation series established the as a symbol of the Rapture because the Rapture can only take place after the end of the church ages are we together amen amen so after this I look and behold a door was open in heaven and the first verse which I heard was as it were a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither come up hither which of course is a type of the Rapture come up higher be lifted up so after the church age Comes The Rapture are we together amen now so brother Brandon goes here he says he says but Jesus didn't make no mistake right here in Revelation chapter 4 Jesus kept his word when he told them what is it that if I keep this man till I come he said Jesus kept his word because Jesus was talking about that moment of lifting him up let's let's follow the thought and you will see it clearly Jesus kept his word he brought John up into heaven and rehearse the whole thing to him so everything that John was looking at in the vision was just a rehearsal you have to remember in Revelation chapter one John was told that things there was and is and is to come what you going to see what you going to write things that was and is and is to come Hallelujah praise the Lord here is God here is almighty God rehearsing he's he's he's he's he he's he even rehearsed our day John saw our day praise the Lord amen John saw a rehearsal of our day he saw the lukewarmness of our day he saw the the the the spirit of the age of laia he saw all of those things but that that's not what I'm getting to tonight I just want us to see the Simplicity of the god that we serve the Simplicity of the god that we serve so brother Bram says let's let's continue on here he said yeah uh he brought John up into the heaven and rehearsed the whole thing Glory he saw the preview he saw it just as though he live on earth and saw the whole church Ages come to pass to the coming of the Lord the whole book of Revelation so the whole book of Revelation was just a rehearsal of things that were to come hallelujah praise the Lord amen almost like a rehearsal a wedding rehearsal you say okay you come and stand here you you be the you be the minister you are just taking somebody as a symbol because it's a rehearsal the the program is tomorrow but we need we need to bring element so we can get the scene together are we together that's why he told us the Book of Revelation is a book of symbol true are we together amen amen watch and see where we going tonight let's take another one we have just few year I will do my best to close you at 9:00 tonight he says oh see he pick him upright why it's year the fourth chapter and the second verse prove it he show him things which was which is and shall come he show him the church ages the coming of the Jews the pouring out of the plagues the Rapture the the the the coming again the Millennium and the interal home of the save just as though he live right down through the whole thing John John is is uh is is is affected by the things he saw he said when he saw the the the great Babylon h h h he used a word that he says I was I was amazed he he he he's in a rehearser but he's he's also being affected by the things that he's seeing right are we together praise the Lord amen so John here he's taking through all of these things the Rapture the coming of the Lord the Millennium the interal home of the saved just as though he Liv right down through the whole thing he saw it all happen see he just took him up and show him show him the fame that that he's turning let him see the whole thing rehearse now so this this is where this is where I want to go with this see almighty God praise the Lord amen amen I believe he did the same thing to to uh uh Moses when he took Moses up into the mountain for those 40 days praise the Lord showing him back things that happened in the Garden of Eden because uh uh uh uh uh Adam and Eve was before Moses but Moses was the one that gave us the record on them right praise the Lord that's just the Simplicity of our God and I'm I'm reading this I'm sitting there and I'm thinking to myself as say as say uh sometimes we we try to you know uh uh uh be so spiritual I remember as you know as a young preacher you know you you you are ready to preach and it's it's uh you know you you you try to you know uh uh uh concentrate yourself and I mean it it's all written on your face and and you try to be so serious and you know and and you are just dead and and and and you know you go you go you try to sleep you want the Lord to show you a vision and and and I mean you just we just we I mean we just we just carry ourselves sometimes over the board right we carried ourself over the board now remember remember now Sunday when I closed the service I made a statement and uh uh and I never said that in anger I said that to just to encourage you but uh uh when you look through this subject you look through this line of thought you will see that God encourage us sometimes to to rehearse okay you want to sing a special rehearse you know sometimes you you say this and and and you know and sometimes people don't get the picture I remember I will say this year you want to sing a specture you are not the one that wrote the song you did not make the music you just love the song and you would like to sing it so uh send the the the music to the Musicians so they can be able to to follow you and if if possible if you can do a rehearsal you know people we we we struggle with this stuff back I've seen that back you know people will says oh it's a special because it's a special it must be secret it's not for you it's it's for God you are coming to bless God you are coming to to worship God and you are coming to also edify the sins right if you are singing a special on Sunday and you come and practice Wednesday night and we hear it it did not spoil the song right it don't have to be a secret thing it's my special praise the Lord I want to sing this special and you go in the room you close the door I can't how to see you that's just the way of telling me he love no that's not the way let me sing it that's just the way of you are putting too much pressure on yourself too much pressure it will be easier when you just tell your husband or your wife listen I want to sing this song Tell me how you how you yeah you know help me let's let's sing it together this song is on my heart I want to it does not take the worship away right it does not take the worship away for the matter of fact it bring more worship why because you are not making it yourself it's not it's not yourself if you do it like that sometimes it is just it is just our personal display there is God almighty God his interal plan he rehearsing it this is the thing I'm going to do in in the end John come and see come and see what's coming to happen and he rehearsing his intal plan taking him through the church ages even showing him the great say that John said I saw it coming down and it was just a rehearsal just a rehearsal brother Brandon will say here he says I've seen his star 1963 he says whence cometh the mother of my Lord the mother of my lord for as soon as as that salutation come to my ears my baby leap in the womb for Joy John was born from his mother womb F of the Holy Ghost by the name of Jesus Christ what type what type of a baby should this be no doubt that she rehearsed this to Joseph Joseph was not there when the angel spoke to Mary praise the Lord amen he was not he was not there but Mary had to come and rehearse repeat the same thing that's that's why that's what rehearsal is it's just a repetition no you never did a way sing it again that's just how rehearsal is but we we take this kind of a complex it's all is all the weakness of our human nature thinking that we want to bring we want to surprise you can't surprise God right you can't impress him either you can't surprise him you can't impress him praise the Lord and sometimes it's just it becomes so difficult for the people of God what what is the need of having all of these musicians we we have these young people and and all of that and and and you can get music to support the the song that you want to sing but because to you it's a special you want to show up sing the song and then the musician should just play you're not the one that wrote that song you didn't make the music praise the Lord now you you see brother brandom saying also here look at this he said presum in 1962 he says I have been all tore up for a few days on account of a vision he had a vision and and and and and the vision was dealing with him he he was burden on the vision tore up on the vision I hadn't tore it right out to the people he said kind of disturbed and I wonder what what could that be how can it be I took my wife and and we went aside and I rehearsed it back to her honey I had this Vision it's troubling me this is a prophet of God no no I'm going to I'm going to say it I'm going to say it in the church even my wife say she's not going to hear it all of those things they are all our childishness I did it myself I'm telling you I did it I mean uh those days I put my I put my my Bible on my arm I'm honor the anointing I don't want I don't want to hear him voice I want to hear the voice of it's all child childishness right all child brother Braham says I was going to preach a message the other day I woke my wife up and I preached a message to her what was he doing he was rehearsing right he was rehearsing while he was going to preach it's it's not this place word uh you know I mean uh I hope you understand what I'm going to I'm going tonight praise the Lord I hope you understand amen amen you know that's as the prophet of God said he says re he says Revival he said God deal with us he says just like a woman expecting the child she has to be flexible amen if she if she put the pressure of wanting a child on her mind is going to set her body off she has to be flexible he says one of the easier way to do it just just you know take a baby you know and start to to love that baby it it will just condition your body I mean he that's he said even for the church he said when the church put herself under stress oh god oh Lord oh this he says uh he says Revival don't come that way he says Revival comes when the people people are flexible they are lifting their hands they are worshiping God they are thanking God for what he's doing in their midst they are thanking God the way he's dealing with them you know they are just they are seeing the move of God in the simplest thing that is happening yes sir so God can come right in that M and give them the birth and do something special because because uh H identifying him in the simplest thing he's doing is creating expectation in in their heart praise the Lord Moses said to the children of Israel when you get to the land he says rehearse these words to your children that's what we spoke about on Sunday rehearse this word when you sit down rehearse the word keep rehearsing it rehearse the things that God has done a testimon is not enough to be told only one time praise the Lord what God has done is not enough to say I I I I said it I tired of saying it you did it you are not the one that did it why are you taking a complex to share what God has done praise the Lord how many times during the messages brother brand brother br will talk about H uh that that Cru hunter that he went out way and and and and and and and and and and the prophet of God said he said he say on table he says there is not one time that's one time I have mentioned this that I have not fil the holy spirit in the meeting this man was ready to shoot that door he blew his whistle and and brother BR was just say oh oh don't do it and and don't do it and he didn't even know how the man lift his hand out and say I I want the god that youself praise the Lord that's the god that we serve he says I know Abraham I know him I can't hide anything from Abraham because what he will rehearse my promises to his children that's what that's what brings that's what brings the word on the road of EMAs what was Jesus doing he was rehearsing Moses said this David said this he was rehearsing rehearsing the promises the Bible said through the prophets in the psalm can you remember when Moses said this when Jeremiah said this and he was what rehearsing that's all rehearsal is it's repetition praise the Lord and that is the reason why when we are trying to do something and you fail and you give up then it means that you you are just you you did not even get the mind of God about it because if it's the mind of God no matter how much you feel you will get up and try again you will get up and try again you will prayed about it you committed to the Lord you say Lord give me Grace you you place this thing on my heart you want for me to do it and I try to think you know I'm just I'm just a failure and you just leave it it's all because you wanted to do it for your s Glory if you want to do something for to glorify God it does not matter if you practice and try to do it and try to do it and try to do it Hallelujah that's how our God works he could have just kept everything he wanted to do for each age and say it does not this thing does not concern Peter James and John they will be dead it does not concern it I don't need to show it to them but he said boy boys come come along come come let me show you things let me just rehearse to you what is coming in the future he's giving them a rehearsal Peter got excited he want to start building Tabernacle don't do this Peter this is just a rehearsal it's future T praise the Lord musicians can come let's pray Hallelujah praise the [Applause] Lord praise the Lord praise

you know the scripture also said like this and and and I mean that that just the way we create the atmosphere of the word whatever stand out to you in the word it's a sense of appreciation can you imagine that God is making you to see something in the word and as soon as you see it you just okay I've seen it okay it does not create the the the the the the the energy to to to keep showing you things in the word you don't have to make it up the word of the Lord has already come to the prophet the things I'm preaching to you is not a revelation it's not a revelation the prophet brought us
