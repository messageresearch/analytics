place morning another the prayer line but it just wouldn't work that way it just brother Jagger had to go ahead and say another thing I want to announce brother Jagger stood in talk the stand like we did at Calgary he the missionary Baptists and the Free Will Baptist and all you know Texas is full of Baptist they stood for him but the fundamental Badness rolls up against the the program and all how they wrote him up in the paper and everything well he they wrote him Bible questions so he answered back and they got a if they had on proof then some bunch of political stand why they wouldn't put it in the paper so brother Jaggers we called a meeting there and 75 cooperating Ministers of the city came in together we talk p a static copy of it and said is this freedom of speech is this freedom of press like that and sent it out and the paper l 10,000 subscribers the next morning and they come crying on their knees that we have published in the paper just freely you don't have to pay us a penny oh brother listen you church one time we live down by the railroad track we don't no more we live on Hallelujah Avenue now we rank into the millions we used to be there only a few hundred of us but we go into the millions millions now and United together with the most powerful church and numbers or is in the United States that's right all right I guess in the world last year alone we had a, 500,000 conversions think of that a million 500,000 conversions in Full Gospel people that is with the general orders last year oh we're coming up now and these little papers and things have been they wouldn't talk about the Catholic people they were afraid of it see they were afraid to do it well we're numbering right on up there now we got a rights let's claim our god-given rights that's right so we're going forward this year but God to be our help and our shield and called to try our best to have a Revival now I oh up here you all have to tell me when to stop up there right up there all right I can walk out this way and look back and so good how many feels good for Christmas say Amen oh my my this is a time of rejoicing the time of when all of us can come together and worship chist Christ and I I don't haven't got a message not a thing I just opened up the Bible here when he talking there turned over here I said where's the birth of Christ everybody's talking about that now so I just have to read a little while and then find something just keep staggering along till the spirit of the Lord picks up something now to start let's begin at Luke the first chapter of Luke that's beginning of the the birth of Christ and we'll read some in here and just teach some on on the word if we can we don't know what the Lord will do for us but we just trust that he'll give us a great blessing they I heard your broadcast it was fine just keep it going keep it going preach the word just telling brother GM in there if there ever was a time that Christians need one another it's right now right now whatever you do lay aside everything cuz I Believe by the grace of God I just talk on that a little bit in a few minutes that how we we need each other right now the Great I believe that we're facing are you listening to me all right we're facing now looking at a great this drama that's ever been set in all human history working out here before us the great field of the world here and a drama that God is going to act out right now that's it's a starling to look around over the world and see how the thing is moving together oh is something fixing to happen friends this what we've talked about in set about is right now here it's already starting everywhere breaking out there's a great picture I like a picture to you this morning I see a lamb out in the field a feed the little fellow becomes nervous he just he wonders look over in a read right behind him I see a line slipping up really easy see p his tail on the ground getting his feet ready for a spring that's the church out there in the field the darkness of Communism is pushing all over the world closing in like a great Shadow and this is a law of contrast take like before day it's always the darkness before day because the days of breaking pushing the darkness and it's the law of contrast you see makes it to darkness before the day breaks and we're in that same thing now it's just the darkness before day the great Shadows Of Darkness is pushing in to fulfill the man of sin did you notice in this very Christmas time all the communist countries are instead of sending out the Christ and the mananger they sent out little books of Stalin putting Stalin's picture on it the man who opposes himself above all is called God and so forth getting a great part of the world into his clutches and another thing then that all the that's to fulfill the scripture and then again I want you to notice another thing one of the fulfilling these people who are FAL and these FAL churches is rising up against the moon and the Bible said they' have a farm of godliness but would deny the power thereof from such turn away and they're taking their stand communism is taking its stand praise God the Holy Ghost is taking it stand yes when the enemy comes in like a flood then I'll raise up a standard against it that's right and the church has taken her stand I mean the Holy Ghost Church now that's all I'm interested in friends and I'm here out there I'm pray for the sick but in here I'm interested in one thing and that's God's Born Again Church that's right that's what I'm interested in anyhow I'm not interested in B laws and deacons and so forth like that orders of churches I'm interested in the baptism of the Holy Ghost upon the church for this day that we're living in amen that's the fundamental part and that's what we're looking for just a word of prayer now Heavenly Father move down this morning into our midst Grant it Lord and may the spirit of God uh take over the service bless the work here Lord bless our brother brother Graham god- giving words of wisdom tonight at the radio broadcast may be able to to shake the people with by preaching the word Grant it Lord May Sinners weep kneel down in the room and give their hearts to Christ if there be any unbelievers here this morning or any that have not accepted Christ may they come also and now start a Revival in the hearts of the people this morning Lord may this be a renewing time a time when the spirit will be renewed oh Father we praise this way come get us by the hand each one of us God Walk us down this Lane here God show to us this great picture that's set in order here revealing your secrets to the Saints Hearts this morning that we might see what's out here just before and as we walk down then Lord in the armor of God may we go as gallot soldiers to face the enemy but how can we Face him unless we know his techniques and help us this morning to understand and show us the his foreground there so we'll know we're to meeting for we ask this in Jesus name amen that's the second chapter let's read this and it came to pass and in those days that there went out a degree from Caesar August to all the world that they should be tax and this taxon was first made uh by the governor of sah and all went to be taxed everyone to his own City and Joseph went also Up From Galilee and the City of Nazareth into Judah the city of David which is called Bethlehem because he was of the house in the lineage of David to be taxed with Mary his spouse wife being greatly child and so it was that while they were there the days of her accomplishment that she should be delivered and she brought forth her firstborn son and wrapped him in swen's clothes and laid him in the manger because there was no room for him in the end now just as a back ground to till we get up to the a part of it that I would use this morning and all of you just let yourself be in the spirit of the lord we are today all over the world is being s celebrated uh the birth of Jesus which now is just traditional Jesus was not born only December the 5th or nothing like or December the 25th we know that's impossible the hills of Juda was full of snow at that time so how could it be that Jesus commonly by Astron so forth and by all that was born in first around first of April so when it was Springtime but this is a day which is all right just set aside to worship uh uh in Memorial of his coming to the world one of the greatest gifts that God ever give to the world was Jesus Christ that we know that and now I want to speak this morning upon his deity who he is so many has him a little baby out there in the cradle and so forth but that that was just one of the pictures just one of the setting forth of the drama to bring it up to what he really is his deity and he said in the scriptures of his coming he was been spoke up since the days of of John plump back even into Genesis it was prophesied that the woman's seed would bruise the Serpent's head promising this cow child Christ Jesus and he's been down all the prophets most every Prophet that was ever wrote in the Bible spoke of his first and second Advent when he has come to the world Jesus comes three times he came the first time to redeem his church he comes the second time to receive his church he comes the third time with his church everything in the Bible travels in trinities threes but all in one Christ you remember the first time to redeem his church the second time to receive his church the third time with his church is king and queen now but on his first coming we'll speak out just a little bit and then on his being here and then on his second coming on and then on the third time if the Lord willing now in these days there was a great persecution against the church uh Caesar Augusta had made a great plan that he attacks all the people and that was only done for one purpose that God's Great prophecy would be fulfilled only thing you have to do when you see something in the Bible it sounds just a little Mystic and a little superstitious to you just give God a little bit of time God's no hurry we're the one gets in a hurry just give God just a little bit of time and you'll see the old prophetic Wheels cogs run right up into the picture it the Bell just like a bringing up up a picture like someone was speaking the other day he said God what was he when he was back out millions and millions of years ago when he was no just like this space here and then he gathered up into the Loos and then he came from the Loos down into Christ see it's just God coming down like this to the Earth then going right back into God again don't you see what I mean just revolving coming down from space from uh eternity rolling together coming down into the Loos and the Loos down into man then returning right back again for one purpose to redeem that man that had fallen now that's what he came for to be a redeemer and before God could be a redeemer he had to be according to the law a kinsman redeemer he had to be kin folks to us and God in the beginning made his first man he made him out of spirit and spirit is the invisible part of man that you don't see now God made man in his own image are you listening to me all right God made man in his own image and God is a spirit said the Bible and the first man that was made had the government over all the creation just like the Holy Spirit has government over the church today he led the creation he led the animals but there was no man that FAL the sorrow so God made Man Out of the Dust of the earth and that man he might have give him my hands like a monkey he might have give him feet like a bear whatever he did he just thr it together and made a man but this man he put this Immortal spirit that never died into this man and he become more than a brute he became a man then this man here that's what I think atheist and some of them standing around arguing but the hour has come when God shed forth his light there's an hour here then when God's doing that's right and so now when they argu while his feet look like a bear and his hands look like a AP or a monkey or soul for they try to say his Argent com that that has nothing to do with this is a body of Flesh that he's just living in like a house it's goings back to the dust of the Earth but the spirit is Immortal it comes from God that's the image of God God is the spirit that man lost his Orin in the Garden of Eden his relationship communion with God was C off there because of sin and unbelief unbelief in what the word of God a picture was painted one time to Eve and told her how much brighter it would be if she just just discard the word of God look over here to reason you can't go there's a difference between reason in God's word God's word is true reason false you can't reason out nothing that's right our minds not is not good enough or never will be to Fathom God's Eternal wisdom and and therefore you can't reason it you just got to believe it and so then the picture was painted out back there to our first father and mother and they fell and that broke off relationship with God and was drove from the Garden of Eden from that hour God be to scream up and down the gardens hunting for his his Lost Child and then the only way that God then could ever redeem him would have to be to make uh to come down and redeeming himself not in another uh not send somebody else he couldn't send an angel that wouldn't be right but the only way God could redeem the man was come down himself and redeem it if somebody sins here and my I was a judge of this of this group of people and I had the Jewish diction over you all and if I if someone sinned and I said now I brother Grim I want you to pay the price that wouldn't be just if I said for my own boy to pay the price that still wouldn't be just the only way that I can be just is for me myself to take his place and what I one pass the judgment and then if I want to redeem the man I've got to take his place myself are you still listening at now look I want you to notice something then when this the only way that God himself could ever redeem this man was to come down and take his place and that was a law that was given by Moses of redemption that had had to be through a kinsman redeemer a man first who was worthy a man who was worth the pr rist a man then who would make a public testimony and redeem the Lost estate of somebody that had fallen and then God was worthy he came down some 1900 years ago in the form of a baby born in a manger overshadowed by the holy ghs not born but sexual desire he was God God's blood was in him the baby is always the blood of its father never of its mother we all know that without I've taught that before here in times and you know that the baby has not one Speck of its mother's blood in it not a bit no nothing does it's always the blood of the male a hen can lay an A but if it isn't fertile it'll never hatch no matter how pretty the egg is and how well she warms it it'll always be unfertile it'll lay right there and rock that's right unless the male bird has been with the female bird and the germ of Life comes from the male therefore when Mary knowing not a man she was with the male God the almighty Jehovah and he overshadowed her and God is the creator that created a blood cell in the womb of Mary knowing no man at all and that brought forth the very creative blood of God to redeem us from our life coming in here being born of sexual desire and then that blood was draw out of emanuel's veins on calvary's cross and today has the same saving redeeming holy power that it did the day the transfusion was made out of Calvary you believe it amen am now that's right we're Redeemed by the blood of God the Bible says we are bought by the blood and Redeemed by BL God's own blood how was it God's blood God has no blood how could it be because it was God's created blood that he created in order to redeem us and came and lived in the same body that he created therefore he could not God had to suffer Temptation he couldn't suffer Temptation he had to suffer sexual Temptation he had to suffer uh uh all kinds of Temptation to be tempted by the devil and riches and powers and and dominions and so forth he had to suffer all of that in order to do it he couldn't be his God in spirit he had to be God in flesh now I'm speaking this morning on the deity of Christ so that you'll know who he is and we're worshiping today not a baby in a Manger not Santa Claus but we're worshiping almighty God in the deity of his son and notice then that blood came down and was was Christ Jesus and God himself coming out of spirit went into Christ Jesus and the Bible said that God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself is that right God himself Jehovah lived in Christ and was made a Kinsman to us because he was born in human flesh like we are is that right the blood cells were developed by God and the the flesh cells were developed in the womb of Mary that brought forth the child and God came down and lived in human flesh and was tempted in every man just like we are do you believe that all right wow then when he did that he freely gave his blood he didn't have to do it he made that sacrifice he could have went right on up into Glory he could have been transfigured like he was on Mount Transfiguration went on into heaven and never died for us but to be willing to die for us he gave freely his blood at Calvary that's right and he picked out he was a man of sorrow acquainted with greef and he made a public testimony in the root book of Ruth is a very beautiful picture there how that boy type of Christ how that Ruth went over a strange country as a backslide and went out of the land and brought back with her I mean theom brought back Ruth and when Ruth came back she was a a of the country of Moab and when she came back she was a Mite absolutely a picture of the Gentile Bride of the church and when she went to leave Nom neom told her said kissed her and told her go back to her people she said I will go with you to your people let your people be my people and let your uh dwellings be my dwellings that your God be my God and nothing but death shall separate us where you die I die where you're buried I'll be buried now there a picture of the Gentile Church coming into Christ because we were once aliens away from God only the Jews was was the ones to be saved but we being dead in Christ take on Abraham's seed and are hirs according to the promise and Christ got a gentile bride that's exactly right now in order to redeem Boaz to redeem the's lost of state that was a backs F the state of Israel then boab boab had to come out and when he did a Boaz rather and when he came out he had to kick off his shoe before the gates before the elders to make a public testimony that he had redeemed that lost woman in her estate and in doing that then he bought back also he got in there his bride the woman he was looking for he had to redeem the woman first in order to get the bride don't you see and that's the same thing Christ did he made a public testimony at the Gates of Jerusalem when he was beaten smitten Afflicted and was let up calary the Cal gol's heal and bathe a heel with his own blood as a public testimony that he had redeemed all the Fallen estate from back down in the beginning and has redeemed his people from the curse of sin and from the clutches of hell and anointing a would need something more in the last days and what he's got now he said I'll not leave you comfortless I'll pray the father and he'll give you another comforter which is the Holy Ghost he will abide with you forever a little while the world see me no more but I'm going up to heaven get this thing fixed up and I'll come back and be with you even in You Until the End of the Age that's what I'm talking about you still hear me say amen that's right that's what I'm speaking of now is him coming again in his power [Music]
