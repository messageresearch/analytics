========================================

So now let's bow our heads just a moment as we speak to the author of life. Our heavenly father, we thank thee for this grand privilege of coming together to worship thee, this glorious wonderful way that thou has forained before the foundation of the world that we should worship thee. We can hear our master say that God is a spirit and they that worship him must worship in spirit and in truth. We thank thee for these great things. We pray Lord tonight that the truth will be made manifest. The spirit will get into the truth and may we worship God's provided way. Save all the lost tonight, Lord. Our hearts just bleed for those who doesn't know this glorious salvation. We pray that you'll save every lost sinner here tonight. And those who are in need of the new birth, may he come like the rushing mighty wind from heaven as he gave them the new baptism at the day of Pentecost. May it repeat again. Grant it, Lord. Then heal the sick. Many are needy. We pray that you'll heal them. And our father is something new for the evening for thy servant to speak on this gospel terms of the salvation of man's soul and body. I pray that you'll help tonight in a special way. I ask these blessings in the name of your beloved child Jesus Christ. Amen. They many you've seen the look magazine life and them carrying articles of how down in Aram so forth and they've been bringing up thousands of Jews going into the new Jerusalem there across trench Jordan the Arabs have the old Jerusalem. So in the new Jerusalem they have brought in literally tens of thousands millions of Jews. See how the fig tree is putting forth its buds. Now the Stockholm church sent a million Bibles down there, New Testaments to give to those Jews. They never even heard of such a thing as Jesus being on earth. They know nothing about it. And they reading the Bible. They said, "If this be the Messiah, if Jesus is the Christ, let us see him do the son of the prophet. We ought accept it." Oh my. I just anxious to get about a half a million of those out there if I could around Mount Olive somewhere outdoor meeting and ask them that question. Tell them to read the New Testament and see what the Messiah was. And if he doesn't repeat the same thing that I'm a false prophet now speak the truth that he's the Messiah of God. Pray for us, won't you? We need it very much. Now tonight usually uh Mr. Baxter's there for 400 years in bondage. How Joseph perfect type of the church today perfect type of Christ. How that he was born among some brethren, half brothers, and they despised him because he was born a spiritual man. Like the true believer tonight being a member of the church, member of the same body, but a spiritual believer rejected and despised. Amen. Notice it. Joseph was born in the family, the same family of Israel, was one of the patriarchs, but was rejected because of his spiritual uh life. He was born to sear. He he saw visions and interpret dreams. And his brethren hated him without a call. Prophecies always repeat themselves. You know that any scholar of the Bible knows that when like and over in Matthew 2 where it said out of Egypt I'll call my son. That was really referring to the scripture where God called Israel out of Egypt but is also referred of God calling his son Jesus out of Egypt. That is Joseph was a type of Christ. He's a type of the church which is the body of Christ on earth today. Beautiful. Wish we had time to go into it. Dig out those golden nuggets of the Bible. Now watch all the old things in the Old Testament just run parallel with the New. And notice how that he was rejected and despised and how he was criticized by his brethren and finally persecuted even almost unto death was taken down in Egypt. And many of us know the story how God was with him. No matter what they said about him when they seen him come in the field said, "Here comes that dreamer. Let's see what he's going to say now." making fun of him just as the unbelieving Christian today will make fun of the believer. Same thing. Yet a member of the body by faith in Christ rejecting. Oh, what a horrible thing. Now then when they went down into Egypt, God was with him just the same. God will be with his church regardless of what you say about it. There's somebody in your church is real spiritual, really knows God. You say, "Wow, they're a little bit of fanatic." I might speak on that tomorrow afternoon. All right. A fanatic. Just because they love God, they're peculiar to the world. But remember, they're blessed in the sight of God. God's people is a peculiar people. Royal priesthood offering spiritual sacrifices to God. That's the fruits of our lips giving praise to his name. Peculiar, odd, always been very much indifferent from the world. Separated, called out. The very church, the word church means the separated or called out. Israel were the people of God until they come out of Egypt. understand they were the church of God because they were called out, separated, made different. God calling Israel out, what a beautiful type calling his church out today. I think of Joseph, what when he died, what a memorial he left there. I think sometimes when he made mention, he said, "Now don't bury me down here, but leave my bone chair until surely God will visit you someday. and take my bones before you. Where did he get that thought? God promised Abraham, his father, that they would sojourn 400 years in a strange land and then he would bring him out. And Joseph knew God kept his word. The other patriarch just bear him anywhere he wanted to. But not Joseph say there's a little between the line you have to read in the Bible. Do you believe that? It's a love letter wrote to the church. There's no need of seminaries trying to teach it because it's not known by minds of this world. I've hid it from the eyes of wise and repudian and will reveal it to babes such as will learn. It's truth. So there's that's the reason we got all these different forms and kinds of religions and churches. It's all right. There it go. God he's the one takes care of the books. Look, notice though how how it was. Let me give you a little something between the lines. You know, sometime when I get away overseas, I'm very fond of my wife and she writes me a letter and she says, "Dear Billy, I'm sitting here tonight. I'm thinking very much of you. I'm so and so." That's what she's saying, but I'm reading right between the lines. I I know it goes a little deeper than that. And if you've got the Holy Spirit, you're in love with Christ. You can read between God's lines. There's something in there. While we're a little off the subject just to this, but let me drop you a little something. Why did Joseph want his bones buried up there? Notice when Job, an old one of the oldest books of the Bible, when he died, he was getting ready or before he died, he was sitting on an ash heap scraping these boils. And his wife came and said, "Job, why don't you curse God and die?" He said, "Woman, thou speakest like a foolish woman." Now, he never said she's foolish, but she's speaking like one. He said, "The Lord gave and the Lord taken away. Blessed be the name of the Lord." Some of his church members came down to give him some consolation, set with their backs to him seven days, accused him of being a secret sinner. Not much consolation there. But they accused him of sinning against God. But Job knowed his heart. He know he hadn't sinned against God. Many time people say, "See all that sickness in that family? I told you they're not living right." Now God does do that sometime, but not every time it's God doing that. Paul God here was dealing with a saint. A trying and proving of a saint. And every man that cometh to God must first be tried of God. And if you can't stand chastisement, then you become an illegitimate child and not the child of God. trials to try our faith. Isn't that marvelous? God would give us those trials and tests to prove us. Now notice this is beautiful. Then after a while Job saying there knowing his heart little Elahu came down which we know the Hebrew word Elah which came in from God meaning that God representative otherwise it was a representative of the Lord Jesus Christ come down speaking to Job said now look job you're accusing God wrongly said but now he spoke to him and he said now you're looking out upon the natural things here and so forth and he said Job, Job began to speak to him about the flower, how it dies. In a spring year, it comes back up again. If a tree dies, it lives again. But he said, man lays down, he giveth up the ghost. He wastes away. His sons come to mourn his death. He perceiveth not. Where is he? He said, you've been noticing all those things. I'm putting it kind of drama child form for the little ones. He said, now you've been looking at that, but remember that flower or that tree never sinned against God. Man sinned against God, so it separated him from God. But there's coming one someday who will stand in the breach between a sinful man and a holy God and bridge the way. Put a hand on a sinful man. The holy God bridge the way. Speaking of Christ, the prophet saw it. He stood on his feet. The lightnings begin to flash. The thunders roar. Job said on no my redeemer liveth and at the last days he'll stand on the earth. Though the skin worms destroy this body yet my flesh shall I see God. Watch when he died years later he made a specification a word of burying. Along come father Abraham and when Sarah died he went close to the same land that Job was buried in. He bought a piece of ground. He would let him give them to him. He bought that ground for a bearing place. And he buried Sarah near Job. And when Abraham died, he slept in the same grave with Sarah. And Abraham begot Isaac. And when Isaac died, he slept with Abraham. And Isaac begot Jacob. And when Jacob was died down in Egypt, but before he died, oh, I just love this. He said, "Come here, Joseph. He had a crippled hip where an angel touched him from rrestling. Look at that. On one side of the river one night, a big strong backslider. On the next side, next morning on the other side of the river, a limping prince and wrestle with God said, "Come here and lay your hands upon my hip and swear to me that you'll not bear me down here." Wonder why. But take me back up there and let me be buried with Abraham and Isaac. Why? Then along come Joseph. He said, "Now wait." They put his bones in a coffin. I had my hand on the old lead coffin here not long ago. They supposed to had his bones in. He said, "When you go out of here, bury my bones up there. Don't bury me down here." I wonder why. It isn't written in the Bible, but they were prophets. They could read between the lines. They knew that that first fruits of the resurrection wasn't coming in Egypt. It was coming in Palestine. And when Jesus came on earth and they done to him what they said they would do. And when he died and rose on the third day, Matthew 27 said, "Many of the bodies of the saints that slept in the dusty earth rose and come out of the grave and entered into the city." Abraham, Isaac, Jacob. Therefore, have anything you wish you, but bury me in Christ. For those that are in Christ will God bring with him at his coming. Hide away from the world. What a beautiful picture. There's between the lines. What the Bible says and what you see in between the lines goes right on with the rest of the word, but it just fills up the gap where you wonder why they was doing it. Now on our pilgrim journey, we notice out in the wilderness while they begin to sin after God had ble blessed them and brought them through the Red Sea. Is it strange old that the children of Israel in their journey, God led them the first thing right into a death trap right up to the Red Sea. Pharaoh's army coming pursuing the mountains on one side to see Adam cut off but God's path went through the sea. Many times God lets us get right up like that. Then he looked down through that pillar of fire and the sea rolled back and they crossed. God made a way of escape. He always will in every instance. Notice then they went right straight to the wilderness of sin. Is it strange from one trial to another? Some through the waters, some through the floods, some through deep trials, but all through the blood. God's way leads sometimes right through every briar patch, right up over the hill, down through the rugged places, sickness, trials, but God brings him more than victorious through them all. Notice they begin to sin and murmur against God and against Moses. And God told Moses when he went to praying, interceding for the people. Now, why did Moses intercede? Now, listen closely. God had appeared to father Abraham years before that in Genesis 22 in the name of Jehovah Gyra. when he was offering up his only begotten son and a a lamb bladed in the wilderness and God stayed his hand and the name of God was called Jehovah Gyra meaning the Lord will provide himself a sacrifice. Amen. Oh, this is beautiful. I just love the word. Notice then right in that crucial moment serpents had that come in among the people and were biting them and Moses was taught in all the wisdom of the Egyptians and they were boasting physicians far beyond him many things and what we are today had our doctor skin by hundreds of miles but Dr. Moses had no cure for that snake bite. Nothing could be done. There it was way in the wilderness. And Moses prayed and God came to him and told him the remedy for it. I like that. Why is he God? Jehovah Gyra. The Lord will provide. Make a way. I love it. Notice then God told Moses in this piper symbol said go make a serpent out of brass and put it on a pole. Now the serpent in a symbol meant sin. The serpent represented the serpent from the garden of Eden already judged. snake turned from a a animal. Now, he wasn't a reptile. The Bible said he was the most subtle of all the beasts of the field. He wasn't a reptile. He was a beast. And he turned to a serpent on his belly. And that snake represented sin judged. And made out of brass meant divine judgment. Breast means divine judgment in the Bible. See, the people were sinning because they didn't believe the prophet. They were ching against him and against God. They had sinned. And because of sin, serpents had bit them and they were dying. And all sickness is caused by sin. That's right. Before we had before we had sin, we had no sickness. But sin or sickness is an attribute of sin. Sickness came because of sin. Maybe not what you done. Inherited three or four generations. It'll follow God said. So notice. And so God put up this had Moses and put up this in sign to Israel. And when he lifted it up, sickness and sin, a compound reason for both sickness and sin. Jehovah Gyra was providing an inign that represented that their sin was forgiven and a healing for their sickness. You get it? Serpent represented sin judged. Brass, see brass is one thing that you can't tamper with. Brass cannot be tempered. You find some form of temporal brass, your tithings for six months will pay my way for 50 years around the world. Missionary, if you can find something of temper brass, can't be tempered. Goes to show that God's represented brass as divine judgment. And God's divine judgment cannot be tempered. God is the same yesterday, today, forever. Here you are. I want you to get it now. Look, brass the brazen's altar where the sacrifices were burned. Judgment. Divine judgment. And in the days of Elijah, when he went out and looked at the skies, he said, "They look like brass." Divine judgment upon a rebellious nation. God have mercy. The skies sometimes look brass around here in America. Divine judgment, heartach breakthrough. [Music] [Music] [Music]
