bring greetings to you and the ingredient our visitors praise the Lord amen now last weekend we had our brother Stanley and sister Howard Fleming we're fast and we never had to greet them properly because the deacons didn't get their names but it's good to have our dear brother and his wife sitting back there visiting with us and uh I was actually talking to him a little bit before the service this morning and came to find out there he's from Providence Baptist Church now Providence Baptist Churches is one of the first uh Church there was uh set up by the settlers and they came from South Carolina after after the emancipation of the of the slaves and there was a Christian organization that talked to to settle many of them back home and so one of the places that they were set to work was in Liberia and the foreign so they were settled there and then and many of them that went back uh turned out to be shouting uh about his people so they started the Providence Baptist Church that's one of the oldest historical church uh there in Liberia so we were just I was just checking with him and then he was giving me a little history that's where he and his wife goes to church and I wish of course it turned out to be uh somehow family related my senior brother that comes here to visit us which of course is coming next month uh is our most senior brother Pastor the Providence Baptist Church so it's good to have our brother Stanley and his wife come into fellowship with us praise the Lord and also we have a friend jimin and Tanika Williams there's uh brother Bill William's son and and his wife they are the latest couple so we we want to greet them and uh and thank them for coming to worship with us but then praise the Lord and we also want to thank the congratulations on their wedding amen praise you [Applause] and and we got our our friend that begin the newest drama in church this morning I was I was listening to the drama I was saying man somebody is playing I don't think it's Aaron it does not sound like decimal either I have to figure out who's playing the Trump so I thought an angel became the drummer this morning praise the Lord but God bless you praise the Lord amen and you know it's a wonderful thing if a person can find their place and and you know and just and just jump into the service you know you don't need any special qualification you just need to be willing you know to to be able to bring praise to you also we are grateful that you can be able to bring worship to us that way praise the Lord Hallelujah and uh having and brother and sister Williams back there they were in town yesterday because Sister Christine got her BSN so she graduated yesterday so they actually came home thank you an amazing ceremony had to go out and support her as well and we want to thank the Lord for that praise the Lord I hope he had of Andrews had a flat out yesterday evening to also go and support his sister and also graduated praise the Lord and uh and what can we say we can say is thank you Jesus amen praise the Lord Hallelujah and we would greet sister Jackie God bless you amen sister Jackie we want to thank the Lord for his grace thank the Lord for his healing Church Upon Your Life and uh sister Naomi kepas in touch and updated with all the progress of everything that you were dealing with and we were standing with you in prayers so we are glad to see that you are okay and you were able to come over to fellowship with us God bless you amen [Applause] praise the Lord we thank the Lord and we had brother Emmanuel and sister Vera with us and I think this is pretty much over a month now that they've been away and but a man was supposed to be returning back home to his postal Duty and in things that he had to do but just like I said couple of Sundays ago he came ahead of his wife so I never had him to greet the church was waiting for his wife to come and then just at the time his wife came he just had a few Sundays here then he will be going so I spoke with him Wednesday night I think this is a if I'm right now a few four five years now that they have choose to make this place a second home whenever they are over in the states so we are always glad and privileged to have them so I told Brother Emmanuel that I will have him to greet the church before he leaves since we he never did it when he came so it must be a greeting in the fair War so praise the Lord but Emmanuel you can come and [Applause] may God bless you profoundly and deeply in our soul s and also for your Eternal salvation pastel I want to thank the pastor they may donate opportunity for eign to take a time and to greet the church that has has been so precious to the Lord Jesus Christ foreign for the Salvation of each and every one of us and my heart is at the same time in my country and here and here as I have a family as well it's all of you that are sitting here [Music] it is a privilege to fellowship with you [Music] probably next Sunday I'm not going to be in church because I'll be already gone back home I'll be already home simple questions and I feel like this is just an occasion to greet you all uh [Music] once again petite reflection and this morning I had just a thought uh said petite reflection so that thought is like a paradox and we see the scientific men the the desperation and the worry more about the spirit the the the presentation to keep that to preserve the species [Music] and we see that the rest of the the race of Jesus Christ nobody cares about and the narratives of Jesus Christ sometimes they don't pay attention to it he is so cute it's more about how the species are being are disappearing and apostasy that is happening and sinking into the the world and the children of Jesus Christ are dying person and no man is even worrying about it we have the responsibility to keep our inheritance in Jesus Christ is and that inheritance includes the the parents and the young ones [Music] and you will notice that Satan today [Music] is fighting against the reproduction of Christians in July it will kill marriage divorce and it will even reinforce divorce is trying to make is trying to convince people that they should not have children and is fighting against young people [Music] so that the young people would not reproduce themselves in Jesus Christ and what's the consequences is apostasis it's the the fight against the inheritance of God it's like Satan [Music] responsibility that's what the young people has a great responsibility [Music] and to have true and Christian marriages and to produce Christians that can perpetuate the seed of Jesus Christ [Music] and we have also the responsibility as parents [Music] to help the young people to produce Jesus Christ in their heart [Music] and also to manifest the life of Jesus Christ in us so that tomorrow and after tomorrow we can have Christians that will fight for Jesus Christ [Music] that's what I've kept a little quote of brother when I'm here take inside with Jesus Christ in the 49th paragraph says it is a message that is preached in June 1st 1962 in Jeffersonville now we have to think about the young people we have children and most of us here we have children guess what about those that will come after them we have to think on others we have to think about those that are coming after us and the young ones and a place for our little ones our children our daughters we don't want to see them in the world done they show us decision the things of such of the kinds we want this door to grow up to be raised like the mothers the disposition and we have to make precaution preparation for that and if we don't have a tomorrow we don't know so if we don't have tomorrow then we have nothing to do when concerning the work of [Music] [Music] so that we can pay attention as Christians [Music] if we don't we do not have uh Christian children for tomorrow so [Music] right so if we do not pay attention to our children to make them real Christian for tomorrow how could Christ would be how God Christ will have a representative on Earth [Music] so if we if the world do not have a weakness how we're going to have a new generation for tomorrow this is the little word I want to share with you this morning and I would ask you if I go back home salutations I would definitely bring the greetings from you guys to those that are over there yes [Music] hoping that if God allows it we'll meet again [Music] so in Africa remember that before you take it in [Music] so when you bring in them you have to make sure to bring the mother as well foreign [Music] foreign [Music] Jesus your name is power [Music] God bless you brother Emmanuel we thank you thank you for those words of encouragement [Music] let's see [Music] Jesus your name is [Music] foreign [Music] Jesus your name will bring every struggle Jesus [Music] is Jesus Young [Music] Jesus [Music] you're me and that's verse now oh Jesus your name is holy Jesus [Music] foreign foreign [Music] thank you Hallelujah amen amen praise the Lord let's sing their chorus I woke up this morning with my mind on Jesus amen praise the Lord [Music] with my mind [Music] yes [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] oh Jesus [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you praise the Lord the Lord bless you let's take our Bibles amen let's take our Bibles Acts chapter 17. the book of Acts chapter 17. the book of Acts chapter 17. we also want to greet everyone that is streaming into the service this morning I Was preparing to to speak on the message I was entitled to science in the library of God in the laboratory of God but I couldn't get all my slides together I wanted to show some some images on the DNA I couldn't get all of those flies together so we will work on it and then we will we will find a time to bring it to you uh so uh I I went back and I started uh went back to a message that I preached many years ago I called entitled to a generation conflict so we will speak this morning on generation conflict uh I look at my notes and I think back in 2014 I spoke on the idea so that's a long time amen praise the Lord so as chapter 17 chapter 17. if we were just read from verse 22 . then pause to in the midst of Mars Hill and said yeah men of Alton I perceived that in all things here are two superstitious for us are passed by and beheld your devotion I found and altered with this inscription to the unknown God whom therefore ye ignorantly worship Him declare are unto you praise the Lord God that made the word in all things therein seeing that he is Lord of Heaven and Earth made with hands neither is worship with man's hands as though he needed anything seeing he gave it to all life and breath in all things and have made of one blood all nations of men for to the word on the face of the Earth and have determined the times before appointed and the bounds of their habitation praise the Lord and have made of warm blood all nations of man now if you study that verse the Bible says all Nation if you go and study it in in some translation the use have made of all race all race and uh and and there is a deep sense to it that's what I want for us to look at this morning if the law will just uh uh give us Grace let's bow our house together and then we will continue to read Heavenly Father We Just Want to Thank You Lord God and we just appreciate you this morning thank you Father Lord God for uh all our our French Lord and our visitors in our gifts Lord God father and even the once Lord that we have to travel whether

we thank God to have uh to have a home we thank God to have you as a family we thank God that you can trust a god like me to to uh to pass to you praise the Lord it is just the grace of God Amen it's just the grace of God and uh maybe sometimes in the future I can tell you all of the story you know I was I was thinking on thinking on uh preaching the message maybe in the future uh the day I'm having my second wife praise the Lord so you can go home and just think about it praise the Lord and what are you what are you believing on that what are you believing on that from Romans chapter 7. you realize that every one of us and with you that are now married you will know it but as you go up you will get to know it and uh you every every relationship you marry your first wife and this is there's a time where you marry your second wife this is done where you marry your first husband there's a time where you marry your second husband it's not another person is in the same Union praise the Lord amen as you walk down the aisle after a couple of years you get to realize that you really now married to the person you walk down the eye with you know so uh it's a mystery a beautiful mystery there was a Derek father Samuel field he preached our message many years ago the day I married my second wife and it was an outstanding message very beautiful message just talking about the beautiful changes the things you learned as you go along in your union and how you grow and how you be you you start to appreciate the person that you thought was so nagging the person you taught that was so impatient but as you go along you start to appreciate praise the Lord I will not use that for now but uh so this morning we want to talk on generation conflict we want to talk on generation conflict that's uh that's a that's a Bible verse that caught my attention in Acts chapter 17. uh in Acts chapter 17. [Music] when you look in at verse 6 in Acts chapter 17 the Bible says verse 5 but the Jews which believe not move with envied and took them and talking to them certain little fellows and all the best assault and gather a company and set all the city on an opera and assaulted the house of Jason and sought to bring them out to the people and when they found him they they drew them uh they drew Jason and certain brethrens onto the rulers of the city crying these that have turned the word upside down these thou have turned the word upside down what an accusation what a way for the man to be accused praise the Lord amen now these they have robbed our homes all these that have defied the women's of the city but these that have turned the word upside down that was the testimony of of the Apostle and then and while I was thinking about that uh [Music] I taught about uh uh What uh Paul said in Hebrew chapter 13 and others have have uh Trials of cruel Morgan and scorching yeah moreover of Bounce and imprisonment they were stoned they were sore asunder they they were tempted they were slain with the sword they wandered about in ships sheepskins and goatskins being destitute reflected into merited of whom the word was not worthy praise the Lord and that's the reason why they turned the word upside down because the word was not wanted of them praise the Lord amen and we and we are promised in the scripture that we are going to be the continuation of the attorney of Saddam praise the Lord our life our testimony is going to turn the word upside down Amen in such an age of violence and and and and and and all that that you know the assaults and the evil things that are happening out there someone can look at the life of a young person and says uh I mean you are actually turning the word upside down when you are living normal amen because the action of the word is already upside down brother Braham said the word is falling apart it can hold Paul says everything is shaking praise the Lord so uh the word was now worthy of them and the word is now worthy of us also praise the Lord now my my my my inspiration is actually coming from sin Luke chapter four but let's look at this uh this uh uh statement here that Paul May or that that uh Luke made over here in uh Acts chapter 17. the Bible says they are the poor there at Mars Hill the scripture we read I want to go back there to verse 26 again where he says and have made of one blood All Nation now you have to realize that the translator the the uh honor the burden of trying to bring the word of God or publish the word of God they did their best to be able to come close to how they can be able to describe setting texts in the Bible but this this verse made of one blood All Nation is so powerful the other uh it actually goes back and speak of our DNA it goes back and it speaks of our DNA do you know do you know that uh when signs discover the DNA code it was one of the major explosion because the discovery of the DNA called actually destroy the evolution Theory praise the Lord it's us it's it's it's actual fact you can go and you can go and Google it you can set it on it the discovery of the dnico actually this straw the the evolution Theory and uh and and and and science are still looking into it they are staying is is blowing your mind it's blowing the mind of Science and and what they are discovering is they are like like every Every Act One Time brother Barry coffee was preaching here for us and then he was he was actually talking to something I can remember but uh he turned this picture around and he has this there's a signature behind it to prove that I mean they were the one that were publishing it they were the ones that made it there are many of you that can remember that and and and that is what every great ethics around the world they were always put their autographed on their work and by the DNA called signs have come to discover that the signature of God it's on our DNA praise the Lord amen that God's signature so when the scriptures say of one blood amen is going is going far beyond just your blood cells is going to your DNA is speaking of your DNA science has be they are beginning to realize that your life is a book your life is a book I'll prove it to you when you are sick you go to the doctor and you tell the doctor I'm having headache my head is pounding me the doctor said okay since when he asks you all of these questions just to get a clued but he's not going to make a prescription on that Claude what is he going to do he's going to take a test he's going to ask for your blood because through your blood he can be able to read the language that is in yourselves praise the Lord and uh are we together I want to get ahead of myself here but uh let me read this here in birth pains for you science has broke into God's Great Laboratory until they are going to destroy themselves God always let wisdom destroy himself God doesn't destroy anything man destroyed himself by wisdom as he did at the beginning taking Satan's wisdom instead of God's word praise the Lord amen and uh okay okay now uh uh faith in action they got an x-ray now this was back in in 1955 they would take your picture without any light so the Bible said your body is full of light and we come to find out the old scientists said that was crazy there was no light in your body but the Bible says your whole your your whole body is full of light and we find out today that your body is made up of light meters x-ray prove it it takes your own light from your body to take the picture on the inside of you so God's right after all praise the Lord now a person could be in in in in a terrible accident and then and then they can be lying in common for you know as long as they want to one of the things that the doctors that would bring Comfort to the doctors if they can be able to go to your intelligence if if your brain cells is working the doctors can be hopeful praise the Lord if they cannot communicate with your brain they will not know what to do with you why because that's your intelligence if they can get a signal from your brain they can know which part of your body that they can help praise the Lord so there is a great laboratory that sign says it's a library Now Now lies within the human DNA praise the Lord and God designed it that way almighty God design it that way so we will realize that the things the things that divide us are more meneal to the things that connect us praise the Lord amen the thing that connect us is more major Jesus never made a mistake he was not he was not looking for words he was not stuttering when he said give unto Caesar what is Caesar and gave unto God what is God he was now stuttering praise the Lord because what he did was that he asked them for the Roman coin and he says who image is on it they said Caesar and he said give it to Caesar then give to God what is God and you can only be able to give to God what is God if you see his signature on it if you can be able to identify God's signature in your life if you can realize that the signature of almighty God is on your DNA [Music] until that becomes a revelation to you you would think that you own your life and you can run it the way you want to run it you will never come to truth submissiveness and surrounding life to Christ until that become a personal revelation you will try your best to give but until it becomes a revelation you will not be able to give to God as I was studying on this I mean there were just a lot of things that were just that were just they were just flying on me and uh I couldn't keep up with it I really couldn't keep up with faith and one of those things was the other uh our science is as they are looking into this as they have you know discovering this I mean it's just it's blowing their mind all over and I believe that almighty God kept it for this time amen because uh uh that's that's the way the Bible prophesied that it was going to be Hallelujah science is realizes something here that it says they are there with all the the the the technology with all the technology that we are having in the word and I mean technology is just speeding so fast that we can't catch up with it we having we having so much technology in the word that we we have not we have not come in terms to to adjust ourselves you you realize that you know this is uh you know uh uh uh Samsung Port out uh uh 23 Australian iPhone Port of their latest phone uh I mean you get the phone you you have not even understand how to use it then the next one come up praise the Lord amen and you you don't even understand all the future you know how to really enjoy that phone and use everything the way that you're supposed to use it and then a new one comes up and then you have to go for the install anything and then a new one comes up so we are far behind but this is something that was tracking to them is that with all the technology we have never been able all the technology that we have in the world has never been able to bring us a solution to our differences praise the Lord you see that's the reason why the technology is not it's not helping us in the right direction but rather the technology is only bringing us to the place where man is destroying themself praise the Lord that man is destroying using it to destroy themself you think about all of this knowledge and now they have drones to go and fight War they have they have uh I mean all of that you know I mean you know my my mind uh and and uh all the artificial intelligence and all of those things that is coming and yet we are having more problems praise the Lord with the technology that the world is having we must not be having hunger problem praise the Lord amen if the technology are directed in the right place okay for example the most common one this the the the the cell phone and all the apps the the Facebook the Twitter then and the rest of them if all of those things were directed in the right place we must not be having teenagers that are taking their own life if there were Direction in the right place we we we will not need or send our children to school they could stay right home and use those things and learn and use their basement as their laboratory where they can be producing things by themselves praise the Lord so there's a problem there's a conflict somewhere there's a conflict somewhere that no matter how much money we have how much wealth we have how much knowledge we have is never bringing us to the place to solve our differences praise the Lord so the problem is now poverty that's a generation conflict we might not be able to talk about everything today but we can start amen there is always a starting point praise the Lord and if you give me one of those starting point I appreciate the same message for the rest of the year because I get down on the Rabbit Trail and how to get out of there praise the Lord Saint John chapter 4 let's go to the book of Saint John chapter 4. praise the Lord sister Faith says show she knows me very well amen until sometimes they have to help me to change the the same on title and then I go online I look at this when did I preach this praise the Lord see John chapter four Saint John chapter 4 is a very very very unique you I mean the all true church history this scripture has been used by many evangelists on the field and uh you know and and and many people you know is is being greatly used and a horse a horse a whole lot of Truth it holds a whole lot of for history and I pray that the Lord will be can can help us for us to be able to get there with because we don't have time today and we're trying to start up this let's just go read it from verse six maybe another time I would give you a background and give you some of the history that is right in there now Jacob well was there Jesus therefore being worried of his journey South thus on the well praise the Lord and it was about the sixth hour there come at the woman of Samira to draw water Jesus said unto her give me to drink for this for his disciple we're going away into the city to buy meat then said a woman of Samira unto him how is it and this will be our verse for today how is it that thou being the Jews ask it dream of me which I'm a woman of Samira for the Jews have no dealing no dealing generation conflict for the Jews have no dealing when did it start I don't believe that she's the one that is making it up for her to be able to get to that place and say why are you asking me we have no dealing she's taking it from somewhere I don't believe it was something that happened yesterday for the Jews have no dealing with the Samaritans praise the Lord for the Jews have no dealing with the Samaritans he let's go back a little bit let's look at the uh uh some some latest story here or history yeah the Jews have no dealing with the Samaritans praise the Lord okay now you when you look back they had a lot just like I said you know talking about translation a little bit here that were dealing it was borrowed it's a borrow word that is you but actually it means that there was just no communion there was no communion there was just there were there were just no communion we see some few things in the scripture that would prove there too to us that's that's where the origin of the word comes from it comes from together uh uh hence it's been honestly to me that the Jews will be on no kind of obligation to the Samaritans amen no kind of obligation we borrow nothing from them will not drink out of the same cup now you can see why she said that amen when I drink of the same cup or the the same well with them will now sit down to meet with them not eat in the same vessel with them praise the Lord we have no religious connection no commercial dealing with them praise the Lord are we together okay the word convenient I think fully expressed the sense of the original as being as uh extensive in its meaning in all words dealing now there's a little history that is attached to this we will not have time to go but just like I said I will bring you the historical part of it because it it goes back to the days of Ahab when one time Samira was was choosing and made as the capital and then it became a a a trailing center for the syrians the syrians come into Trail they made their Trail and and after the period of time uh uh uh the the people in the place starts to lose their identity but we will go we will go ahead here now what I want to show you also in this is that in Luke chapter 10 Jesus was asked a question who is my neighbor amen when he was telling this tribe the two Commandments What is the greatest Jesus says love the Lord with all of your heart and love your neighbor he said who is my neighbor Jesus sees the opportunity and now he's going to explain in God's mind the way he see what this is Jesus now will bring out the storage of the Good Samaritan which of course it was it will blast the mind of a Jewish rabbi because he's talking about the Lord he's talking about the Torah and yeah Jesus is now bringing in a story that will now shows how the people are are rejected by the Levites because the the Levi saw the man never did anything the priest came and saw the man he never did anything it took the Samaritan praise the Lord now to a Jewish robot that is offensive at least if you want to make an example use somebody else don't use a Samaritan are we together are you getting the picture but you see Jesus did that for a reason are we together now you will see another scripture there I hope you can see well and uh in sin Luke chapter 17. is in Luke chapter 17. and I say it again and see Luke chapter 17. there's a reason why I said it three times because I want you to wake up I don't want you to sleep under me I want your thinking cap to start working we have a promise in Luke chapter 17. the revelation of the son of man but yeah you see Luke chapter 17 Jesus will also introduce another story or Luke will talk about a story and that is that 10 lepers um amen there are 10 lepers that saw Jesus and the scripture says and as he entered into the village there met him 10 men that were leper lepers wish to afford off and they lifted up their voices and said Jesus Master have mercy on us and Jesus said Go and show yourself to the priests praise the Lord the Bible says they left but one man returned praise the Lord now wash it here now verse 16 and fell down at his fell down on his face at his feet giving him thanks and he was a Samaritan why because the nine word Jews being a Samaritan he will not be accepted into the synagas [Music] praise the Lord amen but not only that not only that what I want you to grab here is that it is only the illit of every age there will recognize the word of their day praise the Lord amen now see Jesus is is dealing with this and pretty soon he's going to he's going to talk about the revelation of the son of man so what we can grab in picture here is there just like the uh our brother Baron told us this was a dispensational thing because it was a visitation to the Samaritans only the Samaritan could pick it up the other ones they returned back to their denomination but the Samaritan returned back to the word the Samaritan came back to Christ now see what Jesus said the Bible says and Jesus answered and said well then Martin claims but where are the nine they are not formed that returned to give glory to God self dear stranger praise the Lord another verse that will also help you it's in John chapter 8 that was what Jesus was having this conversation with uh with the Jews now talking about a father Abraham you know and all of that Abraham is your father and uh the Jews said unto him then answer the Jews and said unto him say we now well that thou are a Samaritan and have a devil now that that just gave you a picture of how much the Jews look at the Samaritans praise the Lord amen but the the story will get very very interesting when we go back and look at some some history that is attached to death so this was just to be able to give us a picture of what created this thing in this woman when she said we have no dealing praise the Lord why you asking me for water we have no dealing glory be to God if we are and by one block God created Army if every one of us have the signature has God's signature on our DNA welcome at this word no dealing praise the Lord welcome another word no dealing what we ever put a person in a place to ever think that they are better than the northern Malta praise the Lord generation conflict she's reacting on what her parents have told her information that have passed from one generation to another generation and his soul a soul installed in in in in in in the gene in the brains of the people and they can say no we are not the same why why we are not the same why what proof do you have we are not the same if this word Remains the Same that by warm blood God made all men if everything goes back to that one blood one gene cell praise the Lord there is no dealing generation conflict Hallelujah praise the Lord take for example you will realize this is this is this is always it's always mysterious people will fight they're trying to claim rights and privilege and you know and and you know position and whatever better class lower class you know any whatever name they can place it citizen immigrants and whatever but when there is a disaster when we have a disaster praise the Lord all we have take for example like uh we experienced the the the killing of George Floyd you will always realize when something unusual happened amen I always have to be something sorry for it is so easy for at that very moment people forget about their status they forget that we don't have dealing with one another right okay disaster is able to bring us together quickly praise the Lord but then when there is no disaster everybody gets to their class everybody get to their group no they are not part of us we are the origin of the other fake we are the high class they are the lower class but let something happen you realize that from the soul man is able to step out and realize he will realize that something has been Worthy praise the Lord you see family have they have forces and and quarrel among them and you know and you know they'll tell their children different things you know those people the days but when the next family have a problem a death in the family it's so easy for the man to step out of that cage and pretty soon he goes back and say oh I'm very sorry for your loss praise the Lord and as soon as that is over he goes right back into his prison his praising that makes him I mean he's the only one there he can smell what is there so he think is better than the next man praising he goes back into his praising he say I have more privilege than you because I was imprisoned in you generation come generation conflict the word has had Revival there has been a move of God they have been uh philosopher men that have brought great reason into the world there there have been a diff the word have experienced Astro ordinary things praise the Lord well yeah they have not been able to solve our problems of differences praise the Lord now follow me carefully and quietly because I think I've got you today quietly let me get you to the carefully now you will realize You Were Real Lies how the serpent sea teaching is the truth praise the Lord amen if from one block God made all men then something might have affected their blood there was an introduction of another bloodstream that God makes in Eden praise the Lord are we together if from one block God made all men then this conflict this generation conflict it is not because we are from different cities you are from you are we have yeah in the north you are from the sun no it is not because we are different tribes it is not because we are different race that's not where they begin from it's all because there was a strange blood cells that came in contact with the purest blood cell the Arden and Eve had and God bless Hero has introduced every conflict every conflict even the conflict we have with ourselves that sometimes we don't appreciate ourselves sometimes I mean we beat ourselves on the hill where I mean it's so hard for us to praise ourselves we always sing a lot of people are better than us even in the inward individual conflict we struggle with ourselves we struggle with our laws we struggle with our weight we struggle with our appetite we struggle with everything all comes from the blood a contrary blood cells because the prophet of God will say every one of us here at Birth from Genesis chapter 3. the Abominable other the seven heart will eat it brings another blood cells glory be to God size is very if science is ahead of the preachers because when science want to find your sickness they go and test your blood when the preachers want to know the problem of the church they go and look at their doctrines and they are bylaws the doctrines in the Bible says not the problem the problem is a blood problem it's a blood problem a lot of Doctrine problem because you can have all the doctrine from Genesis to Revelation if you don't have that purified blood if not the blood of God is not flowing through your veins you will take this Bible and do the most wickiest thing in the world is that a church problem it's not a Doctrine problem it's a block glory be to God Hallelujah we have our different Supernatural experience around the church we have had the outpouring of the Holy Ghost on Azusa 3 we have the pillow of fire ever taking praise the Lord in all of history almighty God coming down we have heard all of that but yet we have a lot of differences just because of one sentence or another we have no dealing with those people we have no dealing with those people they have that Doctrine we have no dealing with those people blood problem is a blood problem is a blood problem you have not been disposed to the language that is in your DNA when you ever get exposed to the language that is in your DNA praise the Lord hallelujah when you ever get a sports and really read the language that is in your DNA there is nothing there is nothing that a man can do or a woman can do praise the Lord they can tarnish your name they can say whatever they want to say praise the Lord there will be no place to find Hate in Your Heart there will be no place of hatred foreign but it's okay it's okay glory be to God people can say whatever uh you know they want to say it I mean you you you look at all of these great Scholars and and and you know they try to prove and look there in Genesis chapter 6 and they'll talk about the Nephilim came down the the naphthalene they came down there they can't believe that falling angels can come down amen and have affair with women and but they cannot believe that accepting can do the same amen praise the Lord glory be to God amen Genesis was only an effect of Genesis 3. Genesis 6 never came before Genesis 3 Genesis 3 came before Genesis 6. there was not a Genesis 6 if there was not a a blood minglory in Genesis 6 I mean Genesis 3 we will not have Genesis 6. oh okay oh may God help us this morning amen people of God may God help us that we rise above this generation conflict because I will tell you is in each and every one of you this morning even the guy that is preaching think about it think about it the Bible says the desert we bloomsome with roses when Israel went back and got their Homeland there are the the the uh uh uh they go back to the place and you know you if you look at the geographical uh uh position of Israel you see there it's a desolate amen it's a desert but on the basis of that word the Jews have always believed that it was God's promise to them that there's that were blown with roses and today Jerusalem have one of the best irrigation system is one of the most fruitful land they're even in the desert area they play food because what the word of God says so praise the Lord the word of God says so are we together and that same word that says that roses were bloom in the desert that same word says there will be a bride praise the Lord the same word said God will have a people that will give him the preeminence not a people that will become a church member but a people that will give him the preeminence a bride and if the desert can bloom with roses surely God do have a people not that God will have as saying God have a people that will put him above everything if you are not there yet it's because generation conflict is holding you back generation conflict is holding you back [Music] upon the Lord you trying to use your ability to take care of yourself is a conflict Paul say when I want to do good evil is always there there's a war that is in me who will deliver me from this Wretched Man that I am your fight is not outside people your fight is Right In You your fight is Right In You if you can break those change door praise the Lord if you can be like a something this morning pick up that chain upon your shoulder you will be one of the happiest more healthier person than ever lived upon the face of the Earth glory be today Hallelujah amen the Bible says the Lord is 90. the Lord is 90 the scripture says he cover all space all space god is more closer to you than even your breath that you breathe praise the Lord every time we say well let's pray let's invite the presence of the Lord he's been here before you even start praying why are you inviting him you can only make the law of his language is let's make him feel welcome because we get a lot of attitude that don't make God feel welcome feel welcome because he already here he filled every space the thing that is keeping you from God is thyself it's your own human cell that is keeping you from God but he's so night that you can touch him he's so lie that you can touch him he's real people it's not a god that is in space and we don't know where he is I declare this morning that he is here he's right here this morning [Applause] thank you see this woman let me jump ahead of myself a little bit because I'm going out of time see this woman that was saying we have no dealing when Jesus brought Beyond herself and he entered the room with her he brought Beyond ourselves and entered into the room with her and he sat down brother Adam said he he contacted her spirit he sat down and started to tell her you have four or five husbands the more you had an iron the woman I was saying we don't have no dealing she's not inviting instead of come and see this man why are you bringing the people to the man that you have not dealing with for the Samaritans to receive him when she knows that the Samaritan don't have dealing with him but what did she said he told me he told me oh that I have done oh that's why you need you need God to enter your room you need him to enter the chamber with you oh praise the Lord Hallelujah the next time you will ever get the thought of feeling that we ever cross your mind if ever if if ever endeavor we ever bring a thought across your mind that says we are not the same we don't have no dealing that's a devil language that's a demonic language of one blood we try to use religion they are Muslims we are Christians we try to use our our racism we try to use tribalism all sorts of things and yet it had never solved our differences we say they are now of the same family this is our family that is there but we still get probably in our family we try to separate everybody from what we have not solved our problem yet we said this is our our amen so yes the problem is not differences of whom it's not differences of location it's a blood problem the prophet of God said we need a blood transfusion and I'm telling you I'm ready to give it this morning I'm ready to give a blood transfusion this morning that's why we need a blood transfusion how can people expect you to go in a rapture their mind is so breading and crafted in this way we are denying ourselves of our own body the change the things that are supposed to bring us overcoming power if you don't have that I'm telling you there is nothing that will satisfy you they can put you in the house and give you all the money in the world you will never be satisfied you will sit right there with those wealth and you will be crafting evil you will be sitting down with the wealth of the word and say you will be crafting evil so money that's not it's not a problem praise the Lord the facilities that we have we can stream service online we can listen to it we can put it on our phone and what all that we can but yet we are still far from God we are still far from God we are still far from God I challenge you try it you streaming into a service the purpose is to enjoy the word and fellowship but pretty soon you start criticizing you are just looking at the saving and criticizing see that other one there I don't like the way they can sink now what is the benefit of you streaming what is the benefit when other people are in the house of God they are giving praise to God you that is on this on the line sitting down then you are criticizing them [Music] we come to the house of God this place is called the house of God that's the name we give it praise the Lord and the one we come to is almighty God we must be entering into his presence we must be entering praise the Lord we must be glory beyond our sitting position just like the scripture says and John was in the spirit on the last day Hallelujah thank you but then that's kind of you are we together when we come back we just sit back so easy for us to be overtaken by sleep in the presence of God so easy to be overtaken by sleep oh yeah sleep will come but you have to know why you are here and if you really know why you are here you will fight against it you will stand up you will go outside you say no devil I'm here to worship God I must receive from the word of God you don't sit there and just love me you'll see that we have a generation conflict something that have built it have built complex complex in US complex until for no reason we go around misjudging the action of people why is she looking at me like that who she thinks she is when you don't even know what is on her mind right blacks being people that we can never find anything to make us happy no matter how much we have we are just angry our face are found when God's people ought to be happy people the preacher have to beg you for an amen before you say Amen amen say amen amen say amen amen complex and we feed on it we feed every day we go and look for element to make us more difficult we go and gather elements to make us more difficult then you say Lord Jesus come he's been here ever since he's here he's here you need to come you think when God was saying Adam Adam where are you was God looking for Adam no no God knew where Adam was it was Adam that never knew where he was I never knew where he was but God knew exactly where he was and if God should ask you to see him this morning where are you you can tell whether you are in church or you are somewhere shopping praise the Lord the church has equipped itself it has he had drama a Music musician and everything with the church tried to do but yeah the mall the less people we have in church the less people we have in church it's everywhere praise the Lord so Sunday has become Divine worship service Wednesday 7 is not divine praise the Lord Hallelujah they are certain people that are expected to be on Wednesday service is for them the rest of us know with everything that the world has gave us with is advancement almost one Teddy yeah she let you go I'm not even according to my notes here but that's okay that's a good way to start the Jews have no dealing that's what she said and remember that this very woman that was bringing segregation she knew what the prophet said she knew that the prophet said the Messiah will come she was able to identify that you you are a prophet so she was religious praise the Lord amen she was religious she she had knowledge of the word but yes she was bound in the life of teaching one man to another praise the Lord why because she had this problem this Blood problem something has settled down in her blood cells that make her to think that she's better than another person that's the worst curse that a man can ever cling to himself for you to think or feel that you are better than another person may God be merciful may God give us Grace that we can be able to identify the generation conflict praise the Lord and we can be able to identify the generation conflict let me read something here to you then I'll let you go some will see Jesus and when she comes to the world Jesus said woman bring me a drink and she said why it's not customary for you Jews to ask Samaritans such we have no dealing one another in another word It Was a Race effect like between the color red and white today why see why we have no dealing with one another praise the Lord this is where I want to get you Dr Moses you know what I begin to Believe Christian French that we are just living in the beginning of the greatest time this word has ever witnessed the statistics the statistics are mind-blowing mind-blowing the statistics is that there have never been a time they have never been a time in the world the world has had genocides the destruction of life on the ground of human differences praise the Lord when the Roman Empire fought it was not because they felt that they were better than those people they wanted LED they wanted to conquer they were looking for people to to conquer praise the Lord Joshua and his manly fought for their inheritance but they have never been a time the statistics that is out there this 20th century has been able to experience More Death killing only on the ground of differences praise the Lord in Rwanda the genocide it was just ethnic differences people of the sea nation speak the same language but because of trouble differences they took the life of one another that's what this 20th century has experienced there has never been a time in the word where the world has a spirit's information then our age information praise the Lord Hallelujah never be the time I mean if if it is recorded if it is recalled if there is a written document we can get it we can get it well if we have to hack it we can get it this generation if there is a written document if we have to hack it we can get it if it's on video we can get it praise the Lord give them change they will show you uh King Charles on his bed they will show you a video of King Charles on his bed this generation there are never been a time where we have we have access to information we have access to information we are living in the beginning of the greatest time that the word has ever witnessed I just believe that all of the lines are getting on clock all of the lines are getting on clock there are things that people used to do lawmakers used to do they would get by with it now they can now they can praise the Lord there was one Deputy somewhere there I just I just saw that on the news field they were right in the office they were talking about you know another person name you know trying to uh uh nothing she can do we're going we're going to stronghold we got this this is it was recorded they listened to their own voices and I can also tell you the channel to your soul can also be on clock praise the Lord the channel to your soul that you don't have to rely on religion or your denomination you can get access to a living God because all the lines [Music] You Don't Have To Praise In Yourself there is more of God than what you know right all the lines are getting on clock you know clock up with all kinds of doctrines and geologies and all kinds of stuff unbelief is being hindered down generation conflict hanging down from one generation to another and we have a goal wrong with this thing hand it down no matter this I'm Lutheran I'm Baptist when God is looking for people that will turn the world upside down he's not looking for one denomination or another praise the Lord the names that we have had on talk how much have it benefited us all kinds of stuff has been handed down from one generation to another oh there's no such a thing as healing that there is a miracle this past who told you that Is God dead is he not the same yesterday today and forever he says and we just automatically believe it it's fair to us and we just believe it we just embrace it Hallelujah we just automatically believe it say yeah I mean all the church today that I mean the churches they are just fake are we together but they come to a place where God not man would they still be back there in the old former way look how science has progressed in the past 150 years think of it a hundred years ago the only way they had to send message was by a letter foreign praise the Lord just just couple of years back yes couple of years back I mean I'm not old we used to travel and sometimes when you're traveling in in the interior the people come to the bus station they give you a letter they just tell you the town they give you the letter that says when you get to this town just throw it they put the name of the person on it so you are in a vehicle I remember I remember traveling and you know the people gave you letter when you get to this town just try it and you throw it you see somebody coming to pick it up they look at it oh that's Joseph they take it to Joseph house oh yeah they can be picky or they look ahead it's Joseph as soon as they find a person named then they wave to you 100 years the only way we had to send message was by letter all by left to ear when you get there please tell them and there you carry the message and then you make it you make he really told me say I should tell you this I mean he really need your help praise the Lord if you love the guide if you don't love the god well he said I should give it to you and you just go he said I should tell you this you just started talking to it tell him and today they can send everybody telephone telegram Wireless Telegram television praise the Lord Hallelujah your wireless telegram is your cell phone yeah information goes faster just think of the way they can send it how they progress amen how they have progressed I'm going to stop here we are not got into our subject yet but that's fine generation conflict science has beat us science has picked it up they have picked it up they have picked it up ancestry.com people now tracing the ancestors how do they do it how do they do it through your DNA it's through your DNA there's a language that is in you praise the Lord it's the reason why God don't need to speak English or French or German for him to speak to your soul praise the Lord the doctors will tell you and when and we experienced that a couple of times now they will tell you when someone is in common or just looking at a documentary home a couple of days and wife and myself and this this boy is a true life story how to had an accident very terrible accident and uh in uh just just in that uh uh their car got submerged in the water and he stayed in the water for about 30 minutes or more and he came to pull him out and take him to the hospital but I just did everything that he could the first thing they ran for information to his brain and they were having no signal and they told his mama that we're not getting any communication with his brain foreign she said can I go in and see my boy the doctor said yes she went by him and she held his hands started to call his name Junior this is Mama signs proof it's a proof of the Resurrection that when you come out of the Grave it's a familiar voice that you were here when Jesus said Lazarus come forth that voice was a familiar voice he started to call his name as she rubbed his hands praise the Lord sister comfort ing now I mean had an accident now uh and it flew over to Rochester and Iceberg then and his wife to go and find places and my wife and myself went there and were visiting with her I mean she pretty much broke every bone in her body your own life support the doctors were doing everything they were all they were there that's not being the why back now but she's she's well now and if I just were doing everything they couldn't get no communication with the brain we got there in the bed Aaron took her hand and says Naomi this is Ari Naomi this is Irene and after 10 minutes or a little bit than that she started keep doing that Naomi this is Aaron are you hearing me she started moving her head that's the reason why Medical Science were wrong the nearest Kings they were one the closest person somebody that is familiar a mother a sister somebody that is close they don't want a stranger because my sheep yeah my boys [Music] [Applause] praise the Lord generation conflict like I've always said one of these days you will realize all of the things that we have fought over and we talk and make us better you get to heaven you'll be so disappointed that none of those things matter to God none of those things matter to God the musicians can come sorry for keeping you a little bit late generation conflict foreign that's when they start identifying the voice of their parents a couple of years ago I can't remember now but right here in Brooklyn uh uh Senator I went I went down to one shop I remember and I said we were looking at uh what just looking doing some shopping trying to get some painting and we met this Korean woman and she was telling us how her little nephew got to speak in English because the mother will always read an English book to her when she was pregnant she would take a book in the evening and read it to her baby and when the child was born the child would catch the language familiar voice praise the Lord don't make the voice of God a stranger to you the voice of God have to be familiar praise the Lord and how do the voice of God gets familiar when that stay a small voice speak to you when nobody is around all right and you can say yes Lord Lord I'm sorry Lord thank you for speaking to me and the more you make the voice of God we're coming the more you create an atmosphere for the voice of God to become familiar to you little Samir he had to learn the voice of God Eli told him the next time you hear that voice says speak my lord your seven years right around and the prophet of God had to learn that voice until he knew when God spoke he took his heart he said Lord is there something you want to tell yourself and you can know the voice of God also [Music] [Music] it would take the voice of God to bring you out of your generation conflict it will not take your own human calculation all your religious practice the same way he took the voice of God to bring Lazarus out of the grave it would take the voice of God to bring you out of every complex that you are dealing with in your mind every complex every bitterness every darkness that is in your spirit it will take the voice of God and if you don't make your if you don't make the voice of God familiar to you is how long you will stay in your prison [Music] from God one word [Music] and we will hold to face and we will hold to to feel anything and we will hold things down in our spirit [Music] yes I give myself a win oh I gave myself away so you you so you can speak to me oh I
