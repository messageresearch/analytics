in [Music] [Music] sea and stop the Roaring may he come forward to the rescue of this ship there where a thousand lives are in danger may he quieten the sea may he send Mercy forgiveness of sin or anything and may his Spirit now come to them and console them and send rescue quickly and may no lives be lost we ask this in Jesus Christ's name amen God bless you good morning to you my friends may God's blessings be with you my U people has always said when I when I was speaking I always spoke too long I'll do my very best this morning not to do that I just lay my watch out here maybe I can watch it about 15 minutes it's always a pleasure to get to be in this Philadelphian church and among its members and be with its [Music] Pastor uh I have considered brother maton Bose to be one of the best friends I have on this Earth as and the among the ministers he is a very dear brother to me and I I love him and I love his people and because they are God's people I had the privilege just now of meeting brother Stonewell the converted scientist and I just wish that this whole church had the burden of souls on their heart as brother stonell has at this time I was just thinking as I was speaking to him of that little baby innocence and how his heart just yearns and burns setting talk in the tears in his eyes and how that a real rough sinner May brought down by the power of God to that place if we could just all get in that attitude I said brother Stell don't never lose that wonderful something that that it's the cream all for the top of the milk and I pray that God will keep that man that way and and we'll bless him because he's a wonderful spirit he has a not because he's sitting here at the platform but uh that's true and um I said no matter what anyone says what any groups of people says just keep your mind set right on him and they may Bank everything around you it look so black you can't hardly see over just don't worry he he can lift us up above the shadows and he he takes us through his power is a drawing he said if I be lifted up I will draw all men unto me and now tonight is the service that we're to have tonight is to be the the of course the closing service we just had the two and I did this for our brother Bose and for you dear people who are around here and more I hear about the uh your love for Christ of course the more I love you that's right and now I believe that we're living in the most wonderful age that's ever been on the earth we're going to want someday over in a great Millennium we're just going to think oh if I just have know it was in this way what I would have done oh how much more I could have done if I just know what it was going to be well now you don't know it but by faith we act faith is the substance of things hope for the evidence of Things Not Seen is that right see Faith doesn't see it doesn't doesn't see with these eyes it sees with the inward eyes see all the Christian armor the whole armor of Christianity is Supernatural there's nothing to be seen if the whole person deals with the supernatural look at the Christian armor love joy peace longsuffering goodness meekness gentleness patience is that right all those things are the Christian armor see that's the inside man that by faith looks do these eyes and sees the things that is not Abraham was a man who being old and his his life was uh stream was dead within him and Sarah his wife was near 100 and and yet he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong giving glory to God see for he endured seen him who is invisible he didn't he didn't have to look at the natural he seen the super Supernatural all the time that's the way we want to do look at the Unseen what is the Unseen well for your healing God promised you healing God said it's there now you how many believe that's the truth say am uh I just like to hear the word amen means so be it did you how many would say I would like to have a a acorn tree Oak Tree in my front yard and somebody gives you an acorn now you've got the tree in seed Farm is that right well you just might as well Rejoice cuz you got the tree is that right you just got it in seed form but it's it'll it'll produce you take this Acorn and you put it in the ground a little box somewhere and set it in the house and keep it watered the first thing you know up comes a Little Acorn Tree is that right then you trans set it out into the yard it just keeps growing but you can praise God just as soon as you get the acorn is that right because you've got the tree already is that right now when God said I'm the Lord and heal of the just start praising you got it you got it right then you say well I don't see any results but that's don't make any difference you got it anyhow see because the word of God is a seed is that right and we are sold with The Incorruptible seed of God see it can't perish it's Incorruptible and I here's a statement that I usually make in the healing Services the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise of God will bring it to pass that's right because it's a seed it has to and the right mental attitude you just take the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise watch it materialize see no matter how it looks if it looks impossible if God said so he makes it possible that wonderful all right now I told Billy this morning he said now daddy you'll have them people up there till they won't get their dinner or nothing else and we've got to get out of this hotel is certain times said you start preaching I know you I said get a seat and sit down give me 15 minutes he's got his seat he's watching and here I am done going into my 15 minutes that's the way it goes always but well I tell you it's just surreal you see I I have a food that I eat that the world knows nothing about and your spirit coming to me in faith believing what I'm telling you is the truth is the food that I live on that's my eternal life if I don't feed this natural man it'll die and if I don't feed this spiritual man it'll die now our brother scientists sitting here would know that anything that doesn't eat very much and just keep going die and dieting your stomach shrinks and then if you become eating a whole lot your stomach you require more I sure I'm a glutton on this I tell you I really require a whole lot of it because I my capacity just has no limits I've often said if I was just a little bigger maybe I could feel better you know and if it was I don't know how I could contain it I believe we'll have to have an immortal body uh to contain I think of what about it friend now we're just all home folks here aren't we so now just what when the battle's all over the last shots been fired arms are stack smokes all died down and we sat down for that wedding supper now could you imagine that I can just think of it look down through that great table set down Earth for hundreds of miles I look down through there and I look across and here sits mass and B sitting right here brother don't well all these Breen sit along there I hear him say there's brother Rand he made it oh my you know he's bound to be a few tears run down is there I look across there and I think my looku at there there's my old dad there's mother there's my wife my children well here we all are here and the tears will start running down our cheeks the Angelic being standing back and soft Angelic music's going what a morning and I can see as we're looking across the table to one another and looking down through there seeing who all there the tears running down our cheeks as we reach across the table to one of their's hands and gripping like that across the table then I can hear the angels move back bow their heads look come walking out on from behind those doors there he comes the King of Kings the Lord of lords walk down along the table and wiping each one's eyes and putting his arms I'm said now don't cry it's all over now all of them here there's not any of them gone they're all here now enter into the joys of the Lord oh my heart jumps when I think of it that's not these little fiction stories of Santa Claus that's thus sayth the Lord that's the seed that's right now becoming materialized right now it's moving in the Lord bless you now we're going to have word of prayer and then go right into the service for just a few moments father we love you and our hearts are bleeding to you and now it has fallen by poor unprofitable servants time to speak just a few moments and I pray that you will help us not knowing what to say but knowing that thou has said if you'll open your mouth I'll put the words in so you said take no fault what you shall say for it's not you that speaks it's your father that dwell in you he doeth the speaking I believe that's the truth I know it is the truth for you said so and you are all truth the very Fountain of truth there's nothing contaminated to come out of it nothing wrong nothing in a lie it's got to be the resource of all truth and from there you said these words now God bless us today bless this little church bless its humble little Pastor here our brother and all the new brothers and brother Stonewell and the strangers in our gates and make us all a blessing to thy kingdom today as we bless each other in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen I might be able to open up the Bible leaves but there's only one who can open the scripture in the Book of Revelations it said there was a book that was sealed with Seven Seals and no man in heaven no no man in earth or no one beneath the Earth was was worthy to come and take it and to open the book and to loose the seals and then John saw a lamb that has been slain from the foundation of the world and it came and taken the book and opened the seals and the all the Angelic beings cried Thou Art Worthy for thou was slain from the foundation of the world and that's I might turn back the pages like this I might by some theology be able to give you my views of it but there's only one can open it that's the lamb that was slain from the foundation of the world and may his presence now come and take the word of God and place it in each heart just where it has need of I pray that he will do it while I read some of it out of the out of the Bible in the 2 uh2 chapter of St Matthews beginning with the 41st verse I wish to read down the 46th verse inclusive um I'm as everyone knows that I'm not a preacher as I would call a preacher I'm as I said as the spare tire and you only use a spare tire when you got a flat but we haven't got a flat this morning but it just happened to be time to speak just a few moments and you pray with me as I talk to you about this text and while the Pharisees were gathered together Jesus asked them saying what think ye of Christ whose son is he and they said unto him the son of David and he said unto them how then does David in spirit call him Lord saying the Lord said unto my Lord set thou on my right hand till I make thine enemies thy footstool if David then called him Lord how is he his son and no man was able to answer answer him a word neither D any man from that day forth ask him any more questions may he add His blessings to that word and now for a few moments I'd like to take this if you'd call it a text um what think ye of Christ after you seen all these meetings and everything what do you think of Christ whose son is he that's been a an old dispute Through the Ages through the scientists and through the the evolutionists and so forth what was Christ who was he and and it's just as simple as the question is which was first the hen or the Egg you've heard that which the hen come from the egg and which is first hen or egg well the hen was God made the hen the hen laid the egg that's just as simple as anything but they always asking the H come out of the egg so how which his first hen or egg so God made the hen the hen laid the egg the hen was first and um now that's the same thing about the sci scientific research of the bloodstream of Jesus Christ we all know that the Christ was the Virgin born son of God and many unbelievers today try to deny that the woman could have the baby without first having a a sexual uh desire uh from uh being born of sex by the the male well they said that a hen could not lay an egg without uh if it couldn't be fertile of course if the male bird she can lay an egg but she the egg won't hatch unless it's been with the male see and a scientist once told me not speaking scientist because my brother's here but there was a scientist once went hunting with me out in the west and I met him and he was about the roughest fell I ever seen he said do you mean to tell me when I told him I was a preacher he said you look too intelligent to be there and I said well um I said well not disputing your words sir but I believe that's the mark of intelligence and he said he said well anybody would ble such a story as that and I said well what do you mean he said well such as that virgin birth he said you you know you know better than that I said no sir I'll admit I don't know any better I said that's that's just all I know and he said well you mean to tell me that woman could have a baby without being so that was Joseph that man that she was going with is a little slip up like have all time I said oh no God makes no slip ups that was absolutely God's son he said well there is no such a thing I said you mean there's not a Creator who made the heavens and earth he said no of course not he said oh it's psychology I said well how' the world get here said it was here when I come here I said yes that's right and the room you was born in was there when you got there and the furniture was arranged but some intelligent had to arrange it that way that's exact why if it would be silly D I say well how'd that watch come well it's just a watch that's all it just happened to be a watch well now the timing the jewels and everything anybody with with mentally balanced right would know that some intelligence made that watch had to time it and regulate it and put the hands and jewels and the operation well then how much greater is your body than this watch see because it was a man that made this watch and somebody had to make the man so a person says that we just happen to be that shows his a mental deficiency somewhere that's right so he said well now he began to tell me the ethics of Darwin and so forth about how Evolution came into existence how the world and the Sun and the Moon you've read it perhaps Had A Love Affair and chipped off a little piece and it flew off and that made the world and the first man was a sponge and he wore a little Ward on this side and Out Come an arm and then he decided he want a little arm on the other side so it rolled a few thousand years over on that side and Arm come out I said look fell I'm kind of weak in faith I said I I don't believe that I can't believe it I said I just believe way God said it was I said the only way you can prove that by faith you can't prove it any other way I said my Faith's too weak for that I said I just I Haven got that much faith I just believe that God made it the way he said he did and he said I said he said all about the Virgin bir he said it's it's proven Reverend brand that that corn everything else has to have a Poland the pin and the cor and for the tree and the how the bees packet and everything has to have actual male and female I said sure there was a male in this respect I said that was God well is God a man I said God's a spirit oh impossible to contact the actual human being it has to be the sex part I said oh no I said now look you will admit to me will you that the woman had the baby we'll say that that was right the woman had the baby and he was Jesus yes that that I'll go with you that far cuz there's some kind of a something's going on through the world and to come down history and so forth that there was one here called Jesus but he was no virgin born I said then we you'll admit that he had a natural mother yes now he in your estimation he' have to have an actual father a Earthly man here to be his father or he could not have been born he said that's exactly right I said will you stick with that Mr je he said I will I said all right I want to ask you something then if if this woman had the baby and you you said it was impossible it had to have a natural father it had to have a Earthly father as same as it had a Earthly mother so that's exactly trth I said then how did the first man get here without father or Mother where did he come from let he be tadp monkey whatever he wanted to be according to science he had to have a father and a mother is that right I said who was his father and mother well he asked no more questions from that time saying it just said it that was all he he he didn't have oh I tell you their argument is thinner than the broth made out of a shadow of a chicken is starve to death I they just haven't got a they haven't got a leg to stand on no sir Jesus Christ was the son of God I believe it with all my heart and the great holy spirit overshadowed that virgin and she brought forth the son according to God's word for said a virgin shall conceive and bring forth the child his name name Shall be Called Emmanuel and I he was God With Us I believe that not God that will be with us for a space but be with us forever we are his children living in his presence now and the weakness of the church today is one of the the fundamental reasons that we see no more going on in the church first thing I think is because there's not enough travel of soul to bring the person in contact with his maker and another thing is this is the person who does find God doesn't realize who he is after he's found God that's right if you only realize at you're setting now with Christ Jesus that many of the people are trying to post it off to some other great age and all healing over the Millennium and so forth and all the Miracles over to [Music] m [Music]
