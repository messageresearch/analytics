You know, this song was written by a Pentecostal bishop and uh it's a real Pentecostal song and I I think over the years uh because I think brother Brandham sang this song most of the time at the end of a preaching uh uh so we have the tendency of singing it you know uh at the just like at the end of a preaching you know uh and uh Uh, &gt;&gt; but I've been enjoying it all through the week. Amen. I've been enjoying it in the old Pentecostal style of singing. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, it's just been playing in my head and I thought I would sing it this morning. Amen. The Lord bless you. The Lord bless you. Uh, let's let's go to the word. Thank you, musician. Thank you. Let's go to the word. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. For the for the scripture reading. uh for the scriptural reading. Let's let's take John chapter 6. Let's take John chapter 6. I know on Wednesday night we were studying from Revelation chapter 6. But just for a scripture reading just to have u uh somewhere to stand and read a word this morning, let's take John chapter 6. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; John chapter 6, let's drop down to uh uh verse 32. John 6 verse 32. John 6 verse 32. Then Jesus said unto them, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses give you not that bread from heaven, but my father giveth it, giveth you the truth bread from heaven. For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven and and give life unto the word. Then said they unto him, Lord ever more give us this bread. Now you think about that and then uh uh two chapters back the same thing. It was a water to the woman at the word to these people is a bread. He says I will give you water. You come yet and you will not drink again. She says, "Give me thy water." Now, yeah, he's talking about, "I will give you a bread, you know, uh, and then when you eat it, you never get hungry again." Then they said unto him, Lord, evermore, give us this bread. &gt;&gt; And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life. &gt;&gt; He that cometh to me shall never hunger, and he that believeth on me shall never thirst. But I said unto you that ye also have seen me and believe not. All that the Father giveth me shall come to me. And him that come to me I will in no wise cast out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I will in no way cast out. For I am come down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him that sent me. &gt;&gt; And this is the father will which have sent me that of all which he has given me, I should lose nothing. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I wish I was hoping that we will all claim ourself in there. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. uh uh he's talking about you and uh and you have to believe it. I can't believe it for you. &gt;&gt; You have to believe it for yourself. Amen. &gt;&gt; I read that again. And this is the will. This is the father will which have sent me that of all which he has given me I should lose nothing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But should rise up again. rise it up again in the last day. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. We get so used to hearing these things that uh uh we hear them over and over and it's so easy to relax in it and not really, you know, uh uh uh place oursel there, grab it, rejoice in it. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And uh uh let's continue to read uh verse 40. This is the will of him that sent me that everyone which seeth the son. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Is there something that you see in there &gt;&gt; on Wednesday night? &gt;&gt; Everyone who seeth &gt;&gt; the sun. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; The first house rather said come and see. When the woman of the word when uh predestinated sea was quickened in her she said come and see the man &gt;&gt; that have told me the things that I have done. Now so uh Jesus is saying here and this is the will of him that sent me that everyone which seeth the son &gt;&gt; and believeth on him. Now you have to remember it's the same thing that God told Abraham. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Look at the heavens. &gt;&gt; Whatever you see, I give it to you. &gt;&gt; You have to see it. &gt;&gt; He told Nicodemus the same thing. Until you are born again, you will not see &gt;&gt; the kingdom. &gt;&gt; It's not just to believe it. You know, &gt;&gt; not not to believe it by birth or believe it by joining or believe it by association, but you have to see it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Now, so he's saying it here. He that seeth the son uh uh uh uh and believe on him may have everlasting life, and I will raise him up in the last day. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We can all say, "Open the eyes. Open the eyes of my heart, Lord. &gt;&gt; Let me see it." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Because it will not do any good to you &gt;&gt; until you see it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Until you see it, it won't do any good to you &gt;&gt; until you see Calvary. &gt;&gt; Calvary won't do any good to you. You can hear about Calvary. You can you can uh uh uh you know look at the the picture of Calvary, but until you see Calvary, and I pray this morning that you will see the sun. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You will see the son. For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given. That son is the gift of life. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Let's pray together. Father, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we come with our fever body this morning and uh and and we just trusting ourself in your hands, Lord. &gt;&gt; Father God, and uh I'm sure this morning, Lord, uh we all be help from you. &gt;&gt; And if there is one that needed most, I'm the one, Father, I pray that Lord, you'll be merciful. You'll be gracious. Lord, I want to stand. Oh God, just like Isaiah, oh God, that that scripture has has really there with me, no father. Lord, yes, that prophet right in your presence, oh God, when he saw the train, he saw something, Lord, &gt;&gt; he changed his attitude. &gt;&gt; He said, "Wo is me." &gt;&gt; Father, I'm I'm not I don't want to repeat him, Lord. &gt;&gt; I want to say for myself, "Wo is me. I'm a man of God. I pray that father you would just come this morning and oh God bless your word to our hearts. May something be said that will draw us closer to you. We love you. We appreciate you. We glorify your name. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen. The Lord bless you. The Lord bless you. You may have your seat. Amen. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. What a wonderful, wonderful Jesus we serve. Amen. &gt;&gt; So good to be in the house of the Lord this morning, man. We've been we've been we've been running around with this whole thing on this uh Revelation chapter chapter 6. And uh and there's no time to we don't the finishing is not in sight. Let me just tell you right now. the the the finish line uh is not in sight as yet. So we might run it to the end of the year, maybe to next year, maybe to the coming of the Lord. Amen. Praise the Lord. Finishing is not in sight. And what because what what the reason what I'm trying to go into this is that the uh uh there there are just a whole lot of thing. I'm I'm praying and hoping that uh uh next Sunday I might confirm that on uh Wednesday night but uh next Sunday uh if the Lord tired and give us another time I would just like to talk to the church a little bit when I mean talk to the church we will go offline so if you are not in service on on Sunday we will let you know what we talk about but I would just like to talk to this assembly a little bit and uh U and then uh in the evening of next Sunday we will have a prayer meeting in the community service. Uh but uh Sunday morning we will take the time to just talk to ourselves and uh and and that is some of the reason why I choose to just to just stay this way because I don't want to uh uh you know I'm not a teacher far from a teacher but uh because teaching sometimes makes a person to take their time. You know if you start uh uh you know being angry while teaching then you are completely out of place. You are completely out of place. You have to be relaxed. Amen. So there are just lot of few things and I'll share that with you next week if uh if uh we if we uh you know like I said I will I will remind you Wednesday if we going to have that. But that's that's the plan. That's what is in my mind that I'll be able to talk to you as a church. Uh next week we'll take the pullpit away. Amen. And uh so we'll take the pulpit away. The pastor office will be going away and then we'll talk like brothers and sisters. So this morning I was talking thinking about getting back to uh uh Revelation chapter 6 or what we've been speaking on. Emmanuel, I hope you get my image there. I will I will refer back to that and uh but uh uh I mean every time you look into the subject more thing just come up. So I end up with the the beast and the riders. I end up with the beast and the riders. Now I I was I will tell you why uh I end up with that because uh u I'll show you why I end up with the beast and this. Praise the Lord. Amen. Revelation chapter 6 verse one. We we need to go back to Revelation chapter 4. But the reason why I end up with a beast and rather Revelation chapter uh uh 6 verse one, let's uh let's go there. Oh. Revelation 6 verse 1. Hallelujah. 6. And I saw when the lamb opened one of the seal the seals. I heard in it a noise of thunder and one of the four four beasts said said uh come and see one of the four beast saying come and see. And I saw and behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given to him and he went forth conquering and to conquer. Now uh uh uh when you read this as as every Bible scholar that read this uh in u uh uh throughout the ages have always took this this rather to be the Holy Ghost. And the reason why they took this rather to be the Holy Ghost is because over in Revelation chapter 19, let's turn there. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Revelation chapter 19 verse uh uh Revelation 19 11 Revelation 19 11 Revelation uh 1911 I and I saw heaven open and behold a white horse and he that sat upon him was called Faith. ful and truth and in righteousness he does judge and make war. Now if you if you hear the name of the rather he that sat on this is called faithful and truth. Who do you think that rather is? Jesus Christ. Praise the Lord. Don't be quiet on me. &gt;&gt; Don't be quiet on me. You make me sad. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Or we go back and stop preaching on you must be born again. And we go back to water baptism. Praise the Lord. You have been reading your Bibles. I don't know why why we we always have the, you know, the the tendency to behave like we are sh we are not really. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So when you hear faithful in truth and in righteousness, he judge and make wall. Who do you think of? &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; You think of Jesus. So he's a rather here. So because of this rather all through history scholars have always thought this was the same rather in chapter six. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Yes. Because of the white house. So the thing there is the same rather. So they have always called Revelation 6 rather the the the Holy Ghost and even till today till tomorrow. &gt;&gt; Amen. So you see uh uh uh that is the reason why as I was studying sorry I thought about it and I said well uh if we could just we could just run with all of this but it's also good to be able to identify the rather if we can identify the rathers then u uh it would give us uh a a clear picture because the Bible is saying here in Revelation chapter 6, one of the four beasts. Okay. One of the four beasts and uh uh uh and I saw you know uh uh the white house and and the white house also is a beast. &gt;&gt; Okay. So there is one full beast and there is an individual that is riding the beast. Now you will know you will also notice that uh uh when you go through this beast you will find that uh uh uh they were they were not identified him that sat on the white house him that sat on the red him that sat on it was in the last age or the last beast that we actually got the identity of the one that is riding this beast. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And uh so that is the reason why my mind went on uh uh I said well okay maybe we can go by the way of uh uh the beast and the rabbits. You will soon understand uh as I as I go along here you will soon get a picture of uh of uh what I want us to look at. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, Emmanuel, if you would just throw my uh one of the quote of the mark of the beast and let's see uh what brother Brandham said here. He says he says, "Watch this beast." It have four different characters in it. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Daniel saw the same vision 800 years before before B saw the vision. He saw those beasts separated one from another in the beginning of the Gentile ruling. And here they are John seeing it and the end of the gentile ruling. All four of those beasts represent in one seem old devils, demons that possess each kingdom of the Roman down through and the Greek and so forth down through the gentile dispensation has come right down and all met in one beast. So for the father he tells us that the h it have four different character. So what as god is identified by his characteristics the devil is also identified by what &gt;&gt; his characteristics. So for you for us to know that rather then we have to look at the characteristics of him &gt;&gt; that is riding. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Of him that is writing. Even though his name is not given to us, but if we can be able to pick up a clue of his characteristics, then we can be able to identify who is riding this beast. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And let me get your attention very quickly because I'm not yet to tell you stories. We must also realize that we are beast &gt;&gt; and we have a rather we have a rather that's what I want to drive us to. That's why I'm say I'm not here to tell you stories. I'm I'm I'm here for us to be able to look at oursel in the word. We must realize that we have ease. You know, as I was thinking about this, I I thought about it uh in my mind and I was saying to myself, uh uh Jesus just before his crucification in honoring Zachariah prophecy, it was prophesied that he will be riding on a donkey. He'll be riding on an ass. So he gets there and he tell the disciple to go and and I'm thinking in my mind why he never asked for you know uh uh uh you know um for them if if if the prophet said would have said you know he was riding on a white house definitely you have got it. If you have told two of his disciple, go to to to Caesar palace and bring me you know h a white house that no man has really they would have given it to him. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; The prophet says said it was going to be an ass. It was going to be a donkey. Why a donkey? You well you got to find the answer. I've not seen brother telling us why the donkey. I try to find my own own answer because I'm a donkey. Praise the Lord. Amen. You know, it's it's it's almost like uh you think about it this way. You look at you look at the raven in the in the ark and and uh uh uh Noah sent the raven out. He saw dead body. It started eating all over the place. It never came back. Never did the work. And he sent uh and he sent uh uh uh the dove out. Praise the Lord. So uh uh you read that story a raven gets a very ugly picture in your mind. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It gets a very very picture is a is a unc is a is a unbeliever is a but then when you guess over to Elijah being fed God never sent dove to feed Elijah. &gt;&gt; God sent Raven &gt;&gt; and brother Brandham says God servants those rivets. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Then I says I'm a rivet. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So you see, you can't put God in a box. &gt;&gt; You know, all of these one scripture, theological, one quote, you can't put God in a box. &gt;&gt; He's your creator. You are not his maker. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You cannot put God in a box. &gt;&gt; Now, so uh uh that's what I want to get to here now. So thinking about this, I was just thinking about that. says, "Well, I mean, uh uh uh uh it's it was just a sign that God uh uh Christ was going to ride on some of the stubborn people throughout the ages, you know. Maybe that's what the donkey represent. I don't know everything about what it represent, but because uh uh Zachchariah prophesied and Jesus commanded his disciple and the Bible says an eyes that was never never no one sat on it before. And the disciple went to the man and says my master say I should take the man freely give it to him. &gt;&gt; Never even asked who is your master? &gt;&gt; He just give it to him. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that stubborn donkey to just follow. &gt;&gt; Amen. If it had any any stubbornness in it at that moment under the command of the master, it must obey. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. And and uh as as we continue to uh talk on on on uh on this here, let me just let me just wake up myself a little bit. Amen. Let me wake up myself a little bit. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh uh we we sang that song of the water where you you see right there the uh uh you know uh Eliza took a bunch of came to go and pick up Rebecca. Praise the Lord. And brother Brandon in a type would tell us that uh uh uh Rebecca had to she had to to to service those candles. She had to give them water to drink and fill them and and and there were many. It was not just one candle. I think I've showed you in the scripture before that uh it was not just uh uh uh Eliza went with men. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I show it to you in the scripture before. Can you remember that? &gt;&gt; Yeah. The reason why Eliza was the only one mentioned because he was the one that had a commission. Right? &gt;&gt; But according to Jewish uh uh custom in wedding, there have to be people that witnessed the wedding &gt;&gt; up to 10 men. So if you read Genesis 24 carefully, you'll find out that uh there were men that were also there with Eliza. So all of those men have came and and and Rebecca had to to service all of those came. Praise the Lord. But this is what brother Brandham said out of the out of all of that. Uh he said that uh uh uh the same came that that Rebecca service was the same came that wrote her to Isaac. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now he was talking about beast beast being a power. He talk talked about you know we we are giving service to the Holy Ghost is the Holy Ghost that power of God that will take us in the presence of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, uh uh that's where we are with uh with uh with the subject that we want to we want to talk about this morning. And uh uh I mean u Emmano, if you want to put my picture up and uh uh I left my my pen my pen in the office there now. So uh uh this is this is our picture of u of revelation chapter 6 both revelation chapter 4 revelation chapter 5 and revelation chapter 6 that's where we will be around as we as we talk about this okay thank you now so uh uh uh so we see here that uh uh these rather these uh uh beasts on this end have have rather and then these beasts on this end it looks like they don't have rathers they are beasts but we don't see no physical rather &gt;&gt; on it are you getting the picture &gt;&gt; amen revelation chapter Six say him that sat on him. Him that sat on the white horse. Him that sat. So, so in the picture we can see there him that sat even though we don't know his name there but there is him that is sitting on that beast. So he has a he has a visible rather. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. this this this living creature because actually when you actually look in you look in in in the concordance you look in the Greek these two beasts have different definition &gt;&gt; these ones are mostly defined as living creatures and even in one of the definition they say humans. Now these ones on this side uh uh in their definition they are curies. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; If you are not together yet, just follow along. And uh so so we see here that even though till now we have not fully identified the rather of those beasts. But what I want us to do this morning if we will be able to get there is to also identify the characteristics of this beast. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Ben. I'm supposed to leave it here. I'm always putting it in my pocket. Thank God I don't carry home. I'm supposed to leave it here. Put in my pocket and then I leave it in the office. and then don't remember to bring it back now. So, so that's that's what we saying here that uh we we want to first look at this revelation chapter 4. Let's go there quickly. Let's go there quickly. I'm uh Revelation chapter 4. After this, after what? Revelation chapter 4 starts with after this. Meaning what? &gt;&gt; After the church ages. &gt;&gt; We talk a whole series talking about after this from Genesis after this and after that after this is uh is your word is is uh is your message. This is your message. This is the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; When we talk about the message of the hour, this is what the message of the hour is. After this, after the church ages, I looked and behold a door was open in heaven. Jesus identified himself as the door. So a door open in heaven is a further revelation of Jesus Christ. In the church ages, we we have seen the revelation of Jesus Christ in every age. Now after the church ages, there is a further revelation of Jesus Christ. That's the reason why we can't just settle down for water baptism in Jesus name &gt;&gt; as as the revelation of Jesus Christ. There is more of revelation of Jesus Christ that will be revealed in the millennium. There is more that will be revealed at the white throne judgment and all. So here we see that a door was open in heaven. And the first voice which I heard was as it were a trumpet talking with me which said come up heaven. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I will show thee things which must be here after. So this come up higher has been typed as the rapture. We can compare it to the rapture. But in this sense, it is not the rapture. It is calling us into a higher walk with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where we step out of the place of just being satisfied being the church member. I'm in the rapture. You are having a personal revelation relationship with Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. You are not you are not tied down to to to to one assembly. You can be a son of God. Even if they carry you to the bottom part of hell, you can still be a son of God. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; So immediately I was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and and and one sat and one sat on the throne and he that sat on the throne was was uh to look upon as a jasper and satin stones. And there was a rainbow around around the throne in a sight like onto an emerald. Now I could I could really be doing too much of reading this morning that I don't want to do. So I think if we drop down a little bit, Amen. if we drop down a little bit because when I keep reading I would keep making comment which of course is all part of what I want to say but uh let's go down a little bit now so you see here when you when you drop down to uh revelation 6:6 but let's let's identify our scene where is this taking place now all that you that we are seeing where is it taking place praise the lord &gt;&gt; what is God identifying what is it take what is taking place where is it taking place &gt;&gt; yeah heaven that's but another another another thing you can we can say when you look in the reading where is it taking place around the throne &gt;&gt; around the throne that's the picture I want you to grab around the throne amen why the picture is is is important is because of this verse six And before the throne there was a seed of glass like a crystal and and in the midst of the throne and around about the throne were four beasts full of eyes before and behind. Praise the Lord. Put our picture up again, Emmanuel. So So you see here now we we we trying to find the characteristics of these four beasts. We're trying to find to really to be able to identify them these four beasts over and over as we will look at it here we will see that they are around the truth. So their influence is coming from where? &gt;&gt; From the throne. So they might not have a physical rather upon them, but because they are around the throne, so we can seize that &gt;&gt; their rather is not on them. Their rather is in them. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Their rather is in them. And these ones they rather it's on them where in on is just I'm just creating pictures in your mind. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm creating pictures in your mind. And uh and uh and the Bible would let us know here verse seven. And the first beast was like a lion. Put the picture up, Emmanuel. Keep the picture up for now. The first beast was a lion. Amen. And the second beast was a cuff. And the third was the face of a man. &gt;&gt; And uh and uh uh and the fourth beast was a flying eagle. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; They were around the throne. And now if you trust him all through revelation, you will see that they are always around the throne. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Revelation 5 verse 6. Keep my picture up. Don't don't move it. Revelation 5:6. Uh uh uh and I beheld and and Lord in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders to Elam that was slain having seven seven horns and seven eyes which are the spirit of God sent forth throughout all the earth. So you see they are around the throne. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 5 verse 8. And when he have taken the book, the four beasts and the 24 others. So when the when the seals were open, when he took the book, the four beasts and the 24 elders, the Bible says what year? Oh, I love this. 24 elders fell down before the lamb having everyone hops and golden v of the sins of the prayer. So you see here that you always see that they are always in the attitude of worship. &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 19 you will see that uh uh uh you'll see yeah you'll see that the Bible says they are they are they are giving judgment also. But what we want to identify this so we can keep them in our mind because if not we will we will we will we will confuse this beast with this beast. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. So if uh if we talk about the lion and we we talk about the beast and the rider then we can be able to tell that uh there is one that is riding upon the lion. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There is one that is riding upon the lion. Now you will you will see here that uh uh uh Jesus said the word that I said unto you they are life and they are spirit. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So if you take that in principle you will realize that uh uh uh worse is the vehicle that carries spirits. &gt;&gt; Amen. Worse is the vehicle &gt;&gt; that carries spirit. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Isaiah said there is no weapon &gt;&gt; formed against you shall prosper. &gt;&gt; And what did he say next? &gt;&gt; No tongue. &gt;&gt; When he talks about weapon, the next thing he talks about no tongue. Because tongue was the first weapon that was used. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Tongue was the first weapon that was used. &gt;&gt; And when that lie was told, it carried a spirit that troubled Eve and took her away from the word. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Eve and Adam came right from the hands of God. You and myself, we are born in sin. &gt;&gt; So we are more subject to be influenced by words more than Eve. We are more subject to be influenced by words more than Eve. She came right from the hands of God. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are you getting the picture? &gt;&gt; Amen. Because the reason why I'm I'm saying that is because these guys are all vehicle. These ones also are all vehicles. Amen. &gt;&gt; They are all vehicles. They are carrying the power and the power that they are carrying uh they are also carrying spirit. They are also carrying words. We're going to see it as we as we go along as we go along. But I'm just trying to to uh uh uh you know uh uh get a get get us to a good to a good place here. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So we realize that these guys from the place at the time they were identified. So even even if we if we go back to Ezekiel when when they were seen in in the book of Ezekiel, they was always before the throne. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; They were always before the throne. They were always is a is uh is uh is uh is an anointing is an atmosphere that is always before the throne before the word in worship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In worship. That's the reason why you cannot get one of these anointing from a theological school. &gt;&gt; No, you can't get it. It comes from the throne of God &gt;&gt; because it's always before the throne. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are we together? &gt;&gt; A truth representation of this will always bring people to worship. Amen. &gt;&gt; It will always bring people before the throne. It will it will bring the people to to deliverance. &gt;&gt; Two things they can do. Just like we will see in Revelation chapter 6, it exposes the evil one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It exposes the evil one. Come and see. I will tell you the mystery of this. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You love the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, so when when we look at this, we look at it like this uh uh when we look at it in this sense, you will see here that uh right from the beginning, that's what I want I want to labor on. That's what I want to do to be able to show you that right from the beginning when God created man in his image. The Bible says in the image of God created he him. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Man, the brother Brandon would tell us that man has always been God's agent. Man was created to be the vehicle of God that would bring God's presence to his creation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When God rested on the seventh day, we said that it was a mystery. Amen. Watch that seven is always a mystery. It was not a a physical rest. It was a spiritual rest. It was a change of dispensation. Almighty God, spirit God, the internal spirit has found a body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He has found a body that he was ready to dwell in. &gt;&gt; The internal spirit has made himself a vehicle. &gt;&gt; Man is God's vehicle. &gt;&gt; God now has a vehicle where he could run up the hills. &gt;&gt; He could come down the rivers. &gt;&gt; He had a vehicle. that he can do it in. &gt;&gt; Every beast must have a rather. That's where I'm going with this. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now, so it brings it brings it brings us it brings it in picture to us when you read Genesis 3 and the Bible says the sub the serpent was more subtile than any Bible readers, answer me, please. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, maybe brother Lawrence, come and leave songs. Let me go back in the office. Let the people get under the anointing and then I will come back again. Amen. &gt;&gt; Stop sleeping on me. The Bible says the serpent were more subtle than any &gt;&gt; any beast. Any beast? &gt;&gt; He was subtile than any beast. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. He was more subtle than any beast. So you see, yeah, the the the subtality of the serpent put him in a position that he could be the vehicle. Yeah. &gt;&gt; of Satan, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Why? Because he was the most closer. &gt;&gt; His subtality means that he was close. &gt;&gt; He was just like man. He was upright. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Is that not what the word says? &gt;&gt; That's what the word says. &gt;&gt; Because that's why God cursed him and say on your belly you will go. Because he was upright. So he was in a place where he could be the vehicle that God could use. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And that's the reason why God sent a message is to be able to get a bride that is a vehicle in this age what the spirit of God can do. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not people that will believe the message and sit down with denominational idea and people that will believe the message and we say carry our family spirit, our tribal spirit, our national spirit. No, no, no, no. This message has come to call a bride that will separate herself to be the final voice in the final age. And to be the final voice, you must be a vehicle. &gt;&gt; A people that can be able to run with the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Because whether whether we like it or not, whether we like it or not, you are not in a dealership. &gt;&gt; It's only a dealership that car said that nobody ride. &gt;&gt; You are not in the dealership. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; No, no, no. You have been driven. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; By one spirit or another. That's right. &gt;&gt; Whether you like it or not. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You have been driven. You You are driven &gt;&gt; by one spirit or another. You are not in a dealership. &gt;&gt; Just pack to be amay. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So the Bible says there the serpent was more subtit than any beast of the field. And uh so we see that uh God was riding in Adam and Eve and the serpent here got someone that he could ride in. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; So there he's he's riding Satan down is riding down in in the serpent and uh uh uh uh and then the serpent comes over here to Eve and he's challenging her on the word. &gt;&gt; They are in they are in a in a in in a fight of words. They are in a word battle that God really said God said God did real God really said God really didn't mean what he said God said and did God really said they are in a battle of words. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They were speaking the word and all he was trying to do is to find China into her reasoning. &gt;&gt; Brother Bam says uh there's a woman here standing before me. He says he's talking to her. He says, "All I'm trying to do is to just contact your spirit." &gt;&gt; When Jesus started talking to the woman at the word and he says uh you know uh uh uh this water and all of that, he taught us that all he was doing is to just contact the spirit of the woman. So Satan here also got Eve into a word game and all he was doing is to contact her spirit. Find the channel of reasoning. For God know that the day you eat of these things, you will be like him. &gt;&gt; And he sw that seed. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He sold that seed. Just that one seed brings the corruption of our body. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; No matter how how many times you bathe it in the day, it still smells. No matter how many time you feel it, it's still weak. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is the most lazy part of you. Go and build your muscles and do whatever you want. &gt;&gt; Whatever you what you need to carry those muscles is a willing spirit within. &gt;&gt; You can get muscles of 100 pound. If you don't have a willing spirit within, they will become so heavy for you. &gt;&gt; But it just took one word. It took one word of the devil &gt;&gt; to corrupt this flesh. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see where we going this morning? &gt;&gt; Are you interested? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you on board? &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. Let's give the Lord a hand of praise. It's not uh the usual preaching of uh running around. I'm trying to take my time. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, that's where I want to go go this morning. Uh uh uh as just just want to travel in that line to make us to see and and and Oh my God, I pray that the Lord help us this morning. Amen. And as as you look in the word, you will see that uh uh you know uh uh uh brother Brandham identified that uh let's let's look here. Let's read something from the prophet of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Let's read something from the prophet of God. About a people, but we love it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We love it. Trying to do God a service without it being the word of God. Let's let's look here and see. You see what he says here. The beast from the beginning. He was the beast at the Garden of Eden. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's the beast at the end. So if the beast if the beast at the beginning is the beast at the end then all he was doing was just changing forms. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was just changing form. When he finished using this body he drop it like a dead close and he move to the next one. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. But is it not the same thing that almighty God is doing? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It's the same thing he's doing. He used Abraham after the 100 years. He throw Abraham like a dead closed down. He pick up Isaac. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he used Isaac. It has to be God. That's why brother Brandham said, I read that to you. It was God in the characters of those Old Testament. That's why he said in Christ is the mystery of God revealed. &gt;&gt; So if the the beast at the beginning the beast from the beginning was the beast at the garden of Eden. Ezekiel come out and says uh that was in Eden the garden of God. He was speaking to a spirit that was in the the king of of of terror. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he's pointing he's speaking to that spirit and say you were in Eden. &gt;&gt; This arrogant spirit in you was in Eden. &gt;&gt; The garden of God, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; The beast from the beginning. He was the beast at the garden of Eden. He was the beast at the end. And show that he is a religious person. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; A denomination. &gt;&gt; What does that mean? &gt;&gt; A religious person. A denomination. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He love to make you to settle down &gt;&gt; for little. &gt;&gt; Come on now. just for some little experience, &gt;&gt; little sensation, &gt;&gt; little knowledge, &gt;&gt; as long as he can make you to settle down for that. &gt;&gt; Every denomination was once a move of God, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But they settled down. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; For later, instead of desiring more of God. &gt;&gt; Oh my my my. &gt;&gt; Are we together? He's a beast at the beginning and it shows that he's a religious person, a denomination that made a denomination and come right through the trail of age and uh and prove it to you by the scripture that it is. I didn't know that till the Holy Spirit gave it to me the other day. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is where he was talk trying to talk about uh preaching the trail of the serpent. The beast from the beginning is the same beast at the end. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, so that's where we are this morning. That's where we are people. I I I I want to remind us all this morning. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The word is not getting any better. We know that we are in the age as as we says over and over over and over the creation is waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God. That manifestation of the sons of God is going to be an incarnation of God in people on earth &gt;&gt; and at the same time that is taking place on the other side the devil is also incarnating his people on earth. I don't need to preach it till you go in the streets you will see it. There is just violence all over us. Human life now is just useless. It's just useless. It's just in the meaning in the meaning that take place. Oh wow. We jump over it. We forget that that life has been spilled on the ground. &gt;&gt; The house of men are just cruel, bitter, evil, savage. &gt;&gt; Why is it like that? Because there is a possession that is taking place on both end. God is possessing his people and the devil is also possessing his people. &gt;&gt; We have to be conscious &gt;&gt; of what spirit is riding this body &gt;&gt; in every action. That's that's what I must ask myself. &gt;&gt; What spirit is riding this body? Are we together now? So we see that. Oh, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We see the evil beast is the sin that's been riding from the beginning. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Riding from the beginning. The rider and the beast. That's what we talking about this morning. So, uh uh Oh, Jesus. Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, so we see here that um uh I was trying to I was trying to Okay. There there are things that as as you as you walk with the Lord, you you look in the word, you begin to see. Amen. When you look in the in the in the in the book of Job, you look in the book of Job, you will see that the last time brother Daily was here, he preached to us a lesson from Job. Beautiful. And uh uh and then after that, you know, we were home talking and I was sharing with him. I says I says, "Well, uh uh uh Job in the letter end says, I know my redeemer liveth." Amen. The Bible could says that the Lord restore everything that he lost. Because when you look in in Job beginning, you see the principle of restoration because there were four four times the evil men came to Job. &gt;&gt; In Job chapter one, it was the the the savings. That's they were the first. The next was the fire of God. the the the next one that came was the the uh I think the chariots and the fourth one were a great fire. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Now you see you see these things because uh uh just in one verse of this Bible could be the the lifetime of a man. &gt;&gt; Amen. Like John said, if everything was recorded, we would not have a book to carry. &gt;&gt; Right? So you see God put principles. &gt;&gt; There are principles he put in his word &gt;&gt; that if we can grab those principles, we can be able to unlock the supernatural, unlock the blessings, &gt;&gt; we can be able to unlock a channel to walk with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because he put principles here. &gt;&gt; So some of those principles I want us to look at uh as we talk about this. So you you you look at that you look at that because if you don't see it you have to see that it is this sin beast that make Joseph brothers to be jealous of him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He wrote upon them for them to get jealous. It is the same beast that been riding all through the history. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If I should get angry with you for no reason. Amen. Even if there is a reason, the word says the sun must not go down on my &gt;&gt; anger. Come on now. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But if I will have to cherish that to live with it, &gt;&gt; then there is a beast that is riding me. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Are we together? You see, because we we are in a spiritual warfare. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's that's the scripture I wanted to read. Put on the whole armor of God, but I keeping it for next Sunday. &gt;&gt; That's what I went over to to what I whatever I was reading now. So uh uh uh you know uh uh we are in a spiritual warfare. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are in a spiritual warfare. Brother Brand would tell us that this this battle that has been fought is between right and wrong. Is between health and sickness. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's between joy and sadness. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Good and bad. That's the battle that we are fighting. And just like I said, there is nobody that is neutral. &gt;&gt; There is nobody. You might not be fighting the battle that I'm fighting. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But you have your battle. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I like to say it this when we are all fighting the same enemy &gt;&gt; but from different fronts. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm asked to keep the east gate, you are told to keep the west. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's the same enemy. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; If I rejoice in your death, which mean the west gate is open &gt;&gt; and I might be dead soon. &gt;&gt; So what is the benefit of rejoicing in your death? What is the benefit? &gt;&gt; And rejoicing that you are conquered &gt;&gt; when I could be dead soon &gt;&gt; because now the territory is compromised. Nobody is protecting the west gate. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Because you supposed to be there and now you are conquer. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, so when you look at it, you'll see that it was the same enemy. God was just he was giving us a picture how the same beast tried to destroy the life of this man called Job. &gt;&gt; Of this man that had the fear of God in his generation, a man that that assumed evil. He tried to to to to to destroy everything around him. It just it was just the same piece &gt;&gt; moving from one to another. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You look at the picture, you read it in the Bible, it just you know, it just it looks so horrible. It's not a fairy tale. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's not a fairy tale. Because because it comes from one verse to another. The Bible talks and and and and another and another seven came. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And another seven came and said, Job, we were we were doing this and the fire and another seven. Because we read it like that, &gt;&gt; we don't see the time spans between the verses. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't see the time span. Could all of that happen in one day? Yes, of course it can happen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; A whole village and and everybody that was in a village were burned in one day. It can happen where there time spent between it that also possible. But what I'm saying is that uh just a few verses must not take the reality. It must not make us to lost the principle &gt;&gt; the principle of the sin beast just changing his form moving from one evil to another. What what did Jesus says? The devil comes to do what? Steal, kill, and destroy. It's the same devil. He's the one that is stealing. He's the one that is killing. He's the one that is destroying. &gt;&gt; He's the same. It's the principle right there. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, so when you look at that, you look at that, you realize here that the All glory be to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Man, I'm feeling so good. I feel like speaking in tongues. I just say, Lord, pour your spirit upon me. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Pour your spirit upon me. Now, you look in you look in the book of Job. Uh just just just be there. Don't don't uh don't don't worry about it. I just want to uh the Lord speak to Satan here and verse 13. There were just things I was things I was looking at this morning. A lot of numbers were just playing in my head. I said no, I don't want to go that route. Uh or else I will bore the people. Verse 13. And there was a day when the sons and the daughters his sons and his daughter were eating and drinking wine in their other brother's house. And there came a messenger uh uh unto Job and said the uh the oxen were plowed in the ashes were feeding himself and and the sabers fell upon them and took them away. Yeah. They they slain all your servants with the ash of the sword and I and I alone I'm escaped alone to tell thee. Now, so if you look at that, you see at every at every at every uh uh attack of the enemy, one person escape. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; At every attack of the enemy, one person. It's just a principle that God is putting in his word. &gt;&gt; That no matter what happen, he will always have a witness. &gt;&gt; It's a principle of witness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It might not definitely mean only one person survive. It just a principle of witness &gt;&gt; that God will always have a witness. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you see the uh is is is the same beast this beast that is riding you know uh and and and and uh uh we we can look at the picture from God's side also. It is God that is proving his seven job. He say he's my man. He's my boy. He's my son. He's my you know my person in this age. Uh he's not going no matter what the trial is. He's not going to to to to turn his back on me. Amen. He's not going to curse me. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Job never knew anything about it. But I'm just trying to show you the principle here. The same beast that is writing. The reason why I came up to this is because brother B would tell us in the book of Joy the Palmer wound, the kanga wound, the caterpillar and the locust. He said it was just the same beast that was changing forms. &gt;&gt; It was just the same beast that was changing form. And then when we read that the beast from the beginning is the beast in the end. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It's the same beast. So all through the ages, all through the ages, everything that God's people have gone through is the devil taking on the form riding against their family or riding on their family, riding on their tribe, riding on the enemy to come against them. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And in the same way also, it was God that wake up a young man like Shem guy. He was not even trained. He got so fed up. The spirit of the Lord came upon him. He said, "Over my dead body, I'm I'm done. These guys got to kill me before they will ever get to my children." Amen. It was the spirit of God that came on him. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Gideon was so afraid. I mean, he the Bible say he was so afraid. I mean, he was so scared and and and and then an an angel met him and scared him to death. The angel said, "Oh mighty man of villain." He thought the angel was talking to somebody else, me. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Because in him, he knew his person of struggle. In him, he knew his person of fear. Praise the Lord. But but honor that person of struggle and fear. God knows what he have put in Gideon for the day that Gideon was in to be able to to stand for God's word in that day. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Gideon is is is is tempting the angel. Okay, let let the de fall. Okay, let that no be due. And all of these things as he's doing that, God is also using that to build courage in him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The beast and the rider. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Job trial came in in uh in in four. So we can say that Job experienced the Palmer womb. He experienced the canker womb. He experienced the caterpillar. He experienced the locust. We can say that Job had the first horse rather. He had a second horse rather. He had a tear horse rather. &gt;&gt; We had You see, so in the book of Revelation, it comes out with this description, but it does not change what it was in the beginning. &gt;&gt; Are you seeing the picture? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. I will even carry you. I will carry you a little bit here also and show you in our father Abraham. He was uh God's chosen man of that day. But he was born in sin. But he came from parents that were worshiping idols in Babylon. But so Abraham in his heart he had a call from God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He had a call he did not fully understood but he was following it in fact but yet his physical body is struggling because we see in the word yet that he had a lying a lying habit. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He had a lying habit that was battering him. tell his wife, you know, tell tell uh uh uh the the king that you my sister. &gt;&gt; Now, let me show you also now how those spirit right in the generation that seen lying have a god on Isaac. &gt;&gt; It rode on him when it got on Jacob, it was worse &gt;&gt; because he became a deceiver. The sin lie have a god on Joseph &gt;&gt; and it broke his record &gt;&gt; of being a perfect type of Jesus. &gt;&gt; He could have been completely like Jesus but because he told a lie. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. So you see what I'm bringing out in this is that uh uh uh you have to remember Christ is revealing his own word. Brother Brandham says the devil has an error in your life he has the right to punish. &gt;&gt; And until that place is covered he will punch it. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when and and and when that punch is there or when that habit is there and a person do not identify it to take it to Calvary, that beast will ride on you and go to your next generation. It will ride on it and go to the next generation. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Just talking about the beast and the rather look at David. Let me give you a an example here with David. David here was uh you know he was trapped in this adultery. He lost led him to adultery. To really cover it up he killed a man. &gt;&gt; He had a blood on his hands. &gt;&gt; That's how deadly sin is. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Sometimes it has to produce death before people come to themsel and realize that this thing is killing it. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Think about it this way. What if David did this and he ran straight to Nathan and said, "Natan, oh my God, Nathan, see what I've got myself in with all that God has blessed me with. See what I got myself in." Praise the Lord. He might have redeemed himself. &gt;&gt; He might have redeemed himself, but no, he never h went to Nathan. He was covering the scene. Send Urias to the front of the battle. &gt;&gt; Oh, I don't want anybody to see me now. I'm I'm resting. He was doing everything to cover the wrong that he was doing. And as he cover it, that thing was breathing within. Amen. &gt;&gt; It was breeding within and you see what will happen there. Nathan, God had to re reveal David weakness to Nathan and and and and and Nathan came to meet David and David they full of guilt. The man that have done this the man must die. &gt;&gt; Why should it reach to death before we want to make our life right? Why should we wait for dying bed when we have all the time to get ourself ready? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now we're just talking about the beast and the rather but you see that spirit rode on David. If he will have run to Nathan, maybe he will have got God's mercy. Maybe even though when Nathan came he says the man must die, God still gave him grace &gt;&gt; and said no the David you will not die. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But the sword will not leave your house. &gt;&gt; The thing you did in secret will be done publicly. &gt;&gt; So what happened? We read that in the in the in the in the Bible. The Bible talks about Anna, David's son. He took Tema, his own sister, and ripped her. &gt;&gt; It was the progression of that evil, &gt;&gt; that spirit of lust that took David into adultery and and and and and and murder is now making him to do this. And what happened? Terma was a sister to Abselon. &gt;&gt; Abselon got enraged of that &gt;&gt; and what he did he killed his own brother and they did not stop him there. He decided I would take over the throne. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; When it start riding, it can start riding very innocent. &gt;&gt; In the first age, it was a white house. Everybody thought it was it was Christ. &gt;&gt; Until the prophet came on the scene and told us he has a bow, he does not have an arrow. &gt;&gt; That would not be Christ. &gt;&gt; It sounded very innocent. And I said is costing the life of his children, is causing the life of his house, of his kingdom, of his church. Praise the Lord. Abselum killed his brother Anna and uh he decided to take over the kingdom and he was not satisfied. He took his father's concuban on top of the roof of the house. He abused every one of them. What was done in secret came to an open. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Bible says if we confess our sin, God will forgive us. &gt;&gt; If we cover it, we will not prosper. &gt;&gt; There is nothing you can do &gt;&gt; to get away from it &gt;&gt; because it's a beast that is riding &gt;&gt; and it's intention. His final end is death. That's what that was what the pill house was called death. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All that when you talk we talk about Absel so sorryful but even the one h Solomon &gt;&gt; that was visited by God in dream because David never sought sought mercy. He didn't run to God quickly. Now Solomon end up now to be this guy &gt;&gt; trying to protect the kingdom. &gt;&gt; He end up in the worst of all until many wives took his heart away from the Lord. &gt;&gt; Maybe he thought that well I mean I'm not I'm not committing adultery. I'm marrying them. But as they are coming they bringing their idols. &gt;&gt; Amen. as they coming, they breaking their idols. &gt;&gt; Am I making sense to you? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we Are we Are we getting somewhere with this? &gt;&gt; Because I mean, I can go right into the church ages and use the church age book and tell you about the writers and never bring it home. I can leave it in history &gt;&gt; and never bring it home. What I'm trying to do is to show you that that rather that road in history. He's writing this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's writing this morning. I believe he wrote you here h waking up this morning with a consciousness to worship the Lord. He wrote you in the presence of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But don't stop with good shepherd. &gt;&gt; Go beyond good shepherd. &gt;&gt; Go into his presence. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because there is an open door. &gt;&gt; Go into his presence. &gt;&gt; Go into a further revelation of Jesus Christ, the beast and the rather. I read something to you. Uh uh uh someone sent me uh no they didn't send it to me. I think I was looking at all of these uh uh quotes online and I just listening to it came up on my phone and it blessed my heart and I decided okay I'm going to I'm going to meditate on this. I will also take this and add it to my notes. So I read it to you before we close this morning. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; See what brother Brandon said here in testing for life. See what he says here. He says if God's spirit is in you and uh you see God word fulfilled, it will make you rejoice. Something has to move. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Something has to move. Something has to move. Something has to move you. &gt;&gt; Okay. See, see the way he connect this. Now when Jesus came into the city, he said if they will hold their peace, the rock will immediately cry out. Something has to move when the spirit of God comes riding in. &gt;&gt; Amen. Something has to move. Why? Because you are just a vehicle. &gt;&gt; When you receive the word, then it moves you. &gt;&gt; It moves you in the path of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. When the spirit of God comes riding in, something has to move. So the prophet of God saying here when we see God's word being fulfilled when we see God's word identifying the promise to us it rejoice. Is that not why Jesus told the disciples don't rejoice in all of this healing? Rejoice because your name is in the &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh God give us a church that rejoice in the promises. Give us a church that rejoice in the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not the people that are entertained by the word and people that rejoice in the word. &gt;&gt; When you rejoice in the word, you know how to say amen. You say, "Thank you, Jesus." You say, "Lord, that's a promise for me." &gt;&gt; You are rejoicing in the word. &gt;&gt; You're not just sitting there to be entertained. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says something has to move. When the spirit of God comes riding in, &gt;&gt; something has to move. Something has to move. &gt;&gt; A willing vessel has to move. A body that is surrendered has to move. A one that is waiting on God has to move. &gt;&gt; A heart that is saying, "Lord, here I am," has to move. &gt;&gt; A heart that is saying, "Do something in me." &gt;&gt; Has to move. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; Oh my. You love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's give the Lord a hand of praise. Let's praise him together. Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Blessed be your name. Thank you, Father. Thank you, Lord. We love you. We appreciate you. Yes. Yes. Something has to move and the spirit of God comes in. &gt;&gt; We can stay. We can still We can stay like that. &gt;&gt; Amen. A drive that drive a rock of Aaron. It a it a it bouncy in the presence of God. It putful leaves. &gt;&gt; How much more about us with blood and sinners in our body and the Lord of &gt;&gt; you can stay &gt;&gt; and in the presence of God like that when the spirit of God comes in something has to move. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The spirit of God comes in and and and it moves upon a person and they stand and still and shout. Everybody look at him. Oh wow. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's either your own or vehicle is so loaded &gt;&gt; that it can't move at the word of God. &gt;&gt; So when someone is rejoicing in the word, it looks like they're making noise. So, like I said, I I I was listening there and and and uh I decided I said, "Well, this is a good code. I will just keep it." I said, "I will keep it. I'm just looking for a good time to use it. I thought I would use it on a prayer meeting, but while I was sitting in the office there and just putting my notes together before I sent it, I came I I look in there, I saw it again. I said, "Well, okay. I just throw this one in. If uh if we have time to read it, then we will read it. So, we read that and then we bring our our subject to a close this morning and uh trust to see how the Lord will help us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen to brother Brandon. Now, this is from the message influence. So, you will hear a lot of use here in Isaiah. He says here, see, you must be able to stand and take correction. Some of them won't do it. I have went to meeting and I have sat down in an auditorium and uh and you get up and some people come in and they sit down just for a few minute. If you say one word that they don't agree with brother Brandon snap his finger gone see flying up. Well that you know what happened to to to Hezekiah or Yuzia rather God smought him with leprosy. The man died in his leprosy which is a type of sin. He couldn't stand to be corrected by the word. And many times today uh uh it is the same thing. They say well my denomination believe this I don't care. See take time and search the word. God God will never judge the word by a denomination. He will judge it by his word. Amen. &gt;&gt; And his word is Christ. And Christ is his word. He is the same yesterday, today and forever. Hebrew 13:8. Instead of trying to take correction, they fly loose. They can't stand it. Amen. I really I really want wanted to use this uh uh uh next week for my talk to be able to bring to you because uh uh uh it's going to be like like a like a correction, but also it's just going to be uh uh me just spilling out my heart to you a little bit so you can know where this guy that is standing before you, you can know where he is. Amen. But we have the opportunity to read it here now. That's exactly what Yuzia done. A good man, you said, "Well, that person, Yuzia was a good person, too. A fine person, a God blessed man. But no matter what it was, he must always stay in his place because God gave him the opportunity to influence other by being a righteous king." uh but a priest, not a priest. Sorry, not a priest. And uh and the word forbid him to do that. So he went in and was and was going to offer and and and when you see that's that's sometimes that's when the projection is good because I could be reading something completely different and uh uh and and not making sense to you, but at least you are following. Amen. So that's good. I appreciate that. The word forbid him to do that. So, and uh and when he was called, the word was given to him that he wasn't supposed to do that thing. Musicians, you can come, you can come closely. That God has blessed him in his business in whatever he was, but not to try to take this priest office. He He was out of the word. He was he was going to do it anyhow no matter what anyone says. Now isn't there the attitude of too many people today? They won't take correction of the word and that is the reason we find ourself wrapped up wrapped up in a big council of churches here not knowing where we are going heading into the word. Now when I read this you you remember now I'm reading this I'm applying it to our local assembly. Amen. I'm applying it to myself and I'm reading this and brother Brandon says we will not take correction. He says and that is the reason why we find ourself wrapped up in a council. Now you might not be in a council of churches but in another sense if you take this thought you can see that if we are not following the correction of God's word it's easy for us to get wrapped up in something &gt;&gt; wrapped up in a religious spirit. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Or you might say well I don't believe the council of churches is of the devil. The council of churches is mark of the beast. You know I believe brother Brandma as a prophet. I believe the message of the hour. you know uh uh but I want you to be able to see this. The word must be able to speak to you even when you are reading it on your bed. I will tell you something. I was I I was just sharing that uh uh uh with the brothers the other day uh uh uh uh sitting there with some brothers and I was I was reading just this few days. I was lying on my bed and I was thinking about preaching the message on discouragement. I was just lying there, Lord. I said, "Father, you know how I'm feeling in my heart, you know, I'm and I'm lying there." So I said, "Well, okay, let me just take some quotes of brother Brandham on discouragement." So I put in discouragement. The first quote I read, Brother Brandham says, "With all that God has done for us through this age that we will still be discouraged." I said, "Oh God, you know where my heart is. You can't meet me right on this bed. I'm looking for co to come and fire these people up. The Lord said, "Well, you need it. I'm going to give it to you without much that I've done for you." And you would mind people adding to you and be discouraged. God forbid. &gt;&gt; God forbid. &gt;&gt; God forbid. [Music] I rather die with my boots on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I rather die with my boots on. He met me as a young man, &gt;&gt; a young preacher. Praise the Lord. I rather die with my boots on. Let me not go in that direction. Isn't that the attitude of many people? They won't take correction of the word. And that is the reason we find ourselves wrapped up in a big council of churches here not knowing where to go heading into the word. Tens of thousands of members added every year. They don't see the hand of God anywhere moving. [Music] So, you know, just thinking about all of them, you know, as I'm meditating and studying, I'm telling myself, I says, "Lord, uh, you know, sometimes It looks like we we we crave for a growing church. But I think we must crave to grow in the word, to grow in his presence, to be able to walk in the church and feel the presence of God, which of course God have dealt with us time and time again. But I think something is going wrong. I don't know what it is. [Music] Tens of thousands of member out there every year and we don't even see the hand of God anywhere moving dead former just exactly what the Bible says they will be laudes church is a lukewarm spilled from the mouth of God Christ is outside trying to get in the church inside won't let him in set the picture of today. Exactly. Because men doesn't understand that their position comes from the word, the word of God. We are only in position when we are standing with the word. You can be standing for whatever you are standing for. If you're not standing for the word, you are out of place. You are upside down. [Music] And thought he was taken that he now remember we call him today a Christian that God has blessed. He wasn't just the same ordinary man. He was a man that was blessed by God. But he did not want to stand correction no matter how much the word says it was. So he didn't want to understand that because he felt secure enough that God will let him get by with something else. A little place of complacency. A little place of a sense of enough because there's no way we can compare our past with where we are now. And that's what the matter with our people today around the world that they think that God will let them get by with something contrary to his word. He will never do it. We must come back to correction instinct correction by the word. And because of his arrogant way he acted, he pay no attention to what what this minister had to say, he would do what he wanted to do. Just think now just stop that. Just stop that in your mind a minute and see what brother Brandon says here. How can a child face his father and mother that's godly? How could a teenager look in the face of their golly mother with her hair turning gray and say to this teenager, "Honey, mother has raised you different." You see, and you see back down through the life was was done for mother. Don't do that and turn arrogant and say, "Take your religion and go. I will do whatever I want. May that spirit never come on our children. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because brother Brandham said, "God will never allow you to walk on the righteous prayers of your parents." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I never went searching for this. I didn't go searching for it to make it part of my notes. all these YouTube things that can come on YouTube. It just came on my phone with with brother Brandon voice and I was just listening to it uh at work meditating on. So I didn't go search for it. So don't tell me it's because of you. I just felt like I could use this on the prayer meeting, use this for the service. And if you if you think that it's because of you, then it's because of you. [Music] Brother Bam says how can a child in the face of a father or a mother or you see it is the spirit those spirits are all in the schools of the children they go there they see the they they see the arrogant mix that is there they see the way that other children behave even though they would not behave but if a child is insulting and becoming arrogant to a teacher is a spirit that could just bread. Especially when the children sit down and they enjoy it, you have taken that spirit. And then pretty soon you can come home and start to do the same thing to your mother. Do the same thing to your dad. [Music] Don't do that. and you turn arrogant and say take your religion gone I will do what what I want what an outcome of that teenager what happened to them is gone they are lost spiritually morally many times physically and mentally that's what is happening to our generation when young people feel that uh they are suppressed by the message of the power they can't enjoy. There is no fun. They are not enjoying everything. You see, we we have we have a responsibility to make this word come alive to to the young people. Do something. [Music] We talk at the young few that went out for the camp. I mean, they blew their mind. They enjoy. They want to go back again. [Music] Some of us all we do we just work and work and work and work and work. Sometime change your environment. Look for the convention to go take your children out. Let them let them be exposed to this big message community. They will make friends. [Music] They will see other young people that dealing with the same thing that they are dealing with. [Music] But say just that one behavior, just that one misbehavior, one arrogant behavior, that child could be lost spiritually, mentally, physically. [Music] Sometimes it's easy. [Music] These thy will supply my needs [Music] and for now. Oh Lord our humble. [Music] Oh [Music] holy ghost revival comes from me. [Music] And us every Bible study your word in the thread. [Music] I will supply our need for blessed th Oh Lord Ie. Let's sing that again. Holy Ghost. has holy [Music] ghost [Music] revival comes from. Thank you Lord. Thank you Jesus. Send us a revival. [Music] and good work keeping. Please Jesus th forgive me. Yes Lord I pray &gt;&gt; thou will supply our name. [Music] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads together. There's a lot of things that we talk about this morning, dealing with spirits, rebuking spirits. I want us to just pray together this morning. And uh uh if there's a place that the word convicts you, put it under the blood. If there's a place, if you don't feel nothing, then pray for somebody. Pray for a young person, pray for your children, pray for your wife, pray for your husband. We want to be standing with the word. May God just be merciful. I want to say, Lord, I'm the one standing in the need of prayer. I'm the one needing you this morning. Oh God, Father. You are the King of glory. You are the God Almighty. Lord, we see that we are in the evil days. We see the evil days upon us, Lord. We see oh God all the things that are happening around us Lord Jesus. Father we even see our own weaknesses and laziness oh God. Father we see our own backsliding. Oh God father Lord I pray oh God father Lord that there is under the sound of my voice that don't see their own backsliding that don't see where they need you Lord. Oh God, we all are coming just like Isaiah this morning and saying, "Oh God, who is me? Father, Lord, oh precious Lord Jesus, for God I'm undone." He said, "I'm a man of unclean lips." Maybe there is some of unclean thoughts, unclean desire, unclean habits. Lord, oh father, unclean words, almighty God, I pray, Lord Jesus. Oh father, Lord God. Oh let let the Holy Ghost Lord Jesus let the blessed Holy Spirit Lord God. Father Lord that have rolled upon all the saints throughout the ages Lord. The Holy Ghost that rode upon the believers. Oh Father God. Oh may that Holy Ghost ride upon the bride this morning Lord. Oh Father God Lord Jesus we identify our rather Lord. We can identify our rather Lord God. He's truth. He's faithful. Lord God, Father, we can identify our rider, Lord. He's the alpha and the omega, Lord. We can identify our rider. His name is Jesus Christ. He is the word of God. He's the spirit of the living God. He is the bride rider. That's the one that is riding on the bride. He's the one riding on the truth church. We can identify our rather is not a religious spirit. Our rather, Father God, Lord, is not even brother Brandon. No God, father, Lord, I would rather is the Holy Ghost. I would rather is Jesus Christ because this is Christ in bride form. That's what the bride is. That's the rapturing material. Oh father, we pray.
