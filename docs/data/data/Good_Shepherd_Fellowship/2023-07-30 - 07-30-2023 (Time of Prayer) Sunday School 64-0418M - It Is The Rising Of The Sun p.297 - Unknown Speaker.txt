old yeah that morning the quickening power comes hey let me look over the curtains I've seen all of you over there he said oh and she ever loved and all loved you they'll give to you I've seen them all over there like what was it quickly John the Revelator was still full of quickly power and stood up and seen the ends from the beginning Isaiah was full of quick the Millennium and all quickening powder if the spirit that raised up Christ or the dead dwelling you yeah mortal body remember they're quickly power look what we see in this day the quick new power has come to us the open Seven Seals what was that the intelligence of a man no the quickly power of God the quickening power of God foretold this would take place quickly power God made the world testify to it it's the truth the age of the Lord but told you was around that pillar Fox quickening power let the world testify that is the truth and in that she didn't know what it was and we you just look this way it is our Lord he is the one who opened those seals he is those sealed for the whole word of God is Christ and Christ is the seal that was opened one is opening of Steel Man revealing Christ and the Very seven angels which represent the seven churches all completed and we couldn't even see it they didn't they took the picture Supreme judge showing that he's Alpha and Omega the beginning what identification greatly power did that to us great the power let the sea is coming christian powers that's just some deaths alive quickly powered gives discernment to know what's wrong with him what to do what you have done and what you ought not have done what you should have done and what you will be creating power all these things our lord Jesus is the poor quickly power he was all of it together he is so full of quickly power he said this you destroy this body and I'll raise it up in three days talk about confidence and quickness destroy this body and I'll read this Temple and I'll bring it up in three days why why do you say that he knew that it was written of him see it is written in by the word of God which could not fail the word says I will not suffer my holy one because to see corruption neither will our lead be soul in hell and he knows that quickness power would raise him up that there wouldn't be one fell corrupt he said you destroy this Temple I'll bring it back again in three days why he was prophecy the word of God and prophecy if it's true word of God cannot fail in the same prophecy and word of God that says raise him up as that we're already raised with him the word set feared up it is written that's the spirit that is now within him now in us also quickens our moral body Paradise friends the s-o-n is up it's not enough now look at Transfiguration with everyone represented there there was the living saints that raptured that was Elijah then and there and there stood Moses the dead Saints repre it also pulled them had quickly power while the one died and the other didn't die they're all there notice oh look what we're now seeing in these thy States the same thing as he promised John 14 12. now look people say you came to have power no no we're just like to have it non-transfiguration see certainly we do our plain power what we like like they was on the now Transfiguration they wasn't saying more would you say serious do I am in a disciples that's you I am to who I am you know what happened notice they've seen Jesus glorified that's all they want to see represented Jesus glorified and so into today we all try to be some big person we don't care what the people say about us our name ain't nothing it's his name our life is nothing to see his life it's his power not our power and there's only one thing that we love to do is see him glorified how can it be when he's glorified in Us by his resurrection it's in US we see him represented again as he was today did you get that see our desire is not to be glorified our desire is not something any our desire is not through some church or make more than a Sunday school or try to bring in all ties push in offer a picnic party or bring Stars buttons or something else like that that's not our design our desire is to see him glorified Glory by what not with self-pride but in us our lives to prove he is alive and living in us if I can get myself out of the way oh and William Branham not even thought of and you're not even thought of so we can see Jesus glorified among us see him that's our desire that's the quick gives us a quickie time and it gives us joy to know that we are with him for flesh and bone of him being the Bride of him we are Redeemed by him and now risen with him that's what Easter means to the people risen with him notice now we have his spirit in us the abstract D fully paid oh you don't say well I hope I make it you've already made it amen ah we'll make it up already he made it for me not me him self I don't care what she says Eric he made it for me that's all I don't really care about I just I just want to see him manifested how can you do it calm him down no he's in you okay he's in you well then Lord if I get myself out of the way you can manifest myself how can you do it because you are named itself all that the father has given me will come notice Glory with all that evidence which is not for you or I think of that song along that Resurrection morning that's card will be broken we shall rise Hallelujah we shall rise you believe that we shall run in him we become part of him the Easter the revealed Secret Of God like it was then of life after death we are now alive who were once dead and sin of trespasses the true Easter seal has broke death from around him and I'm alive the Easter seal at the beginning broke the Seal of the Roman seal the Easter seal that he was sealed up and man when they died but gone but he broke the steel and revealed the secret and now God by his holy spirit has broke the steel from around our lives and Christ is revealed as he lives in heaven for now we are quick and with the page anchor page we shall rise Hallelujah amen all that Resurrection morning Lords are broken we shall rise Hallelujah oh aren't you glad I'm so glad way back down under little old cold shed one morning the seals were broken and I'll raise him a new creature at his quickening power Sun's Up on gold I told a story about a
