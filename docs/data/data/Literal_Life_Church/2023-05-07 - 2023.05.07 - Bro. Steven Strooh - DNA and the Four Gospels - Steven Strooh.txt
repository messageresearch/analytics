========================================

no will they didn't want to hear me sing those who know me understand no further explanation needed um good morning everyone brother Matthew Lightner how long has it been oh my goodness it's so wonderful to see you and when I see your your girl singing I'm like that's incredible I just can't uh I can hardly uh believe the the the the way time has has advanced and oh my that smile sister Divi oh yeah I was clocking that all the way from over there so congratulations uh um to to the family that's uh that's awesome um now I'm probably leaving out people that are should be saying hi to it God bless you all and I am a little nervous why is that ah sure shouldn't be but it's uh Phil at home so thank you so much and uh I really appreciated the song leading uh uh brother Joe um those are my kind of songs I love that and brother Michael a last minute uh thank you did you enjoy that song I've got the life of God and me you can see who I wanted to sing it right the the the DNA that's the the the the the Natural Life the human life so we're going to touch on that a little bit uh today and just um FYI this is part of a pretty lengthy series and um I intend to do the whole series today huh nah um I I promise that I won't do that um I can't promise much else but I can promise that so um I uh yes so just to fill in what brother Paul mentioned um our house listed um yesterday in in Des Moines we had the photos taken on on Thursday and it's been a hectic miserable couple of months getting the place cleaned out um you know for photos and for for viewing um so yeah pray pray for us uh Kathy's really not doing well with some uh joint hip problems and so forth quite a bit of pain and so please remember her in prayer as well um obviously um you know made worse by all the activities of this past few weeks um the we were very very fortunate we got some good help to come and assist and so that was that was nice um um but yeah it's going to be a trying couple of couple of weeks um and one of the things that just happened this morning that is a little bit trying is the house listed yesterday and I sent a message to the uh the agent that's working with us very reputable guy and can highly recommended by some friends and I said um and he said something about I don't remember and I said no viewings on Sunday leave us alone on Sunday and that especially goes for tomorrow because I'm not there Kathy's not well I gave him the reasons and I said you know let's start on Monday because yes they they we hope there will be a fair demand so I get an email a few minutes ago is three o'clock today going to work for you I didn't even bother to reply so so anyway um so these are the kind of challenges that we're going to face um going forward so we'll really appreciate your prayers and if anybody hears of a of a double wide going in intoledo area let us know uh Kathy's not going to settle for that I can assure you um but if you do hear of a property that you think we might be interested in please please let us know um it's very very difficult to find suitable properties in this area there was one I was going to look at this afternoon and they got an offer yesterday which is how it goes they've only listed on Thursday I think or Wednesday so if things are going very quickly um and then also had a bit of difficulty getting what they call a pre-qual or something and that was a little bit of a challenge because as you know I'm self-employed now and they don't really like that so we'll be uh earnestly coveting your prayers on a whole range of topics so please don't feel that you have to limit it to the Sweet Hour of Prayer you can go a little bit longer so I uh I I know there's there's a lot of prayer going on at the moment and I thank those who are already praying and then of course I can't neglect to mention um brother Solomon wow there's a step and I can congratulate you brother because the you know you you you have the taste uh in this uh setup sister Lily hmm But congratulations uh really uh it's a delight to to see and that's another one that are you know watched growing up so it's fun so we're ready for the word of God this morning let's stand and uh let's approach his throne I so much enjoyed the song of its just a little emotional the Lamb of God thanks brother Chuck all right let's open our bubbles turn to First Timothy chapter 3 verse 16. and you you all know that sometimes uh the way these Bible verses were constructed obviously that's not you know they didn't write the verses this way but uh that's how um they organized it to make it easier uh to read and to reference and so forth but the three sixteens are quite amazing in scripture you obviously John 3 16 but when you come across a 360 pay a little bit more attention to it because there could be something really you know interesting because it's 360 14 7. that's another one 714 that's another one you can see you know um uh in the in it shall be light in the evening time that's fourteen seven you know so these uh these verses um somehow were inspired the way they they're built so whenever I see a 316 my eye sort of just stops and okay you know it's like somebody's saying pay attention uh so um this is one of those and without con so I have the wrong 316. it's uh Second Timothy 3 16. yes oh I told you I was nervous all right second Timothy 3 16 all scripture and I just want you to to concentrate in a little three-letter word all you know that doesn't mean only the parts of and the land you know uh it means all I mean brother Brandon says we can find Jesus from Genesis to Revelation he means every word that proceeds from the mouth of God you you're getting the picture right and this is going to be something that I'll I'll pick up again right at the end but I want you to notice all scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for Doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness so what this tells me is I used to be a a teacher College teacher and um I was an instructor and instructed and what you know is that when you're instructing somebody it's because they don't know what you're telling them if they knew what you were telling them you wouldn't need instruction all right so this is Construction in righteousness what what does that tell us it doesn't come naturally right this isn't a normal state in our foreign condition righteousness we need to be instructed in righteousness and it says all scripture is given for that point now if you'll turn with me just to um let me see if I get this one right this time first uh First Corinthians and I believe it's uh it's 15 verse 46. and you might think my memory is really amazing but I just wrote it down a minute ago so you'd think I'd remember all right First Corinthians chapter 15 verse 46. um yeah let's read from 46 and I better put my glasses on uh how be it that was not first which is spiritual but that which is natural and afterward that which is spiritual the first man is of the earth earthy the second man is the Lord From Heaven as the as is the earthy such are they also that are earthy and as is the Heavenly such are they also that are Heavenly and as we have borne in the image of the earthy we shall also bear the image of the heavenly amen so let's bow our heads say a word of Prayer our heavenly father Lamb of God we just appreciate this role this office that you occupy in our lives at this time as the lamb that was deemed worthy to take the book and to redeem us and Lord we we feel that we feel that every day we we feel the need for that every day we need the cleansing of your blood we need the the comfort of knowing that you undertook before the foundation of the world to have a sacrifice that we could rely on today and so Lord Jesus we just pray that as your as your bride as your your body this morning that Lord you would let your life be manifest in US you would let your life flow through US Lord that we would indeed bear the image of the Heavenly and so lord it's our prayer that each one would would receive what they have need of today Lord and bless my wife at home and Heather and and and each one Lord that is watching online we just pray that they too Lord would we inspired they would feel your presence and that your word would speak to them again this morning we ask it in Jesus name amen you may be seated now just while we were singing that song and you know I just asked brother Michael a few minutes before service and uh I'm so amazed at the musicians here they can pull things off at a moment's notice but I really enjoyed that so it was um it I loved that but it did give me a little inspiration for reverse I wanted to mention and this is all by way of background and by the way this wasn't in my notes so you know you're getting a bonus um Romans chapter 1. uh and uh you know this verse very well but I want to just spend a few minutes on it Romans chapter 1 and verse 10. you know there's some verses that are good to memorize for um comfort uh for um uh faith um you know a word in the time of need and sometimes that's helpful if you have that verse at hand no weapon formed against me can prosper you know we just need those those those scriptures at times just to to speak to to speak to our need at that particular moment and for some reason the way I'm built um not physically this verse means a lot to me and it always has ever since I first read it so we're going to read it together and I'm going to go through it once and then quickly uh step back into it for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen clearly seen you know we talk about through a glass Darkly and we you know then we'll see him face to face but he's given us in this world something that isn't a mystery it isn't disguised it's absolutely plain clearly seen being understood by the things that are made manifested things that are created he says from the creation so we're talking about natural things even his eternal power and godhead so that they are with that excuse now the reason this verse comes to mind quite a bit is because we we often have to discuss the Goddard and if you've ever had the opportunity to share the godded with somebody after a couple of minutes of discussion it's interesting how they this is just an interesting observation of mine over all these years is they they will say they understand the godhead you know they understand the Trinity they know how that works they've got the little triangle diagram you know embedded in their mind and they've got it down and they'll be happy to share that with you um but as soon as you start to uh quit that diagram specifically they'll go oh you know it's a mystery right it's like well two minutes ago it wasn't a mystery two minutes ago you were happy to explain it to me but now it's a mystery and of course that was that verse that we touched on a minute ago first Timothy 3 16. you know great is the mystery of godliness all right and they say you see it's a great mystery I said that's the problem with the public school education that's not what it says it's not a great mystery it's uh it's uh great is the mystery wonderful amazing is this mystery of the godded it's not a it's not a mystery because he goes on this God was manifest in the flesh so so much for the mystery all right so and and that's the that's what this verse is telling us is that we can understand the godhead just by looking at was made now you say okay well what was made uh whoa we're gonna be here all day brother Paul I'm gonna have to go back to the the the the the the the nodes but I just want to mention what do you see every morning when you step outside on a cloudless day the Sun and how many of you know that if you see three sons you need to get some correction because if they're three sons you may have been indulging in something too much because we know there's only one son there's only one light of the world there's only one source of life that comes from the energy of the Sun and the Bible says that he is the s-u-n of righteousness and he or as with healing in his wings so can you see how he says it's clearly seen the other one is there's many religions in the world um especially the Eastern mysticism that's so popular all right and you know how they get around the resurrection problem the sort of laugh after death issue they claim you come back again in some other form reincarnation that's their way of trying to explain life after death the only problem is there's nothing in nature that works that way you don't a goat doesn't die if you're in your uh in your your yard or wherever the goat lives and come back as a sheep all right or come back as a cow so he dies you bury him and you don't have an extra cow the next day all right because that's not natural and so when when the Bible says that these things even his eternal power in Godhead are clearly seen by the things that are made we can go oh you plant a potato and my goodness more potatoes come out of that have you ever dug up a potato after it's been in the ground for about a week it looks a little squishy and it's rotten and out of that rottenness is coming this beautiful green shoot of life that's the gospel though I were dead all right I'll live again and that's what we hold on to that's fundamental to our faith clearly seen in nature and so much so that Jesus uses it an example unless the corner we'd Fallen at the ground abides alone so can you see even all the Parables that Jesus uses the natural typing the spiritual so I know this is common for everybody uh mostly here I would imagine but I just wanted you to see the connection between that and witnessing and being able to express your faith in in a way that doesn't require any interpretation I've had people say brother that's your interpretation I'll say well actually that's the interpretation of nature that's what nature is teaching me now if you've got a different explanation for how a rotten potato becomes a whole crop of new potatoes I'm anxious to hear about it because it's clearly seen so we're going to go back in that verse for a minute for the invisible things of him from the creation so when we talk about a seed Gene of God and you can see the little dnas up there right so you know what I'm talking about when you see when we understand that seed Gene that's been placed in us from the foundation of the world that little piece of God that all of us together make up the Human Side Of God how many know that God has a human side manifested in Jesus all right and all the Believers that came after him the human beings that would have his life in them that makes God a deity but with a human capacity or a human portion of it those are the invisible things of him from the very beginning from the creation that are clearly seen by the things that are made and obviously that's you and I all right ultimately but I think it Amplified not always the most accurate text but in this case it does give us a good word the invisible things it translates as the attributes the the hidden attributes the attributes of from him you know these uh invisible things are attributes and that's wonderful because and I'm going to go through this quickly and then I promise I'll get on to this lady so um if you're an artist or a musician brother Kenny by the way I'm wearing socks in your honor today if you care to take a look I can show you after the service um but if you're a musician and you start to plan brother Brennan uses this analogy if you have the spirit of Mozart you know you would write and play like Mozart compose and and play like Mozart so if you're a musician or an artist or anything expressive like that there's something in you that has to be revealed it has to come out if you're a writer anything like that that has a spiritual component to it and are you mechanically minded or something you know you just can't help yourself it's a trait it's something that it's just it's in you to do those things all right that's an attribute in in the context that we're talking about now so God had attributes within him that were you and I so there was something in God that prompts him to express those attributes all right he wants to express that attribute and that attribute happens to be you all right so how does it come about well that attribute just like an artist or a musician he he will do something in order to express that attribute now you and I can't see the attribute but as soon as brother Kenny sits down at the piano we see the attribute the manifestation of it all right it starts to manifest itself and it pleases us and it it blesses us and and so there's a connection there that God intended for that to happen so this is the important thing the attribute gives rise to the thought the thought is the father of the word you can't say something without thinking about it so the thought is the father of the word that's spoken and then the spoken word becomes manifested and now guess what because God's cycle or Circle is absolutely perfect there's no diminishing of the attribute through the progression so that original attribute in God's mind becomes a thought the logos the thought becomes a word the word becomes manifest and that manifestation is what we read about the image of the heavenly so that means that we have that attribute within us that was in God because there's no change over the course if you if you copy something it gets worse and worse but God copies it it's perfect all the way through so you and I are living attributes of God those attributes that were hidden away in God are now clearly seen right here in front of me today I clearly see you and you were an attribute in the mind of God that's that's what this verse teaches me and it's the godhead so where does that place us it places us right there in the godhead because the Bible says our names are written in the Lambs if we for the foundation of the world all right let's get started so that kind of is the background that I wanted to share with you because I'm going to talk a little bit about DNA and I'm no expert on the subject please anybody who knows about this don't come and ask me about it afterwards I'll just refer you to the slides um but I do understand the principle so we're going to um look at this uh let's see if I've got the right verse up I'm sorry oh my mouse is a bit sticky all right here we go so let's uh what I'm going to talk about this morning is what we started on last time and that was the connection uh the links if you like between the old and the New Testament so last time we talked about it in terms of an arch and brother Brennan talks about a keystone so it's sometimes helpful to understand what if I may say is in the back of his mind when he uses the word Keystone and and there's a particular architect thing called the Keystone that was very common throughout recorded history all the examples in archeology and so forth you see an arch different shapes but they're held together with this Keystone that has both sides press against it it's self-supporting so you build it up with a scaffold but then you can take the scaffold away once you put the Keystone in and obviously Jesus is that Keystone and what I said last time was that the the bricks going up on this Arch would be the Old Testament or if you from your side this would be the Old Testament then you would have the New Testament and in between holding the two things together is Jesus all right so we talked about that now I'm going to talk about it in terms of DNA same principle nothing new but I think you'll I think you'll find it very interesting I certainly did so as you look at Hebrews chapter 9 verse 15 and for this cause he is the mediator he's between the of the New Testament that by means of death for the Redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament or the Old Testament if you like they which are called might receive the promise of Eternal inheritance so what we're going to find is that this link between the old and the New Testament act a part of the promise of our eternal life so far from ignoring one of the if you go to some places they'll tell you oh the Old Testament you know you don't worry about that but you know what would happen to that Arch if you took away the Old Testament all right it just fall down so that's the that's the concept that we're going to look at today you have to have both and there has to be a way to connect them both and so you can probably see where I'm going John chapter 6 verse 63 the words the words that are speaking to you they are Spirit thought first and they are life all right so spirit and life are synonymous words why does he mention them both he could just say life he could just say Spirit but now he's saying both and why is that it's because the the spirit is the Unseen part the life is what gets expressed all right now if this was class I'd be asking everybody if they had any questions but I'm not going to do that I've learned my lesson [Laughter] so what we know about this word life is that it can be used literally as you see here on your screen or figure it what's wrong the battery oh sure yep that we don't really know the way we ought to and and this might be one of those things brother that seems that's fine that's fine so and that's that's the idea that this word life can be used figuratively or literally literally in the sense of Romans chapter 1 verse 10 that the the life that is expressed we see that that's physical but there's the spirit behind the life and that's the invisible part now up until 1956 or 55 uh DN DNA was invisible all right so they first discovered that in 1850 I said I meant 1855 somewhere around there they uh first um identified the fact that there was this molecule that they call DNA now most of you'll remember Francis Crick um the uh the the the scientist said won the Nobel Prize and I believe it was uh 1955 1955. but what they won the real price was not discovering DNA but was from um finding out or uh probably through electron microscope technology that it was a twisted strand like you saw in the picture you're all familiar with that familiar shape right and that's what they got the Nobel Prize for was recognizing this really weird shape to a to the molecule but it was interesting that it was in the 1950s that they discovered that because there's um there's a mystery in how life works so Zoe God's life but how does it work and how does it work in US basically it works through the word and that's the words that I speak unto you all right so brother Branham says this and contending for the faith Jesus said except a man be born again you cannot see the kingdom you can't understand it it's mystical it's a mythical thing until you're born again mythical meaning it's like a fairy story yeah yeah yeah whatever you know I didn't get it mythical until you're born again and then it's like I Saw the Light yes oh what happened who put that there you know things you never saw before you see because now that life is being expressed through you and your eyes are open all right so when until you're born again there the very life of God comes in you Everlasting eternal life Zoe the Greek word so there's something mystical there's something mythical about this concept of life that hopefully we can unravel a little bit by looking at this mysterious DNA so a couple of fun facts human beings look different but 99 of their DNA is the same and here's a fascinating thing about the size of this DNA molecule if you stretched out all the DNA in your body end to end but join them all together because they're all little separate molecules but you join them all together you'd go all the way to Pluto and then you'd have to come back again before you'd get to the end of that line of DNA it's a little bit beyond us right none of us have been to Pluto I don't think so it's it's a little bit hard to picture three billion miles of a molecule in One Direction and then three billion miles coming back in order for you to understand how much of this DNA is in US so when we think of the life of God in us this uh is a natural example of the supernatural because this is what it looks like in the Supernatural times a million all right to Infinity to have eternal life in you so we don't really fully appreciate what it means to have the life of God in us is life his nature his ability his Joy his peace these are attributes of God that are being expressed in us when we have this life in Us and how do we get this life we get it through the word but that word we wouldn't be born again if there hadn't been a connection between the Old Testament and the New Testament a way to instruct Us in righteousness doesn't come naturally so um afterwards there will be a quiz I'll be standing at the door and some people want to shake my hand I'm going to ask them to pronounce dioxy Rabino nucleic acid all right and there'll be a test so please be practicing it um quietly under your breath and that's the pronunciation there for those that have struggled with my accent d o d o c ribo nucleic acid all right okay you all got it that's wonderful the interesting thing about this word and I'm not going to do it now but it has some divisions that actually are interesting Dio sometimes used for God oxy life rope like the rib taken from Adam uh nucleic meaning the nucleus or Genesis and it ends in ic all right so hopefully by the end of this you can you can say that you see all right so what it is briefly DNA is the genetic information inside the body cells that makes people who they are now by the way I copied that from a reference to explain DNA to kids and I just love that makes it helps make people who they are and that's exactly what the word is doing it's who you really are it's instruction in righteousness where we have the righteousness of God in Christ it's as if we never sinned and it makes us who we are so it's not something that we're creating we're doing we can't do anything to make our DNA different we are who we are and spiritually we are who we are so this is uh also called the program of life it's sometimes called the language of life if you understand computer programming this is the code this is the the code that is that tells uh cells what to do and when to do it so as a cell is multiplying and growing it's saying okay this needs to be a kneecap and this needs to be a sinew and this needs to be a muscle this needs to be skin this is a heart this is a lung and the DNA is actually and I wish I had the video but it's actually unraveling that DNA strand and then there's a messenger RNA that goes along and reads the code it reads the Little Steps along the way of their DNA and that tells it what kind of amino acids to use to build a protein and that protein becomes what you are so there's a messenger in our RNA that's actually decoding the DNA in your body as your cells are growing and that's another topic I told you it was part of a series all right so it controls every living cell when we allow the Bible the word of God to control Our Lives then the word of God is the language of eternal life now if it seems a little mysterious and if it seems that we often have to read between the lines you can understand that if you think of it as part of DNA because none of us can unravel DNA that would be Beyond us even scientists struggle with that they it's been you know gazillion years trying to map out the human genome but the point is it a it's possible but B it's incredibly difficult unless you have an interpreter unless you have a messenger RNA that can read the code and produce the life the protein the the organ within us that's needed for life see how that works all right so you're getting the picture now the question is we know that between the old and the New Testament there are four Gospels the question is why for wouldn't one have been sufficient yeah well there is a scripture says Two's A Witness okay so they we could have been just had two and three of course is perfection and god is perfect and Jesus Is God manifest In the Flesh so why not three that for his Redemption so that does make sense but still why four links between the old and the New Testament and I believe the answer lies in the DNA of course these gospels all tell more or less the same story of Jesus but each one gives us a slightly different viewpoint but obviously they all pertain to eternal life now the thing about DNA is it has two strands you'll see the blue and the red strand that controls our Natural Life but there happens to be four links between the two strands are at and they that's how they're joined together so it takes four gospels following the concept that God intended us to understand in 1950 that there would be this double helix structure to the molecule that would be connected by four links and we'll see some more about that here in a second so it God knowing that because he knew he would have four gospels and you see how with God that attribute that becomes a thought the word the manifestation it's all consistent God's not learning he's not he's not going I should try this this time it's all perfect because it was perfect to begin with all right so that's a big difference between God and us and what are those four links Matthew Mark Luke and John now is that order important we'll see whoop that was the important quote so I read this quote and I don't know if you're like me but when I'm listening to a sermon it's very difficult for me because I keep stumbling over something that makes me hit stop and then I struggle to go back to where I left off and so I end up reading the book or online because I want to what what did you say before that because you know you're not always tracking and this just comes out of nowhere and I don't know if any of you have ever worried about the two little strings I never did until I thought about it that link the new and the Old Testament holding Jesus between them isn't that amazing and I I don't think brother Adam ever mentioned DNA that I know of although you would have known about it so this is our scientific diagram all right let the left hand you know like from geometry or whatever let the left hand curly Red Line represent the Old Testament and the right hand curly blue line represent the New Testament and half the children here I think they they're back in school all right but now that we understand that now let's look at those two little strings that red and the blue string they're joined by four links called bases and they're named atgc now what's what's amazing about these base pairs is that only a and t can join with each other and only G and C can join with her so a can't go to C and G can't go to T so the way those four gospels are structured even remember mentioned 316 you know the way they've done the verses is actually quite interesting well this is the same thing this order is a little bit arbitrary because it's not in chronological order the Way It Was Written they believe Mark was the earliest gospel that was written and uh and then uh Matthew and Luke and that there's just doesn't seem to be any Rhyme or Reason to the order of the gospels John at the end the spiritual gospel yes okay that sort of makes sense but the first three there could have been in any order except we'll find out in a minute that the order is absolutely critical to what's written in those gospels all right and so a and t go together and G and C go together and in no other way so you can choose any two base pairs to represent the link between the Old Testament right base pairs being you know each of these two rows that you see there and then the four colored links the you know the the ones Matthew Mark Luke and John join the old in the New Testament together and remember this is the language of eternal life so there's something CR I mean eternal life nothing more critical than eternal life so this is somehow critical to our understanding of eternal love and it's the four ministries of Christ and people say why are there four gospels here's part of the answer all right in order to link the old and the New Testament together there had to be a certain pattern that was going to be important and so when we think of uh DNA in the four gospels we see Matthew and Marco joined together and Luke and John are joined together and why is that because Matthew has 28 chapters and Mark has 16. adds up to 44 chapters for that link and if you add Luke and John together you get about the same number 45 I don't know who slipped up there but it's 45 and that's normal for types by the way we talked about this once uh times are not perfect right 20 pieces of silver Joseph was sold four versus Thirty those kind of things happen but this is too close to be coincidental so the first link Matthew and Mark that's 44. the second link is 45. so the order that they were placed in based on the number of chapters actually lines up with the way the natural cell works the DNA in the cell the natural molecule and these are the only pairs that are virtually the same length to bind the twisting strands of the old and the New Testament together now here's another little fun fact this is where I sometimes get criticized so if you feel like criticizing me I've already gone there so you don't have to bother but they begin to look like the rings of a ladder I learned that by the way as a teacher I used to go into my first year class and all these people are looking at me and none of them are writing anything down they're just staring and I'm busily writing away on the board and talking and I turned around this was my first year and I was like what is wrong with these people then they seem to have something else on their mind I quickly found out what it is I'd made a mistake and they were just quick to jump on that mistake oh you that's not right that's what they were waiting for they're waiting for me to make a mistake so now I learned my lesson next time I had a first year class I did something purposefully wrong and they quickly jumped on it and they said oh that's wrong I said now that we've gotten that out of the way I'm not perfect I'll make mistakes now you can concentrate on the lesson worked really well brother rapper anyway so these look more and more like the rungs of a ladder now I just thought I was the one that thought this of this but I'll tell you what I looked up again on online for how to tell kids about this and they use the same phrase they said when these links get put together they look like a letter so I felt I felt Justified climbing this ladder takes us upward to Heaven as we get more of the word more of the DNA of God more of the attributes of God it's like you're instructed in righteousness and you're climbing this ladder all right which of course we know from Jacob's dream so I always thought it was a stepladder Well turns out it might be a double helix ladder which is more like a spiral staircase right so fun fact not uh any doctrine that I'd like to put my name to all right but it does make sense all right because it's taking us from the earthy to the spiritual all right it's taking us from this life to the next life so I don't feel too bad so we find that the four gospels reveal more and more links between the old and the New Testament and we know that Jesus did both right he he did uh the old and the New Testament he fulfilled more than we realize all right and there's always more to discover we know that job chapter 5 verse 9 which doeth great things and unsearchable marvelous things without number so when we talk about DNA until 1855 nobody knew about DNA until 1955 nobody knew about the double helix and the way it was structured so these were things that would have been unknown unsearchable but now are made clear even his eternal power and godhead by the things that are made so Ephesians chapter 3 verse 8 unto me who am less than the least of All Saints is this Grace given that I should preach among the Gentiles The unsearchable Riches of Christ so you say well brother Stephen I'm not sure all this DNA stuff it's all part of those things that we read between the lines all right the Love Letter the searching the unsearchable riches of Christ and we're going to have to have something to do in eternity by the way and these are some of the things that we would unravel that have mystified us here in this life but in that life everything will be revealed so we want to look at the emphasis of these gospels and I'm going to speed up a little bit because I know this is familiar to you let's read this Jesus is is very different from other human leaders he's our King but he's also our servant all right he's an ox he's a servant he carries our burden come unto me all you that labor in the heavy land I will give you rest all right he's willing to take the load of Sin from us all right and praise God for that all right and that's in spite of our weaknesses so now we're going to zip through this very quickly because you're all familiar with this so you know the lion oxman and Eagle the four living creatures and we know that those are paralleled by the gospels and I'll tell you very quickly so you got the picture Matthew repres is represented by that lion spirit that lion attribute Mark is the the servant attribute the the ox attribute right and then uh Luke uh was a doctor so he looks at things from a man's perspective right so when God's using him to write his gospel it's using Luke's attributes things that interested Luke and we'll see why that's important in a minute and then John of course is the eagle attribute of God the the the four living creatures around the throne four different ways in which God operates and we know that through the seals and so John is that eagle got gospel right he he doesn't look at the natural things he's soaring high in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was gone was nothing made that was not made by that word I mean that's pretty heavy for the first couple of verses sometimes people tell new Christians to start in the Book of John hmm I think that might be a little bit tough when you start with the concepts of logos and the word and God so Matthew emphasizes Jesus as the king and if you notice the way Matthew starts in the beginning right uh John sorry John starts in the beginning God created so he goes way back Matthew starts somewhere in the middle he says Jesus Christ the son of David the son of Abraham now if you were always saying that we'd say Jesus the son of Abraham the son of David but David has the second most important name in the Bible it's the first mention other than Jesus in the New Testament and it's the last name mentioned in Revelation except for Jesus he's the root in The Offspring of David so David has a very prominent position in in the scripture and of course what's important about that oh I will get to it so Mark emphasizes Jesus as a servant he's the one who gets on with the job and knows exactly what he's doing right and Luke obviously is the ideal man and then John is this deep gospel that looks at Jesus as the word so Matthew emphasizes Jesus as the king the son of David and guess which chapter the genealogy of Jesus appears in Matthew it's in chapter one Jesus Christ the son of David the son of Abraham and the traces genius Jesus's genealogy back through David to Abraham Abraham is the first mention of the word Kings and the Bible we need to battle against the Kings to get a lot back and David who is Israel's most important King and even though the one that Jesus is going to fulfill that to sit on the throne of David so the fact that it's in chapter one is going to be important because we're looking at this order if you put Matthew and Luke together you would have a mess it it has to be in two separate links and of course he was a tax collector and only Kings Emperors governments presidents collect tax all right so it's another attribute of a king and of course that was very important um when uh to get Mary and Joseph to go to Bethlehem because Augustus was collecting taxes and of course that's the gospel that mentions the three gifts that were brought by the wise men all right it's not recorded anywhere else and why is that because when you go to see a king you were expected to bring tribute when people showed up to see Jesus at the banks of the Jordan in Mark's gospel they weren't bringing any gifts you don't bring tribute to a servant see so Mark represents Jesus as a servant and a sacrifice which is the ox now first thing you notice in the gospel of Mark is there's no genealogy because servants don't have to prove their qualification by their ancestry only Kings have to do that so King Charles was received the crown yesterday and it's because that was passed on to him by Queen Elizabeth who was passed on to her by her father King George and that was passed on you can see I grew up in South Africa I know some of this stuff so that is the genealogy that has to be proven for somebody to say I can be the king because of my lineage but Mark's gospel mentions nothing about a genealogy all right servants don't prove their qualification like that a good servant is known by speed and efficiency it's can you do the job well and can you do it fast so Mark uses the word straightway or immediately 40 times in his little gospel and straightway straightway he had Jesus on a treadmill just one thing after another it's like Jesus never stopped it was just going from one Miracle to the next and that's the gospel of Mark why is that because if you've got an ox a beast of burden one that's eating a lot of hay you want that Ox to perform all right and that's exactly what Mark does in his gospel and servants are expected to work hard and quickly but you have no interest in who his father's father's father was so even if then is where the sacrifice part comes in the ox has high value for its meat for its food to be food for the people so uh Butte we just had the Kentucky Derby yesterday I believe and so I remember that week from the discussion this morning because you guys were down there at the races weren't you weren't you in Louisville you weren't Louisville weren't you brother Paul just checking um but that's fortunately not with the Kentucky Derby is held so you're okay no that was just held now that is interesting because when an old successful horse finishes his career racing he's put out to stud he gets the life of liar I mean just luxury he can do anything he likes he just eats and grazes all day long he's out there in the field not a care in the world no one's going to kill a beautiful old fertile hopefully racehorse all right but an ox an ox can't reproduce anything with an ox by the way and and that's a little question mark in the NIV Bible by the way the King James uses the word heifer The Offspring of a heifer and the NIV says The Offspring of an ox no farmers were doing that translation so this Ox can't be put out to pasture Jesus isn't going to live a long life of ease and luxury after going straight way straight way straight away half The Book of Mark is the passion it's the week leading up to his crucifixion it's all about going going going and being killed that's the Book of Mark so the passion movie is based you remember whoever that was is based on the Book of Mark that's where most of the passion plays come from and it's because his carcass is too valuable to keep alive after it can't work anymore and where that caucus is that's where the Eagles will be gathered you see how the scripture is so perfect I always say this when you see things and I I know this because I've talked to people and I say so what is this where the caucuses there will the Eagles be gathered well what is that about oh it shouldn't be Eagles it should be vultures because vultures are the ones that eat carrion ago you just identified yourself but that's fine so the problem is with the translation because those two words eagle and vulture can be can be translated similarly but if you understand the inspiration behind it Jesus is the sacrifice that had to die in order for us to be fed spiritual food in due season see and that's why we have communion we have the bread that you had last weekend the bread the body that was broken it can't live on the blood represents the wine represents the blood that does live on but the body could not live on all right where are we so I said I I kind of went through this I gave you this ahead of time so Mark's book records the sacrifice in great detail now we go to Luke now Luke you'll notice is number three on our DNA molecule so Matthew and Mark go together the king and the servant by the way you remember David what's the common term used for David those words servant King he was the servant King do any of you know the song There's a beautiful song by Graham British guy anyway and it's called the servant King it's a lovely song by the way and that's what Jesus was and David was a servant King he remember he had a servant's heart he had that that attribute and that that's another story but I just want you to realize that in the third bases this Luke bases that we're looking at in the DNA molecule the genealogy that's so important doesn't appear in chapter one where you and I would have put it like Matthew did it appears in chapter 3. and why is that it's because it's going to trace Jesus genealogy not back to Abraham and David but all the way back to the first man which was Adam and so because he's interested in Jesus as a man he wants to show that Jesus had those human attributes passed on down through the genealogy all the way from Adam and amazingly it's the third basis in our diagram Matthew 1 Mark 2 Luke 3 and that's where the genealogy appears and of course in Luke there's no tributes to a King there's just Shepherds at the stable all right and they're interested in the birth of the sacrificial lamb that was their uh of their perspective on the birth of Jesus he's a young child I mean he's a baby he's not a young child and he is this lamb that is in a stable in a Manger wrapped in swaddling cloth Etc playing the the the pot if you like of the sacrificial lamb but as the ideal man no man can give his life for us that would do us any good but the ideal man the perfect man could and so in the Book of Luke we read about Jesus early Boyhood we don't read about that in any of the other gospels and it talks about his progression through childhood and that he was uh is it Isaiah chapter 11 the seven attributes of the spirit of God and those are repeated in Luke chapter 3 chapter 2 where it talks about Jesus Boyhood and up until the age of 12 and he grew in stature and the knowledge of of the will of God all of those things that's all in Luke so as a Doctor Luke was interested in Jesus human qualities now John no genealogy Spirits don't have a genealogy remember Hebrews talking about Melchizedek no father mother beginning of days the ending of love right so when you're talking about a spiritual being you're not talking about ancestry so John doesn't have that other than a spiritual ancestry if you like also Jesus is the one who says I am my father are one so the gospel's emphasis is on Jesus as the word made flesh he's this deity this logos that is now clearly seen the Old Testament he was hidden the New Testament he's revealed why is that it's because he was the word made flesh that clearly seen by the things that are made even his eternal power in God did so when you think of Jesus as the Son of God walking on Earth you're seeing the mystery of the godhead revealed and we all know how we understand that and now this is the most important part for me anyway this gospel leads into the book of Acts and we know what that is it's not really the book of Acts of the Apostles as the King James guys wrote it it's the acts of the holy spirit in the apostles all right so this book of Acts is the work of the spirit of Jesus in the church if the Same Spirit dwell in you that raised Jesus from the dead right he will also Quicken your mortal body all right so it's still the spirit of Jesus working in the church and so if you take the last verse of John the last chapter of John it's known as The Unfinished gospel many other things which Jesus did all the books in the world could not contain why is that because we know and you won't read this in a commentary we know that the church is the next manifestation of the body of Christ it seems so obvious to us when we say that right Paul said we're his body you know it just seems so obvious but for the time it's a mystery so this proves that when Paul ran into Jesus on the road to Damascus or vice versa he said Lord he said I'm Jesus whom you persecute and Paul never had anything to do with Jesus that we know Saul of tosses didn't have anything to do with Jesus but he was persecuting the church and Jesus said you're persecuting me all right so we know that we've got a verse for that many other things which Jesus did not the apostles did that Jesus did through the apostles all right that's what the book of Acts teaches us and so this is the unfinished gospel so you can imagine if John came first in in those four books that wouldn't make any sense would it it has to come at the end because it has to go into the book of Acts and then we read this verse First Corinthians 15 46 how be it that was not which is spiritual but that which is natural and after with that which is spiritual well the interesting thing about this is that we also have Romans 1 10 that says the invisible attributes of God so the spiritual gives rise to the Natural manifestation that in turn reflects the spiritual so remember we have to rightly divide the word that's what this is about so when scientists discovered DNA one of the things that they were quick to point out is that they could only find about three percent of the DNA that was actually doing anything that was actually providing any meaningful difference to the cells yeah I always found that hard to believe I just I'm not sure about that it's a great evolutionary story because it means there's a lot of residual DNA that we don't need anymore that came through Evolution you might hear the same thing about vestigial organs Ah that's a big word basically it means your appendix in other things but primarily they think the appendix when I was growing up up whip it out it doesn't do anything ah any nurses yet does anybody agree with anymore that's not what's taught today that's not told that they they believe that there is function for that appendix so these are all the things that people like to believe that aren't true three percent of it so they said that the 97 of the life that is in US is Just Junk DNA ha that's what I said when I read that huh but unfortunately we do the same thing with scripture when you open your Bible and you turn just one page after another and you don't see any underlining and you don't see any notes in the margin is that the junk DNA that they're talking about oh I don't know where that's got to do with anything keep turning the page let me give you an example when you talk about the Old Testament and you explain that dress is important male and female have to look different not just we're not wearing the same clothes but appear to be the same clothes who would have known we'd be facing cross-dressing today but obviously there's something in the scripture about that as well so here's the thing when they refer to that they almost always go to the next chapter I think and says oh wait a minute here it says you should not wear a garment that is made of wool and linen cotton so what about that do you apply that as well I say oh yes what are you talking about we have lots of Blended Fabrics today so ah but spiritually there's a significance and that most people they they wouldn't get this but you would say the Woolen wig that Woolen type wig that we read of Jesus wearing as he's ju as the judge in Revelation chapter one ties in with though your sins be Israelites call it there shall be as white as snow as white as wool wool is the representing representation of judgment the poor sheep has to be killed or at uh if you're going to put his skin on as a garment right wool that's judgment linen from Revelation is the righteousness of the Saints Revelation chapter 19 clothed in linen white and clean all right that's Grace so what does it mean to make a garment with Will and linen you're trying to mix Grace with the law and they don't mix if we have life we've passed from death and to life we don't have them at the same time brother Brandon says it beautifully he says you can't be awake and asleep at the same time you can't be standing up and sitting down at the same time it's in either or situation you're either under the law or you're under grace all right so that's what is the the hidden meaning if you like reading between the lines of those um those um what's the word ordinances in in the Old Testament think about that when you read those and say how does this apply to Jesus because we know it's good all right so that junk DNA that they're talking about well it's sometimes what we would regard as things we don't understand or we don't agree with but read up on it and you'll find scientists aren't so sure about the junk DNA anymore because the more they learn the more they realize it's not junk DNA and they begin to suspect that 97 of the DNA is vital for keeping us alive and for instructing the other three percent what they should do so they don't see a function for that 97 but now they realize it's actually informing the other three percent all right so when we read these types and shadows when we see the Book of Esther giving us this amazing picture of the bride and all the the things that brother Brendan's been been bringing out of the Book of Esther we realize that that's not just another interesting story there's a lot of depth now Ruth is a little bit easier but Esther and Nehemiah that's another one a little bit and by the way you know you've heard me say this before please read habakkuk and Micah and Zephaniah because when you get to heaven and Micah comes up to you and says did you read my book and you go Micah who uh that's not going to be a nice experience so at least read his book and you can say oh yes I read and I remember a verse from Micah and by the way I've got this one stored for that occasion Micah chapter 5 verse 5. and it says when the enemy comes in like a flood all right it's also in Mica um God will but there's this other verse where you'll raise up a standard but there's other verses he will raise up vika 5 5 Seven Shepherds and eight principal men and we will talk about that next time I come brother all right so that maybe I'll get it next time so that active three percent has to be informed it needs a basis all right in order for it to perform its functions so that whole Old Testament that people sometimes ignore and even parts of the New Testament um that isn't junk DNA that's all remember the word all scripture is given for Doctrine and for reproof and instruction and righteousness all right all right and that's the scripture that I wanted to to uh to leave you with all scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for Doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction and righteousness so please as your daily meditations I encourage you to start in Genesis and Page through and look for those pages which I did this morning that don't have any notes in them what part of this should I be reading that would inform me because Paul said the law was our school Master to bring us to Christ and so have I been ignored by the brand who calls him the tutor have I been ignoring the tutor the holy spirit's the tutor basing it on the Old Testament hmm I need to go back and check those lessons which I wasn't paying attention and and see what that can do to inform me about this gift of eternal life that God's given us so this DNA natural all right is a wonderful parallel example of what that spiritual attribute is like we can clearly see how God could put those attributes in us and that they would have some effect in our lives and the only way we can feed those attributes to it we can do that is to absorb to understand to take in the word of God the food for our souls and so I I just don't want you to think so much about the DNA but I want you to think about those words in the Bible that Zoe life as attributes that God has placing in us through his spirit so thank you all very much God bless you you may stand [Applause] so let's bow our heads our heavenly father as we turn the service over to brother Paul I just pray that your attributes Lord even those that I see here in front of me that Lord they just the expression of this six billion mile long natural cells natural molecules in the cells but they represent the infinite mercy of God the infinite eternal life of God that you have placed in each one of us Lord and it's that DNA that's informing us it's helping us to be instructed in righteousness your word is the lamp to our path and a lot to our feet and Lord may we use it as a ladder to Heaven Lord to the Heavenly places may we use it Lord to encourage us to walk in those heavenly places Lord we just thank you for your word we thank you for the Precision of your word we thank you for the comfort that it gives us to see all of this tied together so amazingly it can only be an infinite God that can take all of Nature and make it consistent with every word in the Bible so Lord we we just pray for each one we pray for each need we pray Lord you would undertake in every case Lord as as your word takes a hold in each one's life Lord may they receive the instruction in righteousness and may it be the literal laugh of Christ on display we ask it all in Jesus name amen thank you so much thanks brother Paul
