========================================

1 chapter 8 and verse 1. and we trust that you had a good week god has certainly been good to us we have what's much to come to church for and thank him for and worship we could never worship him enough for what he's done in our lives we appreciate him so much and we are looking forward to the lord's supper today at 3 30. amen remember i want you to have some testimonies if you do of personal victories in your life we're going to have some of that this evening maybe the choir can sing have some worship and time together testimonies and take the lord's supper together john chapter 8 and verse 1 jesus went unto the mount of olives and early in the morning he came again into the temple and all the people came unto him and he sat down and taught them and the scribes and pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery and when they had set her in the midst they said unto him master this was this woman was taken in adultery in the very act and now moses and the law commanded us that such should be stoned but what sayest thou so you can imagine the position that they're trying to put jesus in here and you couldn't deny that that's exactly what the old testament law said and so they're bringing this woman for several reasons not just that they caught her in the act but they're testing jesus here verse six and then they said tempting him and that they might have to accuse him but jesus stooped down and with his finger wrote on the ground as though he heard them not so when remember jesus is looking into another dimension besides what's just going on he's seeing it from a different perspective and so he is he he wrote with his finger on the ground and as though he had heard them not so when they continued asking him he lifted up himself and said unto them he that is without sin among you let him first cast a stone at her and again he stooped down and wrote on the ground and they which heard it being convicted by their own conscience and today i want to speak about the difference between condemnation and conviction when they heard it being convicted by their own conscience went out one by one beginning at the eldest even unto the last and jesus was left alone and the woman standing in the midst when jesus had lifted up himself and saw none but the woman he said unto her woman where are those thine accusers hath no man condemn thee so there's the word condemnation there's a condemning and she said no man lord and jesus said unto her neither do i condemn thee go and sin no more so in this set of scriptures we have both both things going on we have condemnation but we have conviction and we must know the difference in that when jesus comes there's no condemnation but there is conviction amen father we pray you'll bless us today you know yesterday the joy it was to study it and to spend time with you and personal things lord just personal time with you lord i feel so grateful today that that early in my life lord you didn't condemn me i certainly deserved it lord and though i had a good upbringing and maybe not guilty of maybe the same things as this woman i was just as much a sinner and i remember you met me lord and i felt the conviction but i thank you today that you didn't condemn me didn't say i was finished but you love me today and i'm only standing today because of that love i pray today lord you'd visit us in this house i pray today you'll make your presence known to the person who feels unworthy to the person feels that they doesn't they don't deserve the gospel and they don't deserve your love i pray you'll minister to them and everyone else lord it's under the sound of our voice nor we can stand in a surefooted place today and that's upon the word of god lord minister strengthen bring victory bring deliverance bring strength to the weary heart lord i pray this will minister to many as you've give it to me i give it back to the people and we just thank you lord for your blessings looking forward to the great day to spend in your presence and in fellowship with you and if there is anything lord between us and you we just lay it at your cross today asked you lord to forgive us of it we love you father we just commit this day to you in jesus name amen amen god bless you may be seated someone asked me this question the other day um what's the difference between condemnation and conviction and i just said well that's a great question that's a great question and i hadn't really pondered it very much before sometimes when i say that's a great question because i don't really have the answer it's better to be honest right but i've been thinking about it ever since they asked me i've been thinking about it and then i begin to study it this week and begin to ponder and look at it and i think probably i could honestly answer it without study and i could honestly say that i can answer more from years of experience of serving the lord then rather the things in the word about it i can answer for years now serving the lord that the christian experiences that and as you grow and you mature god helps you to be able to understand the difference between conviction and condemnation and i've kind of grown into that so i can answer by knowing it only by experience and but i find in this subject of condemnation and conviction the waters get a little muddy a bit and they're interpreted the same way sometimes and they're looked at looked at the same way or they're interpreted the same way but they're very much are different things they are different and i think it's important for a believer that he knows and understands and if you don't understand the difference in conviction and condemnation satan will certainly interpret it to you and this is this is a these are subjects and this is a subject that that he likes to wreak havoc with with the christian any christian a christian that's uh struggling a christian that's maybe even on the mountain and victorious and doing very well and just staying filled with the spirit satan's still gonna fight you and a lot of times in this thing it's in this thing of condemnation it's in this thing of the difference in condemnation and conviction i trust i'll just try just trust me today to know and i trust that you trust me that satan does not like godly conviction so that's a sign right away that we know if it's godly conviction satan doesn't like that because he knows that leads to true it can lead to true repentance he knows that can lead to true victory and when you come to more victory satan's defeated so he doesn't like true conviction and and so these and many times these meanings are used sometimes the same but they're very different sometimes even ministers fail to clarify when they're preaching about condemnation or conviction and the the waters get a little bit muddy with us ministers and i just ask for forgiveness on behalf of ministers sometimes we don't clarify things and we don't present it the best way that we probably could and be led of the spirit to make sure that people understand because us ministers sometimes fail to clarify things enough and can preach condemnation many times and not realize it and preach the people under condemnation instead of letting the holy spirit do his work of conviction that's what we want that's what we desire in preaching the gospel is to preach the gospel and remember the prophet said that we don't save anybody a preacher doesn't save anybody a preacher doesn't heal anybody you were already saved 2 000 years ago at calvary you actually were saved before the foundation of the world in god's mind amen you're not saved the night that you give your heart to the lord you actually god had you in his mind you're saved back then and god purchased your salvation at calvary can i get into greater amen this morning and so we don't save people by preaching we're preaching to drive away the unbelieving devils that you're listening to and if you quit listening to them you get saved amen so we don't save anybody and we certainly don't want to preach condemnation to the people we preach so that the holy spirit can walk in the room and come in the room and bring conviction to all of our hearts where we are where we're short at what we need what we need in our lives and so conviction is a good thing can you say amen two of these things con i'm just making some opening statements here and then we'll get to preaching these two things condemnation and conviction are both very much a part of the christian experience how many could raise your hand and say that these things are very much a part of the christian experience condemnation and conviction and they they are spoken of uh in the word of god they're certainly spoken of in the word of god and they very much need to be talked about because they are both quite often both of these things are quite often and most the time happening in our lives on a subconscious level and conviction happen at a subconscious level not necessarily on a conscious level and because they are on a subconscious level the devil can mix things up and the devil can defeat people because it's happening not on a visible level but at a subconscious level and how many know as brother branham taught us that we as christians have to have our subconscious in line with our conscience can you say man we can't be saying we believe out here and we're a christian out here and we got doubt down here in our spirit we've got to get this spirit of subconscious believing just like our words are believing i believe this message i believe christ i believe this word well our spirit has to believe it too and our life has to testify out of it as well and that's when we're moving into something the devil is afraid of but it's a subconscious and i just say this about a subconscious level you're growing in the lord if you're not ignoring your subconscious what's happening in the subconscious with you is what's really happening and the prophet taught us that that's what's really happened you can have a lot of things on the surface but what's happening below the surface is what's really happening and so uh so this is it's it's eternal it can be an internal battle and everyone everyone because everyone has a soul and thus a place that that that that god has the potential for god to dwell uh everyone has a soul and thus they have a place that that they can be connected to god and to even be approved by god every person and that's why this not only affects christians but it affects people who are unbelievers as well because they have a soul and if you have a soul you have a place for god if you have a soul there's a longing within you to be approved of god to be accepted of god and it's funny people will spend their whole lives doing things and giving to charities and doing good things and they're straightening their life out and all it is they have a soul they want to be pleasing to god and so they're doing all these works and it's because of a craving i want to be accepted by god i want to make it into heaven i want to be a good person i want to be and all of us have this craving how can i be accepted by god how can it be approved of god having the approval of god almighty is everything in life but oh we can spend our whole lives trying to reach for other things to get god's approval and and complicate things and work so hard and i can tell you as a gospel minister this morning it's much more simple than what you're making it to get god's approval and as a matter of fact when you really look at it god did not look at you to try to get his approval he already took care of it at calvary can i get an amen so you can't work to get god's approval he took care of it himself now i'm going to start preaching but man wants to be connected with god and they wants the approval of god to be rejected and to be disapproved to know that god is not approving of to you to know that god is he he's he's condemning you and god is writing you off and god is cutting you off and i i can't get reconnected with god and just the human spirit has a hard time with that i know there's some real extreme cases where you know solomon says in uh in proverbs the fool hath said in his heart there is no god that's like the last age of a fool and if you read proverbs you'll see stages of a fool a fool starts doing this and a full star but the final stage of a fool is basically he says there is no god now that's an extreme case nobody in here is underneath that category nobody in here is in that stage i just don't believe it but you can come to that there's no god i don't need god and that's the biggest lie a person can take on to themself is they don't need god god gave you a soul for him to dwell in can you say man and you need god living in that soul so the spirit of fear has its heyday in our subconscious trying to figure things out luther was an example of this in his uh martin luther was an example of this in his inward struggle if anybody's ever read his diaries or his life or what he and especially the days you can watch a couple movies on it i think don luther on luther but if you watch his life before he really had an experience with god this man struggled he felt like that some of the other priests thought he had demons bother him and he even admitted to it it's just this constant and he's doing all the right things and he's fasting and he's sacrificing he's just doing all this stuff and he could not get peace with god no matter what he did of course he was in a church that was that was performance based that was works related he was in the catholic church that everything you did to get acceptance with god was doing something burning a candle going to confession doing all the stuff and so that's all he knew growing up he had a decent upbringing but that's all he was taught and then when he came into the church to be a priest then they taught him all that over again you got to keep now you got now they added about 50 things that he had to do to get approval from god but he was not at peace do you know that that mother teresa was the same way they put out a thing of some of her diaries after she died here's a woman that affected so many and feeding the poor and her life was a great testimony of what a person can sacrifice and do for her life is incredible but now you read her her things and she never she never got peace with god she had an internal struggle the whole time she never could find full approval from god and in these diaries now reveal she's crying out she just she can't get peace and she's helping the whole world she's helping the orphans in all of india but she never had a subtleness she never could get that peace and luther if you read it he was the same way this internal fear that god has not accepted me and he lived under such a performance-based upbringing and a works-based church associated and he associated works with his connection with god it was bait all based on works he could never do enough he could never do enough and so he battled and then one day one day look reading in romans justification was revealed to him true justification was revealed to him and it was just simple and that is that in in christ in christ was a finished work that christ did so he's going how can i have all these things that i have to gain and try to get approval from god and yet in christ it's showing in romans that that when christ was crucified he died for all of my sins and my approval was in that when god approved christ at calvary when god approved that sacrifice then he proved of me oh i should be getting some greater amens this morning hopefully in about 20 minutes i can quit preaching we can just start shouting because you need to know that this isn't a performance-based religion this isn't a works-based religion this is the finished work of what christ has done for your life and when that love overwhelms you and begin to notice what he's done then it's not a prophet problem living a life worthy of the gospel because i'm not living a life worthy to get acceptance i'm saying i value it i appreciate it and my love says i want to do everything to love him back [Applause] hallelujah so what a testimony you can read luther's life that the very best of our very best performance will always fall short and never fully satisfy that the very best of our efforts the very best of our very best religious efforts and giving and sacrifice still will always fall short and never fully satisfy god so god came and he brought a satisfied approval of his sons by what he did at the cross luther sees romans and it said in there therefore and i don't have time to read go back and read before romans 8 where he says therefore because as brother lonnie used to say go see what the therefore is there for. because he said hold something for seven chapters leading up to this conclusion therefore there is now no condemnation but but but no no there's no buts about it there is therefore no condemnation none to them who are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but walk after his word so where's this condemnation coming from where's this where's the origin of this condemning accusing voice in your mind if you don't get anything else today i can tell you that voice does not come from god and it does not come from this word so he says i'll take care of it and root luther read therefore there is now no condemnation to them in christ and walking out the flesh but after the spirit therefore here's another place therefore being justified by faith in his son we have peace where where do we have peace at in the soul my mind not may not have peace every day based upon watching too much of the news based upon my kids not doing what i want them to do based upon i don't have enough to meet my bills should i name 10 other things that happened to you this week my my peace is not always completely settled in my mind and in my spirit but in my soul god has provided a complete settledness a complete rest therefore being justified by faith not by our works but by faith in his son and his finished work at calvary we have peace where in our souls it settles it when i am truly in christ not by religion but i'm in christ i'm in his word and i've i'm trusting in that and i'm living that then i am in another category i move myself out of the category of being under condemnation in the condemnation of the world i'm not in the category of being condemned with the world i'm in when i'm in christ i'm in another category i am no longer condemned by god there is therefore no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus and i'm in another category because it settles it and it brings peace it brings peace can you say amen how many can raise your hands that i know what that peace is all about i've experienced i know what it means to have peace in my soul in the midst of the storms of life there's peace in my soul i'm settled in my soul there's never a question about where i'm going there's never a question about the rapture [Applause] brother marcus becker preached a wonderful message friday down in uh down in lima just a couple weeks ago and i was just astounded but he was he was along some of these lines and i was so ministered too but i'll tell you there's there's a rest there's a peace and he said there seems to be a fear of people i won't make the rapture i won't make the rapture and he had a beautiful thought he said this is based upon the love of god this is a baseball and god said no no no my people my people because they're in christ they're already a part of the rapture we're not working our way to a rapture what is this fear that says i've got to do more to make the rapture praise the lord you know i just want to settle down and just smile right now because i know that i am giving the devil a huge boot in the rear a black eye i know he doesn't like this and hopefully by the end of this service you'll trust me and you'll be smiling too can you say amen because the devil has some of you bound but you need to say you say this is the word of god this is what he said about me i'm accepted in the beloved i'm accepted because the sacrifice was accepted [Applause] the same one who stood in that boat with the disciples and reached forth at the end of the boat and said peace be still and he calmed the storm the same one is here today and can say peace be still to your soul the same one is here and if he can speak to a literal storm he can speak to the storm in your soul let you raise your hand say i accept that in the name of the lord jesus christ i accept it i may not understand everything you're saying preacher but i accept it i need it same one who spoke to the storm spokes to the storm in your soul said peace be still because therefore being justified by faith in the son of god we have peace maybe not in the spirit level all the time but in the soul it's a settled deal so the approval thing my judgment of your sin jesus says my judgment of your sin was fully satisfied by my son's death at the cross that's what god says god says my judgment of your sin because sin has to be judged the soul that sinneth it shall die that's bible that's the word the soul that sinneth it shall die but he says my judgment of your sin was fully satisfied by my son's death at the cross when i approved of him then i approved of you we actually were born with a cloud and that's why this condemnation is so important to talk about it because before you did anything wrong before you did sins plural before your first lie before you did things like me like stealing twinkies out of the cupboard or off the twinkie truck before i did any of that my life was condemned when i was born i was born under a cloud of condemnation before i did anything wrong because my daddy my the first adam he fell he fell he felt he he fell with her and when they fell i inherited all of this condemnation that's why brother brown says he says what what happened in the garden you can't even repent of that we repent of our sins that we've done but we can't repent of that serpent nature that we have because we didn't even do it you still got to repent of it but he says you can't even repent of that which lets me know that i can't even take care of an inherent condemnation that i was born with as a little baby hanging over my soul that i am condemned and un unacceptable to god the day i was born it's hard to look at those little babies and say in soul level they're unacceptable god oh my goodness wow but in a soul level unless they come to a new birth they still got condemnation on them adam's condemnation brother brown preached that condemnation by representation so one man represented us all and we all got the boatload of condemnation from one guy and one gal that failed and it'd just come over and it come over and come over in 2021 all of a sudden we're born with this condemnation on us whether we've done anything wrong or not so you sitting here that's done a bunch of stuff wrong drugs and needles and and adultery and okay you you did a lot of bad things okay we don't want to hear about them we just want to testify what god's doing in your life now but we got people in this room do a lot of bad things some of them i know i thought but you were bad you're a bad case and then we got some that over here that didn't i'm not talking about on this side of the building we've got some over here that are goody two shoes they didn't do too much wrong aren't you glad you sat in this side today sat in the right spot man no i'm gonna let you know that these over here that are really bad and these over here that didn't do too many things bad are just as bad as these over here condemned unacceptable to god so we get this thing like elijah and oh he's such a great man and elijah spirit coming on the prophet this day such a great man no and yet we heard the scripture on wednesday night such a wonderful message make sure you listen to it elijah was a man subject to like passions as we are weaknesses human weaknesses a temper got down in his spirit got depressed read about it and yet god heard his prayer god closed up the heavens and god heard his prayer god open up the heavens god heard his prayer because it wasn't based upon his righteousness it was based upon god's righteousness [Music] so we're on the same boat elijah elijah was born with condemnation moses was born with this spirit unacceptable to god it's all and unacceptable to him it's condemnation by representation but bring up that quote if you would back there because i'm going to show you where he said now if one person can cause all that condemnation then it's the same as true that one person doing the right thing can cause the righteousness of god to come on my life if i was declared condemned by adam and what he did in eve then i can be declared righteous by the act of one man that's it that's in man he can't help being what he is because he's born in that condition man is represented in heaven as a sinner by a sinner i was speaking on this some time ago and someone said then that's not just if i'm to be represented by one man's disobedient that i don't have a chance i said that's true because you're born a sinner but you are represented you were represented by adam you are condemned to condemnation by representation well then that looks very cruel but turn it on the other side then we are ordained to eternal life by representation where one represents us to death another represents us unto eternal life so it puts us back again before the throne again but what do i need to do to do that no it that act it puts you back before the throne again [Applause] getting brother diggs spirit up here you know he'd be shouting brother dicks you ought to say praise the lord this morning you ought to say thank you lord for your word that's the word and it's true hallelujah blessed be his name he paid for my sin it's pain and full [Applause] something that we couldn't even repent of god says because you can't even repent of it i'll take care of that serpent nature i'll go to calvary i'll give my life and i will be satisfied [Applause] and if you'll believe and come to a new birth i'll get rid of that serpent nature and i'll put my nature down on the inside [Music] hallelujah but in my experience with this rotten enemy that i'm giving a black eye to today in my experience with him i don't know about your experience that even after a person has found peace in their soul satan can bring this trouble struggle up again in the minds of christians the struggle between condemnation and conviction not understanding it and the galatians in the bible are an example the galatians are an example if you read the book of galatians these were heathens that had come to the same new birth that paul was preaching to the jews the jews had way too much of their religion still in them when they came to the lord they had the holy ghost but they had way too much religion and they were going to require the galatians to get circumcised to try to become a jew and paul's saying we're not trying to become jews here we're trying to become christians so don't require that some of them when did someone and all of a sudden this cloud come over the galatians by the brothers in jerusalem by the preachers preachers with the holy ghost but hadn't grown out of their traditionalism oh boy is somebody going to say amen preachers with the holy ghost but not mature enough yet to learn how to preach the people under the right thing but to take the message and preach these galatians under condemnation so they're coming they're all under a cloud and paul meets them in galatians says why are you guys so depressed what's happened well the brothers in jerusalem been preaching this and we need to be circumcised in this and and paul says who hath bewitched you i'm quoting from your bible now this is the words he used bewitched is a spell the preachers in jerusalem preaching the wrong way cast a spell on the minds of the galatians that caused them to think that they would be condemned and unacceptable to god if they didn't get circumcised and follow the jewish ways who hath bewitched you that you could believe everything he starts reminding them their new birth he says you were birthed you didn't have any of that are you got you got born again experienced you've been birthed by the word did you come to liberty yeah we were so free it was just simple we came to your message paul we believe the gospel jesus christ i can remember services where we were shouting and feeling free in the spirit calvary saved me calvary did the work and now we're all bound and lost our liberty and paul says well then i'm here to tell you stand fast in the liberty when christ set you free get back to where your standing is and stop letting these men preach you under condemnation you were free before stand in the liberty christ has made you free and be not entangled again [Music] with the yoke of bondage again they were entangled by the yoke of bondage in the world came to the message and got a new birth but now they're entangled by the yoke of bondage again a religious yoke of bondage everybody understand what i'm saying so the devil will not leave alone christians that have the holy ghost to still work in the realm of condemnation to make them feel condemned the galatians our example read your bible this week and find out if that's not true it's i'm so glad that book is in the bible i'm so glad of it for the message because sometimes in pockets of our our group we find the same type of things going on and that's very unfortunate to have to say that truthfully but we find that we must not as ministers preach the people under condemnation we must never use the word to preach them under condemnation and a final uh striking you're unapproved by god your final you've crossed the line if you do this we cannot cannot preach that way to the bride of jesus christ we can preach we can preach all the word we can preach when people we can bring correction of the holy spirit the conviction of the holy spirit could convict somebody i need to be corrected we can preach correction but don't you dare preach condemnation to a bride who's been declared the pure virtuous bride of jesus christ [Applause] sometimes we have to preach to us preachers too not just to the congregations so you can see why knowing the difference between condemnation and conviction is important to a christian's victory how many would agree now it's important to your victory this morning if you want victory in christ we've got to talk about this condemnation and conviction i've seen someone truly led into a real conviction of the holy spirit in services or sometimes out of services and it's real conviction and they're quickly they quickly label it that they're feeling condemned because they've been taught wrong truly convicted by the holy spirit in a service and if they're not taught right i'm feeling condemned i'm feeling condemned i'm leaving so they go out the door they don't repent and they label it condition i'm not coming to that church and i'm not going to let my kids come to that church because it's all just condemnation in some cases it might be but now i'm trying to bring the contrast to what conviction is that's why you need to know the difference and so you can be led by real conviction and then quickly label it condemning and missed the door of repentance i've seen parents coddle their children that have been moved by true godly sorrow for their sin 14 15 26 years old they've been moved by real godly conviction and the parents coddle them and think that they're being done wrong and they need to shield their kids from that what a big mistake kids won't be responsible for that the parents will be responsible for it because you don't understand the difference in conviction and condemnation you might have led your kid away from a true repentant heart to go on with the lord because you labeled it they're hurting you big mistake let me say it clearly conviction of the holy spirit and correction of the holy spirit when it's done in love and it's done by god his holy spirit is never something to protect yourself from it's something to embrace this i've been doing this for whatever now 40 years serving the lord i have never regretted god coming and convicting my heart it doesn't feel good sometimes i get a spanking from papa it does not feel good when it's happening but i have never regretted the lord's holy spirit coming and convicting my heart and says you're guilty of doing that i said lord i can't hide it i'm guilty forgive me lord i've never regretted it i've never wanted to run from it i wouldn't i wouldn't want to look at a life without that in my life without the correction of the holy spirit and godly people to correct me do you want to live without the correction of god do you want to live without conviction do we want to have a church without conviction absolutely not but the church world has removed all those things to make everybody feel comfortable give them the right music and give them the right things and pat them on the back every service don't talk about this don't talk about that whatever's offensive politically or any way don't talk about it and their churches fill up because that's the way they've reinvented jesus for the people we don't want that kind of atmosphere we want the true holy ghost among us to do what he wants to do i don't know where my life would be today without the conviction of the holy spirit i wouldn't want to know and me repenting and me obeying it it's glorious it's wonderful it's painful it hurts it's exposing when we give our kids a spanking then we always say this is going to hurt you hurt me honey more than it's gonna hurt you and you know the kid's thinking it's hard really how can this be hurting you how many thought that when you were a kid classic statement of parents honey this is going to hurt me then it's going to hurt me man i hate to do this and they're going ah how does this hurt you more than me some of us got some of us didn't get enough spankings when we were kids some of us maybe got too many but it's all over now some of us got too harsh of spankings some parents took their anger out on us but you know what if you're where you're at today you have a love for god love for his word then you just let that all wash and say i needed it i took it i needed it i'm not gonna mull over it can you say man i am what i am by the grace of god help me a lot lord not to beat my children so harshly i'm i'm looking to the future to do better things but you know what i am what i am by the grace of god today and i'm not looking at the past i'm looking at the future with my lord somebody give praise to the lord this morning blessed be his name there is no perfect parent you didn't have them i didn't have them and guess what you're not a perfect parent either that's why we need the lord praise the lord i'm having a good time this morning i know about you but i'm glad to be here i'm having a good time in the lord [Applause] so then you see there's one on the other side of it maybe they don't catch the conviction of the lord they read it as condemnation but then we see ones trying to live a christian life under condemnation but not conviction they're trying to live the christian life under condemnation but not the conviction of the holy spirit and satan makes all the waters real muddy so let me just tackle this thing a little deeper now after after i have a drink of water trying to take care of myself better lately for the sake of the lord and getting some testing done and make sure i got everything on track drink more water i got to have in a couple weeks gotta have a colonology mom colonology isn't it i like mine better my my nurse son-in-law is shaking his head god help my father-in-law colonology that's what they call it if it's a preacher gets it done colonology i'm changing the name because that's for preachers he gets the colonology it's not fun i know that the meaning to condemnation is the action of condemning someone to punishment a sentencing so it's not just the going through the jury process of trying to find what's the truth it's the action of condemning you've been condemned it's a final verdict okay it's a condemning and then the punishment goes with it whether it's 30 years or whatever it is 50 years or life sentence whatever it is it's the final judgment and notice it can be done sometimes when whether they're guilty or not which fits with the message very well because satan is the professional at pronouncing a final judgment on a believer and it's not true you're doomed you cross the line so it's a it's a final judgment it's a what and it can be done a final judgment can done be done whether they are guilty or not the punishment and the judgment is dished out that's condemnation you've been condemned it's not the hearing it's the final condemnation and the punishment that goes with it and some people get the wrong judgment and i've been reading up on this because i i seen a video the other day of a man in missouri and he was in jail for 43 years and there was one lawyer that looked it over again and said wait a minute something's desperately wrong and she took several months and she realized there's there's some holes in this 43 years in prison okay he never said he was guilty never guilty of three they said three murders and so 43 years and the witness then they got the witness and the witness said she found the witness that witnessed against him said she found out that she was accusing this uh the i was she was accusing the wrong man back 43 years ago i accused the wrong man of the murder his name is kevin strickland and i just been watching it uh on on the video on my news thing on my on my app i've been watching him and watching him you know and he learned about this while he's watching a a soap opera in prison it gets they break into they break into a news briefing and he finds out that he's going to be released after 43 years not from the lawyer but watching his soap opera and they break into and there's his picture and says he that it's going to be overturned and he's going to be released i don't know how that guy acted but to find out that way 43 years accused wrong in prison in bondage that long and he has to find out on the tv that hey buddy you're released you were falsely accused i wonder if in the service today through the victory of my sermon you've been under bondage way too long and my message would be to you come out of that bondage you were falsely accused [Applause] the devil's been talking to you way too much [Applause] i watched the interview and you said what do you want to do first when you get out say i want to see my mom she got sick with cole and she's been sick she hasn't been able to come and see me i just want my mom remember this boy's a teenager you know when he did these things he hasn't had a life he has no life and so i just want to see my mama i want to see my mom my mom's so special to me unfortunately she died two weeks before he got out didn't get to see his mind went directly to the to the uh cemetery and and cedar that way but what a tragedy but here's the other thing he said what's what's another thing you want to do he says i've never seen the ocean i want to go see the ocean i've only seen pictures and i don't want to just see the ocean i can't even believe there's something that's so beautiful that exists i want to go to the ocean and i don't want to just go to i want to jump in the ocean i want to swim in it in fact i'd like to go out away from the land and go out in the ocean you know i tell you things begin to just swell up when you're set free in the year 2020 this is really interesting now there were 129 exonerations nationwide defendants exonerated last year lost a total of 1700 years behind bars an average of 13.4 years per exoneration according to the report from the national registry of exonerations and 30 of wrongful convictions in the registry's database can be traced back to mistaken eyewitness identifications there's you know and there's been a thrust of this lately i don't know if it's a natural type in the spiritual for the bride but there's been a thrust of this because of dna because all these modern testing there's greater proof can you say man and i'll tell you when this bride gets into the word more there's greater proof there's greater proof till she concludes i'm not guilty can you say mine i've been justified i've been under this bondage in this prison for 43 years for 30 years for 20 years but today i'm walking out of this prison i've been set free can you say amen i've been falsely accused blessed be his name coming out right here today it ends i'm coming out i will no longer live under satan's condemnation [Applause] from this day forward i raise my hand if you can't do nothing else sorry for yelling but i'm excited i'm not mad i'm excited if you can't do nothing else just raise your hand and say may god bring me into that liberty in jesus christ hallelujah did you see the kid in minnesota that was not guilty on all accounts and i'm not trying to bring a political thing about this it's a big stir about it liberals don't like what happened he got off scot-free conservatives like that he was defending himself with his gun that's not what i'm talking about i was watching the video of this this kid as he stood there and on seven argued accounts jury declares not guilty his faith on this account the journey is not killed he just breaks up on the third one not killed he just crumbles to his chair because there's just nowhere in between you're either condemned to life or you're completely set free in this case imagine the feeling that overwhelmed him so what happens at the altar that's what happens in your life sometimes when he declares you not guilty when he says god's approval was satisfied at calvary i believe it affects our spirit my wife said she just looked at and just wept just wept at this young man and i don't you know i'm not trying to discern and i'm just saying when someone has the declaration like that and feels that free that he can walk right out of the courtroom that is a type and these exonerations are a type this bride becoming free my goodness friends i had to just shut the bible and just start shouting to the glory of god this isn't just a story this is what's happening now in the bride of jesus christ i got people coming people calling me texting saying listen i've lived underneath the religion of this message for years and i'm through with religion religion hasn't worked this message isn't about religion this message is not about religion it's about relationship it's about relationship blessed be the name of the lord i say blessed be the name of the lord thank you for the truth that i have been approved and set free [Applause] and there isn't anything that i can do to make god love me more than he does this morning there's not one ounce of something i can do to make him love me more and there isn't anything i can do to make him love me any less [Applause] nothing nothing there isn't anything you can do to make god love you any less there isn't anything you could do to make him love you anymore he loved you before the foundation of the world sent jesus christ sent the prophets of the bible why because he loved you it was for love alone that he sent his word to the people oh let's give him another handclap of praise i just love you so much thank you jesus satan is your mistaken witness greatly mistaken he's your accuser wow and try to the other meaning to condemnation is not just a final punishment but it's a strong disapproval that you're unaccepted you as a person are unapproved of you're unaccepted so i could preach more on that but i'm done with that one of condemnation now i think you get the point but i want to make something real clear since calvary those who truly receive christ are in christ and are known they are no longer under the condemnation of god or the judgments of god whatever he had he took us our punishment whatever we had we he took our punishment for us god no longer deals with those in the book of life in the lamb's book of life in the realm of final judgment or final disapproval can i say it again god no longer deals with those in the book of the life and those in the lamb's book of life in the realm of final disapproval or final judgment so if you're living under that you can rest assured it's not coming from god at all this becomes satan's language satan's realm if you've been born again by the word and you come into condemnation if you don't remember anything else today remember it's not god condemning you his anger his judgment has already been satisfied that's condemnation but this is conviction a formal declaration that someone is guilty of a criminal defense made by the verdict of a jury or a decision of the judge in a court of law so conviction we look at it in terms of the jury and all that come and you decide and ultimately only god knows the heart whether the person's guilty of it or not but when you're guilty you're guilty wouldn't it be great if people would just admit they're guilty i'd have a lot more tax money lot less court cases but men without the birth are liars and they put on stuff you know but if we just admit we're guilty when we're guilty here's the evidence yes i see the evidence i'm guilty i've said that to policemen that pulled me over and it still doesn't help sometimes they still give me a ticket trying to be a christian here and admit my guilt but when when you're guilty you're guilty but when you're not you're not so in the realms of conviction let's never mind a jury deciding and never mind other christians deciding your verdict but let's leave conviction in god's hands okay you don't have to have a bunch of people presenting a case against you and also there's a verdict and you're guilty you know your heart okay so when but when god convicts you then it's time to open up to it can you say man i'm sorry i'm going longer i was going to close there but just a little bit on conviction and i'll have to finish this next next week you got you got some time we're staying for communion right so i can preach all the way through and then you know what this leads perfectly up to the communion scriptures tonight because i'm going to read to you in first corinthians 11 where it says we are corrected and we respond to correction so that we will not be condemned with the world different category we're not under their condemnation we're in a different category so we're talking about godly conviction that is to lead you to godly repentance that's what i'm talking about godly conviction that leads you to godly repentance one thing it's one thing when someone else is trying to convict you it's another thing when god is moving on you to reveal that you're guilty and it's now listen this is not the feeling of guilt this is actually god moving to show you you're guilty okay we don't want that removed from our lives it's the truth the truth is the truth the truth will set you free so if you're guilty and you own up to it and repent of it then you've admitted to the truth it happened i did it god please forgive me and his blood cleanses us from all sins this is conviction it's not somebody else convicting you and it's not the feeling of guilt because you cannot be guilty and feeling the feeling of guilt i got another sermon on that he had cities of refuge for people who were not guilty but they were feeling the feeling of you so they could run into the city of refuge and be protected there because they weren't really guilty amen so there are times when you're feeling the feeling of guilt but you're not really guilty but it's a whole different picture when god is moved in on your life and he's revealed and exposed because he knows the secrets of the heart and he exposes you you're guilty of this it's not the feeling geek but you are guilty and you know it he lovingly shows you and we never want to be without that in our lives can you say amen and when we're guilty we need to say god you have shown me i am guilty and i'm owning up to it please forgive me help me never to do that again this is sober sincere repentance and you don't want this out of your life this is not condemnation this is the move of conviction in our lives amen you gotta separate it you know i thanksgiving yesterday or friday i sent my whole family a text from thanksgiving because somebody was guilty of taking my phone on thanksgiving day because we had everybody at the household 23 of us and somebody was guilty of taking my phone and taken pictures of 200 pictures all throughout my house of yeah of of the doors and every nook and cranny and the closets and the floors there's no pictures of people i was going through 200 out of my phone and i was starting to get upset i did not take these pictures somebody is guilty of taking pictures of things i don't want i don't want every nook and cranny in my home photographed taking up the storage in my phone i'm going to find out who done this i'm getting to the bottom of this somebody did this as a joke on me so i'm going through them i said who in the world done this and there are times when something happens at the house like so one of the kids or somebody drives on my grass my nice grass i have a goal in life to have my grass looking like john garrett's it's taken me years and i can't get there but i'm watching over the grass you know and so i put up these posts and i do everything when you drive through cars are for the driveway the grass is to enjoy cars driveway grass play playing you're supposed to somebody ran over the post the other day this stuff happens all the time you're laughing this stuff happens and most the time i send out a text all right i want you to tell me who did this and i get no response nothing nobody even says nothing terrible it's very disrespectful and so on that note i don't think she raya i have to praise ryan today because she quickly returned a text and said dad my husband's truck is too big and i ran over your stick with the truck she quickly confessed raya you're my favorite child today god bless you thank you for your admitting guilt and your honesty god's going to bless you for that the other kids i just don't know about yet anyway i go through all these 200 pictures and there's two pictures in there that gave it away and then i knew i had evidence of who it was out of all the pictures of the nook and crannies of my house and i know this is a little bit comical but i thought i would [Laughter] so they're not here today they're probably listening in but emmaus and israel my little nephews second nephews i mean look at this you know you have been caught you shouldn't have put that up because you are guilty but the thing is about it i mean look at this guy israel he has no remorse he's in your face sticking his tongue out there's no repentance or anything there these are my second nephews and you boys if you're listening you're guilty you've been caught and my punishment it's not like the lord he forgives you completely i if you come and confess next week you're on vacation but if you're listening israel emmaus if you come and confess to uncle paul i'll let you off the hook but there is a punishment i want to see a box of twinkies on my desk next week and then you're off take that off so i don't get criticized by other message ministers his presence can bring the evidence like nobody and convict you even if stuff you don't fully know yourself but then you realize wow lord i'm wrong in that sometimes it's attitudes it's not you you did something wrong it's your attitude but i was right i was right in that incident but your attitude is wrong we've got to ask forgiveness for our attitude sometimes god convicts of these things when god brings conviction there's no need to hide because it'll do you good in the end some people run from it and call it condemnation but if we're convicted and some people who are convicted never repent they walk away i'm going to quit coming to that church it's all condemnation i'm not going to take my kids there anymore it's just condemning them it is what if it's the chastening of the lord and what if chastening means you're a son it's conviction of him what if it's just taking the very hide off your back and those short skirts and those tight skirts and he's just going at it and just be careful you don't label it as condemnation it might be the lord reminding you of what modesty is because he loves you but his conviction never ever has a final judgment or disapproval of the person if you do that you're getting off the scripture his conviction never has a final judgment or pronouncement of punishment final punishment or disapproval of the person it's kind of like when you raise kids you're correcting what they did wrong but you're not disowning the sun no matter what they do wrong they're still my son my sons and my daughters are still even if they drive on my grass they're still my sons and daughters i don't kick them out of the house for that that's right i feel like it sometimes but i don't kick them out of the house for that why they're my sons they're my daughters i love them anyway my love doesn't change because they ride on my grass do you get it if my love for them can be that way then god's love for you has to be the same way he don't disown you as a daughter of god because you messed up but he will convict you and you should run and embrace it as soon as he does some christian writers said about conviction what gives us conviction of sin is not the number of sins we have committed it is the sight of the holiness of god henry blackaby said when when a holy god draws near in a true revival people come under terrible conviction of sin the outstanding the outstanding feature of a spiritual waking has been the profound consciousness of the presence and holiness of god another writer said conviction of sin is god's way of inviting you to restore fellowship with him i like that one conviction of sin it's not condemnation it's god's way of inviting you to restore fellowship with him again conviction is not repentance conviction leads to repentance but you can be convicted without repentance conviction is more than a mere feeling of guilt for someone we have done wrong something we have done wrong conviction is more than just the feeling of guilt it's normal to feel guilty after doing something that we know we shouldn't have done conviction goes above and beyond having a feeling convict in the greek is translated as in lyncho which means to convince someone of the truth to reprove to accuse in other words he's god's trying to convince you of the truth to reprimand to reprove you so we see that conviction brings out the truth it accuses of our wrongs and rebukes us of our sins as we have seen through the verses we have discussed conviction is good brokenness is good it draws us closer to god how many raise your hand and say jaws are closer to god conviction of the holy spirit always wants to draw you in closer to god not to run you away not to write you off not to cut you off if you find yourself in deep conviction for something don't ignore it go to your prayer closet and get right with god today today is your day of reconciliation our lord wants to be with you he wants to manifest himself through you and he cannot do that if you're not right with him yes brokenness is painful but it's necessary it is beautiful thank god for conviction there's a clear difference between conviction and condemnation conviction comes from the lord and it leads to life and joy however condemnation comes from satan and it leads to despair conviction is intended to lead us to the lord but condemnation drives us away from him condemnation causes us to look to self conviction causes us to look to christ when someone is conviction when someone is experiencing condemnation there is no solution to their problem when we are experiencing the conviction there's hope because of the cross jesus christ died for our sins when we look to the cross we find freedom and hope for god said he did not send his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved do you hear that even the world god did not send his son to condemn the world god is not about condemnation hallelujah so the pharisees bring the the woman caught in the act they sitting there and they're all about condemnation of this woman we caught her in the act we got the word we got the quotes on it from moses we got it but we're going to bring jesus in well if you bring jesus in that was probably their mistake [Laughter] because jesus he's going to be looking from a whole different picture at this theme jesus is going to look back into the eternities of time and see wait a minute they've brought my daughter here they don't know it but they just brought my daughter and she is in sin but i'm i'm looking ahead into the mind of god and she's my daughter but they're coming with one agenda i got the quote i got the word i got moses i got the quotes of the prophet got a whole i got the case and it's not just hearsay we caught her right doing it she was doing it what do you think jesus so as he deals with these guys he don't just well i'll tell you no no he just he doesn't say nothing he just drops down to the ground and nobody knows what he wrote but all we know is that when he wrote something conviction fell on the whole group so it's been sad that he's probably writing out these men and things that they have done some names because god knows all the names he probably he probably took a section of the sand and he wrote this pharisee's name at the top and then he put a line and then he he listed a bunch of stuff under that name he did another lady listed and they're looking at going and you know what that was this is conviction because around jesus is conviction and they're looking at that going wow first of all god knows me in this presence i can't hide anything he just wrote my life right there god knows i did that i was hiding it for all these years as a pharisee and god knows everything i've done he's writing it out i'm taking license there but something brought conviction on the place so he writes it all and then he i think he wrote theirs first because they all start to back off begin to drop their stones and he says stands up and says all right we're going to proceed with this with your stones he that's without sin let him come forward and cast the first stone they just dropped their stones then it says he got back down in the ground again i'm wondering if he wrote this woman's life wrote the men's names because if conviction is there then she's feeling conviction as well and she goes he knows my name he knows my life he knows everything i can't hide anything from him but here's the difference they had the opportunity and that presence to repent that would have been the place right there to drop their stone and say i'm guilty i'm feeling condemnation i'm feeling conviction not condemnation and we tried what am i doing they should have been saying what in the world i'm doing with this stone in my hand i know it's one o'clock but i just feel to finish this just right here what am i repentant should have said what in the world am i holding this stone in my hand you all remember this when you get so critical of people critical of your husband overly critical of your wife critical of other believers in the church conviction and repentance tends to wash all that away because he who has forgiven you gives you forgiveness for others they should have been dropping their stones so what am i doing with this stone and can you imagine these preachers he's offering them conviction and they drop the stones and they begin walking away instead of it's kind of like cain who was serpentine brother tony and god still offered him repentance serpent seed couldn't even be saved and he says if you'll do what your brother did i'll accept you and people want to say god's out just condemning everybody no he's not he's giving everybody an opportunity he gave serpents to eat an opportunity he just didn't have anything in him to repent that's not god's fault can you say amen he said no i'm going to do my own sacrifice cain walked away and he serpentine had the opportunity if you'll do the sacrifice of your brother i will accept you right now serpency and those pharisees could have had a change in their life if they had responded to the spirit of conviction around them and christ around them dropped their stones and walked away and went back to their religion again i'll tell you today friends i don't want to go back to any religion can you say man i'm staying right here in the presence of jesus christ i'm staying right here in his presence let him rebuke me let him expose me let him tell me where i'm wrong in my life because i know it will be for my good was it for the good of this lady i'd say it was because he said where's your accusers now tonight i'd like to talk about that just about 10 minutes in communion where's your accusers because we're so concerned about the accusers and and all the people are saying things about us and all these other things get your mind off of all the other accusers god has a way of removing the accusers it's not about people it's about where you stand with god it's about you and jesus it's not about what people are saying about you and he said where's your accusers now and she goes i guess they're gone so it's just me and jesus where are those who are condemning you god has a way of removing him removing him and he removed her accusers and he said these words that i was going to make the title of my message today if they're gone neither do i condemn you i've convicted you but i'm not gonna condemn you go and sin no more come on let's stand let's give god glory go and sin no more [Applause] and that speaks when someone's repented imagine she was just weeping just weeping he the declaration come forth from christ neither do i condemn you now go and sin no more and that's the future for you that you have a different life ahead when there's true repentance it's going to be different down the road praise the lord i feel weak in my body but has this helped people here this morning as it helped you to see the difference in condemnation and conviction he says peace give after something peace be still [Music] he says peace peace be still like a child [Music] my heart obeys him when he said peace [Music] he says peace [Music] peace be still there's his hands [Music] peace [Music] a child my heart obeys him [Music] when [Music] amen let's sing before we go what brother michael's sang today to fit the service there is a fountain filled with blood drawn from emmanuel's veins where sinners plunge beneath the flood and lose all their guilt guilty stings amen do you love the lord today makes me love them so much more let's pray before we say father i pray you'll minister and let this be planting the seeds today a revelation in the hearts of the people may it grow to victorious lives and victorious christians take my feeble way of presenting it lord and you make it just so much bigger when it's you so much greater bless these people lord who've listened blessed that strong feeling resonated inside of them in their regions of their soul they say amen to the word of god coming from their soul it's the truth [Music] bless them strengthen them in the name of the lord jesus christ we ask him amen [Music]
