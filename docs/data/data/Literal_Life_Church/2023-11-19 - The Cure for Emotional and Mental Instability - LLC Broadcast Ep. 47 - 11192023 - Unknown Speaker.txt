of Christ we believe you can be fed and we pray that you'll be blessed visit our website for more information at literall life. church may God bless you my friend and may the music and message encourage you [Music] today this is nothing that I've really uh practiced for today I did have a couple songs on my heart but I hadn't had a chance to prepare them but brother Gideon said there was no special so I just wanted to praise God to this [Music] morning the tempter knocked and somehow I found strength to tell him no what i' once called Treasures I just stood and watched them go surpris at my resistance and new found [Music] stability I decided this there's a higher power holding [Music] me thank you Lord for holding holding [Music] me and if it wasn't for you Lord no t in where i' be in your arms I find there is such sweet Serenity thank you Lord for holding holding [Music] me storm of fear and sorrow shook my soul throughout the night I cried I may never live to see the morning light oh without the sun is shining I am safe without out a harm i' decided there's a higher power holding me oh so thank you Lord for holding holding [Music] me if it was was and for you Lord no telling where I be in your arms I find there is such sweet Serenity thank you Lord for holding holding me cuz in your arms I find there is such sweet [Music] Serenity thank you Lord for holding holding [Music] me you are Luke chapter 21 and uh verse 25 Luke 21 and verse 25 and there shall be signs in the Sun and in the moon and in the stars and upon the Earth distress of nations with perplexity the Sea and the waves roaring men's Hearts failing them for fear and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth one place in one of the gospels says looking at the fearful sights it's termed fearful sights and looking after those things which are coming on the earth for the powers of Heaven shall be shaken so we have words like distress we have perplexity we have fear in men's Hearts their hearts failing them for fear we have fearful sights that are watching how can they see fearful sights constantly in front of them through television and through their phones there's fearful sights that brings more fear and perplexity and stress verse 27 and then shall they see the son of man coming in in a cloud with power and great glory and when these things begin to come to pass then look up and lift up your heads for your Redemption draw nigh and he spake to them a parable behold the Fig Tree and all the trees when they now shoot forth ye see and know of yourselves that summer is now nigh at hand so the Fig Tree is typed as Israel and all the other trees in other words everything begins to come into this Bloom and this summertime and and begins to come into its full manifestation all things bad or good come to full manifestation at the end time and when we see them come to full manifestation when we see the Fig Tree Israel become a nation and come under their own nation and now looking for their Revival when we see all of the Nations and all the spirits come to a head and manifest all the trees coming into that manifestation then we know we're close to the end Jesus said this so likewise ye when you see these things come to pass know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand verily I say un you this generation shall not pass till all be fulfilled look at this now Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away this is the generation that will observe and watch Heaven and Earth passing away but when we watch that pass away then we always always know that there's one thing that will endure and not become corrupt how many know that every system is becoming corrupt but there's one thing that can't corrupt and that's the word of God the only thing we have left that won't corrupt is the word of God but we'll be the generation that watches as Heaven Earth and things begin to pass away and things begin to fall apart I want you to notice as I preach out of verse 34 this morning and take heed there's this warning to watch yourself Be watchful take heed to yourselves it's a personal thing in this hour take heed to yourselves lest at any time your hearts become overcharged with surfing and drunkenness and cares and worries of this life and so that day come upon you unawares for as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth I want to speak this morning on the Cure for emotional and mental instability God never left us without a cure but you can see Jesus said in verse 34 that we could be affected and our emotional life would be depleted because of the fear in in this generation all will be affected by it and we can become emotionally and mentally depleted but God but God provides for his people in that hour he gives the Cure so I'm looking here this morning at Jesus depiction of our day and uh prophesying and giving us exactly the characteristics of our time and we can see a last warning here that our hearts not become weighed down when he says overcharged it means our hearts become weighed down our hearts become drained our Spirits become emotionally drained and uh we should be on guard for that as Christians he's not just talking to everybody but particularly Christians he's speaking directly to us because he says if you if you catch it take heed to yourselves it's a personal thing that that your hearts that your hearts he's speaking to the elect that your hearts your spirit your emotions don't become depleted and drained be on guard for that in the in one of the amp five versions it says take heed to yourselves and be on guard lest your hearts be overburdened and depressed weighed down with G with the giddiness and headache and nausea of self-indulgence drunkenness and worldly worries and cares pertaining to the business of this life we live there friends this is dead on of what we go through through to deplete us emotionally so I'm going to read it again that we become depressed and weighed down with the giddiness and the headache and the nausea of self-indulgence drunkenness because that's what the world world teaches us to be in other words they have things to answer to this scare they have things to answer to this fear when we're emotionally feeling shaky and unstable then they have answers but they're temporary answers they're temporary fixes for it and so so so so now the headache the giddiness the nausea of self-indulgence that's what the the world wants you to do drunkenness and worldly worries and cares pertaining to the business of the of this life lest that day come upon you suddenly like a trap or a news and the last verse in 35 says for as a snare shall it come so now a snare is a trap for an animal it gets you snared it gets your heart snared it gets you under a bind can you say amen and the world's going to do that but Believers got to say wait a minute now I'm not supposed to be bound by anything this is just about time for Redemption I'm supposed to look up and lift my head up can you say Amen I'm not like the statistics to get burdened down by this I have a source that I can go to I have a fountain that I can drink from God has given his word to this generation and that word is sufficient to take care of our need during this time as a matter of fact his word you don't think it well it's for my soul the words for my soul no God provides for emotional depletion God provides to fill you God provides for a sound mind God provides any instability that you're feeling can you say amen God provides for it what I find is most of our Generations are turning to other things for their emotional stability oh brother PA you going to go there I'm going to go there I'm finding that a lot of us are turning to other things to fill our are a void our void emotionally David Courtright wrote in a book a couple 2019 he wrote a book called We're the age of addiction the age of addiction you can look it up and uh David Courtright writes that we are the complete age of addiction and the summary for the book he said at the beginning he says we live in an age of addiction from compulsive gaming and shopping to binge eating so now when we think of addiction we think of marijuana we think of someone in an insanus Al someone uh a dope adct and so that's the addiction we think of but this fell he's mentioned we're addictive Society we have a lot of things that are addictions can you say amen and he says it's addiction from compulsive gaming and shopping to binge eating and opio opioid I never can say that word opioid abuse sugar can be as habit forming as cocaine researchers tell us and social media apps are hooking our kids but what can we do to resist temptations that insidiously and deliberately rewire our brains what's he saying all these things over time rewire our brains they mess with our sound thinking what can we do that that we can resist the temptation that insidiously and deliberately rewire our brains he said nothing nothing David Courtright says unless we understand Theory history and character of the global Enterprises and the the corporations unless we understand the history and character of them that create and cater to our bad habits so you can read the book because then he explores of course he doesn't have the answer he says or not really answer but he said maybe we could look at all the corporates that are contributing the corporations and Enterprises contributing knowing that we have this weakness knowing that America is this way knowing that we lean towards addiction because of our emotional depletion knowing that they gauge everything in entertainment and in uh selling whatever it is they gauge it so that they can become they can become uh the Creator and keater to our bad habits in other words some in some ways we can help you but when they go to help you it's not really helping you it's leading you more and more to addiction because guess why they want you to be addicted to their product because they make money right amen it's all about the Mighty Dollar come on now they're going to make money off of you they're going to make money off of medicines they're going to make money and trust me today I am not criticizing I'm not criticizing something that helps a person but I'm here as a gospel Minister that has to point you to what Jesus said and that we Believers guard ourselves be from becoming to addict too addictive to something that is is to be the all answer for our emotional depletion how many know addictions start somewhere man provides all kinds of remedies of all kinds where does all this start though the craving number one the craving in the soul for peace let's start with The Soul Man without the Peace of the holy spirit in his life the Holy Ghost in his life will be craving that his entire life and Satan has alternatives to bring that peace to his soul in other words being settled with God being settled being settled that God I've accepted his his uh his uh journey to Calvary I accepted what he's done I receive What the Lord Has Done For Me because I'm a sinner I need to be saved every person in this room was born a sinner unacceptable to God but the problem is is we try to do good works and we try to do things that would give us a little bit of temporary peace to make us feel good in our soul but God says I don't want you to do that I want you to receive me and you receive peace come to me all ye that are weary and heavy laden why are they weary why are they heavy laden trying to get peace on their own but God says come to me for your peace come to me for your settlement and I will give rest for your souls so a man or woman can come to complete rest in their soul level that they are it's been settled God has accepted me because I have accepted his Calvary experience I've accepted what he's done for me and now I'm accepted not because I earned it not because I deserve it but he has accepted me already he died for my sins and it meets the craving but if you don't find that if she doesn't find that they will search their whole life because they got a craving in their soul you have a craving in your soul and the other bad part is people fill it with religion they fill it with something that they do if I can just do this and make Mommy and Daddy happy or make brother Paul happy and if I could just just wear this and if I could just be this and be a good girl and do all this stuff so you move into that mode of putting something on the outside but a lot of people they still haven't met the craving on the inside there's a craving that no dress no outward religion there's a craving then none of that will ever satisfy it's his spirit that pours out in your life as you accept it and all of a sudden peace comes that I am at peace with God I am in relationship with God let the world fall apart I am at peace with him here and on the broadcast and on the internet wherever you are I pray you'll seek God to meet that craving in your soul addiction uh originates in three main things and that is a past family dysfunction a past family dysfunction and then the second thing is a real bad trauma happened in life that's the second thing a past family dysfunction a real bad family a a real bad trauma that happened to you whether it happened to you when you're 5 years old or they happened to you last week it's a trauma to your spirit it's a trauma to your emotions and third thing is the pressure of the Demonic realm existing that we live in now is there's a pressure from the Demonic realm particularly the sexual Temptation and the saturation of filthy sexual things in front of us so it's saturated with that and that brings a pressure on the human spirit a Temptation on the human Spirit you're trying to hold to God but around us is this demonic Force this demonic pressure especially on our young people but it's on every it's on everywhere so three things can cause people to to to run towards some addiction to help them relieve and calm themselves but you got to go back to the source that some past family dysfunction took place you grew up with something that affected you and and we might as well be honest every you know I like to say that uh you know uh the people come to our church and people come and they come from dysfunctional families um probably most of us come from some dysfunction from our family oh I had a pretty good Dad Mom I had a pretty good life most of us come and then I always like to say we all were born from a dysfunctional family Adam and Eve it's these things that lead to looking for remedies a family a family trauma the a family dysfunction a bad trauma that happened to your life and the de demonic realm we're fighting against if these things in these things then it leads to looking for remedies everybody I want you to just think of not just think of medicine this morning when I think of Remedies okay uh I don't want you to think of just medicine there are hundreds of other remedies to fill the emotional inst stable person entertainment books music movies Fashions social media gaming sports role playing meditation concerts things that emotionally charge us a concert will emotionally charge us even Christian concerts now you trust me now even highly charged emotional gospel meetings even camp meetings that are emotionally charged and I'm not talking about the ones that are preaching the word of God in the right thing but emotionally charged will appeal to someone who's is drained emotionally but listen listen be careful because someone could be be be come into an emotionally charged atmosphere and be affected emotionally by it and get very excited but it still can be just a temporary emotional fix because when you go back you have the same addiction when you go back you have nothing to overcome with it's a deception just to present an emotional atmosphere so people feel so great at camp but then they don't feel so great when they get home P cost did that it's a charge emotionally many times and God was doing good things through that praise the Lord and He will do that but always be on guard that you don't fill your emotional instability with just another emotionally charged concert or service so something becomes addictive when physically and mentally we become dependent on a particular substance and unable to stop taking it without incurring adverse effects that's the meaning out of the dictionary of what addic addict being addictive is physically and mentally dependent on a particular substance and unable to stop taking it without incurring adverse effects in other words enthusiastically here another meaning to addictive enthusiastically devoted to a particular thing or an activity that's not Drugs That's enthusiastically devoted to a particular thing or an activity that can become an addiction and what's the addiction from trying to fill an emotional need people go to all kinds of sources to fill their emotional need and I'm here to tell you this morning some of them are good some of are own okay but we can't only go to those things we have to go to God even for our emotional and mental stability so the devil deceives Us in that that Bible oh this this there's nothing in here as I read there's nothing in here for me feeling emotionally unstable right now it's got to be something it's not in here that's a lie that's a lie in the presence of the Lord in his word as we as we stay with it young people stay with it read it say God reveal it to me cuz there is a filling of our emotional need even it fills our souls it fills our minds it fills our bodies even physical healing is in the word of God we can't buy into the deception that modern problems and the reason I'm feeling emotionally depleted because of an incident a trauma that happened the reason I the the the answer for it has got to be some somewhere else some people even seek emotional fing from their own families and I even do that you know we we love our families and so we we gravitate towards them but it's still limited it's still not the fulfilling that we need to fill with can I get an amen amen your wife your husband a boyfriend a girlfriend young people will will fill the void of their craving for fellowship and they think that the answer all is if I can just be closer to this person and and and they can feel and then they start doing it they start filling that void that craving that's within them and they this is the answer so now we need to do this we need to move on and so you have to be careful though because you have to fill your Void emotionally first with our lord Jesus first because if it's only in that boyfriend or girlfriend or that husband or wife it will disappoint you someday and you still feel a lack on the inside it has to be with our loving savior that we find that emotional stability so now uh we keep going back and it's feeling an emotional thing that we have need of but it's temporary many times it's not solving the problem but we keep going back and we keep going back we're still not settled and stable and our emotions are our thinking and so there's no sense being critical of dope addicts this morning and and marijuana there's no sense in yeah they're an addict they're addicted to that thing look at your own life what are you feeling your emotional need with more than likely there's something something calms you calms your nerves sometimes laughing calms our nerves and comedians will get us to laugh and we'll forget all of our problems because emotionally that's what it does but when we go back home we have the same problems we haven't solved the issues and we've been we've been refilled a little bit by laughter and we laugh and we enjoy it you can even come to church like this and temporarily feel good but there has to be something deeper in our lives something more lasting something more consistent I believe I'm going to bring that answer to you here this morning morning but the God on the mountain is still God in the valley and if you only like the god in the mountain and you're going to just travel to camp meetings and you only like to live on the emotional highs you haven't really got to know God in the valley yet and if you're going to grow in the Lord you have to know God in the valley because the same God that was in the emotional high can you say Amen is the same God that's with you in your lows and you cling to him you don't cling to some entertainment you don't cling to some relieving of your nerves if you have to do that medicine I'm not condemning that I'm just saying don't cling to that and not to God cling to God I don't understand anything right now I just want to see my life end please take me Lord take me home Henry has that song he wrote take me home take me home I have to play it to myself one time I have to play it because that's how you feel Lord just take me home end all of this I'm ready to go he's writing that because that's how you feel we're weak and God gets Glory when we're admitting that we're weak and that we cannot depend on anything else but God can you say Amen we're weak in ourselves and when we're weak then God can express his strength through our weakness it's humility to say I can't do this on my own and I'm not going to turn to something else to meet my emotional void turning to my God God I'm you don't think other prophets and other people in the Bible Christ said I've been mistreated i' it's been it's unfair I'm the hounds of hell are after me I've got a jezebel after me I don't know what it is but God I turn to you I will not turn to anything else I am emotionally instable right now and I'm willing to admit it but God I'm staying right here until you answer and you come and you feel this need you feel my emotional instability you make me stable I'm not preaching against things sometimes that would would relax us but we cannot we cannot make that the the fill all for being depleted emotionally we can't we can't do it and when Jesus said be careful that your hearts become overburdened and depressed by all this around you and your emotions are depleted you know all that pressure was in direct resistance and conflict to the scripture before that was our answer still Small Voice heavens and earth will pass away in front of you but my word is stable thank you for watching our message today if you would like more information please contact us by
