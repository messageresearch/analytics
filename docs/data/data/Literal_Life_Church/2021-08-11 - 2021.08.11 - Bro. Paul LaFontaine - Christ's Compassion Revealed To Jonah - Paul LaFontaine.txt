========================================

finishing up tonight brother paul are you going to be finishing tonight the jonah series tonight are you going to be finishing it well you know what i'll do my best to finish it just for you how about that matthew chapter nine we're going to read here in verse starting at verse 35 and just remembering in prayer i don't i couldn't hear all the prayer requests but remembering brother rowell our friend here at the church in philippines and his wife and he has covered now so let's just remember him we're thankful for brother jim babb coming out of it and many others that we prayed and we're very thankful to the lord tonight his healing touch but we want to remember brother rowell's a just a servant here with the church and been here many times so let's remember him he's deep in my heart tonight and also the pruitt family who lost their mom and brother pruitt's wife last week and we just pray that god will be with him in these days of loneliness and these days of missing her it's a huge vacuum i'm sure and i just pray that god will comfort their hearts and just be with the pruitt family and the church there amen matthew chapter 9 and verse 35 jesus went about all the cities and villages teaching in the synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing every sickness and every disease among the people but when he saw the multitudes he was moved with compassion on them because they fainted and were scattered abroad as sheep having no shepherd notice here jesus has compassion on the sheep that were scattered and also they had no leadership another and when you don't have a shepherd or you don't have the right kind of leadership you tend to follow the wrong type of leadership when you don't have the right shepherd then you tend to be overly influenced by other ones and when jesus seen that in these sheep his heart was moved his compassion he was moved with compassion for them verse 37 then saith he unto his disciples the harvest truly is plenteous but the laborers are few pray either for the lord of the harvest that he will send forth laborers into his harvest and i might add in back in the book of jonah the last scripture of the last chapter in the last scripture of jonah tonight chapter chapter 4 verse 11 and should not i spare nineveh that great city wherein are more than six score thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand and also much cattle should i not spare nineveh that great city with six thousand six excuse me more than six score thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left heavenly father we pray you'll bless your word tonight we're thankful for the ones who have come and those that are listening in and watching and we pray your word would go forth this evening i pray for my friend brother rowell and that you will raise him up lord that you will touch his body and his wife lord he's such an essential person to the area lord in the the country i pray you raise them up and any others lord in the country that are suffering i realize lord they've been locked down now for probably a year or more and just a trying time for them lord and i just pray you'll bless him and encourage his spirits lord and raise him up and or the other places that was mentioned tonight canada and different places lord you're able to turn things around you're able to override governments lord and we just ask you that you open up the churches father so the people can worship again override men's ideas and men's politics i pray lord open up the way for your saints we pray in jesus name amen amen god bless you tonight once you shake somebody's hand before you take your seat and god bless you for coming out to the house of god it's a joy to be here we always enjoy wednesday nights and the wednesday night crew and uh i know that it'll be a blessing to you i'm gonna play a short video for you and i wouldn't normally do this and i trust you're not offended please just work with me here uh but i've covered this whole jonah thing and then a few weeks ago i seen a little video and you've probably seen it before and uh and but i think this will be a blessing to you because she tells the whole story just within seven minutes and i wouldn't normally do this so please don't be offended but i thought you know i've been through this and i've preached what i preached and i'll finish tonight but this might be on a different level maybe for the children and i thought you would enjoy seeing this this evening so bear with me here in my folly if you would and you've probably seen this before but i thought this was pretty cute brother kyle if you want to pull that up the story of jonah long long ago there was a man named jonah who lived a good life and always obeyed god's laws he thought of himself as a true man of god joan was a hard worker through his labels he was able to buy chickens and a donkey and a goat one day god spoke to jonah jonah huh jonah who is that my earring ditch jonah i am the lord of god there is a city called nineveh far away it is filled with people that have become wicked lives they are forgotten about kindness and helping others why are you telling me about them god because i want you to go there and tell those wicked people i'm going to destroy them in their city because of their wicked ways yes lord i will go but they won't listen they're evil the more jonah thought about it more uneasy he became that night jonah did not sleep very well no ill hurt me nineveh is so far they'll laugh at me no jonah was denying god's plan for him nineveh those people don't even know about god why should they believe me they might even try to kill me more jonah thought about those wicked people the more frightened he became he decided to run away from god that very night he packed his clothes and hurried to the sheep for it that the next morning he saw a ship that was getting ready to share far across the sheet hope who goes there uh jonas sure uh please captain let me come with you i'll give you all my money for a place on your ship huh looks like trouble to me yes i wonder what he's running away from well i guess we can find a place for you jonah boarded the ship and hid deep in the hold as far away from god as he could at last he saw the anchor being drawn up onto the dick at last we're heading out to open sea god will never find me now i'm going to have a new light for myself as soon as the ship was fought with far from land god sent a storm for no one can hide from god said god sent great gusts flying over the sea and waves cashing over the ship men on dick we're taking on overboard captain we're shanking we need to overboard the ship throw the cargo overboard and all the sailors went under the when went inside the ship look he's sound asleep we need all hands on deck dick hey wake up wake up come we have no time to wake him now as the sailors closed the door joe no war fell asleep that outside it was dark as night the sailors began to throw the cargo overboard jonah ran a blind deck only one thing will save the ship stop stop you must throw me into the water instead what are you saying we can't throw an innocent man into this angry sea listen god has sent this storm to punish me punish why i tried to run away from him and now he has found me if we throw him over now he'll surely drown but the wind and the waves are too much for us we have no choice the sailors grabbed jonah and drew into the sheep the sea became calm down down down into the sea shank jonah gasping immediately drowning but god was not yet finished with jonah he sent a big fish to swallow jonah in one gulp jonah found himself in the stomach of a great fish oh it's so dark in here what will become for me now maybe god will still hear me jonah turn to the lord lord thank you for shaving me inside the fish jonah prayed for three days i'm sorry i tried to hide from you please let me out of this terrible prison i will do as you commanded god heard jonah and knew he had changed he made the fish spit out jonah onto the land thank you merciful lord for delivering me safely to land now jonah go to nineveh and tell those wicked people i am going to destroy them yes lord i'm listening i'm on my way jonah entered the city calling to the people people of nineveh listen to me the lord god will destroy you and your city stop your wicked ways watch did you hear that you have angered god he says the lord is angry with us why what have we done you are vain and shellfish maybe if we change our ways we've been too concerned with our fancy clothes you are greedy and unkind we should share our riches with the poor you are wasteful as the poor star we've been eating too much and not caring about our hungry neighbors it's true we've been selfish god will punish you we must all pray to the lord for forgiveness the people heard jonah prayed to god and me and began meaning their ways meanwhile god jonah climbed a hill above the city and sat down to watch god just destroy it he waited and waited i feel like a fool all my work has wasted god is not destroying nineveh jonah yes lord jonah will you never learn my love my love is great it is greater than my anger and it is for all my creatures didn't i give you another chance yes you did now i am giving the ninevites another chance go now jonah and try to love as i do then you will be a true man of god yay for god he has forgiven us so jonah began his long journey home and tried to love as god had taught him the end amen i i've had i've got all the children's attention right now i'll slowly lose it over the evening but i've got all of them looking praise the lord yes i look at youtube sometimes i know none of you do but sometimes i find something good on youtube i just don't know how she finishes what i've tried to preach in five services in seven minutes pretty much covered it didn't she amen praise the lord well we appreciate that and i just wanted to finish up tonight just a few thoughts from sunday and also just take it a little bit further in a couple scriptures the lord gave me and i know i mentioned sunday that i mentioned some things that went on personally in brother braham's life and i wanted to be a little bit more specific with that and he really come through some things like jonah and uh you know very similar in how god had to correct him and a few things and so i want to get into that we'll see how far we get tonight but hopefully we can finish up some of the things i'd like you to pay attention to matthew chapter 9 and make a few comments about jesus being moved with compassion for those sheep that have gone astray those sheep that it didn't have a shepherd and uh his compassion there was stirred up within him and uh other others could look at these sheep and look at these people these multitudes and and feel nothing but jesus could feel something jesus was stirred up in his heart jesus when he says that he was moved with compassion that means something was moved inside of him and it broke his heart and he felt something for these people where others didn't feel jesus felt he just didn't move on to the next campaign but he looked at them and he was moved with compassion that is what i want to be is that what you want to be tonight uh he was he was broke in his heart and i guess the opposite of being moved is being unmoved unmovable in your heart unmovable in your feeling unmovable in your compassion and being past feeling and overlooking the need of people that don't have leadership and i just say lord help us not to be to where our heart is unmoved would you raise your hand and say help me lord not to be in that place where my heart becomes unmoved but let my heart always be moved let my my spirit be moved with compassion let me let me never lose my feeling can you say amen this is a generation where we become numb by the sins of the world and numb by different politics and all these things going on and our feeling can jesus even said that the love of many would grow cold during the end time i don't want that to happen to me i want to stay with the fires of the holy spirit in my heart and burning for him my love of god comes natural but to stay on fire for him and keep the feeling of god that's what i want to keep and i don't want to just have love but we know have been taught by the prophet it's not just the love but it's when love projects that grace takes over so you can have the love of christ but it's when it's projected that it gets somewhere and so boy i'm just i'm moved by this scripture to see jesus and with his disciples and i just wanted to look at this because i suppose that many denominations and churches would look at jesus in this scripture and they'd see he turned to his disciple and he said pray that the lord sends laborers because the the need is great there's so many he looked at the multitudes he was moved with compassion and then he says pray the lord of harvest we'll send laborers we need more helpers there's a great job to do here and i suppose many of the big systems of churches would look at that and say that's what we need to do we need we need to employ more people we need more missionaries we need to employ missionaries to go over seed seas and we need to we need to send more the more the better we need helpers we need more bodies we need more volunteers jesus said we we need more servants and people with servants hearts and you know what servant's hearts mean that's chair stackers that's what one guy said it means he's a good cheer stacker well we believe servant's heart means something more than that here but that's what they think we need more bodies we need more volunteers we need more laborers but let's not forget the point that jesus is making his subject is we need more moved with compassion for the lost because you see you can have a lot of bodies and a lot of volunteers but are they move with compassion you could send a bunch of them overseas but if the holy spirit isn't moving them and they have a burden and they recognize the need and they want to help fulfill that need they in other words you have to be moved in your heart to be used of the lord if you want to be a laborer in his kingdom it's not mechanical it said i do it because i love people and i see there's sheep grown astray i want to be a witness i want to be a help to his kingdom can you say man so lest we just make it mechanical he's asking not just for laborers but he's asking for more of us to be moved with compassion for the lost not just more bodies the sheep are being misled and notice in this scripture says they are without a shepherd and so this is one of the reasons that he's moved with compassion is that the sheep have gone astray and that's what happens with us when people we see people go astray or we see friends leave what they believe before or we see people get uh just go at a certain direction and then it moves our heart but he's moved because they have no shepherd and that's what moved him because why they were being misled and one thing i want you to catch tonight as we go through jonah a little bit and also brother branham and speak about his life i want you to notice that many times it's because people are misled that they're going the direction they are and we have to remember that to have compassion for them because it's not always just the thing that they made a decision themselves they got away from god's shepherding and they're being influenced by what's on the internet they're being influenced by other spirits they're going down a direction but it's not always all of them and we're going to find brother benham said that sometimes it's god's people but they're being misled and so we have to have a compassion and not write them off can you say man but we have to realize they're just off track because they're like sheep going astray they've been misled they've under the wrong we do that with a young person you can watch them go through their stages of under all kinds of different influences and you can be very critical or you can pray for them love them admonish them in a godly way but if you get overly critical you have to realize they have to go through stages of learning and getting influenced by the wrong thing and we pray them right back again a lot of times you have to be careful because you'll you'll damage their heart too quickly by criticizing them and they're just under an influence for a season is that okay with everybody every one of us are susceptible to be influenced by the wrong spirit sometimes and if that can happen with you you say well not me i don't go out there and do that and wear those type of dresses those young girls are wearing and those things but you see you might be influenced by the wrong doctrine the wrong preacher right so all of us unless we stay close to the holy spirit can be influenced just like a young person or a kid can and so because of that we should have grace in our hearts and say they may be under an influence right now but god moved me with compassion to pray for them until they're restored back again so there's something about his being moved by this about the sheep going astray it touched him it made him feel for them he wanted to he wanted to do something about it and appeal to to more laborers that we need people it's not just that we need more people we need more people with holy ghost compassion and love praise the lord i began this series with this quote so i'm going to put it up again out of god doesn't call a man to judgment without first warning him and brother brahm said this is the reason i went into this series jonah took a different attitude he gets on top of the hill and said well it'd be a good if i never was born and oh how he went on and god had a little gourd to come up and make him some shade till he got cooled off up there but he said now here i went down there and they're going to say i'm a false prophet and god spoke to him and said look at the city down there look here jonah that whole city is repenting with sackcloth and ashes and then he told him about the little gourd and the worm that it cut down one day the lord willing i want to come to the tabernacle and take a series just on jonah oh there's so many great that east wind blowing and all oh my there's so many things in there it's it's thrilling them nuggets in there it all types right in fit it even brings jesus christ in it and everything else i'm certainly not replacing what the prophet could do in a series but that intrigued me to show there's a lot more in here than what we read on the surface i found the mystery of god in here i found that the first part of jonah's life type christ going in the tomb for three days and coming out but the last part types the bride that has to come to a victory in divine love and burn all the stubbornness out of us all the resentment all the bitterness can you say man if we're going to be effective for the lord with the wonderful message that we hold then we cannot have anger unresolved anger in our hearts we cannot have prejudice in our heart we can have we can we can't have a lack of something to where it would cause us to to not have feeling for the people we must have holy ghost feeling and affection for the people not compromise but we must have something that goes with this message it's not just having truth but it's it's it's the things that go with truth it's how truth is presented amen and it all comes in the spirit of christ so christ is revealed in the very last verse of jonah 4 11 the very last verse the depth of christ mercy compassion and forgiveness is revealed to jonah the last verse of the bible speaks of jesus christ and it's revealed that's what i want to tell this tonight the the compassion of christ revealed to jonah jonah was in the let me just say it this way all right jonah was in the message and declared the message but now the christ of the message was being revealed to jonah can i say it again jonah was in the message called to the message and even proclaimed the message but he hadn't yet seen the christ of the message to affect him yet and bring a tremendous victory in divine love so that's why i say if you look up the word truth there's words that go with it many times in the bible truth and mercy truth and love truth is usually never by itself it goes with something and that's because if we just held truth without the character christ without the love of christ without the forgiveness of christ then it's missing the element to it but if we're going to be a proclaimer of truth which i believe we have been blessed with restored truth like no other people has been blessed i i feel so blessed tonight i i just don't know how to thank the lord for what he's placed in our hands in the last days i look at people and i have compassion them because a lot of times it's they don't have light upon the scripture even and i'm blessed with much light tonight on the bible that i can understand things i thank god for it i don't deserve all this light that i hold within me i don't deserve all this revelation but there's one thing for sure i don't want to be stingy with it i don't want to have an attitude with it i want to be a light to this world expressing the character of jesus christ if they're going to see the message let it be more than doctrine let them see let them see the revealing of jesus christ and that's the last verse it's jonah was in the message declared the message but now the christ of the message was revealed to jonah let me say this god released his forgiveness to the ninevites but jonah had not released his forgiveness to the ninevites i'm summing up tonight god had released his forgiveness already to the ninevites but jonah was missing it to release something releasing him and release his anger and say let me get rid of my anger and let me be let me my forgiveness be released to them too now i know it's the same i know it's christ in us but this as we look at brother branham's life now he he himself admits he says i need a little change in me didn't need to be born again again didn't have a lack of the holy ghost but he'd come along there as god looked at him and there's just something laying there and he says god told me not to do this i was doing this wrong god told me not to think about it this way god told me not to have this attitude towards certain ones he's correcting me so it wasn't a problem with brother brahms experience can you say amen but it's something deeper that had to happen in him can you say amen that if there's some part of anger and the thing about anger friends anger holds back the forgiveness of god anger hold if you've got christ within you anger holds it back anger makes you withhold everything that's good in you anger makes you withhold it but when you resolve your anger and and just get rid of all that then everything that's within you gets released to the people how do we know that because god himself is a god of anger can you say amen but psalms is full of scriptures that says he gets he's passed his anger and his his compassion he's full he's full of compassion and his anger doesn't last very long he does get angry but it doesn't last very long because something is released to the people if christ is within us how many would raise your hand boldly and say i believe i have christ living within me that christ needs to be released and it can be held back by anger so god had forgiven god had released his forgiveness which jonah didn't understand especially when he spoke you people are going to die i give you 40 days it's over and he went on the hill to sit down as brother brahm said and watch this whole thing be destroyed i'm going to get my popcorn i'm going to sit up on the hill and i'm going to watch what i said is going to come to pass and all of a sudden it wasn't happening and down in nineveh god had to come and tell them they have repented and so now god releases his forgiveness to this whole ninevites was it supposed to happen that way but god is short in his anger he won't hold his anger forever when he's seen what he need to see i'm gonna show you two things tonight that he's seen number one was repentance he's seen repentance but he's seen something else and when that happened it released his forgiveness but but god released his forgiveness anger the anger in jonah held back his acceptance his forgiveness god's compassion released forgiveness to them but it was for what god seen in the ninevites and here's number one they repented and number two he's bringing out in verse 11 that did you know jonah that they cannot even discern between their right hand and their left hand and they could not discern that here it is god released his forgiveness because they could not discern the condition that they were in amen were they in sin were they making god angry it got worse every day but god discovered these men can't even tell their left hand from the right and that's not just naturally but that means they did not have the knowledge or the discernment i don't know how many years it heaped up in sin but they did not know that they were in this life of sin they had no revelation that they were living that way are you holding on to my point now are you seeing christ in this are you seeing christ at calvary and what he said from the cross they had no they did not understand and god was angry at their sin but he seen something deeper they were so blind to it all they did not know or have any discernment of the condition they were in they had what the bible calls a their understanding was darkened darkness blackness is a lack of understanding spiritually light is revelation when light comes the people get revelation understanding they see where they're at if light doesn't come or they reject light they live in their darkness and that means that they not only start sinning they not only develop a life full of sinning but the worst part is is that light has come and they reject the light so they live in this darkened understanding of things in other words they're blind they're blind they don't have the discernment to tell what's right or wrong somebody tell me what generation that is no more discernment about what's right and wrong for that matter no can't even tell say clearly this is a boy and this is the girl can't do it anymore they'll defy science and biology and everything but their mind is so darkened they won't admit no if that boy girl chooses a different way it's their choice what arrogance is that amen what kind of arrogance are we raising when you say if i decide if it's against god if it's against science if it's against biology if it's against everything we can see it doesn't matter because i decided it's going to happen the parents are going to support it that's a darkened generation that's that's a generation that has no discernment that's a generation paul says it in the bible whose conscience has been seared with a hot iron because there used to be you'd have a conscience of right and wrong never mind the holy ghost just the conscience of what's right but when you get to the place the conscience is seared there's nothing left that's our generation and uh they were so blind they did not know i have any discernment of condition they were in a darkened understanding and he says jonah shouldn't i spare these people who not only are in sin but don't know who they are don't know they are in sin and don't know how to get out amen it's one thing to be in sin it's another level not to know that you're in sin or how you got there or how you get out oh the love of the lord when he brings you in it might take you years but he'll show you what life you were living he'll show you how you got there he can show you the very moment where you got off track he can go back and just it just in your whole life because he's got he's got the blueprint for your life i tell young people this he he's he's got it all he was aware of it all and he can point you back this is where this started wasn't the prophet doing that in the prayer lines can you say man and the thing i preach is a god that would know so perfectly your past wouldn't he know your future just as well praise the lord he went there into those vision and discernment and he pegged and said you were with the doctor here and he said this and this happened when you were young and and just pegging the very moment this nervousness started or the very moment this sin started that's when you got off track god knows friends god knows our lives and if he knows the past he knows the future brother brahm said that he says don't you think in this prayer line that the god that can show me that you that vision don't you think the same god could tell me that you're going to be healed from today on amen he's the god of the past but he's the god of the future praise the lord and i love a god like that can you say amen it's one thing to be in sin it's another level to not know it or to not know how you got there and to be blind and to not have leadership and to get under the wrong influence and to fall and so the forgiveness gets released from god based on the ignorance of the people so he did not destroy them because they repented and because they didn't know what they were doing which is in jesus jesus words it this way he asked god to forgive them at the cross for they know not what they do so that you know what that covered all all of us that would be his bloodshed and the spirit going throughout generation through his word that would be his blood that go through before we were even born we go through our life we start living a life of sin before we give our heart to the lord and start we go we go through we're going through it not knowing what we're doing not knowing who we truly are his blood begins to come there and he says father forgive them he's asking the father to go ahead and release the forgiveness and and we're not even born yet but he's all looking on the crowd as i said he's looking at the crowd that's killing him jews his own people but he knew they didn't know what they were doing if they didn't know what they were doing they wouldn't have been crucifying their messiah they're still looking for their messiah and 2 000 years ago they killed him they sent him to pontius pilate they took care of him can you imagine now us how how does it happen that you're looking at your very own people and they're the ones that's orchestrating put you on the cross but forgiveness was released because he knew they did not know what they were doing that's powerful friends i'll release my forgiveness anyway i'm gonna let god i'm gonna ask you lord to forgive them i'm gonna stand in the gap for them right now i got a child they're wild they're a wild child they're embarrassing me on the internet but god i'm gonna ask you to release your power i'm going to ask you to release your forgiveness i'm going to ask you to release it lord and not have some type of standard they have to come through that before they're forgiven to say lord they need your power they need your change they need your forgiveness [Music] father forgive them they don't even know what they're doing now for a parent that's hard to say because a parent can easily say they know what they're doing i taught them better than that and i understand that part and there's a lot of rebellion and there's ones that do know but do they know by the holy ghost or do they know by you by what you put in their heads [Music] so you understand how the lord's taken us deeper how we judge things we could say they know better i taught them better that they grew up in a better church than that and so mentally now we're thinking that they know better how in the world can we get that result but you're only looking at it from from a mental standpoint and you may not know what's going on in that heart i don't i'm not here tonight to justify sin i'm not here to say just justify everything they're doing i'm not here don't push like on every wrong thing they're doing you're not helping that kid by pushing like that's my child i'm going to like what they're doing like like like like like i wouldn't be doing that but you don't have to like or unlike they know what you like and don't like they know what you believe can you say but it's not about you trying to fix them so that you look better to the whole world it's getting deeper saying father they need something they don't know what they're doing they really don't know what they're doing until they have a real experience the true experience they're operating from a mental uh a conscience or something and somebody who doesn't have the holy ghost and tries to live this message for years there's some people that max out because it's too hard to live without the holy ghost i'm not justifying their sin can you say man but we have to remember this is lived by a personal personal relationship with jesus christ a holy ghost a conversion can you say amen amen so who of any of us can tell can come down say this person they have it and they don't who who could do that we've tried to do it in the message for years and yet someone asked a question brother brahma i want you to tell us one thing that we can put our finger down and say this person has the holy ghost and this person don't brother brandon he was asked about it he says there's not a way in the world for you to do it and yet he preached all the fruits of a person's life he preached so many things that you could see this holy spirit evidence in our life but then he brings us back to the evidence it's not just fruits or it's not just dress wear you know what the evidence of the holy ghost is talk because you can't go that direction if you keep going a direction to make the evidence of the holy ghost dress where you become a denomination even though we believe in holy dress we believe in separating dress we leave guys be men girls be girls and all these other things but you can't go down that path too much like some churches have where you make the evidence now i can tell they have the holy spirit the bible says there's not a way in the world for you to do it that's right why because only god can see the innermost part of what's going on inside amen so we pray we pray earnestly and we can even say father forgive them brother brown said some places it was their only hope because somebody abraham up on the mountain was praying for law and it was the only hope he had amen we're standing in the gap father forgive them they don't know what they're doing they said that on the internet lord if they know what they're then they shouldn't said it but lord if they don't know what they're doing god forgive them change them love them draw them rebuke them in your way shock them shake them amen praise the lord amen father please forgive them now they don't know what they're doing so this this is christ in the last verse in other words forgiveness was not held back until they could see what they were doing completely go ahead and say amen i need a drink i just got thirsty forgiveness was not held back until certain requirements were made forgiveness not held back until they could see what they were doing completely because to see the wickedness of their ways completely forgiveness was not held back i tell you friends i'm sometimes i'm into a subject here that i'm just saying lord teach me because i feel like i'm i'm not treading upon waters that's not it's not something that's not solid here but it's new territory for me because i'm sometimes the guy that says how much do we do this and compromise those are the questions that i weigh which you have too but you cannot none of us have a right to withhold the love and forgiveness of god we don't have a right to withhold it amen so forgiveness not held back until they could see what they're doing wrong completely jonah's compassion and forgiveness was withheld it was held back because his anger was still there his anger was unresolved and we've explored why it was there but but his anger was still there and resolved his forgiveness could not be released because his anger was not resolved his compassion was limited to things instead of souls and that's what he preached sunday his compassion and his pity was on the gourd his compassion everybody remember the gourd from sunday remember the plant and remember that he was having such sympathy uh not empathy somebody came up sunday and told me there's a difference in sympathy and empathy empathy is deeper right sympathy i'm sorry that that happened to you empathy enters into the need of a person but here's jonah having sympathy for this plan you poor thing look at you you look what the worm did to you and just all this pour himself into this thing instead of souls his compassion was poured into something or a plant or something instead of souls and it was having sympathy it was relating and i can relate to you the plant that's been destroyed the gore you poor gourd that was destroyed by this worm it's not fair you're a victim and i can sympathize with you and cry with you because i'm a victim too i'm a victim you're a victim everybody's a victim wouldn't you like to be a victim too victim mentality now you're he's sympathizing with something like that and ignoring ignoring these souls that's right and i think i preached that enough sunday is that we're getting off track when we put such emphasis on things instead of souls is that okay with everybody jonah's compassion was forgiveness was withheld he held it back because anger is still there and when anger is still unresolved this is a bit of teaching tonight teaching and preaching so it's treaching his anger was still there and when anger is unresolved your forgiveness cannot be released his compassion was limited to things instead of souls plants and things made him happier than people he didn't even really like being around people he didn't like people plants and things made him happier than people he didn't even really like to be around people too much i'd rather just be alone with my whatever i don't need people it just doesn't work that way amen from the very way god created us in the beginning he said it is not good for man to be alone he made us relational god is relational god didn't want to be alone so he created sons and daughters of god so he could fellowship with you you know tonight wednesday was one of the purposes that god had from the beginning when he was alone i'm going to create sons and daughters so they'll come to church on wednesday night and i can fellowship with them they'll talk to me and worship and i'll speak back to them you're in the fellowship that god had wanted before the foundation of the world god was lonely he wanted fellowship god's a relational being he made us relational beings you can't be an island to yourself it's not going to solve anything i'm going to go away with all my anger it's not going to jonah said i'll die with my anger i don't need nobody i don't need the ninevites i don't need anybody and yes i'm better off with my anger and i'll die with it that's how stubborn he got people go off to themselves and they think that's the answer it's not the answer there needs to be a release of your anger so there can be a release of your forgiveness [Applause] blessed be his name turn with me if you would in matthew chapter 18. matthew 18. and i'm aware of the time yes matthew 18 and verse uh just towards the end here jesus here's another expression of this god's forgiveness must be expressed also in us it's not just god forgiving but we also must express the forgiveness of god and it says here in verse 23 i think it is matthew 18 23 therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king which would take account of his servants and when he had begun to reckon one was brought unto him which owed him ten thousand talents but for as much as he had not to pay his lord commanded him to be sold and his wife and children and all that he had and payment to be made that was under the law even the old testament is that how that's how you paid your debt if you got in debt you paid with your land but you also also paid with your family it'd sell your family your wife and your children all that he had and payment to be made verse 26 the servant therefore fell down and worshipped him saying lord have patience with me and i will pay the all then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion uh oh underline it there's the term again that's right the lord of that servant was moved with compassion and loosed him and forgave him the dead he asked he asked for time he showed humility can you say amen and forgiveness was released to him does anybody learn anything tonight amen it was loose to him compassion was loose to him forgiveness was loose to him he forgave him but the same servant went out and found one of his fellow servants which owed him a hundred pence and he laid hands on him and took him by the throat oh my goodness saying pay me what thou owest and his fellow servant fell down in his feet and he saw him saying have patience with me and i will pay thee said the same very same words he just said to his lord same words same humility but guess what no forgiveness is released to this guy his fellow servant fell down his feet he saw him saying have patience with me and i will pay thee and he would not but went and cast him into the prison so he should pay the debt so when his fellow servants saw what was done they were very sorry and came and told the lord that all was done then his lord after that he had called him said unto him oh thou wicked servant i forgave thee all that debt because thou desirest me should us not thou also have had compassion on my fellow servant even as i had pity on thee are you learning something here amen god doesn't look at it just he's forgiving but this forgiveness trickles down into our lives to others if he's going to release his forgiveness then we can't hold ours back oh say ouch or something should it not thou hast had compassion thy fellow servant and even i lay pity on thee and his lord was wroth and delivered them to the tormentors till he should pay all that was doing to him so likewise also shall my heavenly father do also unto you if ye from your hearts forgive not everyone his brother their trespasses so i don't have to bring it down home to a brother trespassing against you jesus did it himself he brings it right down to your life every day and if somebody do you wrong this scripture applies don't run to god and say god please forgive me give me time god please forgive my debt and then you turn around and not offer that to someone else something's wrong with this picture it doesn't work that way in the forgiveness of god forgiveness is not meant to be held back forgiveness is meant to be released can i get an amen tonight love and forgiveness and all these elements that we have within us friend that come from the holy ghost they're never meant to be held up you don't have a right to hold them back give them to some people not give them the other give them to another person not give them to other no it's to be released get given out can you say amen it's to flow through us but what about this what about that what if what if they did what if they do it again to me just just release the forgiveness of god so brother as i'm moving along here now brother bradham had a season that he went through and he called it a complex and it was from the people not listening to him and not responding and following the word like he felt like they should he preached around he said it seemed like i go to a certain city and i preach and the next year i come back it seems the people get worse and so he over time this built up he called it a complex and the people weren't obey him and then he says i had lost the feeling of the people he hadn't lost his gift he hadn't lost his holy ghost he hadn't lost his ministry he hadn't lost going to church he hadn't lost his friends something happened internally in him that really only him and god could see and then he finally admitted it that we must not lose the feeling of the people he's still preaching he preached the seals having this holding there in his heart my timeline shows when he referred back that this was going throughout when he preached the seven seals which to me was the the such a climax to what he was used of the lord to bring from the lamb of god and here he's preaching through all this time and internally this is happening and he i'm not saying this he admitted i have lost the feeling for the people still preaching to them the people are still being blessed people are still being healed but it's just interesting to me friends that it's a it's a lesson for all of us that we can be functioning and everything going we can be coming to church and god can bless us and he can bless our finances if we're faithful with this and all this can be going on but we really need to pay attention to where our motives are going where our spirit's going internally because all of a sudden something can happen and you're going in a certain direction and your heart is just going another way this is what was happening to him that's right and for him he finally admitted he said i realized that i had lost the feeling of the people he says here in the book of revelations when you get to latest in church age revelations the third so now i'm just going to read some things i've got plenty of time well i got 10 minutes but just hold with me here okay and i know once i get to a certain point i know that you're going to be all for me continuing this on another service you'll get a certain point say yeah maybe you ought to finish it another time but this is so good we just want to take our time with it this is good for me i don't know how you're feeling but this has been a great lesson for me because i believe the message and i believe i have the love of christ with me and i believe i've expressed it but i want to take god's hint when he says that there's still some prejudice in there is if i'm holding back something i want to know what it is because i don't have a right to hold that back now the book of revelations when we get to the latest in church age in the revelation the third chapter the bible said that this age the earliest and age was blind because you're rich you say you're rich and you're creased with goods greatest churches the finest dressed people the greatest that there isn't been any age because you say i have need of nothing noahust thou not that thou are poor miserable wretched naked blind and don't know it now if a man was in this condition and you could tell his tell him his condition and and would try to help himself if he was mentally right but when he's in that condition and you can't tell him any different he just don't believe that he's naked he doesn't believe that he's in that shape then it shows that here that he is blind the god of this world has blinded the eyes of those that refuse to serve christ and they're they're so blind that they can't see the sign that we're living in this hour the time that we're living in and remember there's already been one stand in the gap and no one else can stand this is in the message standing in the gap you either have to accept that that remedy or you're doomed and now to us to get close now to what i want to say could we stand now i'm preaching to myself in this could we stand and see a human being that's blind physically blind and know that he's walking over a cliff could we of our state of mind that we're in this morning could we stand and see a blind man walk over a cliff line and not try to warn him it would be there it would be so cruel we would be so indifferent in our heart could you imagine a person getting so indifferent that he could almost laugh and see a blind man that cannot see and can't help himself deliberately walk over a cliff that would be a bad thing do nothing about it well to my brethren world over i want to make this confession i humbly say it that that's just about what i was doing or fixing to do i didn't say that he said you know he's getting ready to leave the ministry over this complex and losing the feeling of people he's getting ready and making plans to exit the ministry that's right but you see even the great saint paul and this is the next quote in indictment even the great saint paul got between straits one time and many times that god has did things or let servants do it that was mistakes in order to prove these things now we know that human beings can make mistakes but god can make no mistake now if i get into the field of preaching and going that the way i do then i have to set up meetings ahead and get things lined up and perhaps this is that great time coming that we've been looking for and surely if this is in itself a tremendous thing that will bring to pass and may come to pass the tremendous victory in the love divine and that's the verb before the adverb then it's divine love which is god see and then it takes the love of god to dash out there on the front line and stand in the gap for the people and these um so this notice the sermon now god's showing him if there's no one to stand in the gap if there's no one to pray if moses wouldn't have stood in the gap god would have destroyed the people somebody's got to stand in the gap and sometimes it's only you that'll stand in the gap for somebody you have to have a feeling to do that you have to have love to do that and then it takes the love of god to dash out there on the front line and stand in the gap for the people and these rickeys and raketas that have so sassed the words and i've called them ricky and ricketta god give me to understand i shouldn't do that because that's many of them are still his children they can't help because they act so much different some of these old cold former churches has got them that spirit on them and they're much in in a person as israel was in prison as much israel was in prison just as much moses went down to deliver them from slavery human beings that loved jesus christ would serve him if they only knew what to serve him by and they're in bondage under denominationalism that tells them don't you do this and don't you do that so this is the term he started to use in 58 the rickies and raquettas and it's probably related to ricky nelson elvis he mentioned all those names and now all the world wants to follow the ricky nelsons and act like the recognizance but the biggest problem is when they tried to bring it in the church and now all of them were acting on stage like ricky nelson like elvis it was a deception and so he he didn't hold back this is the term he gave him rickey's and rickettas ricky's over and over and over again and here he says god showed me that i shouldn't do that because of the influence that they have been under of the denominations that taught them that's okay so when you look at it like who's at fault here they're at fault yes but who's that real thought he's looking deeper than just saying i'm going to take this person and quickly lay them label them a ricky and ricketta and that's it and take a personal stab at him but he's looking at a different god saying now wait a minute now when you look at the denominational systems and all that's been taught by the clergy that's failed in the word of god to tell them truth you've got a generation that's up there on the stage got the stage looks like a rock and roll concert and they i wouldn't call it ricky's today but they look like the justin bieber let's bring it up today justin bieber on the stage in the church trying to worship looking like justin bieber so i'll call him beepers brother brown i'm calling him ricky's america i'll call them beepers and he began to slam that and seen it come in the pentecostals even to some of the quartets and too much showmanship in the stage he labeled him ricky's up there ricky's up there rookies up there i know he'd get quiet but he did they're showing off instead of the sincerity of worshiping god it becomes just a big show even in the quartets and he's ricky's ricardo these ricky's but see god comes and corrects them a little bit and realizes that is it all their fault they're under an influence i said they're under an influence so you can keep labeling that that's fine but it's not going to do any good until another influence comes in their life and that stronghold is broke can you say amen amen and who ultimately is responsible then in the next one he's bringing an indictment but the indictment is on the entire church world and the clergy that lead the people the wrong way misleading souls a lot of times i look at young people and if they're acting a certain way i look at how they were raised i look at their influence i look a lot before i quickly judge where they're at because to me sometimes they're a product of the influence that they've been under so yeah you could you could really come down and say they're all fault are they all at fault if a preacher abuses his authority and abuses the people on the judgment day will it be the sheep that answers for all of that the lord i'm really into it here tonight i'm just asking the the brother branham is being led by the lord to look at this different that's right and he said human beings that love jesus would serve him if they only know what to serve him by and they're in bondage under denomination that tells them don't do this and don't do that don't believe in that crazy stuff don't believe in that don't believe in that and and so the devil's telling to and yet and influence him to be like the world but don't believe what he's bringing in the message who's responsible for that oh friends i could say a lot right now who's responsible when parents misdirect a child against this message or hold your heart back from this message who's going to be responsible well they're acting like a wild person out there but who started who planted seeds to make them afraid of the message tell you the reckoning day is coming someday and it won't just be honing in on that person that's living out the sin it'll be a bigger picture than that he says an indictment how can you be a part of that word when you deny practically all of it and the so he's referring to him god correcting him and the reason it's done is because not because the people that's the reason i think god spoke to me about calling out the people the rickies and rickettes god spoke to the prophet about calling his people the reikis and ricketts these are quotes that you don't hear sometimes because they don't want to admit that god had to correct the prophet or he made him many mistakes god spoke to me about calling his people rickies and ricketts it's because of these selfish denominations has got those people living out there in the way that they're living you know i know something he continued to use the terms rickies and rickettas a lot so you know what i say to that i say that it wasn't what it's not wrong for god's prophet to rebuke what he sees it's the motive and the spirit that he was doing it in to hone in on that person and god's trying to it may not just be that person it's their influence because he said it you can you can search it from 63 he's still saying rick he's in ricketts and he's still the holy ghost has tell him to call out those things because that's what it is but what changed what changed god wanted the prophet's heart to change how he looked at it and look at it in the bigger picture come on friends haven't we had this happen in the message for years we think we're going to do a service by going in and just destroying quickly someone who's not wearing the right thing and you you run in there and just jump really quickly we've done it for years if i can just get this corrected everything the church will be all right if i can just make them do the right thing my home will be all right and you found it wasn't true because god is a relational being they're a relational being they have a soul can i get an amen i don't justify sin i don't justify dressing in modest any of that i'm just saying our approach you have to realize we're not just praying to change their dress we're praying that god will change their influence is that okay we're praying for a whole change and not just an outward change he continued to use the term but he had change in his heart and the feeling he had a feeling for them god did not say to not rebuke the rickies he corrected the prophet to know they are acting that way because of the wrong influence and all of a sudden now forgiveness was released brother brahm did not leave the ministry thankfully and forget what was happened through this rebuke to the prophet forgiveness was released it goes through all the way to the message shalom you can read it i'd refer to it sunday he cares do you care all this that he had done in the prophet and and it's it's have an effect on him that he has even a more effective ministry because he's preaching even in a greater way an anointing because why internally down here he knows his position that he may not be able to correct all of those things that he sees on the outside but he's got a message he's he's preaching the holy ghost and he has within him what to preach for a real change he has light he has the light and if you've got the light let the light go forth and do its work on the darkness is that okay with everybody amen i love that now i i just can't leave tonight without reading this this last week i was looking for this quote and uh couldn't find it couldn't work it right to get it right and i wanted to read it before we closed tonight and i think this sums it up a lot i just i love if you if you want to go through you'll find this and standing in the gap then he refers to it here in the indictment i read it to you where he says god told me not to do not to do that and not to look at it that way he comes up to a few messages later and humble thyself and he says i need a little change in my life not so much he needed to be saved again or anything like but i he said i just i'm going to wait to pray i need a little change and he referred to the little changes being that attitude that he spoke of towards those if i speak the word and they reject it well that's up to them let him go he said no i should be running down the river and continue to pray and continue to speak to them and continue to reach out to them all along then he comes up 64. first message 64 shalom and he says is it because the people don't know what they're doing there's a lot of good people out there but they're under darkness and they don't know the state that they're in what's it going to take be a light share share light with them that's right and let the light do the work to break the darkness but meanwhile meanwhile there's a real love for someone who's under darkness and don't know the condition they're in don't they know better than that and these days they may not so you can write them off but they may not know by understanding what they're doing at all so i was looking for this quote and then all of a sudden a brother for the alex mcgillis after he heard what i preached he sent me this quote he said brother that's the one i was looking for and this is what it says you're going to love this well you might he might be repenting after this some of us yeah that one brother kyle if i have found grace in your sight through god you take my word for this brethren if you want to be a blessing and get a blessing go ahead stand up you can stand up come on if you want to be a blessing and get a blessing when a man has done you wrong and he is absolutely justly he i mean he has done you wrong and you know that he's done you wrong he's done you evil don't mention that well there's a lesson right there you're not supposed to talk about everybody else hello don't mention that we talked to everybody about it don't mention that you take him to prayer before god next and don't take it in a way of just a selfish and say well i'm supposed to do this but stand with your shoulder to his shoulder and stand in the presence of god our father way a prayer should be made in the presence of god say father he's my brother and he is justly he deserves punishment because he has done me evil and i don't see why he did it then let god do talk let god go to talking to you and you'll see maybe what that man's been through the devil has twisted him up somewhere and caused him to do that amen though he's absolutely wrong before you leave the throne of god you'll be feeling sorry for that man stop right there you'll be you'll be feeling sorry for this is what prayer does this is what forgiveness is this is what softening your heart does instead of acting and telling everybody about stuff acting in your anger instead of saying he's done me wrong that's it it's over yes people do you wrong all the time i'm sure they do you're wrong your bosses and your husbands or wives or whatever sometimes they they do it wrong they stay wrong they accuse you wrong this is what the prophet says to deal with it don't mention anybody go to prayer about it and you put yourself that here's what he's doing god will go to talking to you and you'll see maybe what that man's been through the devil has twisted him up somewhere and caused him to do that though he's absolutely wrong before you leave the throne of god you'll be feeling sorry for that man why because you're looking at it from a different light from heaven's perspective you'll be sympathizing with that next quote you'll be sympathizing with that and when you get back down to earth again you'll go over to that brother and shake his hand because you know what he's been through oh lord jesus help us let's not let's let this penetrate into us because i know some of you hold grudges and you haven't went to that brother and shook his hand no he's done he's finished i've forgiven him really it's a strange way to express it no you haven't released forgiveness yet i already prayed about it but he's saying this is the effect of our prayer when you come back down earth you go over that brother and shake his hand because you know what he's been through you can't stand with a mortal in the presence of god and condemn anybody i don't believe no sir even if he's a rank sinner and what about a brother that has made a mistake though i say he's wrong sometimes he's accused wrong when he's not wrong you better know your information first but if he is wrong well if he will take him to the throne of god stand there shoulder shoulder with our brother knowing his immoral mortal and maybe his destination rest upon our attitude towards him powerful words from god's prophet powerful words lord let it be more than just a quote i need more of this can you say amen i need to look at it from heaven's perspective i need to grow into maturity this way my compassion needs to go deeper than what it is and if i can be that vessel that stands in the gap and he may be to realize his internal destination is based upon my response my response to this whole thing may god help us to watch our response he brought a bunch of things he could be wrong you ever consider that it could look like he's wrong and it isn't the devil twisted him up he is wrong or it could could be hearsay see it could be you get in the presence of the lord you realize we've done wrong too done the wrong things and so you just start to feel a comrade with that brother you realize that no matter how dastardly he's done you bad how could we do it like the little girl said that god said to jonah did i forgive you when you ran away from me and jonah had to admit yes so if i forgave you why can't you forgive these ninevites heavenly father gracious are your words to us lord precious lord jesus we know that these things that you give us these even even these little things that the prophet went through they're they're there for a reason lord you're watching over all things you were watching over him and you're watching over us lord you want to shepherd and guide this people the last days into this victory in divine love you're guiding us into it lord and it's more than just a shout it's more than just a dance it's more than just a hallelujah lord i want to give more than a hallelujah i want to praise my god but i want to live more than just a hallelujah lord i want the very as we see in jonah seeing this here christ manifested that when i look i can see through god's eyes every situation every one lord from a ranked center to a brother who's done us wrong grow this church this lord i don't care if it ever grows in numbers i don't care if it ever grows in big conventions and big meetings i love that lord but i'm asking you lord to grow this church under the holy spirit leadership in divine love and i remember your prophet saying way back in 55 he says in all the gifts that we pentecostals have and all that will be set up on the mantle as it were someday and he said the holy ghost will take the church over in such a divine love that there will be healings come from that there will be new births come from that there'll be changes come from that just by divine love functioning in a body we're gonna get there lord because you promised it i'm gonna make it because you promised it we really need more of your compassion we really need to be moved by it lord we need the feeling in our hearts when the prophet lost his feeling he says i just got to get that feeling back that i had for the people lord at the end there is standing gap he says i'm going to go back on the road i'm ready to go god's done something in my heart i got that feeling my heart for the people may we have godly empathy and not just sympathy may your love and mercy and forgiveness melt our anger crush our anger lord make his holy spirit filled believers ready at any time lord to worship you ready at any time to be used of you ready at any time lord to release the word to people to release grace to people to release forgiveness we don't have a right to hold it back lord jonah was holding it back but lord you released it to the ninevites because they repented and because lord they really didn't know the state of the state they were in so he said i'm gonna go ahead and change and release my forgiveness and then not destroy them may we find this forgiveness as well may we find it as well in jesus name with
