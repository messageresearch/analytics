========================================

Hello everyone. Pastor Paula Fontaine and Literal Life Church in Petersburg, Michigan would like to invite you to take the next half hour and enjoy some time in the word of God. If you're hungry for more God, we believe you can be fed. And we pray that you'll be blessed. Visit our website for more information at literalife.urch. May God bless you, my friend. May the music and message encourage you today. On the cross hung my pain and the guilt and the shame. Jesus bore my suffering to the grave to make me free. Oh, the blood that was shed. &gt;&gt; It outflows to cover sin. It washes clean and purifies in its healing crimson tide. Jesus, he took my place in divine exchange. Hallelujah. Grace is mine. Now I will live by faith. For the one who saves, he gave all to give me life. Spirit is my present help. I'd be lost all by myself. He resurrects. He satisfies. He takes his power and makes it mine. Jesus, he took my place in divine exchange. Hallelujah. Your race is mine. Now I will live by faith. For the one who saves, he gave all to give me life. I lay down all lesser things for greater gain. He is alive inside of me. I lay down all lesser things for greater gain. He is alive inside of me. I lay down no less things for greater gain. He is alive inside of me. I lay down all the things for greater things. He is alive. Jesus took my place in divine exchange. Hallelujah. [Music] [Music] to give me life. Jesus Christ [Music] is mine. Now I will live by faith for the one who saves. He gave all to give me life. I lay down all lesser things for greater gain. He is alive inside of me. I lay down all lesser things for greater gain. He is alive. &gt;&gt; Psalms 149. Praise ye the Lord. Sing unto the Lord a new song and his praise in the congregation of the saints. Let Israel rejoice in him that made him. Let the children of Zion be joyful in their king. Let them praise his name in the dance. Let them sing praises unto him with the timberal and harp. For the Lord taketh pleasure in his people. He will beautify the meek with salvation. Let the saints be joyful in glory. Let them sing aloud upon their beds. This type of praise is not just when you're in church. Amen. &gt;&gt; This type of praise is not just when you're around the saints and showing off. This is even on the beds. It's at home. It's at work. &gt;&gt; This is a continual praise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let the high praises of God be in their mouth and a two-edged sword in their hand. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To execute vengeance upon the heathen and punishments upon the people. to bind their kings with chains and their nobles with feathers of iron to execute upon them the judgment written. This honor have all his saints. Praise ye the Lord. I'd like you to pay attention this morning to David's writings. And there's so many songs and so many truths in David's uh words in the Psalms. And David is particularly special to me. I identify with him very much in the scripture and his life. But David here at the very end of his writings, we find he speaks of the people of God and he speaks of a people who God is drawing great pleasure from their worship. And so when we look at this scripture, I wanted to just minister on it a little bit because a couple things in there with that we see is God is taking pleasure in this type of worship. And it's not just that he's taking pleasure in us, but we're taking pleasure in him. And when we start talking about that, we start talking about a a wonderful worship, a worship that comes to a high pinnacle. And that is when God is pleased with the worship. And when the and he draws pleasure from the worship and that we draw pleasure in worshiping him. And so uh what what this is coming from is is I just want to present it this way is that this this praise has has reached actually a higher level. It's not just called praise upon their lips. It's called the high praises of God. I don't know if you ever noticed high praises. And this is the only place in the scripture where high high praises is mentioned. the only place in the scripture we always have praise and we have that word mentioned many places but this people at this time that David is pointing to that they they h they they have a distinction about them and I can't help but think that this is the bride of the last days because they are really the people that have the two-edged sword in their hand &gt;&gt; but I want to preach to you it's not just that that we have the two-edged sword in our hand but we have the high praises of God upon our lips. &gt;&gt; And this is a people that he's pointing to that it's the high praises and it's it's it's on their lips. And I I'm going to venture to say this is a prophecy of the people of the very end. After 6,000 years, there will be a people arise that will reach the apex of all things that God would be so pleased with their worship. And you remember, worship isn't just singing or lifting your hands or clapping. Worship is our life before God. Worship is our offering to God. Worship is who you are, even when you're by yourself. And so, just look at it that way this morning. It's more than just what we're doing this weekend. And it it comes from a life that is poured out before God, a sanctified life. And after 6,000 years, I believe this is speaking of the bride because we'll reach the apex of all things. God will restore his word. God will give that book of redemption back to his people again. Everything climaxes at the end time. But all of that is to produce a people that have come to the apex of what real worship is all about. &gt;&gt; And uh the David brings it. It just seemed to strike the right thing in the heart of God and it moves the heart of God and it it it strikes the right thing with no elements missing. And I want you to hold on to that worship with no elements missing because in a moment I'll speak of uh times in the Bible when there was worship going on even to Jehovah God. But it had missing elements to it. And and God does not take pleasure when worship is missing elements to it. &gt;&gt; He's looking to a people and he's creating a people to come to true worship. How many remember what Jesus said to the woman at the well and and and she was confused about worship and he prophesied. He said to this woman at the well, this harlot, he said, "The the hour is coming and now is that the true worshippers will come and worship in both spirit and in truth." He's talking about our day. In other words, they won't just have they don't just have the spirit and lacking truth. &gt;&gt; Nothing will be lacking. And they won't just have truth without the spirit. But when they come with the full truth and spirit, then they become the true worshippers of God. &gt;&gt; God brings this thing to a head. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So this is a people that's reached the highest form of worship, the highest level that you come to. And this is a people with the two-edged sword in their hand and the high praises of God upon their lips. They have the king's sword in the end time. And I want to say that the king's sword is not just books and tapes and Bibles. It's so much more than that. &gt;&gt; The king's sword, the word is so much more than books and tapes. &gt;&gt; It's so much more than just our Bibles. Because why? The sword is to be put in the hand. The word is not meant to be just something on your phone, your Bible on your phone. It's meant to be so much more than that. Where does it belong? It belongs in the hand of the believer. And I believe this bride holding it, she knows by character. It's not meant to use on one another. &gt;&gt; Amen. At least she should know that it's meant to use on the devil. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; And this bride is going to take it and she's going to go for the juggler. There's some young girl that's going to pierce through the spirit of immodesty of this generation and she's going to take that sword in her hand and she's going to cut through that spirit of immodesty. There's some young men that are probably sitting here that's going to take that word and it's not just books and tapes to them. They're going to put it in their hand and they're going to drive it and cut that demon of pornography. Cut that demon of lust. Amen. &gt;&gt; A people will have it in their hand and take it to the root of bitterness in their life. &gt;&gt; Can I get an amen? &gt;&gt; People are going to when they have it in their hand, he says they take it to the heart of their many enemy, they're going to take it to the core of something and take it to a root of bitterness in your life and cut that out &gt;&gt; using the word that he has sent to do that. Hey, maybe they're going to take it and drive it to the heart of pride in your life and cut that pride out of your life. &gt;&gt; I, as I go along, I may have less amens, and I'm prepared for that. &gt;&gt; This is not just books and tapes and Bibles. It was in the hands of the people. And I believe in the end time, it's going to be more than on our heads. It's going to be in our hand. And we're going to take it to the heart of the enemy. Maybe it'll cut the pride out. The pride that says I'm better than everybody else. The pride that says this church is better than all the other churches. May God take the word and cut that out of our life. There is no perfect church. This isn't a perfect church and your church is not a perfect church. And if you've got that pride to lift up some church or some minister, may that word is for this to take in your hand and cut that pride out of your life. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Cut the pride out. Use that sword to cut Hollywood trash out of your life. &gt;&gt; To cut those clips out that you're flipping through that glorify sexual perversion. &gt;&gt; That's what this word was sent for. &gt;&gt; It's not just to play around with it and sing about in church. It's to take into your hand and cut those things out of your life. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. We need to know understand why the Lord has given us this word. So they have a sword in their hand but they have high praises upon their mouth. So I don't want to leave that part out. This is the people of the end time. They have the sword in their hand but they have the high praises in their mouth. They have been taught to bring their mouth under God &gt;&gt; causing them to say the right thing. Let's talk about worship that is missing elements to it throughout the Bible. And I have no have no time to go through every incident. I just want to say since the fall in the garden, we seen the effects of the fall. &gt;&gt; Man and the the and created in the image of God. He fell. When the woman fell, they fell together. And there were so many effects of that fall. He lost his oneness. He lost everything. He lost his title deed to the earth. He lost his power. But one thing that we've seen in the offspring is from the false union that union that took place with Eve and the serpent. One thing that we've seen that kind of surprises us from the offspring of the fall. And what we've seen come from the offspring is worship. &gt;&gt; Think about it. Now, and to me, I would never expect that from from sin and the fall and and and and and all of a sudden now everything's messed up and man's lost his place and and and now he's born with a serpent nature and he doesn't have a he doesn't have he has a soul, but he has a serpent nature to automatically gravitate to the things of the world. And so, he's all messed up in sin. And yet, and yet Cain himself, it's worship. Well, number one reason is he has a soul. And when man man has a soul, no matter how far they are from God, they'll have a craving for God to worship God. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; And Cain had that as well. &gt;&gt; But here's another reason why worship was there right away. It's because the one who caused all this fall, and I'm going to expose him this morning just a little bit. Lucifer anointed the serpent to cause this fall. And Lucifer knew very much about worship. And matter of fact, he was probably more knowledgeable about what worship was around the throne of God &gt;&gt; than anybody on earth, any angel, anyone. Lucifer, chief angel, chief musician, &gt;&gt; right there at the right hand of God around all of the perfect worship of God. He was knowledgeable about worship. And so I'm wondering that's why now Cain, he anoints him. And now Cain, he's going to bring worship. You think, "Oh, he's a dastasterly fella. Just loves the things of the world. What's he want to worship for? He's just to go out and just do all kinds of things in the world." No, no, it's worship. The third first thing he brings is worship. &gt;&gt; This is very hard for people to admit it was worship. It was worship be but it was missing elements to it. Now we say, "Well, he's worshiping God. I mean, come on. He's worshiping Jehovah God. He's bringing an offering. He's doing that." So, our tendency would be surely God is loving enough to accept that offering, &gt;&gt; to accept that worship. I'm here to be real clear now. &gt;&gt; We're reaching for the worship that God takes pleasure in. Not a lower form of worship, not a worship that's tainted, and not a worship that's missing elements. Well, what was Cain's worship missing? It was without revelation. &gt;&gt; It was worship without a cleansed soul, &gt;&gt; a redeemed soul. That's a pretty huge element missing in your worship. It was worship without the holiness of God. It was worship without relationship with God. It was worship without oneness with God. It was worship with no fellowship with God. And yet it was all worship. And Cain's worship was worship to Jehovah. But it brought what it wanted to bring to the Lord. It was worship without blood. &gt;&gt; Somebody ought to say, "Praise the Lord this morning." I'm speaking the truth to you. That worship that's missing essential elements. &gt;&gt; God is not pleasur. But there's a people coming with all the elements. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Nothing missing. &gt;&gt; Blood, revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A redeemed soul. &gt;&gt; Standing there with the book of redemption &gt;&gt; and their identity revealed to them. &gt;&gt; That's why Revelations 5, I read it last night. That's why they, as David says here, they'll sing a new song. It says that in Revelations 5 when the he takes the book they'll sing a new song. &gt;&gt; He hath made us kings and priests. That book of redemption revealed their true identity and it made them something. &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Praise the Lord." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Cain worship was worship to Jehovah, but it brought what it wanted to bring. It was without blood. It was without sacrifice. It was without atonement to purge sins. It had great fruits to it, but it offered no sacrificed life with it. God is not interested in cane worship even today. &gt;&gt; The music can be perfectly right, but God is not interested in cane worship. &gt;&gt; And I can safely say we have a lot of at the climax, we have a lot of cane worship today. &gt;&gt; But that's not my desire. I'm not called to cane worship. I'm called to worship at its highest level with all the elements there. &gt;&gt; These elements were missing in Cain. And I'd say they're essential elements, but from time on, from that time on when it was worship, but missing something, God never took pleasure in it. I wouldn't go so far as to say he rejects a sincere heart. Please understand, God doesn't just reject sincere hearts. And if they're offering what they can offer, that's fine. But he withdraws himself from worship that's missing certain elements. In fact, in some cases, he rejects it if it's missing certain elements. There are places in the scripture that show this and I don't have the time to cover them, but there are lower forms of worship even to Jehovah. There were times when God's people mixed their worship with the ways of the heathen. But you see now there were times when they would mix their worship with the heathen. They borrowed too much from the heathen and it lost its purity. It lost its originality. It lost its puress to us and we should be very careful today to not try to get a direct copy of what other churches are doing. &gt;&gt; I encourage you that that our agenda and our goal is not to copy what the other churches are doing, to try to copy what's going on out there. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; But to get it original from God. Can you say amen? I don't remember David having any influences when he was on the back side of the desert and he became a musician and a songwriter and got a hold of God. He did all that by himself on the back side of the desert. He received his inspiration directly from God. &gt;&gt; And when he come out of that, he was ready to face Goliath. &gt;&gt; He had an anointing to face Goliath. &gt;&gt; He had the right anointing. He had the right songs. He had the right faith. &gt;&gt; He learned how to be a worshshiper. Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; You young people, you you you have a lot of alone time because you're not married yet. You ought to you ought to be on the back side of the desert. Say, "God, give me your inspiration. Build my faith. Make me a worshipper, a true worshipper." &gt;&gt; Because guess what, young people? You're going to face Goliath someday. And you need to have God preparing you to get ready for your Goliath. I'm 59 years old. I face some Goliaths. You're going to face Goliath. And you need the faith that David had to go with boldness. &gt;&gt; Lord, make me a true worshipper now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God loves the beauty of holiness behind the person that's worshiping. He does not. It does not bring God pleasure when there's a secret life of sin behind it all. You may be the best musician, and I tell you because I love you. You may be very good at it and getting better at it, but God does not pl take pleasure in gifts or or uh talents when there's a life of sin secretly being hid behind it. Throughout the Bible, it wasn't worship God was looking for. There's a reference in Isaiah 66 at the beginning. He says, "Your sacrifices have become uh your elations is is like swine's blood." So now we have a place that's bringing sacrifices, the people of God, and it's the right sacrifices, but it wasn't giving God pleasure. And he goes on later on in the chapter, he says, "To this man while I look, to him that's poor, humble, and of a contrite spirit. To this man while I look." So they were bringing the right sacrifices, but without a humble, broken spirit. And God was not pleased. &gt;&gt; So it's it's sobering. And it's very sobering to realize this has been happening throughout the Bible. And then Paul brings up in the New Testament. He brings up you can give your body to be burned. You can understand all the mysteries. Anybody know where I'm going? First Corinthians 13. It's in the New Testament, too. You can bring all this. You can understand all the mysteries. Give your body to be burned. You can speak in tongues. But if it's missing the element of Holy Ghost love, &gt;&gt; he says it's as a sounding brass and a tinkling symbol. &gt;&gt; That means it's just noise to God. It doesn't give him pleasure. He doesn't take pleasure because you have all the speaking in tongues, all that. But if you're missing Holy Ghost love, you're missing the key element. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There are a few times that in the Bible the worship just hit just right. It wouldn't be like the our days when he's it's going to hit perfectly right. But it hit just right. And when it did, the worship struck the right thing and the right thing was there and the right elements were there. And when it hit just right, things would happen. Solomon's temple is a great example of that. There must have been all the elements there of dedication, of rededication, of pure hearts &gt;&gt; because when they struck that, and incidentally friends, there was hundreds of worshippers, there was hundreds of musicians, there was 120 trumpets. &gt;&gt; I don't think they were quiet trumpets. I think they were loud. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen. &gt;&gt; And and and this was a hu I wish I'd have been there, but to be honest with you, I'd rather be here in the service this morning rather than in Solomon's day because God said he said the glory of that temple won't even compare with the glory that's in the temples of the end times. I'm glad to be here this morning cuz I believe I'm not a part of a movement, but I'm part of what God's doing &gt;&gt; to bring true worshippers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. that he breathes it in &gt;&gt; and it's a sweet smelling savor to him. I take pleasure in my people. &gt;&gt; May God take pleasure in my worship. &gt;&gt; May he be pleased with my worship. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; May he be pleased with the way I play the guitar. May he be pleased with I way I play my piano. &gt;&gt; How I use my voice. &gt;&gt; May he be pleased with it. Amen. &gt;&gt; That place that place began to just there was such something struck it just right and God just come down into that temple and swept in there with his glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Sometimes, you know, I I think it gets quiet sometimes when that type of glory comes cuz nobody can really say anything. But their worship and their instruments and everything congealed in oneness and harmony and it just pleased God and he swept through that whole place with his glory. But the interesting thing about David, most of what comes out in all of his trials, he always ends up with a victory and a positive confession. He always ends up with a praise upon his lips. Praise to his God. How can the guy who sinned again with Basheba went through so many trials the enemies against me? He was reproached. People were talking against him. How can a guy go through all of that and he ends up with the praises of God on his lips? &gt;&gt; He ends up being the great writer that wrote about the praise of God more than anybody. It's not just when he felt like it. You know, David, he didn't praise God just when he felt like it. He ordered his mouth to make praise a continual thing. Here's some scriptures. I will bless the Lord at all times. His praise shall continually be in my mouth. Re from the rising of the sun to the setting of the same. The name of the Lord shall be praised. &gt;&gt; Rejoice in the Lord always. And again, I say rejoice. Somebody ought to praise us with the Lord one this morning. &gt;&gt; Hebrews 13:15, I'll bring the sacrifice of praise continually. when you're in a trial. That's why it's called the sacrifice of praise. It's not so much here when you bring the sacrifices. It's easy when everybody's around to praise unless you come in with the doll drums and you've lost your job or something like that. But I want to tell you, David learned that's when God wants to hear you sing. He wants you to come to church. &gt;&gt; And you've lost a loved one and you've had the greatest trial of your life and then all of a sudden this worshiper rise and said, "I will worship my God." though he's slaying, I'm going to trust him for watching our service today.
