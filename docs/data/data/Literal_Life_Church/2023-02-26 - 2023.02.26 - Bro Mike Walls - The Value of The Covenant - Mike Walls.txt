I just want to use this to start with and I made several scriptures and I may not it'll just depend on things go Genesis chapter 6 in verse 5. and God saw the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually and I repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth and it grieved him at his heart and the Lord said I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the Earth both man and Beast and creeping things and the fowls of the air for it repenteth me that I have made them but Noah found Grace in the eyes of the Lord these are the generations of Noah Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations and Noah walked with God and nobody got three sons Shem him and japath and the Earth also was corrupt before God and the Earth was filled with violence and God looked upon the Earth and behold it was corrupt for All Flesh had corrupted his way upon the Earth and God said unto Noah the end of All Flesh is come before me for the Earth is filled with violence through them and behold I will destroy them with the Earth God bless you can be seated this morning I'd like to speak a few minutes about the value of the Covenant the value of the Covenant and you know we see and and hear the story of Noah and everybody knows all these stories and how that they come about and we've heard about it since we were children ever since we've been in church and yet it has something to do with what's happening today Noah was preaching a message at the end time for those people it was an end time message how that the young people at that time was being told that God's going to send a flood he's going to destroy the Earth and and yet people just looked at him and just like he's just an old man he's just preaching you know but he was a messenger of God and God used him and then the Lord comes along and says I'm going to destroy the Earth and everyone that's in it because they've corrupted my Earth they've corrupted this thing and if you look around the world today and I know that I picked up a newspaper article yesterday just as we were coming out to go to breakfast and on it began to talk about how the lgbtq and all the different things the percentages of how it has doubled and tripled and the different Generation Z and the Millennials and all these different ones and where it began to grow at and where it's at now and what's driving the way we are today and you know in our time we had a prophet to come along and tell us that this world was going to be the mess that it's in today and when brother Branham come along and told us he sings people you know back in that day they probably couldn't understand it they probably couldn't believe it but yet he caught something that people of the world could not see and the reason he could is because he was the prophet messenger and I'm going to read a few things from his this message and I know there's people who's not agreeing with the message well that's their problem I don't have a problem with the message because when the Lord introduced me to the message he didn't introduce me just to a man but he introduced me to the word of God in a way that I had never seen now I was raised up at Pentecostal I was saying just a bit last night and what Drew is my wife and I together was we love going to church we love worshiping the Lord and and I played the drums and when the spirit would hit on me I'd get up and run the aisles or I'd roll the floor I'd do what whatever I was going to worship God and today I've not stopped worshiping God every once in a while I still get a Pentecostal Footloose going but let me tell you when I heard the word through a prophet now when I did all that shouting and all that dancing I would go out feeling I'm missing something I'm missing a part of something and one day you know we had different brothers would tell us about the message and and how that God sent a prophet and many years ago I was privileged to be with my father and he was meeting with brother Ernest Fulcher which is my wife's uncle and in Brother David Musgrove I didn't know these didn't know the man must grow but anyway they took my dad to the officer in Christiansburg and they began to talk to him I'm 15 years old never thinking I'm going to be a preacher never thinking anything but somehow the Lord allowed me to be sitting there when these men are introducing this Prophet to my dad and it just kind of just you know just kind of went past me but then some years later my wife's family that moved up from where they were at and she was 11 years old when they came to her church I believe in 1971 or 72. and that was my first time to see her and so they joined their Church and so it was through her parents talking to my father and then connecting them even more to brother Fulcher and showing us and talking about the message so as the message if you don't mind I felt like I need to give a little background on why I believe what I'm preaching and so when this happened then brothers would come and they'd bring stacks of books before iPads and all this stuff and they'd have stacks of books and they'd say brother random said brother Brown said brother Brown said and my dad got to the point because you know they say brother Branham said well they say Jesus said now that was the attitude we took but one day my father got soul he goes I'm going to prove this thing wrong and he started studying that thing and the more he tried to prove it wrong the writer it got he goes that's in the Bible that's in this scripture and the first time he preached about serpent seed was on a Tuesday night he preached for two and a half hours and it felt like 30 minutes because he was feeding us something we had never heard before it was the unveiling word of God and from that point my soul began to thirst for it but I still hadn't got that revelation of the Prophet myself I'm at home and I'm we just built a a new house and I'm jumping ahead of myself and you just forgive me and I'll try not to preach more in an hour but the way you're going already you're pulling me in a different direction I don't know what this is about I'm not even at my notes yet and so in 1991 I was I was sitting home and and my wife we just come through a very serious situation with my wife she she almost died we lost a child because of a doctor telling us things and and she almost died and and we had to make a big decision about letting the doctors take the baby and she was 28 years old and when this happened it shook me to my core this is 1988. we just built a brand new house I've got a good job and everything's looking lovely but now I have a wife who's at the point of death and I go to my father and just so happened brother Jackie Benton was there with my father preaching there and I went to these two men of God and I said look the doctor says if you don't take this baby that my wife will be dead in three days and we already have three children and I'm praying I said Lord what I what do I do and so these brothers Just prayed with me and they said we believe God will give you the right answer and whatever you decide so we decided to let the doctors take that baby it was one of the hardest things we've ever done it was either her life or both of their lives we don't believe in abortion I don't accept abortion but this was a different kind of historian and you forgive me if it's if you feel like I was wrong but I did the right thing because then God would begin to really reveal himself and because of that strain and all of that happened she went to a nervous breakdown and and then she couldn't eat and she lost down to 91 pounds she was literally dying right in front of me and as she's just dying in front of me I said I looked her I said you're not going to die on me I said I'm going to make you eat or I'm going to pick you up and physically take you to the hospital they're going to put an IV in your arm and you're going to live you cannot leave me in these children and I'd look her in the face many times and I'd pray and I'd say now honey I'm not praying against you I'm praying against a demon that's trying to destroy you and she'll testify I'd look her right in the eye brother because I know the light of the eye is there and I begin to pray and I'd rebuke that devil and I'd rebuke him and I'd say Satan you're coming out and one day I was down by the by the end of the bed and I was praying and the Holy Spirit came into the room and he said she'll live she's going to get well I stopped praying I got up I walked over I said honey the Lord just testified told me that you're going to be okay she says when I said I don't know when I don't know where and I don't know how but God promised that he's going to do it and it took some months but I kept praying and I said Lord thank you for answering the prayer I wasn't asking him no more Lord to heal her I'm thanking him Lord thank you for healing her and she ended up in the hospital she ended up in an insane Hospital and she wanted to commit suicide I'll tell you it got darker than brighter but because he spoke I said you won't die and I kept testifying you're going to make it you're going to make it and the doctor told me he says the best thing you can do is show her love be with her show her love show her love psychiatrist people say well I don't believe in psychiatrists he's just the same as a high blood pressure doctor to me he's just the same as a heart doctor to me he's just the same as a doctor that tells you about your sugar diabetes he's the same kind of a doctor but people think oh that's a bad word let me tell you something God knows what he's doing and when we got there we were in front of this psychiatrist who was a who was a a Jewish man and my wife I remember when we were first go over she looked him she stood up and she says I don't need you and I don't need your medicine God's going to heal me she ended up in the hospital under his care it kept getting darker I walked into the hospital the doctor meets me in the foyer well in this mental hospital the rooms are all around the walls and this is like the big area where you greet each other and just as I'm walking in the doctor walks out he goes Mr walls he says I want to tell you something I said yesterday she's already been in the hospital for a week it's on a Monday he walks out he goes Mr walls I don't know how to tell you this he goes Something's Happened he goes your wife is completely changed he said it wasn't my medicine he said it was her faith in God here she is today stand up honey here she is today she's well [Applause] when I met this message I met the god of William Branham that can testify and tell you he's alive he's moving the same thing that he did back in that day he's still doing today I'm not basing this message on gifts and signs and miracles I didn't know anything about signs and miracles what I heard was the word of God and when I heard the word of God through a man like brother Branham it changed who I was I was sitting home then in 1988 after she's went through all of this series of sickness and all these series of problems and I'm sitting there and I'm reading a little article and all of a sudden the Holy Spirit drops in and reveals to me who brother Branham really is that the prophet of God is here before you and just as Moses spoke the fleas and the Flies and the frogs we got a prophet that can speak into the squirrels and speak to a storm it's the same God today because if that same God can speak to him he could speak to me he can speak to you let me ask you today what are you looking for he preached three kinds of believers he talks about the kinds of Believers that we're faced with and all these things let me tell you something when people say that brother Branham was a liar he was a false prophet that's their problem brother Paul was saying something just before we came out that somebody was saying that brother Brandon was a big deceiver I said well he's one of the best deceivers I've ever heard of because he's deceived me wonderful and I believe all of it because something by Revelation has struck my heart and you can't give me that God has to do that and when God revealed to me who this man was then I knew from that point listen we've been through all kinds of battles through all kinds of sicknesses all kinds of struggles and God has been there to see us through this nobody in Jeffersonville told me to go start a church in Washington D.C area Nobody Knows the supernatural that picked me up and moved me from Richmond Virginia to that area where I am that was only my friend my family and two other families when we started in the living room of a man's house that's another story but now there's about 300 people gathers there I've never called the first person because God called me to the place he sent the people God ordains his people and I'm preaching to them the same message I'm preaching to you that the people are corrupting the world and we had a prophet saying that man with all his wisdom is destroying us and even today with all the systems and all the things that are happening I was looking out the back window of the or out the window of the motel and seeing that wonderful little river running down and just in 2019 my wife and I was over in Italy on our 40th anniversary and we did something bigger than we would normally do we took some time away and we were over there and we got them into Italy and not forget the name of the town but we were we were there we were riding through the canals and just you know and all these things they said when you go under the bridge you're supposed to kiss your bride there was a lot of those bridges I had a good time and the other people were like singles divorce and we're back there and we're the we're we're the we're the joy of the boat but you know when I looked through that little river today that's behind the hotel let down that little stream has dried up in Italy the streets of Italy that they use for water it's gone it's it's down to nothing you've seen the news you've heard the things and how things and even the scripture talks about how that the Euphrates river is going to be drying up these things are happening and look and then the world is is starving there's one of the dams out west that if they don't get enough water it controls uh electricity to six of the different states and the water's not there for them right now what's going on God is getting ready to destroy this Earth One More Time as it was in the days of Noah as it was in the days of Sodom of lot it's going to happen in this day are you ready so if there's three kinds of Believers which kind of you you know some of us we go here we're sold out you can't change my mind you don't know what I went through to get to this point and I see the power of God and he's still moving today and then I I look at the people who are make-believers I call them schizophrenic today they're in church hallelujah praise the Lord tomorrow you'll find them out down there running around doing this mess around with the wrong kind of people telling kind of dirty jokes but they know that the prophet's real they know the message is real but they can only worship him when they get into the presence of God their schizophrenia say have a dual personality sorry dual personalities they want to be Believers but yet when they get outside the influence of the world is pulling on them more than what the word is pulling on them they come here they want to sing in the choir they want to play the music and all these things you need people with the Holy Ghost this message is real I was studying a few weeks ago something just it just shook me brother Paul I've been I've been preaching now this message for 30 years better than 30 years 31 years there at the in the DC area in eight years before that with young people and I come along and I I was studying do you realize how privileged we are to have this ministry to have this message I'm going to read a few things to you because I hope you don't mind if I believe the message then why can't I quote him and if you're going to sit there with doubt and disbelief you just do it you won't stop me there's not enough wet blankets to stop the unquenchable fire of God it can put out any water you can throw I tell people they say well I don't want to go to church with hypocrites I said I'd rather go to church with them than go to hell with them if I don't have enough Holy Ghost to sit down the side of an unbeliever and worship God then why would I let them control who I am don't be ashamed of being a real believer this morning let go let gosh of God we don't have to put this on we're not to make it up just live strength to be what you are we were in one of your restaurants the other day what was that name of that Pacos or something Tony Packo's if you like it good for you but I I'm not a Paco she wanted this she just wanted the experience I said okay let's just go to the experience and you get into these things and and and you see this stuff and we were sitting there and we pray to our food and this elderly man got up and as he was going out he said may I say something yes sir he goes it's so nice to see people praying it's so nice to see people pray you don't have to be ashamed lgbtq plus 222 23 whatever they are they keep adding numbers and pluses let me tell you something they're not going to stop me from worshiping God then they're going to stop me from calling the name of Jesus Christ why because he's my Lord and Savior this is something that's real to me and this is what I believe with all my heart brother Brandon makes a comment in the mark of the beast and he says it was this man Louis Petrus he says how many ever heard of him he said the Stockholm Church in Sweden he said wonderful brother he said to me brother Branham the Jews has always believed their Prophets said if you just go down to Israel I said fine that looks good to me brother brand I'm saying fine that looks good to me I'll go down there he continues on and he says he's given millions of Testaments he said they read from the back to the front he said they read them New Testaments he said and asked them Jews they said why you come home to bring your pop and Mama to that's blind and sick and packing them in and says come to the Homeland to die they said we come to see the Messiah he's preaching this in 1961. he's telling this story 1961. he said brother don't worry Gentile your days is just about over he says let me warn you in the name of the Lord the Gentile door is closing just as certain as I'm standing here Jesus said the muhammadans there would tread Down the Walls of Jerusalem until the Gentile dispensation be finished and fulfilled there she is Israel in her Homeland a nation with her own Army and her own money she's full she's a full Nation now the Fig Tree is putting forth its buds and already butted out brother Mike what's this got to do with the value of a covenant just give me time I at my church I've been preaching this in a series and so my my mind's running to all all my different messages and brother Brandon's coming along and he's beginning to tell these things he said and when they got there he said they give them the New Testaments he said absolutely Petrus he goes they read the New Testament about what Jesus was they never heard about him they said if this be the Messiah then he's not dead they're reading the New Testament now this man's getting the Bibles into their hands you with me okay he goes we believe our Prophets and the Messiah will be a prophet let us see him do the sign of the Messiah a prophet and we'll believe him is the messiah oh what a perfect setup just perfect I said Lord let me go brother branham's caring and he knows he's carrying the sign of the Messiah in his ministry he's carrying that sign and he comes along he says and when I when I got up in Cairo Egypt he said just before we met the king Pharaoh he said at Rome he said then we went down at Cairo Egypt I had my ticket in my hand to go I went up and they they didn't call the flight and the Holy Spirit spoke and said not now this man's on his way to Israel to show them the sign of a prophet the sign of Messiah and the Holy Spirit tells him not now he said this is not the hour yet more gleaning to do brother Branham says I couldn't hardly believe it can you imagine he knows who he is he knows what he has and he knows what he can do with it do you know that yourself do you know who you are do you know what you can do with this message do you know what you can do with this power of God can you understand that the Holy Ghost wants to lead you and guide you into all truth and all righteousness he wants to do this and he says I couldn't hardly believe it I'm thinking thank God that God didn't let him go what if brother random would have went there it would have been finished friends but God wouldn't let him go he said there's more gleaning to do here I am today here you are today if he hadn't went then we wouldn't be here today it would be over already but God said I've got more people I've got gleaning to do you can't go now but this man knew I can go and they will accept it and it would have been done oh thank God he waited for me thank God he waited for you without that Revelation friends we would be going out of here we wouldn't have had a chance brother Branham comes into this place realizing he could go and he says I couldn't believe it God wouldn't let me go and he said but this is not the time yet he said I went up behind the hangar God is my judge and I prayed and I knelt down and I said Heavenly Father just another hour or two and I'll be in Palestine I'll challenge those Jews those Jews and say did you say that if the Messiah be the true Messiah let him let him see him do it do the sign of the prophet and you'll believe him he said I'll go down and ask them these questions didn't you say that you would believe your Prophet the Messiah he was going to challenge him to this can you imagine this man knowing his position could have easily done it except almighty God was watching over while he was on the cross we was on his mind he knew that there had to be a voice speak to us and pull us into the presence of the Holy Ghost just like brother Branham was pulled into that presence he said he said get a Jew to promise you he said he will keep his word he said now if that's the Messiah of the Bible then he was a prophet and he is still a prophet now if he does the sign of Messiah will you believe him he's saying that's what I'm going to say to these Jews will you believe him and he knew he could do it he said right on the same grounds say select yourself a group of men and said look he wasn't afraid to challenge he wasn't afraid to stand and and talk about what God was he said you you can choose some men and and set them out here somewhere find out whether it's the profit or yet or not he said let them see it be done he said then write on them sane grounds where your father's forefathers rejected the Holy Ghost he said a Jew took it to the Gentile here is a here a gentile bringing it back to the Jew do you hear what he's saying he said I could do this but thank God the holy spirit said you don't do this he stopped him he pulled him back a little bit he said so the Gentile can bring it back to the Jew he says and when that Jew receives the gospel the Gentile days are finished but he wouldn't let me go Hallelujah some of you weren't even thought about in 1961. I was six years old at that point many of you weren't even born yet but because of The Watch knew that it was going to have a people come on the scene that the Earth had to be in a worse condition but the Covenant that he gave to Noah was going to be standing in this day he said I do set my bowl in the sky as a covenant to the Earth that I'll never destroy it again with water so today now they're thirsting for water and there's not enough water bye look what's happening he's not going to destroy it with the water but yet it's being destroyed because there's no water and people are looking and wondering what's going on and and they say well it's global warming okay and why is a global warming because man has made so many things so much industry put up so much stuff and polluted The Heirs and destroyed so many things that's what's destroyed and brother Branham said this man destroying himself I see this message More Alive more now than I ever did the more I studied the more like I'm just beginning to scratch the surface again these things are just so powerful and and I I don't I don't read it just to have something to read I read it because there's an inspiration behind this listen brother Branham we all know he wasn't re-educated but that's not what God's looking at he's not looking at your education he's not looking at phds look I've got a 12th grade education and I just made it by the skin of my teeth but in our church we got about five or six people that's got phds and I'm preaching to them and I'm like this has to be God because I'm not worthy to do such a thing but God knows I ain't got no better sense than to tell the truth preach what's there preach what's the truth tell the people what's exactly going around brother Brandon said the prophet is a special man a prophet is a man who whom the word of the Lord comes to because the prophet is so designed that life that his subconscious and his conscience is so close together that he doesn't go to sleep to dream his dream he sees it when he's wide awake a prophet foresees way off brother man told us things that happened in 1933 when God gave him a vision of seven things happening remember that and he tells us she starts telling us all these different things that are going to happen and all the day look there's people saying brother made this up and Brethren hey I'm going to tell you something when he made the comments that the Lord showed him seven things in 1933. remember when I came to the message I didn't know anything about the cloud I didn't know anything about any of that stuff all I heard was the word of God the word is what drew me to this message and then when I heard about the clout and one day I was able to go to Arizona my wife and I we got to travel out I believe it was 96 97 and we went to Arizona and was able to go to Sunset mountain and I didn't know that brother Brown's profile was on the end of the mountain have you ever been there see that I got the picture of my Bible your face is not out there you don't have to wonder is it like brother Branham you can see that it looks like brother Branham and I took a picture of it myself because I was in such awe I thought wow so now here's More The Lord's just adding to me now giving me more benefits well in 1996 things you know they change card designs now I'm a car guy I like cars I like trucks I like things with motors I like challenges and but I like old stuff you know and and when when things happen when the car show comes to DC me and my brother and some of the brothers in church will go to the DC car show and we'll see all the new technologies we'll see you don't want to see all this he said brother you're a bane okay I don't hunt and I don't fish I tell my grandkids I said I'm a Hunter they said well I said when I see a four cell sign I'll be driving down the road and I'll just catch my eye and I thought I'll mark that and now my grandkids go and and I was playing my grandkids and they said I said somebody it's like a magnet starts pulling me come take a look take a look my grandson years will be riding with me now and say grandpa don't look don't look it's got a four cell sign I was 19 1996 they changed the body style of the Ford Taurus what's this got to do anything Prophet said in 1933 that cars would become more like an egg did he say it did he say that what does a prophet do he sees far off now he said they had some cars in his day but I want to tell you something that happened in my day it's thus said the Lord being fulfilled and I I just happened to see this new Ford Taurus and I said man that thing looks like an egg and sure enough it had ovals here and ovals there and so my oldest son at the time was 15 years old now he is thank God he's told me the other day he said Dad I'm not as adventurous as I used to be I mean he was like one of these living on the edge kind of guys Daredevil he's going down this hill close to our house and another young man from our church and he's going so fast and there's a tree about this big around about four inches round and his pedal catches the tree need I say more he broke his nose his collarbone and part of his thumb I believe it was he got hurt really bad and that was all because the Lord wanted to show me something we're sitting in the doctor's office and as I'm sitting there I pick up AAA magazine well guess what it's got in the front of car and so I start filming through this magazine while he's back there with the doctor and I'm like yeah man this is really this is really neat I like this magazine and I'm looking through I'm like look at this you know brother Branham said he even said this he said a 1931 Ford or 33 Ford wouldn't look like an egg did you all know he said that you remember if go back and read it I've got the quotes on but I'm not the real that but he said it wouldn't even look like an egg-shaped to me but just so happened when I turned the page I see the 1996 Ford Taurus and it says the egg and you now here's a prophet seizes back in 1933. and now they're saying the egg and you let's just get a bit let's get a little closer it says the new egg shaped what did he say now this happened to me friends you can't tell me that this man just happened to be lucky no I've got the evidence right here that what a prophet said on original magazine it says the egg shaped Taurus the new egg-shaped Taurus the egg in you and I've I've often said now I wish I'd have bought me a 96 Ford and if I see one if anybody sees a 1996 Ford Taurus and it's white bring it to me tell me where it is I'll come get it and then I'm gonna paint the top of it yellow and be sunny side up that sounds funny but right here it says it and just so happens on the other page to put the words of the prophet in context they put a 31 Fort which looks like a 33 Ford right across from the same page tell me that God doesn't honor his prophet's words tell me that he doesn't know what he's talking about this ministry we got is more than just a man walking up there it was something that ignited his soul and the Covenant that he made with Abraham when Isaac and Jacob and Moses and Elijah and all these different ones that Covenant today is so valuable to us because we now have the evidence of the Holy Ghost the token where did you ever hear that at before token a prophet comes along Exodus chapter 12 verse 12 starts talking about how that you're going to have a token and you're going to apply the blood let me tell you something you got to apply this Blood of the words into your souls and don't be a don't be a schizophrenic believer today when you go out here today say I'm committed to God that he's shown me something we've got something more than what the world wants to offer us listen truly sin is just a pleasure for a season but the power and the glory of God is for eternity my wife and I we have such peace with each other we don't have to worry about it this one's going to run on this if I'm going around on hers you can run on me I work with men and when my wife went in through that deep depression and she suffered so many things I I showed her all the love I could I let my my children with my my mother-in-law and my mom and and I just stayed with her as much as they could and how that it was such a thing and then the men I was working with one man's wife she came into depression and he divorced her just because she went to depression and I'll tell you what that's not love that's selfishness let me tell you something when you marry somebody you marry them for real love I told them last night you can do we can have all kinds of talking about marriage and all that but the only way that's going to keep our marriage together is real love and the only way that's going to keep you in line with this message is really loving God and serving God and he'll show you how to make it through all these things that we're going through this is the day that we've got something more powerful than what the the sanctuaries of the religious lives have we got something that's greater than all of that and it's the power of this word we have and God has hidden it from so many people but yet he's chosen to let some of us see something that's so real listen I don't care if people condemn me it doesn't matter they don't know where they never walked in my shoes they'd never been where I've been so they won't understand why I can believe and preach a message like this it's not just about William Branham it's about you and me he came to give his life for the message the Gospel of Jesus Christ that he might give it to you and me and what did he say he said the young ministers sweep it on to the coming of the Lord all these different things are going to happen we're Solomon you're in trouble come here how many struggles in life have you ever faced we have faced death my wife and I faced to death just stand right there buddy I'm going to ask you a question what is this you sure you're sure you know what God knows the value of Who You Are it can make you a penny a nickel dying quarter or 100 bill and you're going to be tested and you're going to be tried you're going to be thrown to the ground you're going to be stepped on you're going to be twisted around and people think I'm going to stop them from believing that God you take this you take this the hundred dollar bill let me ask you something it's still a hundred dollar bill isn't it now this crispy it looks kind of used up but has it lost its value no matter what you go through no matter what you go through you're going to be crushed you're going to be walked on but you never lose your value you never lose your value you see but I can't make it but God said I bought you God said I paid the price and you never lose your value it's not about how you feel it's not about how you look it's about what you know is inside of your soul it's the value of the token of Jesus Christ here's your first wedding gift don't you ever forget that buddy [Applause] thank you [Applause] never forget the value that God placed into Who You Are you see but my marriage I'm struggling with my marriage God knows the value he placed in that marriage he knows the person he lets you be joined to today friend let him know that you cherish the value of your marriage the Covenant that you made a marriage covenant is to death do you part and I'll tell you what that devil will come to try to destroy that parting part he'll try to make you think well I can't make it you can make it listen there's a lot of brothers that's got the Holy Ghost and we're all human beings here listen the only thing that makes us different from the Baptist and the Pentecostals and the methodists as we receive the Holy Ghost by the message of the hour not just by the message but try to understand me now we received a message that God gave us the Holy Ghost to receive it by is that better the message didn't give me the Holy Ghost it can't do it God gives the Holy Ghost just try to understand him but he reveals to us something that's happening but there's a lot of men that have a have a holy ghost in them but they don't know how to talk to their wives they don't know how to talk to their children yet they love the Lord they love the message and they're so busy working with the let me tell you why because I was one of them I got so busy working doing this and working doing that and helping this brother and helping this brother my wife was home suffering when are you going to spend some time with us I was busy helping the brothers I was busy helping the the church and I you know there's a time in the season for all things but Brothers Nate you need to pay attention when your wife starts telling you I'm missing you one thing my wife forgot to say last night when she cut me down so low to the stump meet my needs I'll tell you what when you come to become a Christian when you come here to to serve the Lord what are you here for Lord meet my needs it's not about all the shouting and running the owls but Lord meet my needs Lord come into my life when we come here Lord I need to touch my soul I need to touch for my body I need a touch for my spirit Lord made my needs don't be so busy with everybody else that you forget where I am don't worry he has not lost the value of who you are today but he looks good and says I'll meet your needs I walk into where you are I'll go with you through your suffering but you're going to suffer because my bridegroom he said he learned obedience by the things that he suffered and brothers and sisters when you are learned that you've suffered through something then see what God's trying to show you on the other side of that don't you say oh it's me oh it's me say Lord what is it you want to show me when we see these things happening he knows that the value of the Covenant is staying with you the value of the word is staying with you oh Hallelujah what keeps my wife and I together we love the Lord first we love the Lord we cherish because he brought us together I'm not looking for a replacement I'm not looking for somebody to fill in her spot I'm not looking for a younger model shame on these preachers I will not meet with a woman alone my wife's either going to be with me or the Deacon or another sister there's going to be three of us it's never going to be me in that one Brethren let me tell you something if you've got the Holy Ghost you begin to build a hedge around your spiritual life as God put a hedge around around job and all these things and the devil said Lord move the heads back let me tell you something you keep the Hedge as close as you can our hedge is the Holy Ghost and he's able to watch over you and to lead you through when the Trials come he said I'll go with you and he said I'll even be in you oh but we've got to trust him that the value Covenant as we're staying with it when she was on her deathbed and me looking at those little eyes she couldn't take it I said Lord I walked in that new house that we had just built we hadn't even moved in yet I walked in the front door I said Lord you can have it you can have this house you can have everything I own I said I'll serve you to whatever you want me to do but give her back to me not realizing I would have to sell that house I would have to leave that job but that security and I'd have to move north two hours and take on the job driving a bus to support my family a school bus somebody said what do you do for a living I said I'm a pastor of the church I said what'd you do wrong you pass your church and you drive a school bus I said prove him in All Things but let me tell you something I use that school bus as an opportunity to talk to children who would not listen to their parents but would listen to the bus driver now I wasn't supposed to give them sodas but I give them sodas I wasn't supposed to give them candy but I gave him candy so happens one day there was a little girl she was having trouble she was mostly mostly Disturbed and having issues and I saw her jump and drop kick her mom in the front hallway of the school and the principal grabs that young lady by the hair of the head and drags her out to the outside and puts her outside and they've called the police on a little 12 year old girl the next thing I know this little girl she's so obsessed she walks out in late sits right down in the middle of the street that was my child I said Lord God and I walked out there I'd made friends with her little kid I said listen I said why are you here she goes they don't like me they hate me I said well you know I'm your friend right she says yes sir I said well then you come with me and let's just walk over here behind the buses well they can't see you okay there's bus drivers all around and my supervisor was sitting in the bus on the road protecting the little girl so nobody could pass through and I talked to her and got her out of that street when I got her out of the street they said what did you do to her I said I was her friend try to introduce him to Jesus Christ I try to let them know that there's something more than what this world's got to offer them brothers and sisters this life is to live every day I'm not going to be a schizophrenic I've dealt with people that has that personality and I'll tell you what they're hard to deal with I've had somebody in my church that was a schizophrenic and they were hard to deal with one day they're so wonderful and they're great and they can't help it they really can't help that but some people can help what you're doing but let me tell you something God doesn't forget who you are he lists the value of the Covenant take control let me just say a couple more things and I'll close you okay I've had the privilege to take hundreds of people to Washington D.C and I've asked people I said you know These Guys these say that brother Randall was a false prophet and all these things I said let me ask you a question I said is your pitcher up in Washington D.C for any reason I said what do you mean I said well as far as I know the supernatural happened to brother Branham and they took a picture and proved then it was Supernatural I said have you ever gotten your picture put up there no I said well then why are you putting him down I got proof you know this is the type picture that's there I've got on my phone where I was just up there a couple weeks ago with brother Yvonne carry on and his wife my wife and I went up there with him and I took a picture with that brother Yvonne says brother Mike I want to go see the picture because people says it's just a lie that is not in Washington D.C I said come on let's go I'll tell you what we've got something that's been proved by science whether they like it or not we've got something that's been proved by the Holy Ghost whether they like it or not and I got something that's been proved to me supernaturally whether you like it or not and I could care less whether I like it I know where I'm standing you need to know where you stand let God and when you desire God enough he will come and reveal himself to you and you won't have to question is it real you'll say praise God I know it's real foreign [Applause] my wife we were out in Arizona again and we're walking along the trail of Sabino Canyon as we're walking alone my wife I didn't know what was going on with her and she was she began to to think some thoughts and we were walking alone and this this elderly brother I forget his name right now he was he was leading the way and he was talking and and it was standing there and he said and he turned and he looked in our Direction and he says if you've ever wondered is this real I'm here to tell you this is real and my wife was crying I said why are you crying she goes because I was just thinking as we're walking right that trail over here is this real and the first thing he said when he turned around was if you are wondering is this real it's real answered her questions we've had things happen to us that only God could identify that it's not coincidence friends it's a holy ghost this is I'll lead you and I'll guide you her family's left this message a lot of them some of mine are struggling because of the message but if you ever meet Jesus Christ you meet Jesus Christ he will lead you to what this message really is what was the message brother Brandon said the message was Jesus Christ revealed in you it wasn't revealed in brother Branham it was revealed in Jesus Christ yet he was identified with the ministry people say well you you got that cloud picture and all these different things yeah I got them because I believe they're true I've said this and I'll say it again people say you know there was a rocket fired over this I said I could care less if they put something up there and blow it up around and it made the head of Christ it doesn't matter to me I believe it anyway it fit right inside the message why not accept it in the message listen brother Brandon was a man I'm a man you're a man listen we're all human beings I don't see no angels in here today and we are all challenged by the same devil and if you've got the Holy Ghost we're all led by the same Holy Ghost so the same God that was with this Prophet is with us this bride is going to be the manifestation of Jesus Christ not the manifestation of William Branham she is to be the manifestation of Jesus Christ she is him because if he lives inside of you then it's no longer you but it's the Holy Ghost of Supernatural living inside of us don't you want to be close to the Covenant don't you realize the value of the Covenant that you carrying wow and he saw you and he gave it to you could the musicians come brother Brandon said brother Mike brother Paul says he wants you to be at home last night brother Paul said brother Mike just be at home I felt really good thank you wonderful spirit of God here I told my wife I said after I get Brother Paul's I'm not taking any more speaking engagements I do not like traveling to preach I like traveling but not to preach and I'm serious I am a nervous wreck when it comes to it God put me in a church that's where he told me the pastor and I'm happy in my place and I don't need to try to become an evangelist pastor I'd rather pay and I support evangelists and I bring evangelists to my church because they're part of the ministry now I have pastors come through and there's nothing wrong with that but if they make it a habit I got a problem with that but when I see that these abandons we're supposed to have the vanishes they get get on get them on the on the road keep them going we got a lot of good Brothers young ministers that are coming up I went to Brother Jason Watkins first Youth Camp back in 21 in October 21 and I was the oldest Pastor there like what happened when I hit 67 this year I'm like where is time gone we hit 44 years of marriage at the end of March and it seemed like it just happened but four children and 11 grandchildren later we are living it up we're busier now we were when we were starting out but we're having a great time I'm going to just sing this little portion of a song and if you know what you can sing with me before he knew me yet he loved me I'm not sure what key do you know what key I sing she's she hasn't played in the piano so long I'm a I was laughing last night sister Rebecca they said something about they needed a piano player and she sat down and hit a few chords and brother Paul says we'll just sing acapella and I was thinking I probably shouldn't even try to sing but just this song came to my heart and I don't see it because I can sing I Sing Because I'm Happy he knew me yet he loved me for he knew let's just stand and yet he loves me he's Glory makes the heaven shine I Was So Unworthy [Music] I'm such Mercy [Music] while he was on
