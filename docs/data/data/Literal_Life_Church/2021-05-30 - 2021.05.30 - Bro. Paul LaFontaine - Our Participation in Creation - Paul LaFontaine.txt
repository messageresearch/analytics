========================================

from matthew chapter 16 and just a portion of scripture that we is very familiar to many of us that have a revelation and the way that god described how he would set up his kingdom and that's by revelations not human intellect but it's by revelation that comes directly from the father and so we're appreciative of that it's nice to have jason and adam with us here this morning visiting again they were with us wednesday night god bless you for being with us and and we appreciate all the visitors i hope i don't miss anybody but god bless you this weekend i didn't expect quite as big a crowd just memorial day weekend so many going on vacations and different things but it's a joy to be with you in the house of god this morning i trust that god will help me in my my feeble way to say something if i if i don't have it for you there's a god that's here that knows your needs and if you you'll you'll just give yourself this morning god knows you better than you know yourself amen matthew chapter 16 and verse 13 when jesus came into the coast of caesarea philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that i the son of man am and they said some say that thou are john the baptist some elias and others jeremiah's or one of the prophets he saith unto them but whom say ye that i am and simon peter god always asks personally what what you're saying that i am and here jesus asked his disciples whom say ye that i am and simon peter answered and said thou art the christ the son of the living god and jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto you but my father which is in heaven revealed it unto you and i say unto thee that thou art peter and upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it just so we understand that the rebel the church is not built upon peter that's what the catholic church says it's built on peter as the they call him the first pope that's not what jesus is saying here the the the rock is built upon he says this rock i will build my church and it was upon the revelation that god gave peter of who he was that is the foundations for the church a revelation and the and when you have that revelation the gates of hell cannot prevail against him amen that's pretty powerful and i will give this is go further now i will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was jesus the christ let's pray together heavenly father we gather today lord asking for your help and strength and your revelation the lord as we uh we just come father we know that what you have given us in the past is secure but lord we look to you again in our hunger we look to you to speak to us we look to you lord in this quiet place that we have just reserved this sanctuary this house of god we look for you to meet us here and to speak to us lord to our individual needs and lord jesus i pray every heart whether or listening online or here in this building would be open lord that you they would remove every wall every hindrance every hesitance and i just pray they would give an open heart not to me today as such but who it is that can speak through me i pray that you'll bless every life you know where they're at you know where they stand and i pray father that you'll just bless us in the service lord in a special way that we can learn of you today in jesus name we ask it amen amen once you shake somebody's hand now that we're allowed to do that say god bless you this morning amen i think that's the first time i've asked for that in over a year amen god bless you all i'm going to bring us back into uh the thoughts and the channel uh a little bit that brother andrew was bringing us into last sunday if you weren't here you can catch it on the archive but it was a wonderful service and i'm going to bring us a little bit back into that and brother andrew last sunday i'd never seen a sermon in my life dedicated to that one thought the prophet proclaimed that we operate the gift of god if god sends a gift it's one thing but we are the ones that operate that gift and i've heard that said before i know the prophet said that but i've never heard an entire sermon dedicated in the way that he did it was a wonderful service if you didn't get it it would benefit you to listen to it but i want to bring us back in that channel again to talk about that a little bit to realize the significance and just maybe look at it in a deeper reality uh that tells us that when we no matter how powerful gifts god sends us that it depends on what we how we react to it and how we exercise our faith to that gift to operate it that we get the benefit from it and we are you know i love how brother andrew said it that we're not poverty-stricken in our pulpit in our lives in the last days god has blessed us incredibly with the word being open like it has we're not we're not um searching we're not uh we're not hurting at all we're not in poverty at all and how many would say that god has sent you wonderful gifts in your life to be able to help you in the kingdom of god in your christian journey if it hadn't been for the gifts that he sent starting with jesus christ and then all the other gifts of the fivefold ministry gifts within the body different ones it's god that sends these gifts and how many can raise your hand in your christian journey i wouldn't be where i'm at today unless god had blessed me with gifts in my life and so that's an important thing can you say amen and it and we realize that these gifts when they come to us they can be among us but if we if we look at them too carnally we will miss the benefit sometimes because we don't see it as god sending that gift and we can have the most powerful gifts that god can sin and yet we have to exercise our faith and look and watch our response to that gift we pull out of that gift the power of how much it can affect us so it brings the responsibility back on us that the the the greatest gift and that's proven right back to jesus christ that the greatest gift god ever sent to man was right there amongst the church and in the jerusalem and in bethlehem god sent the greatest gift he'd ever given and most of the world missed it and when they seen it most of the world rejected that gift the greatest gift god could send and they rejected it they should have been latching on to that they should have been saying thank god he said something to us they should have been saying this is my gift god sent me what can i do and giving their faith to it to believe it but most people didn't and so we are the ones if we can bring this closer now we pull out the power in a gift by our attitude towards a gift by our response towards a gift and i'm not talking about the person because that's where we get hung up is the person sometimes it's always been the the skin test in every age people stumble at the skin that god is hiding in god hides himself behind skin in the old testament god hid himself in the tabernacle behind animal skins badger skins that's a type can you say man that god she kind of glory rested in that place covered and hidden by badger skins animal skins god hides himself in badger skins today we without god we're animals can you say man i said without god you're just an animal you don't hear too many preachers saying that but without god we're just animal skins and we're animals but when the glory of god comes down it's god hiding behind animal skins but we stumble at the skin it's always been a preacher said one time it's always been the skin test with the prophets he sends with jesus and with you and i and with preachers it's always been the skin test people stumble at the skin that god is hiding in but if they could get past the skin test they could see god is speaking to me god is visiting me god is making himself personal to me so then we have this truth that brother andrew brought that that is so wonderful that we uh how much priority we give in we we operate this and i like to use the term unlock what's in the gift instead of operate we unlock it and i'm taking it from my text when jesus said to peter and the disciples with this revelation it's what i'll build my kingdom on and he says if you have that revelation the gates of hell shall not prevail against it and i will give you the keys now when you have the keys that means you're going to unlock something keys mean you have access to unlock something and he not only gave the keys of the kingdom to peter but he gave them to all believers who have the holy ghost he gives you something to unlock so just like we operate the gift and we pull the christ out of a minister we pull the christ out of someone we unlock christ and release christ and bring it to us and the benefit of everyone else we we we not only operate it but we unlock it he says it and let me just word it i will give you the keys of the kingdom and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven oh i wish i could preach that as powerful as i want to preach it that is the par and that's a revelation from god that you hold in your heart look at the power that goes with it why would we be afraid of the devil why would we be afraid of his demons why would we be afraid of of anything the devil has for us when we hold a revelation the gates of hell cannot prevail against it so how many times in history if we if we had god send something and hardly anyone recognized it or gave themselves completely to it respecting it fully and pulling from it everything they could pull from it you know we are so cynical today there's such a lack of trust today can i get an amen the the devil is trying to talk us when god sends a gift the devil's trying to talk everybody out of it the devil's trying to put it down the devil's trying to create a scenario again i shouldn't say create but to bring a scenario against it to cause people to doubt cause peter lacquer even towards a pastor or any other gift the devil's worked overtime to try to talk us out of things even talk us out of the fulfillment of malachi 4 5 and 6. look at the devil trying to talk people out of it trying to take away the validity of it we're some 60 years past that visitation now of malachi 4 being fulfilled and the devil doesn't care he's still trying to talk people out of trusting that this is the gift god sent us here 60 years ago and he's finished his work but the devil tries to talk us out of and cause us to have a lack of trust and even though the devil talks to people and makes them cynical and skeptical and lack of trust i want to proclaim today no matter what the devil did or what he's done god went ahead and did what he said he would do and he has done it he has said elijah and there's nothing you can do to stop it how many believe that with me this morning see the devil puts a little doubt and oh yeah well this that and the other putting dates together he had his dates wrong and all the other things that's the devil's work he either said elijah he didn't ascend elijah and if he sent elijah he brought the word to bring us back to this bible can you say man i was sharing that with the brother the other night the the young brother that was here and i was just saying we're so blessed in the last days because god is restoring back to his truths that got lost and he did that through malachi 4 5. god went ahead and did it but the devil's trying to talk us out of these gifts that god sends and when he does that i mean he's doing the greatest damage he can do because when people lose trust i don't know about that i don't know about this i don't know about these i don't fight for a mission i don't even know about brother paul devil works overtime and he works right mainly in that vein you know the devil's not trying to get you to smoke or drink or wear a miniskirt that might be part of it but he's trying to get you to lose trust in the gifts that god sends i'm telling you friends the bible says in john 1 he says there was a man sent from god and his name was john he named him and so if god can do that in the bible he can do it again there's a man sent from god whose name was but the devil's work is to cause us to lose trust in that in the gifts that he sinned and the greatest gifts that he can send if people begin to not operate it and utilize it and have a right attitude towards it and say you know what i believe this thing i believe it can help me i believe god can i may not be perfect i mean i have a lot of problems and a lot of questions but if i can trust what god sins at least trust that and say god i trust it i know that you said it and faith begins to move we operate the gift to be a benefit to us and that wasn't just happening back 60 years ago that's actually happening while i'm preaching this morning because you can look at this big bigger bigger preacher it's just quiet i'm allowed to say you're not allowed to say amen to that especially after yesterday and all that good food that my wife cooked ooh that was good costs a lot of money too you know i don't understand one thing is how we spend all this money for this big open house and all this food and all this entertainment all this thing and free rides on the john deere for the kids we pay all this money for a food and that girl opens the cards and she gets to gallivant and take off with all the money i was trying to figure that out this morning how does that work i don't know you're gonna hightail it out of town tomorrow to arizona go to the camp he's probably taking every bit of that money with her and we're stuck with the bill i don't how does that fit into what i'm preaching here i don't have a clue where i'm at do you think do you think god as brother andy was saying is we're not poverty-stricken do you have god has a you think god has any less of supply right now in your life do you think god is lacking in the gifts and let me say this is that people have so much confidence in elijah and brother bran i'm fulfilling that and if you don't understand that this morning be glad to spend whatever time show you scripturally that god was supposed to send malachi 4 elijah in the last days to and so that work is finished now but a lot of people said they trust that gift but they don't trust the gifts that are speaking now our god's not that little and they somehow lift that gift up way up into you i can trust that i can trust that but now listen you are limiting god god is big enough in this service can you say amen and god has sent you gifts in your life right now that if you'll believe and operate those gifts you can move on with the lord amen so there are resources in the body of christ now can you say amen the spoken word coming into his people is an abundant supply it's an inexhaustible fountain the prophet called it we have today an inexhaustible fountain to drink from if it can't run out can you say man it is rich i'm rich in faith and hope and love and the word of god i'm not poverty-stricken this morning i have access to the riches of heaven but people if you don't tap into it you can have resources all all around you gifts all around you but you have to have the right attitude towards it you have to operate it in order for it to help your life you have to join in you have to give can you say that and our brother's using saving last week as an evangelist you have to amen there's something about an amen that says sick them to a preacher there's something about amen that operates the gift and allows us to preach more freely i still ain't saying amen i still had and i don't feel like it uh you know i had a rough day yesterday you didn't have as rough day as i had yesterday in the last three weeks yeah uh we feel pretty rough i'm already given out here this morning everybody say praise the lord i get to get a drink i don't feel like coming i don't i'm really tired from yesterday so i'm not going to show up to church today listen i'm not so sure you wouldn't be a little backslid because i don't care how tired a believer is there is priorities that i'm going to come and hear the word of god uh drink coffee get yourself awake splash cold water on your face have some red bulls brother lucas i want to hear the word of god i may not make any other events this week but there's i'm not going to miss this event right here because the lord has his gifts in the body and i want to be around those gifts and i want to tap into those gifts praise the lord he's an inexhaustible fountain and you know that that young boy wednesday night at the service he tapped into something he broke in conviction and repentance we prayed with him we talked to him after i tell you friends you need to look at church the right way that's the reason why we're here can you say man i don't know how you look at the politics or you look at the thing and did everybody make decisions just right what happened wednesday night with the broken heart of that young man that's why we're here [Applause] his hungry heart tapped into something and a gift brother brandon speaking holy spirit came in that place and i want to compliment the congregation too that wasn't in a rush to leave because we got some spirit-filled people here that can sense when god is moving and they stayed and they stayed and they kept praying and kept worshiping thank you all for not being in a rush in your life because that's what's important that's what we're here on this earth for is the holy spirit and his gifts that he sends and we tap into them to see lives changed to see his hearts broken in contraction that's why we're here it's not the church buildings and administrations and who has the next position i care nothing about that that the holy spirit comes in revelation and convicts hearts changes lives that's why that's what the message is for that's why we gather can you say amen we should pray for our children to have an experience with almighty god you can give your children everything else in life and not pray for them to receive the holy ghost that's the most important thing but a gift working is what would and us activating that gift and and and there was a gift working there wednesday night and that's why you can take it or you can leave it based upon this based upon your feelings sometimes you can push it off but it's it's it's it's you know it we must realize that when god's gifts are speaking then we we should respond activate them praise the lord begs the question what potentials are still untapped and and you know i could speak about something past and speak a lot about brother branham's life but we're not there anymore we're here and we draw faith and things from those stories but i won't spend a lot of time on that because we're he's fulfilled his ministry can you say amen and no so i asked the question when you speak about operating the gifts that god sends you or is it how much potentials are still laying in the body and in the gifts of god untapped this morning how much potential how much of christ in you is still untapped how much is still in me that's untapped when he preached last sunday that's the question i was asking by our hesitance or by our cynicalness or or by our approach to christ that's hesitant how how much is still untapped of the glory of god through the gifts of god and we don't tap into it because we're hesitant i i think of the woman at the well and uh so many times the prophet telling the story and i believe it's because she was the type of the bride of christ today she was a harlot she was a harlot and and he said well that's a type of the bride of christ yes because spiritually we're all harlots boy you won't every preacher say that we're hard because we got all this mixed ideas and religions and all this thing and if it's not religion you came from it's dabbling in the things of the world so your spirit is a harlot spirit it's it's dirtied by the world you just give your soul and your spirit to all kinds of dirtiness and filth on the internet and movies and all this stuff that's that's what you spiritually do to your system that's a harlot and so spiritually that one with the well represents this bride we all come as harlot spiritually and when she came to that well jesus was already there waiting for her and she she came up to him and he said can you give me a drink and i'd like to bring this out and show it he he asked something from her and jesus he's seen the response he asked something of her and asked a drink of her and she she's she defaults back to what the norm is and she's going back to everything she's heard it's not normal for me a samaritan and you and i to even be talking with one another we don't have the norm is is that we don't connect and we don't do things and you're asking me for a drink and i probably shouldn't do that that's how people are they're they're motivated by the past and by the norm but when jesus comes the gift comes he doesn't want you to operate but what you've heard him but the past is and by the norm he doesn't want you to operate that way because he had something in that woman that he had to tap into and if she would have held he had a gift for her she had something within her her and he had something within her and that needed to come if she'd held on to her past idea she'd have never got it because his response is when when she asked for a drink he asked for a drink he said here's the words i want you to get if you knew who it was that was speaking to you now let's not apply that to the woman with well it's quiet this morning if you knew who it was that's speaking right now you see that statement i could preach a whole sermon the sermons could be preached on because that's our world that's the cynicalness of this world his gifts are laying right there around them but jesus said if you knew who it was that was speaking do you know who's speaking to you do you know what god has blessed you with gifts in your lives and i'm not talking about just the pastor and all the wonderful gifts we have in ministry here at the church a lot of different ministries a lot of different gifts but even you as a believer you have something within you to give to the rest of the body and i'm not talking about stacking chairs you have a portion of christ within you and for some of you it's not tapped yet because you've got so much hesitance but you have something in you that i need you have something in you brother paul you need something i cannot get by without the body of christ i was going to talk to a man a few weeks ago i said you know he doesn't attend church at all and but he believes this message and i said you know i just wanted to say to him hey you know what you and i believe the same message probably being the rapture of being heaven together and given that given that because he's a brother he believes like i do i said i i felt the difference in you and me is i need i need the fivefold ministry i need it and i need the body of christ they are my family more than even my own personal family i need them just as much as my personal family my granddaughter she's here this morning i love her to death you should have seen her face on that tractor yesterday i love her that's family emotion i love her to death but listen i would i would never trade and ditch the body of christ because this is my royal family right here and i need you i need the gift that's in you when i'm around you you have something to contribute and when that comes out i get blessed by it see when you look at church it's all a nicolaitan thing that all the holiness is in the pulpit we got to get away from that this is a body ministry this isn't even about william branham completely anymore this is about a body ministry and you are a part of that body no matter what the devil has told you there's something in you that's untapped and i need the body of christ i need the fifo ministry i need my family with all of your corpse and different personalities that sometimes this kind of we clash and we clash sometimes not because of your personality because of my personality with all of that i still love you and i need you and i need to be around the body of christ i draw strength from the christ that's in you and jesus said if you only knew who it was that was speaking to you why was she clouded in that idea because she was reaching from all that she had heard this isn't appropriate we can't talk to one another i'm in a different category not just a harlot but she's a samaritan the jews looked down on the samaritans she took all of that norm and she's using that and if she'd held on to that she would have never seen who it was that was speaking to her she would have never been delivered are you thinking about what i'm saying she would have never went any further in her life pastor harlotry or any of that if she'd held that thought that you know i'm less than you and jews look down on us and we don't believe the same we don't worship in the same way you can't hold on to any of that you're prejudiced looking at the church that there's in crowds and circles in the church that i'm not a part of and all the other things yeah fleshly fleshy things can get in and people have clicks and stuff but if they start up too much i just preached against him because it's of the devil to have clicks so the devil have people think in the church that they're better than everybody else there's certain families or whatever that are better it's wrong it's the world it's satan trying to divide there isn't anybody here better than the next person we're all sinners saved by grace we're all born as i told the young boy there on wednesday night we're born with a serpent nature we're all under the same category born in sin we all need the cross we all need the blood we need the gift of jesus christ we need the gifts of the fifo ministry but we're not gonna get out of here you are in the same don't get lifted up and say i don't need the body i don't need to be around you don't do that you need it just as much as i need it the gifts that god sends in his body you need it so much so that he said the pastor if you give him respects he'll lead you through to the other side that's pretty powerful now when i think about that i'm not thinking about myself personnel and myself paula fontaine because i guarantee you i i don't even i don't know how to do it i wouldn't know how to i don't know how to get you to the other side but the gift in me if god speaks through it it'll get you in a rapture if you give it respects if you say this is the gift that god has put among us this gift god has put us and many other gifts god will work through his gifts as you tap into them and unlock them can you say man i want to let me say one more thing about the woman at the well and she says if you only knew who it was that's speaking to you you would ask him for a drink so now if you recognize somebody else is speaking to me other than just this flesh vessel in front of me now you got to ask and so that's everything that andrew preaches right in there because she's going to activate she's going to she's going to bring out she's going to unlock by her response and her attitude she's going to unlock he said if you if you ask me for a drink i'll give you waters of everlasting life i'll give you eternal life you have to ask you have to uh operate the gift the gift can be the greatest gift in the world but you have to operate it right you have to show an attitude that's correct towards it you have to keep your attitude right can you say amen a lot of people are still christians but their attitude has become just hard it's all right it's quiet here a lot of people are still christians but they've let their they've got what my dads used to call the disease hardening of the attitudes a hard heart you're christians but their attitude towards the gifts of god has changed and he says if you ask me for a drink if you knew who was speaking and if you asked me for a drink that's the problem we don't know who is speaking to us and if she did jesus said you would ask if she understand who was speaking jesus said you would ask me if you understand who it is speaking to you you would be asking everybody understand if you understood who it is speaking you'd be asking you'd be probing lord i need this in my life you would pull on eternal life and you would operate all the things that's laying there and you would get everything you can by asking by believing by entering in and then she unlocked what he had in him by just simply asking and she started to talk with him she started to open her heart then he discerned her heart and she because she did if she'd have kept that mindset that we're not supposed to be talking to each other and i'm blocking you out she'd have never got deliverance because she but because she she started to ask and she kept talking in god settled all of her questions god set her free god gave her deliverance you know why she got deliverance because there was a gift in her there was a portion she was a seed of god all the outside she was a harlot everything everybody's seen but in this inside only god could discover and this is what i'd like to make the point too it didn't take 10 years in a seminary to get this woman delivered it didn't take a psychological seminar to get her out of her harlotry one moment in the presence of god and her identity was revealed she tapped into him and he tapped into that gift in her and she tapped into the gift in him and when that connected in one moment her harlotry and her lifestyle was finished with the things of the world finished now i know we grow in the lord and i know certain habits but on the inside she was changed on the inside come see a man that's told me all the things this is isn't this the very messiah just one moment in his presence friends but you see if we hold and hesitate and we don't operate the gifts when he's present among us if we don't pour ourselves in then we won't get the benefit of what god has for us in that gift and we can't tap into the potentials i believe in my congregation every one of you sitting here and those that are listening i believe there is untapped potentials in every one of you you're only going so far because of your past because of your hesitance and i'm gonna love you right through all of it because i've got that too but i'm here to tell you you have you haven't capped out yet you haven't tapped out yet you have so much more potential in you for christ i've told women that were baxted i said you know what i see something in you and if you would get rid of this and give this to the lord i see you as a pillar in the house of god filled with the holy ghost there's more potential in this room there's more potential in your life and some of you think well i'm old and i've had my days of shouting and i've had my days and yes i believe this and and you've heard all the quotes and you're sitting there this morning i know where he's going next and yeah i know that quote that's coming up now this is all become old to you i'm getting too old to respond and all my goodness do like my wife has to tell me quit acting like you're 80 years old you're only 55. your life is not over that's what she tells me your life is not i'm just like last night i'm just barely making it to my bed and i said han just go tell those kids to turn that fire off and quit go to bed and you know what she got all these things and she's just as tired as i am but she's got all these comments to me you're not 80 years old your life isn't over yet you know she says i want to do some fun things still you know life isn't over we're not just going to sit here in a rocking chair i say well why not why can't i sit here in this rocking chair i'm going to say that to you spiritually i'm going to quote my wife to you spiritually your spiritual life is not over yet your spiritual life is not over yet could it be that the best is yet to come in your spiritual life you've been through hard times you've lost loved ones you've dead all this you've been you've made mistakes and everything but could it be your best years are yet ahead could it be that the most spiritual journey you've ever taken is just in the future for you could it be that god has some great glories for you just down the road if you just tap into the gifts god has given you and tap into that which is within you your spiritual life ain't over yet it's not done yet oh the glory days of the camp meeting you in the glory oh and i just felt his presence you can feel his presence this morning if you just healed yourself your spiritual life is not over yet the best is yet to come i feel tired this morning and i'm going to quit here in a minute but i'll tell you i'll just say to the devil my best years of ministry are yet to come my best songs that i've ever written are yet to come there's inspiration to tap into there's things laying within me that still got to come out and it's the same with you giving up just trying to give up say it's all over now and just you become some warmer you ought to defy the devil and get up and say i'm not no bench warmer i'm a participator hallelujah i'm a participator brother brahman says if you get that quote brother kyle whoever's up there today a greater witness than john he says but now you yourself you are christians and you pull that gift out see it isn't me it's your faith that does it if it don't have no faith there's nothing can be done it's your faith that operates the gift just like christ when he was here on earth this little gift to me this little you talking about his own gift this little gift to me is just like a little spoonful out of the ocean here and christ was like the whole ocean he's calling his gift just a spoonful christ was the whole ocean now i happen to believe his gift was a little bit more than a spoonful that's what he said his gift was and so he goes on to say is that he says it's not it's just not as much of it you see so it's that's the way a gift of god is now it's your faith that operates that gift the woman touched his garment jesus never said oh i no jesus said no i did something he said thy faith he looked at the woman says your faith has activated this gift thy faith has made you whole there's what brother andrew preached that's what brother andrew preached it's in this in it with the woman with the woman that touched him of his garment she's saying oh you healed me lord no thy faith has healed you you operated the gift and guess what she didn't have to have an interview with him she didn't have to to to have two hour session with him she she had sex faith she said i don't have to touch his body because people always they want to get close to got to touch something and sometimes that's needed but this woman said i can't get to him the crowd's pressing i can't hardly get to him i'm not going to have an interview with him that's not going to happen he doesn't have time for that but her faith risen that i don't even have to touch his body we would think we got to touch jesus body i don't have to touch his body if i just touch the bottom part of his clothes if i could just press through the crowd and just touch the bottom part of his clothes i don't even need to touch his body i don't need to talk to him she just touched it she's completely whole and then he says thy faith has healed you not i've healed you thy faith tapping into the gift you operated the gift what you need this morning from the lord will come to you as you operate the gifts that god has given to you i want to turn this around just for a minute here just like you operate my gift you stir it up when you say man you stir it up when you you stir me up when you text me and say go get them brother paul thank you so much stand for the word keep preaching sometimes even from ministers different places it's such an honor to get a text listen again god bless you thank you i don't give any glory to myself it's of the lord but i uh we all like to have a compliment don't we but it's but you operate the gift you stir me up when you say amen but when i preach did you know i'm stirring up something in you that is untapped in you and your flesh resistance sometimes your flesh is i can see it on your faces because this flesh is not born again but if you only knew who was speaking to you the gift is trying to tap into something that's in you in your soul deeper and if you can get past all the stuff boil out all the fluff and all that stuff you can see what's really happening here i'm actually operating something in you and stirring something in you didn't paul say to timothy stir up the gift that's in you i'm stirring something up in you so i want to turn this around one of the reasons god fills us with his power is to use us to affect those around us one of the reasons god fills us with his power is to affect others around he doesn't give us this power for ourselves he gives it to speak words of life to others his presence comes to affect us but the true evidence of being in his presence is us recognizing and using our influence to see others changed as well is this okay his presence changes us and causes us to help change others death and life is in the power of the tongue so i i'm i'm going to title this our participation in creation and i'm going to finish here in a minute because i don't have the strength to go on but but i'm going to finish it maybe next sunday our participation in creation when he says i'm giving you the keys to the kingdom to unlock to lock that's pretty powerful and most of what god gives us this for is to speak the words of life and creative power there was the word the logos and the thoughts of god coming into the logos in the beginning and he spoke it let there be there it was it was the logo speaking it that's how god works comes from the thought comes the word and then it's spoken and when it's spoken it has creative power in it it begins to create what was spoken so he's standing there at the beginning but did you know in the new testament did you know that we have a participation in creation when the early church came brother abraham says the seed comes through his body it's because somebody else spoke the word that somebody else is going to get it not necessarily speaking through angels and speaking through a cloud and speaking all the old testament all the other things he can do that but in mostly in the new church it's the creative power we're participating in god's creation because in the new testament it's new creations it's not the moon and the stars and the light and the and creation it's the new creation and that's in you we are new creations will you participate in someone else coming to a new creation you participate in creation so we have power in our words what we say all right let's make it simpler we're all here today in our lives we have what we have and we have our marriages and our families you know where it all started with words if nobody would have said nothing we wouldn't have what we have right so there's a certain creative power that happens that you're with the wife that you're with and you've got the family it all has developed and you've got the house and everything else but it came if nobody would have spoken something it would have never happened on a level like that the power of it let me get simpler i have four beautiful children i have a beautiful grandbaby i have a strong bodybuilding son-in-law i have a beautiful wife i have a nice home i have a nice truck i have a john deere tractor i'm just listing this stuff my world is just full of things now and i miss mostly a beautiful family and you know what i have all that today and even a lot of the ah never mind let's not go into that the financial benefits is more because she's better at that stuff than me but all i have all this because one day on the phone with becca i said the words i'm interested in you and i'm going to be spending more time with you that's what started it just a sentence and i got all this if i hadn't said that i wouldn't have all this look at all this i am a blessed man but i realize wow young people should watch what they say over the phone if you say i love you you better mean it but i said i'm interested in you and i'm going to be spending more time with you i was very confident i'm interested in you i'm going to be spending more time with you well she said the feeling is mutual and i said praise the lord do you have the holy ghost do you like freckles important questions before you get started but just think about i have all this and it's all that one sentence on the phone i've looked at that a lot how powerful are our words to actually create things in this realm and create our future by what we say so death and life in the power of the tongue we better watch what we say we better say lord let me say the right things let me be like hattie wright and say the right thing it actually and so that happens with my wife but look at hattie wright she said brother branham that ain't nothing but the truth triggered the holy spirit coming in that place just a simple little statement he said i give you the salvation of your two sons right now until she said the right thing in the presence of the lord she said it and so how powerful is our words to stir up the gift and what it is of christ in other people i think of peter that was standing there when jesus said i'll give you the keys to the kingdom and just a few days later there's several thousand people asking peter what do we need to do can you imagine being a place what do we need to do to be saved hundreds of thousands of people what do we need to do to be saved and guess what somebody was there with the keys to unlock to all of those people peter had to say it he's the one that had the words to unlock christ in that whole crowd and if you think that's different today it's not any different you have the keys of the kingdom i've been in situations in the last few years and i'm just casually talking and sharing my heart with someone in the grocery and the different things and i realized god was speaking to me through that they get back with me i see him again saying you know what you said one sentence there and you didn't realize what you were saying but it's changed my world it's happening now we have the creative power of god upon our lips and if there is a part of christ in us then what we say can stir it up and unlock it and bring it out you have the power to do that that's why he saved us that's why he fills us with the holy ghost and peter says yes repent and be baptized he had the keys to unlock salvation in the holy ghost to all of these people because he said i loose the kingdom of god to you now he he says he he just preached the word he just told the word he didn't necessarily the words say the words i loose the kingdom of god to you to be saved in jesus name no he just preached repentance and he preached the word and that's what unlocked to them the potentials of salvation brother brahma says in attitude in 1950 i'm afraid that the church if you have that quote i'm afraid that the church doesn't know their authority i'm afraid that holy ghost born men doesn't realize their authority or the authority that god has permitted to his church i'll give unto thee the keys of the kingdom whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven whatever you loose will be loosed acts 1 and verse 8 if you have that scripture up there acts 1 and verse 8 says ye shall re and ye shall receive power acts 1 and verse 8 ye shall receive power after which the holy ghost has come upon you how many is glad for the power the holy ghost brings power to live an overcoming life but ye shall receive power after the holy ghost has come upon you but it's not over and ye shall be witnesses unto me so god fills you with the holy ghost not just for power but that now you're going to be speaking as a witness you're going to bring it to someone else you're going to tap into what that christ is in someone else i trust this week that you can practice with this watch your words and say god anoint my words to say something to somebody in kindness in the holy spirit love can you say amen that would draw something in them of god out of them we have the power to do it creation is calling for something that is not there let there be light this this that its creation is calling for something that's not there if there's no love we bring it on by our words creation is something that's not there but we speak it and then it's there if there's no love we bring it on by our words no one will do it for us sons of god make it happen by faith religious people will for will wait religious people are always waiting for god to do it for them or someone else but jesus said if ye say to this mountain be thou removed believers call jesus on the sea and others want a distance between them and god if there's no peace we call for it if there's no happiness we call for it we ask for it we create it by the word of god some wait for god to deliver them from habits some say there's going to be a feeling sweep over me someday and i'll be delivered from this habit you might wait for a long time but i wonder if you just start speaking the positive word of god over your life and that habit will be done sometimes i speak it and habits are done by something i speak we have to recognize that death and life are in the power of the tongue and if you say to this mountain how many years did abraham declare things that were not as though they were too many in the church and in the message depend on others for other things and waiting for others but this is the hour of a personal revival not a national revival or even necessarily a church revival nobody's going to speak changes to things but when we begin to speak the word the positive attitude towards it we begin to bring out things in other people the more i look at it seems that we have a huge part in pulling the potentials of christ out of others we are handed the keys to unlock the kingdom within in this work of new creations god uses his own people to speak just the right words and to bring others and bring their potentials out in the first creation he by his word spoke unseen things into existence in this new creation he's still speaking it but on whose lips if something is laying there that is untapped if the word is to be may come flesh who is it that pulls this out god working through his body the bride is making a transition she's been making it for years and i believe it's these things chris the next chapter i'm going to take and joshua shows us the thing the land that was taken under moses and then the land that was taken under joshua there was just different stuff taken under moses and his leadership but everything changed under joshua and there was more land taken under joshua the bride is under the joshua commission and i believe that we're moving past just an emphasis on what the prophet was and all that the bride it's a body ministry you have to see that this word is in you and it must be spoken to untap the resources you're sitting there today i don't know who you are but you're saying that i've got a lot i'm bound by a lot my past everything i'm here to tell you that it can be gone in a moment's time your past it can be gone if you latch onto the word and say i believe this word i believe god is speaking to me and i believe my future is in the hands of god you'll watch those things fade away so quickly we have a participation in the creative work of god and i'm going to get into this in detail in another service but you wouldn't believe the power of the tongue to speak life to another individual that's why the body of christ is important we are participating in the very creation of god if it had been like that in the beginning he would have had us alongside as he spoke those things into existence if we'd have been there in these bodies he had us standing there and speaking those things with him today he's doing it in this new creation he's adding a stand there with the same word speaking life speaking the word into existence i just feel his presence here this morning these are deep thoughts but i think it's where the bride is going the bride of christ is moving past just an emphasis on the man william branham please understand not there's no disrespect but we're moving we're not moving past the message we're moving past the emphasis of what god did through him and taking this word and realized we are little creators and if you want to change in your home if you want to change in your life begin speaking the word sometimes inspiration hits you and you hold back and i don't say that sounds a little strange don't hold back if he puts something there speak it watch it develop watch it just cultivated and developed and materialize look what he said here in the third seal and i'm closing on this sir just see just stay behind the word that's all christ retreated to the word himself it's written see now stay behind the word but eve she began to kind of let down she never let it all down she only let one little phrase down and that's what satan wanted her to do he got her from behind god's promise by reasoning don't never try to reason god's word just believe it you see see we're taught by culture no no you don't do you don't ever do that and that's the problem with the culture that teaches it because that may be true with teachers that are teaching your children in school the government that's issuing things to us that from one day to the next change no trust in that when when covert was around we're supposed to trust the science trust the science trust the science stick with the science and then when the science is out about whether a guy is a guy or not and a girl's a girl or not ignore the science completely stupid just stupidity i have zero confidence in the political system the cdc none of it i'll follow certain rules but i'm telling you they don't know what they're doing they don't know because they're godless can you say man i got one trust and that's the god of this bible that's what i trust in but they teach us to be cynical towards everything the problem with being that way and just having this principle just believe it if god said it just believe the problem is if we use the world's mentality we'll talk ourselves and disbelieve the very gift and the very word he sent us and if we disbelieve that we're in trouble be skeptical be this be hesitant be not when it comes to the pure word of god that's the devil talking to you if it's the word believe it receive it and watch it materialize in your life praise the lord let me finish this quote he says now he got her from behind god's promise by reasoning don't never try to reason god's word just believe it so she stepped out from there and before adam ever got to her for a wife she was already defiled by satan and she and did you notice christ did the same thing exactly now for redeeming now he's in the subject of redeeming now god had to be there first and did you notice mary before she come to joseph the holy spirit had done got there amen see that's where the redeemer come that's a powerful point is that the serpent got to eve this proves serpentine the serpent got to eve before adam did so when he reverses it all back for redemption god got the seed into mary before her husband joseph and it was a physical seed talked to someone a few weeks ago was it a physical serpent seed yes it was physical not just a spiritual it was a physical seed why because mary had a physical seed put in her the very supernatural god and she had a baby and it was christ she had a real baby she didn't have a spiritual baby so if she had to have a real baby then it must have been a real baby that come out of the serpent i know we said the serpent nature and the spirit of it and all those other things but it wasn't adam who had cain it was not just a spiritual deception going on with eve it was a physical deception and a sex act and and before adam got to her with his seed the serpent got to her so how do i know that because when he comes to mary he gets to her before joseph i just settled so much in my heart just now excuse me a minute while i shout a little bit because i was trying to explain that to somebody and and that just opened up to me so real that if the serpent got to to eve before her husband did then god had to get to mary's room with a physical seed before her husband joseph all right praise god now notice i know i said i was stopping about 45 minutes ago i'm all over the place today i don't even know i'm just tired that's all there is to it but in my soul i'm ready to shout praise the lord brother ray all right notice the natural woman fell and god made a way for her to be redeemed although she had fallen he made a way now that was the first bite on earth fell before her husband and her were married she fell by the reasoning instead of staying with the word she fell and she fell to death eternal separation with her she took her husband and everything else there was on the earth she fell but now but god full of mercy made a way to redeem that woman and now he promised her notice now how did that entire fall take place it started with words from the serpent words how powerful was the words of the serpent to deceive eve and reason with the word it started right there with a little sentence and the fall of the entire creation took place because satan misinterpreted the word how powerful is it in your life when you say sentences i'm going to get into it i'm going to get into these little arguments and these little things that you say to tear down people and these gossips don't come next sunday if you want to preach gossip preached on i'm going to preach on it because i don't care what you say here in church what you're saying at home in your home creates an atmosphere in your home what you're saying to your children creates an atmosphere and creates their future many times the true word would be known to her now remember because he promised christ to the woman and christ is the word saint john 1 in the beginning was the word was with god and the word was god and the word became flesh and dwelt with us god dwelt with us in flesh he was the word i'm coming to the point before a word it's a thought and a thought has to be created okay how is that created before the word it's a thought and a thought has to be created all right so god's thoughts become creation when it was spoke by a word that's when he presents it to you as a thought his thoughts and it is revealed to you now stop right there a lot of people even in the message stop right there his thoughts we're hearing his thoughts preached every sunday when we get into the word we're hearing his thoughts preached and then things are revealed to us but that's not the end his thoughts is revealed to you then it's still a thought until you speak it it's where the bride is that's where the bride's going because they're reading their helmet preach preaching conventions all the thoughts of god oh we're rejoicing the thoughts of god thoughts of god and uh listen if you're not bringing it down personally to you and speaking those things you're missing something right it still stays in thought form until you speak it don't you see where jesus said if i say to if you say to this mountain not if i say jesus jesus but if you say to this mountain be moved and the first thing i guess in moses time big old green fly i don't know where that quote is but i'm skipping down here he can do what he wants to he's god the creator the only thing he can do is just speak it that's right he's this creator what's the next one you have brother kyle is there another one or not okay i'll get it here notice that god told eve that after so long a time the word is coming back to you now how did she fall i want my class to say it what did she fall from what did eve fall from the word is that right the word and god said he'd make a way to redeem her back to the word again all right after so long a time the word would be known to her all right the word would come for one purpose now redemption how do we get back how are we redeemed how does all this work its way back we have the word we speak the word we fell from the word he gives us this word back again we bring it into our lives and we speak it and we say lord when i spoke this i'm waiting for it to materialize it's going to start happening just like when he said let there be light as soon as it's spoken by holy ghost the holy ghost it starts to develop and materialize and become what it needs to become if you have something impossible i'm preaching to you a god that nothing is impossible and your way out is a lot easier than what the devil making the devil make it he's making it complicated but you're way out of things and you're changed and you're it's a lot simpler than what you're making it we have the word and if we have the word we put that upon our heart and we put it upon our lips and we watch god friends this message in this word is not church it's not another movement it's not another hatched teaching from a man out of a denomination please this doesn't even have to do very much with william branham this is god's word restored back to us and when we have the word back and we take it and we speak it it will do all the things that are impossible to us if if i didn't know that i wouldn't preach because i'd just be another preacher that's waiting for my seminary notes to come from things and no life in it this is not that this is the spoken word of god the original thoughts of god coming to his people again is that too deep for everybody that's not too deep is it eve fell from the word god gave it back to us when we speak it watch it do its work and i want to get into the power that you have with the holy ghost to speak life to someone and we shut our mouths my mom used to have a song unspoken words how my life is so filled with unspoken words we hesitate we hold back we don't need to hold back i'm not talking about being belligerent but i'm saying you have something within you and sometimes you just speak that word and you you'll see things begin to stir up in another life your teenager your child your coworker he has it oh i'm not a preacher no no this doesn't have to do with preachers now this is the life in his body you could have speak the creative word of god can you say amen sister janice i don't mean to embarrass you but are your eyes better today they're not
