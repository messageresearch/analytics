========================================

hey man i i told brother jason man you didn't preach everything what we're gonna say tonight you know how many enjoyed that amen i really did amen i certainly appreciate it and if um if i could say anything about it's a lot of things brother jason said but i wanna i'm gonna give you some armor tonight i'm gonna give you some weapons tonight and one weapon he gave us was the word amen y'all remember that he said when you say amen it forces god to fulfill what you amen hallelujah hallelujah amen means so be it hallelujah so when you amen the word it makes god stand out attention hallelujah remember harry right all she said was that's nothing but the truth and god said give her whatever she wants right hallelujah so god's going to do his part you just do your part amen romans chapter 10 let's start reading it um verse 8 the bible says but what saith it the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth and in thy heart that is the word of faith which we preach that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the lord jesus and shall believe in thine heart that god hath raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation amen let's go to um hebrews chapter four hebrews chapter four hebrews 4 and um let's start at verse 14. hebrews 4 and 14. the bible says seeing then that we have a great high priest that has passed into the heavens jesus the son of god let us hold fast our profession for we have not in high priests which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmity but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in the time of need amen the lord and bless me of his word you can have your seats praise god is this my water praise god if it's not i don't believe brother jason will kill me tonight by god's grace i want to use for a subject honest confession honest confession amen you know it's it's too often when we hear about confession the devil he wants us to draw up he wants us to pull back and not confess that in which we have need of but uh i don't necessarily want to talk about confession as a weakness but i want to talk about confession as a power amen confession as a weapon amen you know before i go forward let me read you something the prophet of god said he said only by your confession can you be saved amen so for you to get anything from god you must confess that he is lord if you need healing you must confess him to be a healer if you need deliverance you must confess him as a deliverer if you need joy you have to confess him as a joy-giver amen so your confession is very powerful tonight but let's let's finish he says he says only by your confession can you be saved that's the most powerful weapon that god put in the hand of me hallelujah so i want to tell you young people tonight the most powerful weapon you got one of them tonight is your confession and the scripture says that if you confess the lord jesus christ as your savior you shall be saved hallelujah so our confession brings christ on the scene and you know the prophet god said god can't do nothing for you except first you confess it but let's let's take it a step further hallelujah you know he says it's the powerful weapon that god put in the hand of man is a confession it's a communal and a confession holy communal means to commit it to god and you may say brother jesus i'm struggling with this i'm struggling with that confess it and commit it to god those are the two powerful weapons that god has put in the hands of the belief but your confession must be honest you can't just be going through the motions hallelujah for the church people you can't just be going through the motions to get mom and daddy off your back it has to be something honest you have to sincerely say god i need your help lord i can't do this without you not just saying lord i'm sorry but hallelujah say i'm sorry and change your ways that's what a real confession is confession means hallelujah to say the same thing that god has already said about you so as you confess let's think about what god has already said over you holly he said that you're healed and not sick he's saying you're the head and not the tail well let's let's let me give you another one that god said he said i call the young people because they are strong this is how god thinks about you this is his confession harley but let's read a little bit honey you know the greatest thing with with us and uh us as young people and people in general when we think of confession we think about what we're hiding you know and i can't let nobody know this and the more you think like that the more the enemy will have control over you but a real confession brings god nearer you look in the bible for anyone the bible says that god he he he dwells where there's a broken and contrite spirit hallelujah so god loves to comes around that person who's needy god loves to be in the midst of those people who can say father i need your help i can't do this on my own father i'm so sorry i've been a failure god loves those kind of confessions because they're honest and when they're honest what happens when your confession is honest then mercy comes [Applause] and i know we don't want judgment tonight we want mercy so i'm challenging you not to hold those things down in the depths of the hidden areas but confess them out and let god give you mercy hallelujah we don't want god's judgment hallelujah we want god's mercy so why not confess it and come clean remember hallelujah remember the woman that the prophet of god talked about she committed adultery and her mindset was i'mma take this to my grave and she was doing a pretty good job years and years and years have went by without her confessing it but then it got a span of time in her life when she started getting sick and she couldn't explain why she started getting very ill and very nervous and she didn't know why so there was a prophet on the scene so she said she had to get in his meetings and and see what's happening with her so she went to the province meetings and just to make a long story short when they when she had a interview with the prophet at his house he started seeing a vision of her in a car with a man who wasn't a husband because a man a husband was in the military going overseas he said i see you almost got hit by a car and see you almost got hit by a train and she fell out streaming and hollering and her next words to the prophet was nobody's supposed to know that but i'm telling you tonight whether you confess it or not god already knows [Applause] he's just trying to help you to obtain mercy hallelujah he already knows but if you want to keep that sickness inside of you if you want to keep that pain inside of you god will let you go ahead and this lady was on the brink of killing herself because she had a secret [Music] and this thing started taking over her being she couldn't sleep she couldn't eat she couldn't and this this is this is the crazy part she was a sunday school teacher she tried to bury she tried to bury her confession by doing some good in church you can't hide your realms from god by trying to be somebody in church you can't hide from god by trying to be faithful to service no god don't want your hands he wants your confession god wants your heart god wants your life so you know what she comes to the prophet and she says oh my god nobody's supposed to know that nobody's supposed to sin and she's streaming and hollering and all these things and midi comes in and she starts to tell me please don't let him tell nobody that please and brother branham's next response to her was well sister i can't do anything for you i've already showed you by the grace of god what the problem is now it's up to you to get it right and then she starts to sing but it'll mess up my home and that's what happens we hold things because we're afraid of our losing our social status we're afraid of how our friends gonna look at us if we really tell our friends you know what i really want the holy ghost i know we hanging out i know we doing our thing but this is not my destiny i really want to serve god i really want to be filled with his spirit i really want the anointing and the power of god in my life i don't want to be out there in the world too many of you are afraid of losing your facebook and ig and twitter status you're afraid of being looked at different on snapchat well let me tell you something if the holy ghost is not on you you're already being looked at differently hallelujah and what is it like anyway if god don't like it don't mean nothing he's gonna vanish away anyway so this is what happens church she holds it she's crying and she wants to walk out and god's mercy god's mercy put the prophet into another vision and he says your husband is this tall and this color hair he works for this company well he has the same thing to tell you hallelujah while you're thinking i don't need to let nobody know that i'm coming through this they might have the same problem they might be going through the same issues hallelujah none of us are exempt from trials and tribulation hallelujah i might be standing here preaching tonight but i have to go to god and say lord i need you i have to go to god and say lord i'm not able hallelujah father i don't know what to do i don't know what my next turn is how i don't know if i'm going back on the floor god i need your help hallelujah but what the enemy will do the enemy will say don't you do that you're going to look weak well let me look weak because in my weakness i'm made strong [Applause] hallelujah in church she walks out she leaves and she tries to make all these excuses why she shouldn't confess i'm a sunday school teacher and not first that she defends her husband and she says not my husband he's a deacon and this is the next thing that caught me the prophet of god says because of that sunday schools teacher unconfessed sins and that deacon on confessed sins he says no wonder brother johnson can't have no revival because you got things in the church that's holding back the anointing of god hallelujah you got unconfessed sins hallelujah in people's lives and they come in here and they smile like everything is all right and full of with trouble he says no wonder brother johnson can't have a revival in the in church she goes and she meets he says you could pull oil on her from the top to the bottom of the soles of her feet it won't help until she confesses it but look at how she tries to play a game with the prophet she says i've already confessed that she said i confess that to god and most of us most of us will try to play that same intellectual intellectual game with god she says i've already confessed that to god and the prophet zeroes in on he says you didn't do that to god he said you committed adultery on your husband you have to tell him what you did now that takes a little bit more courage because now she's about to step into something she can't control hallelujah and that's what the prophet was trying to get her with her hands hallelujah meant nothing her confession in her life is going to be have to put in god's hands so she comes and she she finally he says i can't help you i can't do nothing until you make it right and then she goes and she she finds her husband and she starts to tell him everything brother branham told her and then she says he says to her who you've been talking to god knows all about you he knows what make you tick he knows what makes you upset he knows what encourages you so why hold on to things that are no benefit and church from there he says well i'll tell you what honey let's just start fresh if you forgive me and i forgive you let's just go on with god and they repented to one another they confessed to one another then they came back to the prophet husband they listened to the prophet's terminology when they came back he said when they came back it was different he said when she came back in the room it was different hollywood and in another place he said now i can't control that devil whoa he said now i can control the devil why because now the devil has no rights he has no rights because their sins have been confessed and once you confess the devil can't hold you anymore he has no rights he has to be cast out then but as long as you holding on to it hallelujah think about it the oil the prayer and all these things can't budge him but once you confess it and make it right the mercy of god comes in hallelujah it casts that spirit away he says now i can control that devil he prays for she's delivered and then the grace of god they were looking to give up everything and he says no go back to your ministries just continue to serve god and you know what he was saying go and sin no more once you confess it ask god for strength not to do it anymore see that's the power of the blood when jesus came holy the acceptance of the blood of jesus takes the desire of sin away [Applause] that's why we confess jesus christ as our savior because the life the blood the gene and all the things you've been hearing this weekend about christ has the ability to change your desires by faith hallelujah when you accept the lord jesus christ by faith it takes away the old testament covenant and under this covenant hallelujah this life the life of christ it connects with your life and it gives you power over sin well you don't have to keep going back into that thing keep going back into it holly the confession of jesus christ hollywood has the ability to make you whole put romans 10 back up again for me romans 10 verse 9. i ain't gonna be too much long y'all know i'm about to close listen and most of you have heard these scriptures before but let's take it to a different place he says that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the lord jesus holly most of us have fulfilled that part we say i believe in god i believe in jesus can i get amen and if you have it i'm gonna show you tonight why you should hallelujah he says that you shall confess with thy mouth the lord jesus and shall believe in thine heart you see with your confession follow you it goes into two stages it comes out of your mouth but it has to become what you're confessing it has to become a life hallelujah he said and thou shalt believe in thy heart hath raised them from the dead thou shalt be saved so if you confess the lord jesus out of your mouth and you believe it in your heart then the life of christ takes over your being and the reason why we don't see a lot of young people living for god is because they don't believe it in a heart it came out of their mouth but they never stepped into a real surrender [Applause] hollywood a real surrender is when you say god i give you my life that's when you believe it from your heart when two people get married they give up their rights to live for the other person [Applause] jesus if we go back to hebrews 4 it says we have a high priest holy that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities he knows what you're going through amen but you know we hear so much about other gods and all these other things why jesus why jesus why not lebron why not cardi why not taylor why not kim k you know these are the worldly gods but what makes their gods better than our god you have to be able to answer that question somebody asked my daughter they said this is this girl in school actually say how can you serve a god that you don't see and my daughter's response was we don't serve him by our side we serve him by faith wow hallelujah if you hallelujah shall confess with thy mouth the lord jesus shall believe in thy heart hallelujah you're believing him you're accepting him by faith hallelujah god honors faith he said when i return will i find what faith your testimony has to be a testimony of faith i believe that he is god but just in case you ain't there yet let's go to matthew 28 hallelujah matthew 28 why jesus why don't we serve him what's so special about jesus christ hallelujah matthew 28 verse 18. listen young people this is why we serve him the bible says this is how to just just look at this he says and jesus came and speak unto them saying now god is talking nobody else is talking he's gonna make a confession god look at what he tells his people look at what he tells his church earlier look at his confession this is about to come out of his mouth the scripture says and jesus came and spoke unto them saying all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth this is why we serve him because there's nothing that can stop him he's unshakable he's unstoppable he's unquenchable on heaven and in earth you give me your tv god they can't say that they got limitations hallelujah your favorite songwriter they got limitations hallelujah your favorite author they got limitations but jesus said hallelujah heaven can't even stop me oh wow he said in heaven and in earth they can create whatever kind of bomb they want god will still come out of it and you wonder why jesus because he's all powerful and there is nothing like him this he should be your confession tonight i speak jesus hallelujah hallelujah your name is power your name is healing your name is life you know what that name does breaks every stronghold [Applause] whoa i just want to speak the name of jesus church look but you got to get there you can take it down let me read something to you listen young people i want you to catch this the prophet says this isn't a message come follow me he says you make yourself when you're young you make yourself when you're young got any young people in here he said you set your ambitions to what you want to do and what you're trying to achieve in life you think of it and as you think of course your mind it is presented into your mind by an unknown something that dominates your mind so the things you think on on a regular basis it begins to turn you into your thoughts and that thing begins to dominate your thinking holy and the scripture says as a man thinketh in his heart so is he honey so why not consecrate your mind to the things of god why not consecrate your person to the thing of god because once hallelujah it gets into the womb of your mind it will begin to dominate you so why not let the word of god get in there and the word of god will begin to dominate you and you'll become what the very thing that you're hearing [Applause] you become the very thing you're listening to you make yourself when you are young don't y'all know catholics start at about five years old five to four years old they get them so young and indoctrinate them and it's so hard to get them away from that why because it becomes a part of the thinking hallelujah and once it gets to be a part of that person it's hard to turn them away from me totally let's keep reading hallelujah he says and then when it becomes in your mind then you speak it that you're going to do it and then your ambitions drive you to do it hallelujah whether you believe it or not if you haven't given your life to christ there's something driving you and if you have given your life to christ there's something driving you hallelujah so you can't get away from being driven you're either going to be driven by the spirit of god or the spirit of wrong hallelujah there is no middle ground my brother jason was talking i think he was talking about a peacock and a black white bird you could dress that bird up all you want is still going to be a black bird holly and you can come here and you can sing songs and and build a choir and all these things but if your heart ain't in it you're just entertaining yourself [Music] and i can tell when some of you your hearts ain't in it amen because we're singing songs about the power of god and y'all up here like that and we hear the verse and say your name is power so you don't understand your situation you don't realize hallelujah what it means to be in bondage once you ever get out of bondage hallelujah and you begin to say that his name is power hallelujah you knew that it was something that came in and took over that situation you knew it was something that wow you know it was something greater hungry that came than what you was going through church when you get to that spot young people when you get to that spot when christ begins to make himself known to you honey nobody can take that away from you but let's make it very plain very simple if you're not filled with the holy spirit just ask yourself what why why why why why not we have enough word coming forward we have a true anointing in the church hallelujah we're singing songs of zion amen we're preaching thus say of the lord amen god comes and visits the church and people are healed and we see the dynamics all these things so why don't you feel i'm gonna tell you why the prophet made it very plain very simple he said and the only thing that kept me from being saved when i was 12 years old you mean god can touch you at the age of 12. god can visit you at a young tender age before you become a teenager [Applause] god can get a hold of you and give you a true confession holy a true walk with god he said the only thing that stopped me at the age of 12. about short hands how many of you older than 12. i ain't gonna mess with you don't be afraid and even before 12 god can touch you but listen what he says he says the only thing that kept me from being saved when i was 12 years old because a spirit hung over me so if you haven't received christ in the magnitude of changing your life with the expression of the holy ghost it's because there's a spirit hanging over you and i know some of you parents i think little brother that's just too harsh don't be so harsh you keep on babying that spirit and that spirit gonna stand up in your face one day [Applause] that spirit gonna tell you one day i don't want to go to church that spirit go start talking about the pastor and dare you to say anything back that spirit gonna start saying all kind of stuff because you're babying it that's why god told saul saul go down there kill all the amla kites he said kill everything kill mother sucking baby goat dog kill everything she mama daddy kill it all you say brothers that's kind of rough kill a baby kill it kill it in baby stage why because when it grows up it's going to be an amalekite [Applause] and you need the holy ghost you know why because without the holy ghost you got traits of your family tree in you and you become what the generations before you were without the holy ghost but with the holy ghost it by the generations of the third and fourth generation the holy ghost hallelujah stops the spirit of alcoholism from getting on that sun that was on that father hallelujah the holy ghost stops the promiscuous spirit that was on their mother trying to get on that daughter hallelujah because the holy ghost is life he says the only thing that kept me from being saved when i was 12 years old because a spirit hung over me and then he makes a real plane a devil oh you thought we was gonna sugarcoat it tonight no if you ain't got the holy ghost you got a devil [Applause] yeah you don't want to make eye contact that's all right see it's too often we try to pacify things that need to be dealt with let me tell you young people something there's no reason why you shouldn't have a victorious life [Applause] there's no reason hallelujah because god has sent a vindicated word he's given it to vindicated men hallelujah and the expression of god is being preached hallelujah and all you got to do is open your spirit and receive all you got to do is receive holy now i don't know about y'all hallelujah but i live i live a tough life but i love to receive just now losing paul and you know he got those uh honor palmers in there and i just been receiving you want some water i don't know i'll take an arnold palmer god wants to give you what you stand in need of but first things first you must acknowledge him holiday you got to say god i need you hallelujah he says the devil he said listen what this devil is saying he said the devil saying wait a little while longer and some of you been waiting a long time but let me ask you something in your waiting has life gotten better it hasn't gotten any better so what are you waiting on hallelujah he says it was a devil saying wait a little while longer that spirit hung over him hallelujah and he says that's the reason you wasn't saved when you become the age of accountability he said a spirit you got in the crowd you got in a crowd what kind of crowd a crowd of a bunch of other unsaved people and you know those spirits they call for help hallelujah those spirits will reason those spirits are talking to each other these those spirits are saying but you ain't got to do all that and you young people are fighting things and i'll be honest you young people are fighting things that we didn't have to fight holy but we still got the same god we still got the same goal hallelujah in this day and age they're making drugs legal we didn't have to worry about that we we shunned away from it a lot because we couldn't just walk around boy this thing fight just that gas seeing what's wrong is accepted to be right nowadays in school they'll tell you man you ain't doing that until you start dating the same sex you ain't doing any girls until you got a girlfriend boys you ain't doing that until you got a boyfriend those are evil spirits hallelujah god created adam and eve not adam and steve [Applause] but i'll tell you how perverted that spirit is it starts with a confession and now you got these crazy parents who when they have children they'll say well we're not going to name it we're going to let it be what it is when it grow up [Music] i don't know about you guys but if i have a baby and it's a boy i'm going to name it a boy [Applause] there's all this weird psychology and all that stuff holly you want to know what you are go look in the mirror this is plain god didn't make this thing complicated hallelujah what's your name victoria that's a beautiful name i guarantee you if me and victoria stand in the mirror together victoria will say i'm a lady cause i sure don't look like this guy and i guarantee you she has no desire to look like me it's just that simple but if an evil spirit perverse mine what that thing teller well you look better as a man lying devil [Applause] lying devil [Applause] one time i was preaching a young lady came in the prayer line and she said brother dicks the devil is telling me i'm a lesbian and this is how he talks to you and gets in your head he says he says to her that i'm a lesbian i said well why why do you why are you believing that she said because every young man that i wanted to court or marry they ended up getting involved or marrying somebody else and then my girlfriends were always there to comfort me they were always there to hold my hand and lift me up and care for me so i believe i'm a lesbian because my friends are always there to love on me i say no sister satan's lying to you i said that's what good friends are supposed to do good friends are supposed to be there in your time of trouble hallelujah but don't pervert the love hallelujah don't let the devil avert the lord hallelujah is friendship godly friendship is a love of innocence not perversion julia and your girlfriends are there to love on you with an innocent godly love not a perverted sexual love hallelujah and we ended the conversation like this i said well let me ask you a question do you still desire to have a husband she says yes i say any discussion let's say because you still got a desire to be married to a man what satan is doing he's lying to you hallelujah amen because that desire shows what's going on in the inside hallelujah and the prophet of god said hallelujah the deep color to the deep hallelujah so if you're a desire to marry a man there has to be a man out there for you somewhere and you hold on until you meet him and say i do and i think just uh i don't say that the craziest thing is watching two men holding hands walking down to why they love each other what a perversion you know why it's a perversion because those two men could never have a child without a woman you know why we're addressing us because the spirit is in the room and satan's been trying to tell some of you young people sway to the left no stay the course look in that mirror if you see a woman that's what you are look in that mirror you see a man that's what you are holiday and don't believe anything else hallelujah you say all brothers in my heart i think this and the bible says don't touch your heart [Applause] the only time you can trust it is when it's filled with the holy ghost because death is not your heart it's the heart of god and until you're filled with the spirit you cast down vain imagination [Applause] hallelujah look i know a young lady who backslid on the lord when she turned 18 why is 18 such a magic age for girls who have been who've been running the course they've been serving god and then when things don't go that way when they turn 18 they get a spirit on them say they feel sexy and i'm feeling i'm gonna leave this church because i'm ready walking like you got a sack of potatoes in your shoes honestly honestly that ain't attractive that is since we're here let's just really kill the devil them big old things like you're a ladybug that ain't attractive ain't no tiger you look like a big old bumblebee or something why be all fake up with all that stuff on earlier a man needs something real holy he don't want you to peel back all that stuff and he got something oh my god [Applause] father he'll really be praying lord please give me perfect love come on brother and a woman was a real man she didn't want some 65 walking around the house mama boy these get tough he can't change the tire can't put air in the tire can't cut the grass can't fix the pipe can't do nothing [Music] but he know how to hook that john madden up you know how to hook that nintendo up come on brothers y'all gotta do better than that church that i always say and i'll say it again before you get to that spot make sure you ready make sure you've done everything you're supposed to do so you won't mess up somebody else's life and i hope brother paul don't mind but you parents stop pushing these kids to get married and you know they're not ready you know your child not ready you know she won't be a good wife you know he won't be a good husband and you push him to get married and he mess up somebody's life you want to protect that child just like you want your child protect [Applause] exactly he said there's not a man that's got his right mind but what wants to do right can i get amen and i believe everybody in here wants to do right but because there's a law inside of you when you want to do right you do what that's why we need god don't get nervous i'm coming down he said but there's something he said but there is something won't let you do right is that right he says the congregation says amen he said that's the devil hallelujah christ paid for your healing and your salvation amen so if you ask yourself tonight brother these why i keep going back to this thing it's a spirit and you got to confess that spirit unto god and let god take it away from you amen see once you confess it amen it gives god the power hallelujah to come and take that thing out of your life because you're telling god lord i give this to you and i i tell you right now church hallelujah there's not anything that i've ever given to god that god hasn't taken over but what we do too often we'll ask god about something and we already have our answer like balaam we already know what we want god to say so we're not really asking god we're just going through the motions don't go through the motions tonight tonight is the night for a real deliverance [Applause] church before i close remember i don't think we was talking about this remember when david committed adultery with bathsheba he was wrong as two left shoes but you know what he did that with the heart of god god that didn't change god said david was the man of the god's very own heart but he got caught up with his own human desires hallelujah and him and bathsheba did something they weren't supposed to do and david holy the king david the man after god's own heart hallelujah premeditated murder fornication holy he lied adultery all these things were happening from a man after god's very own heart but god so rich is mercy church there's always a bigger picture church and you look what david did there was no excuses he was supposed to die he meant babysitter was supposed to die but this is what i like about it when nathan the prophet go back and read it secret samuel harley when uh chapter when when samuel when nathan when nathan came to david he began to tell david a a parable and he said david it was a man you know and i'm gonna just hit the high notes there's a one man who had one sheep this other man had so many more he had hundreds of people having the number is he said this man that had one this man that had so many went and tucked a man who had one and david looking at that thing you know how you can see somebody else wrong but you can't see yours you know you young people do you judge each other in the crowd she had boyfriends and she didn't need all this she just nasty and you can quickly judge her for all the mistakes she's made but if you could see her mistakes and you don't want to be like that her life is grace to you you won't look at it like that but because you can see all her faults and not want to fall into the same channel her life becomes the grace of god when we want to step back and condemn that person for everything they're doing and if god allows you to see it and not want to be that that's god's grace in church when you think about what the lord has done and what he's doing and and and and and just the grace of god you you see david all the stuff david did and then god comes through nathan giving everybody all right gives him the parable of the of the two men that have one had much and one had little and by the time he finished telling david about himself david didn't know he was talking about him david was ready to jump all over him because it felt like his sins were exposed and y'all know how we do especially young people you feel like oh we all know what you did you need the holy ghost but your stuff is secret and you need the holy ghost hallelujah in church nathan comes and he says david this man took this other man and david after david heard the whole thing david said where is he i'mma kill him i'ma kill him i'm gonna destroy him and then nathan says david you're that man what does david do he doesn't try to justify his actions he doesn't say well i'm the king i can do whatever i want he doesn't try to say well about sheba she know i come out there every day and she just did that on purpose no david falls on his knees and repents he confesses his wrong david says first thing he says he says lord i have sinned and because he confessed it even though god already knew about it when he confessed it the mercy of god came next holy because he was supposed to die but sheba was supposed to die because there was no excuse for that amen oh yeah but because his confession was made right god gave him mercy and nathan said david thou shall not die [Music] why because he made the right confession and young people everything about you is for purpose every mistake every wrong everything is a purpose and you look at what david david placebo we look at and we say man what an awful act god had to let it happen why that was the only way we can get psalms 51 creating me a cleaner oh god and renewed my spirit within me [Music] that psalm came from what he did with bless you so god has a plan even when you look like you're messed up he just want you to make it right hallelujah but if we think about god our confession unto him in my closing i want you to see that god will never ask us to do anything that he hasn't already done young people adults saints i want y'all to know there's no other confession greater than the confession of god let's go to joshua chapter 1. joshua chapter 1 verse 1. god told abraham he said because there was no one greater no one else could do what he asked what he said was going to happen in abraham's life god said i'm going to swear by myself god confessed to abraham that i'm going to be the one that helped you get through this promise hallelujah joshua chapter one he says now after the death of moses the servant of the lord it came to pass that the lord spake unto joshua the son of none so who's talking to joshua the lord the lord is talking to joshua this is not moses it's not another prophet god is talking to him now listen let's keep going he says uh and all this he said he says moses my servant is dead now he's telling joshua don't worry about moses no more this is between me and you the prophet was good but now i'm going to talk to you just like i talked to him god is confessing now god is telling him what he's going to do he says hallelujah he says now therefore arise go over this jordan thousand all those people into the land which i do give them god's saying whatever you stand in need of i've already given it to you this is his confession hallelujah he said even to the children of israel let's go oh my god come on young people i'm talking about god's confession to his people look what he told joshua he says every place that the sole of your feasts are tread that have i given unto you just as i told moses hardly so the same promises god has given brother brethren he's given them to us [Applause] this is god's confession to his people hallelujah wherever the soul of your feet shall try i've given it to you for possession let's keep going from the wilderness to this lebanon even into the great river the

god said he will not fail me nor forsake me he said no man will be able to stand before me all the days of my life that's his promise he confessed that to me and you know once it comes out of his
