morning wherever you're from we welcome you here in the church may God bless you and uh if you're thinking that the service is almost over we're just getting started we are just getting started amen we have no other place to go what what's more important than this praise the Lord hearing the word of God and sitting at the Lord's feet what can you say to me Lord to help me in the times we live in and to be able to live overcoming life Matthew chapter 3 and verse 11 just one scripture and it's speaking about uh just John the Baptist speaking and remember John the Baptist had the spirit of Elijah on him and so he said this one statement that's been just really speaking to my heart this week I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance but he that cometh after me is mightier than I how many knows there somebody mightier than a prophet amen John said it all the prophets pointed to the Lord as the mighty one that's right they didn't point to themselves if they're a true Prophet I indeed baptize you with water under rembrance but he that cometh after me is mightier than I whose shoes I am not worthy to Bear he shall baptize you not with water he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire in speaking about fire we'll go to the end time prophecies and that's in second Peter uh chapter 3 and just add a few things as we go to our day second Peter chapter 3 excuse me I believe that would be yes second Peter chapter 3 verse 7 but the heavens and the Earth which are now by the same word are kept in store reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and predition of ungodly men verse 10 but the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent heat the Earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up verse 11 seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved what manner of persons ought you to be in all holy conversation and godliness amen amen father we just want to thank you for a life that was lived in front of us Lord not only just our sister Erica and her short 40 years we're thankful for her testimony all the way to the end and her Godly life Lord I pray you'll be with the family today as they meet together this morning and have the memorial service Lord and their their hearts Lord be grieving for their daughter and wife going I pray Lord you will be such a comfort to them Lord I pray you'll be near them Father and in the coming days give them the strength that I know they feel like that may they don't have give them that strength in this hour I pray in Jesus name and we're also thankful for our dear brother Billy Paul who you taken to his reward and I'm thankful for his life I got a chance to meet him a couple two or three times and Lord I feel privileged I got to talk to him a little bit and his encouragement to me as a young Minister Lord was so wonderful I appreciate it so much Lord we pray for the brandom family today that you will be with them as well as they've lost their daddy and their grandpa Lord and Great Grandpa be with them all today we pray and as they have their memorial service tomorrow be with them then and in the days coming we commit that to you Lord we commit the service to you and the word that we've read Inspire it to our hearts through your Holy Ghost we pray in Jesus name amen amen God bless you you may be seated I have been asking the Lord to continue to help me to rightly divide this subject of the Holy Ghost that we've been speaking on and to keep it in the Simplicity that God in ended it for as I said at the beginning of this series the subject of the Holy Ghost has been really attacked by the enemy so much but I just want to say something positive you never need to be afraid of the term the Holy Ghost you never need to be afraid of the Holy Ghost it's something you never need to let Satan complicate it's never meant to be complicated it's actually if I could say it this morning the greatest miracle that can take place in a human human being is God's Own spirit being injected into your life so it's interesting that Satan would take the greatest miracle that can happen to you and complicate it and make it something that you would be afraid of that is not God's work that is the enemy's work but it is the greatest thing the greatest miracle that can take place in your life is that God's Own Spirit could come into human beings and if that is the greatest Miracle then I think that we should also uh be ones who if it's the greatest miracle that we should be also asking him for the greatest miracle if we don't have that great miracle we should ask him for that great miracle because he's given it whosoever will may come can you say amen and he's basically said if you ask if you knock if you persistently ask he's going to give you his spirit and so you have to ask but we ask with more fervency when we know that it's the greatest miracle that we could ask for now how many of the rest of us have a life that we ask God for miracles for other things we ask God for miracles now there's some people uh that don't believe in a supernatural God there's some people today that don't believe in God at all uh but there's some who believe in God but they don't believe in a supernatural God but there is a lot of people that that believe in God but I find it interesting that uh the worst thing about us sometimes is is the person who wants God and he wants God in his emergencies and he wants God to be a miracle working God and even will ask God I I need a miracle I I I need this but one thing that we don't want to do is we don't want to micromanage God and only be asking him for the Miracles that we want but the other miracles of the Holy GH ghost coming in us we back off and say I only want him that's micromanaging God that's saying I want only out of God what I want but I'm preaching to you that the greatest thing that you could ever ask God for is to fill you with his spirit and if you're going to ask God to perform a miracle for your life with sickness or anything else and you avoid the greatest Miracle then I'll tell you and I'll challenge you today there's things that you need to ask for that are even more important than miracles in your life God can do Miracles God heals the sick God heals cancer as he did our brother he's done it for years and he'll still be a miracle working God but I'm saying the greatest Miracle you can ask for is God putting his spirit in you somebody say praise the Lord this is what we should be asking for this is the greatest miracle that God could do and God is not your Aaron boy God is not your grandpa why do you say that because we live in a world that he's a grandpa to go you know how Grand you know Ellie you know how papa is uh you know how Papas and nanas are it's like they come to Papa and Nana to get things that they know their parents would not give them it's just they they they they're working the system and yesterday yesterday I I walk out out of my office studying and she's by herself out in the Florida room and she comes out that door she's by herself which is she don't need to be in there alone that's where all the candy is sure enough she comes through that door and she's munching on something I said what did you get [Music] nothing so and so but you know it's like to me it's like all you had to do is ask Papa and I'll get you one you don't need to steal it but people make God a grandpa people make God their Aaron boy and they only go to prayer did you ever notice that after 9/11 how spiritual the nation become people were putting there praying praying people that hardly have ever prayed now it's like we need God oh this is serious is it and you notice it only lasted for a few months and they go right back to the idolatry again they don't want God that what he can do inside of them they want a god they can call on for miracles but only temporal miracles only natural Miracles only miracles of healing I'm desperate I love desperation but it's not fair to God to only ask him for the things that you want when there's something that's been provided that would actually be powerful enough to change your life from the desire of sin and you haven't even asked for it what's the criteria for getting it the only thing I can see is when he said in the Book of John he said what father wouldn't give his children something if they asked he said what father wouldn't do that if it's good for them he said and our heavenly father he said all you need to won't he give the Holy Ghost to them that ask him praise the Lord greatest Miracle you could ask for in desperation is being filled with the Holy Ghost so rightly dividing this truth of the Holy Ghost and bringing it in Simplicity to the youngest child can understand it it's it's it's quite a challenge uh the experience of the Holy Ghost has suffered interpretations of men is swinging One Way making the Holy Ghost evidence an emotional workup and then swinging the meaning to another way where we just have dry-eyed mental exercises with no power in it at all that's the way he swings people's interpretation of the Holy Ghost even to this day even to this day Satan is still swinging the interpretation to Great workup of emotion and Swinging it over to intellectualism he's still doing that but hopefully as a minister and I'm only responsible for my church here I'm not trying to speak to the whole world unless there's a Hungry Heart to hear I'm responsible to my own church to teach the the balance of what the Holy Ghost is that true word births will come and people will know that they know that they know that they have this change within their life I want everybody here to know that you know that you know that you got it and you're going in a Rapture that's my desire as a pastor so I'm preaching for this purpose for my own church that we can have everybody I don't want to leave any of you behind I'm going and I don't want to leave you behind and the only thing I can see in scripture is that they're not going in there's foolish virgins there's wise virgins and the only difference that didn't go in is they didn't have the oil the Holy Spirit the only difference I want everybody to get the oil I want you to be filled with it I want every young person every child that comes to the age of accountability I want every one of you to be filled I don't want to leave a hoof behind I want to take all of you in the rapture oh but there's predestination and all the I know that but that's up to God I'm preaching the Holy Ghost so every one of you will get it I'm taking all of you in with me that's my desire praise the Lord so we we find then that we we we want to rightly divide that to a person knows that they know that they have it and this change has happening them and when it does there's no more doubts and there's no devil will ever move someone with that Revelation that they have what they need no devil will ever move it can you say Amen am this statement that John the Baptist makes with the spirit of Elijah on him reveals so much and I want to just settle down and elaborate on it for a minute in this series this statement John the Baptist makes in Matthew 3 that he says that I'm baptizing you with repentance I'm baptizing you with water I have my calling I have my office to you I have the spirit of Elijah and so I'm meant to forun the first coming of Christ I'm the voice of one crying in the wilderness Make Ready the way for the Lord I'm to prepare the way for the Lord and so I have my calling I have my office and that's to baptize you if you come and repent I'll baptize you with water but he says there's one coming after me there's somebody that's following this message this is my message and I'm leading you to it but I I will phase out someday and there's one coming that's mightier than me somebody say praise the Lord and I wanted to just elaborate that that that his John's Ministry was for a purpose it was to introduce but it was to lead to something else it wasn't to stay with the focus on John the Baptist it wasn't to stay with the focus on Elijah what I will do I I will do my position John says and I will fulfill this but I want to let you know there's one coming after me the message of Elijah was not complete without Christ coming the message of Elijah will never be complete until the one that comes after the message comes and incidentally comes in your life else the message means nothing until he the one that's to come after me John says he will come and I'm pointing you now to him the Lord amen it's happen really in every message every true Prophet there's something to follow Christ is to follow it's been said even by the prophet of this age there's a time that something moves from the prophet to the prophecy there's a transition that goes from the prophet and the emphasis on a prophet to the actual prophecy and guess who that gets fulfilled in not the prophet in his people but he said there's one coming after me I'm baptizing you with repentance but there's one it was repentance It Was preparing for something it was to forerun something and as it's been said in this hour by the angel of the Lord that as J John the Baptist forun and come before my first coming you and your message will forerun the second coming of Christ that's what's been said and we see the Vindication of that being fulfilled in in all the scriptural fulfillments of the last hour if God forerun his first coming with a messenger with the spirit of Elijah then he will do that in the second coming as well and we've seen that fulfilled but we've got to start looking as that but when I'm finished when I'm done I'm forerunning this and if if if we don't get to who's coming we can fall short of the purpose of the message we are not continuing to glory in a prophet we are not continuing to only glory and what God get in the prophet but the one Christ who comes after him this is what John is saying Christ will come after me there's one to come after me that's mightier than me he's greater than me and he's coming ever be watching because there's something coming after my message and it won't be another man it won't be another Prophet it'll be Christ there's a mystery of this throughout the Bible there was a transition from Moses to Joshua Joshua meets Jehovah Savior Jesus Jehovah savior there was a transition from the prophet Moses to Joshua Moses died Moses my servant is dead his ministry was as far as his physical Ministry it was over there was a transition from Moses to Joshua how many know there was a transition from Elijah to Elisha how many know that Elijah spoke the words and went off the scene and there was a young Prophet Mich that had to speak the same thing as what Elijah said and he didn't speak anything different than what Elijah said he spoke the same thing got in trouble was put in a prison for it because he spoke the same thing I feel that way sometimes the the messenger's gone but I'm still up here preaching things that he said and I get in trouble for it sometimes people buck up against it and all I'm doing is being a Micah I have no message of my own preach the word stay with what Elijah said can you say man and I get in trouble for it but that's my office in this hour to bring Christ to the people can say man to say the word that was said so that you can come into your inheritance and so the transition came from Moses to Joshua from Elijah to Elisha from elizar elizar eleazer to Rebecca who had an office of introducing her husband to her but when his job was finished it was about Rebecca somebody say praise the Lord From The Prophet to the prophecy and so when it does when it comes there's one that's going to follow me it when it does he says it's greater it's mightier now we don't think that because if we look at the powerful things that happen through someone else that's gone before us like the prophet of the sour or like others who have been before us when we think it what's mightier than that what could be greater than that but John said the one that's coming is mightier he's greater we don't think that we seem so so we see so much of the powerful work of Elijah but Christ Christ being in the people is greater Jesus himself said the works that I do shall you do also so there's even a work that was coming after Jesus Earthly Ministry that he would say the works I'm doing shall you do do also and many more works you shall do so it's a transition to go from there's something here but there's something coming there's something here but there's something coming and we must not miss what God is bringing after we must not miss who this person that's coming after the message is sent I will say that the third poll though not a public show is greater than the first and second poll anybody who knows that truth would raise your hand and said the f the third pole is greater and mightier than the first and second but yes the yet the first and second is so much more visible we would how can that be greater when this one's quiet and there's no public show but nevertheless it's more powerful it's more Mighty can you say Amen the third poll the word being in the people Christ being manifested in this bride is greater than the work of a prophet am I getting trouble for saying that but I'm saying what John said he that comes after me is mightier than me Christ being in the people is greater than Christ being in the Prophet come on now Christ being in the people sinb born people the power of God in their lives the signs following their lives is greater greater than God being in a prophet I said it a couple weeks ago Jesus was born without sin so it's not a real big thing that we see Miracles and God and the Oneness with God and him uh raising the dead and him doing yes he did that to display that's what God can do in a human being that's not a greatest Miracle is just his power could come in sin born people that would born in sin change their life fill them with the power of God and the works that Christ did you see it in their lives too Paradox is greater Paradox is something unbelievable yet it's true Hallelujah so in Elijah we could all sit around and be Spectators to what God's doing through Elijah and uh I'm not so sure that that's why the Pharisees heard about John out on the river so we'll check it out ourselves and John was baptizing a lot of sincere people that seen his office in the scripture so they're getting in the water and they're repenting they're being baptized and so he's doing it and then all of a sudden the Pharisees come up and he discerns their motive as a little hey they say well this is good we want to be baptized too and he could discern they didn't really come with a sincere heart they didn't come with repentance they didn't come to say I'm I'm leaving my Pharisee hood and I'm coming to the truth of this Prophet because he's going to leave me to the Messiah they're not saying that say we just want to be baptized because everybody else is being baptized he says you generation of snakes to religious leaders you vipers and you people think I'm a hard preacher people get squirmy and they don't like cuz I preach and I'm preaching on them I'm preaching on them and you know guil is charge yeah I'm preaching on you can I go to the scripture mandate for a Pastor Paul told Timothy and Titus preach the word reprove rebuke judgment begins of the house of God those that sin rebuke before All That Others May fear now don't get nervous I'm not going to call your name but a pastor has to get specific and reprove and rebuke or he's not doing his job if I compromise on that then I can't be your pastor anymore not a god-called pastor but there's going to be rebuke it's going to be hard but I always think if you read the message and you read what John's saying I'm not a hard preacher at all when he can say that have people have a religious spirit with all kinds of Pride I think I'm right I don't need to listen to you and he says you are like your father the devil you come from him and you're a Generation of Vipers I am not a hard preacher boy that Spirit of Elijah was on John so strong the same one was on the original Elijah that told Jezebel who she was and she didn't like it she could control her husband Ahab but she didn't like the man of God because she couldn't control him praise the Lord see whenever I walk away from this I'm just need to stick on my notes with Elijah you can be a spectator and all the Pharisees coming out I'll be baptized too and but John says you he says in one place Jesus says about John in John 5 verse 35 John he was a burning and a Shining Light Jesus said this about John he was a burning and Shining Light and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in this light I don't know if you can pull that scripture up I'd like people to see it Jesus said this about John he was a burning and a Shining Light and ye were willing for a season I'm John 5:35 you were willing for a season to rejoice in his light but I have greater witness than that of John for The Works which the father hath given me to finished the same works that I do bear witness of me that the father hath sent me I have a greater witness than that of John and you were willing to rejoice in his light but now there's a deeper light now there's a further light so what's he saying you can't continue to rejoice in the light of John the Baptist because there's greater light that's come is that okay with everybody Jesus said it himself so John says it's not about me it's the one who's coming after me I must decrease he must increase how many you know that John said that I must decrease now he must increase when we live in the glory of the Days of Elijah it's hard to believe we become a spectator because God's doing everything in the children of Israel were a spectator to what God was doing through the prophet Moses but when they come into the promised land you couldn't just wait Moses was gone so you couldn't just say where's Moses because if we can go to him and ask for a miracle we can watch God do a miracle through Moses Moses was dead no you go into the promised land pick up your sword and start fighting for your own land somebody say praise the Lord it was a transition to the prophecy being in you can you say Amen Christ in you taking your inheritance and going against the devil yourself the days of being a spectator sitting back in the congregation and watching everything I don't think we should be a spectator I think we should jump in ourselves and said whatever is happening here I want it all for myself you don't want to get to the other side and say I was a good spectator no you want to be into it and I Reed the same holy spirit that was being poured out but you can easily become a spectator when there's a prophet around but that but the one that comes after me he says that's what the one after the prophet is what we need even today the one that shows up after me is the one you should know by now the one who comes into your life oh blessed be the name of the Lord the one who's coming after me the one who comes into your life after I preach on Sunday morning here the one who meets you after this is the one who's essential it's not coming to church and hearing the pastor but the one that comes after me in your life this week that's the essential [Music] one it's not coming to church it's the one who goes with you after church you still with me everybody awake amen turn the air conditioner on it's too warm in here people falling asleep it's the one it's not coming to church it's the one who comes after church on now the one that comes after me so now he now I'll take it further the one that's coming after me is greater than I and he will baptize with fire the Holy Ghost and with fire so now I want to preach the rest of the time on this because here in the scripture when John says what's coming after me it's going to be the Holy Ghost him coming after me and he will baptize you not just in water not just under repentance but he will baptize you with the Holy Ghost and Fire now it's God that put that in there he didn't just say I'll come and baptize you with the Holy Ghost because we know the Holy Ghost is unseen I've been teaching that Jesus said about the New Birth he said the spirit goes where it listeth and and and the wind it moves around and you can't see the wind from moving it comes and goes as it pleases and you can't tell you can't tell it you can see maybe something's happening but you can't actually see the spirit so if he only said the Holy Ghost he didn't just say the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost and with fire now we're going to find out today why did he say that it's perfectly in line with scripture as we go back if John had the spirit of Elijah on him then we go back to the original Elijah and we realized that The Showdown with God's people that were backslid Elijah said there's only one thing that's going to fix all this is that you pray to your God and I'll pray to my God and I'm going to show Israel the god that answers by fire is the only proof that he's in the midst so John had to say the Holy Ghost in fire because Elijah is all about calling the the fire down why well we're going to get into that because John is saying to settle he's like Elijah to settle this it it it took one thing for God's backsliding people Elijah said there's only one thing that's going to settle this this backsliding idolatry condition in God's Own people a God that answers by fire I am glad today to say no matter what you think about me I believe in a God who answers number one didn't a brother say that a few weeks ago darl W or somebody we're not just a God that we pray to but we we're we're a people that we're looking for an answer back from God we're a people that crav not just we're pulling up bringing up prayers all the time there's a lot of religious people do that but we're a results oriented people we're calling on God to answer now if he doesn't answer for 10 years we're not going to give up we're not just praying to God and putting our prayers up there saying God I want want you to answer that prayer we believe a God that answers and we believe in a God who would answer by fire God's backslid people God Answers by fire only that and when we have let me just say it when we the reason John the Baptist said when he comes it will have to be the Holy Ghost with fire is because when you have a sin born nature that you're born with when you're full of can's desires for the world and worship when you're born to worship His Own Way I preached on that you're born with a Cain nature you're born with a serpent nature that desires the world but wants to worship your own way when you're born with that baptism and water will not be enough for the sin nature in your soul baptism and water is not enough repenting is not enough there's only one thing that does with a sin nature and takes care of it and that's the holy fires of God to consume it has to be a baptism by fire and that's why his messenger is saying that John is God's messenger but that's not enough we might need a fire oh I wish I could go through the scenario of the whole thing of Israel and uh you know their backsliding condition and Ahab and Jezebel's part that they played and all of that and finally God says that's enough there's a showdown and he says you bring your altar they brought they're out there they split it up just right they cried all day and all night they cut themselves which is incidentally part of idolatry worship there's spirits to cut yourself oh I should have get a greater amen than that all those spirits of tattoos and cutting yourself and loneliness and suicidal Spirits all goes with the other worship of the world all the traits that go with it when you're lonely you're opening yourself up to Spirit you'll never find that in the holy spirit of God you say will you find loneliness yeah you might be lonely but there's a God that can be your friend when you feel lonely it's only the devil that turns you to cutting to cutting yourself it's only the spirit of the world they're cutting themselves and they're laying on the altar all day long until Elijah even mocks them and says maybe your God's on vacation maybe he's taking a little rest because they weren't getting any results from that Elijah said your God is is not real because he didn't come with fire I'm calling for fire so then when they've done it all day Elijah says clean the whole altar redo it set it in place split up the sacrifice get it perfectly in order you know Elijah's Ministry is to set the right Altar for us Elijah Ministry this day you will not find any other message in the end time that sets the right altar of repentance God's order for the church was set by Elijah you try to come up some other way God sent his order through the church through Elijah you start to mess around with those things Church order dress whatever it is don't mess with it because Elijah is setting the order to come before God but all of it is a preparation of the Altar and you know what he did he said bring tons of gallons of water and pour it on the sacrifice and soak it down I love how God does things I'm going to make sure when the fire comes they'll know this is God soak this whole altar that there's no way that a fire could ever suck it up couldn't can't do it and you know what happens all of a sudden he came down and Israel repented this is the true God they should have known that but when you go for through years without God showing up in that way and you become backslid then it's only the Vindication of God answering by fire that's a distinction to the people this is God I'm backslid let the god that answers by fire he come and consume the sacrifice he consumed the altar that fire swallowed up everything that was there so you can know why John the Baptist says this messenger is not enough there's one to follow me we need a fire to answer back to our repentance and to burn out the old nature how many knows there needs to be a fire answer back to your heart of repentance when you repent praise the Lord for that when you're baptized praise the Lord for that but then you be saying God I want you to answer back by filling me with the Holy Ghost I need the god of fire to come in my life the Holy Ghost of fire so it's the one coming after me that will baptize with Holy Ghost and Fire Elijah should have said that when God put the those two things together of Holy Ghost and Fire it's telling us something and now I want to go deeper in this if you can still give me uh another three hours here praise the Lord when God puts those two things together of the Holy Ghost and Fire God put it together don't separate those two things but when he puts the Holy Ghost and Fire together he's saying this Holy Ghost baptism is not just an intellectual thing it has fire with it not physical fire as it was in the days of el but the holy fires of God coming down on your life the Holy Ghost comes with fire we're going to find out why we need the fire because why it it's not just an intellectual stimulation it's not just an invisible thing and this is where God balances me out because I could just preach it all one way the Holy Ghost is just an in invisible thing you can't see I've been preaching on Mary she didn't feel anything when she received it but you know what Mary Wednesday night we were on it Mary she didn't feel anything there was no sensation when the when the conceived Christ in her there's no sensation but it wasn't long she could feel something wasn't long you could see it coming out you can't come to God and not have results happening in your life that you can see this fire is what he's talking about that it won't be just an intellectual thing the Holy Ghost will not just be an intellectual thing but fire will come with it and you know what when there's a fire around you're going to know it right right eventually if there's fire anywhere you're sitting peacefully in your house and you're sitting there quietly and everything's in Harmony and peace and Oneness with one another and everything's so nice you got your house so perfect but what changes everything is if a fire starts the fire's going to make you move you're going to smell it can you say Amen you're going to get nervous I got to save my house can you everything is quiet until the fire comes amen fire fire is going to do something when fire is present nothing will stay the same this I'm speaking about the Holy Ghost when the fire comes with the Holy Ghost nothing will ever be the same this was fulfilled in the upper room someone reported that to show what was happening with the apostles and the 120 in the upper room to show this person reported it I think it was Luke that reported what happened and got it from Witnesses who were were in the upper room he reported Luke or whoever it was to bring it in the word of God that when this happened in the upper room it was not some powerless religious Orthodox gathering in the upper room I'm going to say it again the Bible reports that that upper room was not some powerless religious exercise Orthodox Gathering but clothing tongues of fire set on each of them that's what your Bible says isn't it interesting that John says he'll baptize you with the Holy Ghost and Fire and then when he reported it there were cloven tongues as a fire setting individually on each of them not physical fire but it's it's it's the fire of God splitting himself into 120 Believers and his fire his consumption of himself coming in the people oh I'm happy today I'm happy that I don't have a powerless religion I'm happy that the message is not a powerless religion I'm happy this Bible can come alive and the power of God can show up and change people's lives I'm happy that I can preach something that will kill the very nature of sin in your soul our God is a consuming fire and if you've got sin in that Soul this fire will burn it out of you you got desires for the things of the world still got them this fire will cleanse them out of your soul it will burn and consume every desire for the things of the world Hall it's not a powerless Holy Ghost it has fire with it and it so keeps burning in your life until even this day cuz I want it to keep burning in me it doesn't just burn out the the desire for sin it keeps burning stuff out of you I won't get into it now I'll get in a minute the bitterness the resentment the gossip the tongue that won't shut up you stay in the Holy Ghost it's going to keep burning things out of you that shouldn't be there because our God is a consuming fire I want him to burn out everything that's not of him everything that doesn't belong in this vessel may God's fire burn it out of my [Applause] life that's the prayer We Begin bring before God clothing tongues of Fire God is a pillar of fire how many knows God's a pillar of fire then he splits himself up into 120 Believers when fire is with it it means it will not be an uneventful event the pouring out of the Holy Ghost will not be some uneventful event or boring it's not going to be boring when a fire starts it's not boring when the fire if a fire was across the street just now and we're on the parking lot there's going to be gawkers we're going to be watching the fire fire gets everybody's attention everything's normal no this is just a a normal service and everything's quiet on the home front but when the fire shows up then we're all gazing upon and saying somebody's being set on fire here somebody's being chased God's in our midst and doing [Applause] something and we don't want the fire without the Holy Ghost I don't think you can truly have that you can work up the fire you can pretend it's there through emotion but when the fire's really there he's consuming what's not of God and it works in coordination it is the Holy Ghost it is together with the Holy Ghost so it's not a mental exercise it's a paradox it's something unbelievable if you want to pull that first quote up in a paradox something unbelievable but it's true it will be Supernatural not just natural when he comes it'll be Supernatural I believe that the same God that fell on the day of Pentecost upon his church as a pillar of fire and divided himself with clothing tongues among his people is here tonight it's the same God he was then he is today with the same Holy Ghost I know it's a paradox it cannot be explained emotions screaming crying and so forth cannot be explained but it's a paradox how God does it amen oh I shouldn't have done that all right hold on oh boy oh did I ever get lost you bring me back that first claw quote I I'm I'm still in Petersburg Michigan I do know that I so go to the next one see if it finishes after it's the Unseen God now I want you to notice it's the Unseen God dwelling in the human heart making himself visible now that's the perfect balance when you say Holy Ghost and Fire because the Holy Ghost you don't see it's the Unseen God putting himself in human beings you don't see that part but the fire you see it's the God doing a human making himself visible by vindicating his word that he is the same yesterday today and forever God wants to show by these people getting the Holy Ghost you don't have to put nothing on you don't have to work it up you don't have to shout because somebody else is shouting I don't like all that pressure I don't like working up emotion I don't like any of it you never have to do that when God's dealing with somebody preach the word can you say Amen but you see it always go with God showing himself the same yesterday today and forever this isn't a powerless religion and what God does in you is not a mental exercise but it's to show Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever that the works that I do shall shall you do also the young mother the older woman in the body of Christ some of the criticism sometimes to this is the woman are the women are under bondage and we believe that the women should keep silence in the churches that's to handle the word of God but we don't want them keeping silence how you can how can you keep a woman silent who's got the Holy Ghost we want them teaching the young people the the young girls we want them worshiping God I get texts from sisters encouraging me and giving me a scripture I'm not offended by at all because she's a member of the body of Jesus Christ she's not a lower species can you say amen and whatever influence in this message that tries to make them some lower species she's coars together with you brother as a as a vessel she's the weaker vessel but you together with here your coair together honor her that way God can use a woman to speak something can you say Amen Jesus Christ the same yesterday so it's something happen that's why we go back to birth is a mess birth is a mess all the sisters raise your hand birth is a mess it's not just this blue or pink hospital room and there's no blood and there's no suffering and there's only one sister that I know of that every time she would tell this and she's gone on with the Lord now she was in my church one 35 years ago and dear sister Phyllis sisters hated it when she described her two children she had because she's oh well well I didn't have hardly any pain the whole pregnancies and when I had the child it was just like a little tickle and the sisters would hate when she tells them how did you get by with a tickle but that's the only one I've heard and it's still when they come out it's a mess blood water life comes in the child most time they scream out there's noise can you say amen and we have a religion of many years that tries to bring birth to Shake in the preacher's hand or I go to Paula fontaine's church so I'm okay or I'm in the message am I okay a birth real birth when God's dealing with you it's a mess and you don't care what people think about you you're going to come to that altar you're going to give your life to God you may cry you may weep you may shout I don't know what you'll do you may not do anything but just God's changing your life and and the makeup can run down and get all over your face woo and there're snot flying everywhere sometimes and you got to get the kleenexes and you got to get it because why if the natural birth is a mess spiritual birth is a mess you're going to know something is happening to you don't ever make it some intellectual exercise don't ever make it something that I believe brother Brandon was a prophet and I'm good you're not good until you receive the Holy Ghost and when you do I'm not encouraging you to try to work up an emotion I'm just saying you'll know when something's changing you you know what something maybe not at that moment but you see your life has been changed there's something further than being baptized I'll tell you as a pastor there's a further experience than just being baptized and some people receive the Holy Ghost while they're being baptized I don't know I can't tell you when you receive it but you receive a change in your life that you say Amen to the word of God you're following the word and your desires on a soul level has been changed I used to desire to go to that and go to this place and go to this watch these movies and guess what something has got a hold of me and the greatest thing I desire is to be in his word not for worldly movies not for the sin of the world not for the flesh not for what the world produces something's changed in me that's right birth is a mess you know something is happening Holy Ghost is unseen you can't see it but you can see fire you can see what a fire is doing there's an unseen part of the Holy Ghost but there's a visible don't judge your evidence by the visible no amens to that time to take a drink there's a visible and there's the invisible don't judge that you got it in the evidence by the visible but the visible if Fire's there something's going to be visible don't judge your evidence by the visible don't ever think it won't be showing up though like Mary she didn't feel the conception but later she knew God had done something God was growing in her life so I just want to let you all know if you ask for the Holy Ghost the fire goes with it if you're going to ask for it don't be these specifics and say the fire goes with the Holy Ghost I might be too embarrassing no no no no no when it's getting a hold of you you'll take the Holy Ghost with the fire with it however it would make you act whatever it would make you do you'll leave family and friends Jesus said except you're ready to leave father and mother and he said hate father and mother it's not hate in the sense of a hate like we think but you have to be willing to leave family father and mother cuz family sometimes will lead you away from God when this experience happens it's not about the family being an idol anymore or them choosing for you it's you and God choosing for what the will of God is for your life is that okay with everybody if you want the fire with it if you don't want the fire with it you don't want it bad enough any Christian here that has his Spirit knows knows the fire goes with it can I ask for a show of hands that the fire came into your life any Christian who has the Holy Ghost knows that the fire goes with it it's going to burn the desire for sin out it's going to put you on fire for him boldness is going to come you're not afraid anymore to pray you're not afraid anymore to confess the word of God for this hour the disciples were afraid until they went to the upper room they were hiding they even denied Jesus they went away Jesus was left alone his own disciples that night all betrayed him but when they received the Holy Ghost they didn't forsake Christ they got the boldness to Proclaim Christ can you say am man when you get power in your life and that's what he said after you receive the Holy Ghost you shall be Witnesses power when you receive this the power of the Holy Ghost you'll be Witnesses unto me you're not afraid to be a witness it's not some shallow temporary emotion one thing one night and the feeling goes away that's not what this is this is the Holy Ghost and Fire but ye shall receive power after he comes upon you to be Witnesses unto me in Jerusalem in Judea in lamberville in in Seline in can you say Amen in Petersburg in Toledo of all places Toledo to be a witness in Toledo of the message of the hour listen he's made you Witnesses and that's what the Holy Ghost gives you power to do it's not for signs and wonders he'll have that but it's a power to be a witness it's a power to be [Music] bold it's a power to not be afraid anymore right to talk about your God say I've got this thing I'm not ashamed of it something's taken over my life it's like fire Jeremiah said it's like fire shut up in my bones everybody okay preaching my heart I laid it all on the table to you this morning you don't think the devil fights me to hold back and saying these things he fights me tooth and nail but I'm gonna I'm GNA laying it on the laying it out before you tonight Lin it all and then tomorrow the family and I I always quote John Mir who was a great conservationist if we didn't have John Mir we wouldn't have a lot of our national parks including the Smoky Mountains he has a lot of good quotes I was reading some of them this morning but the my greatest quote that I use John Mir and this describes where I'm headed tomorrow the mountains are calling and I must go so I didn't just quote brother bradam this morning it's all out there I'm actually quoting John me fire what does this fire do one writer said the fire will refine you the fire will purify you the Holy Ghost Fire has a capacity to remove the draws in your life the iniquity the sins can you say amen he will keep your heart holy and clean and well keep you focused on God the fire also can destroy the destructive part of the fire of the Holy Ghost is it in you is what makes it impossible for demonic activities to operate in the life of the carrier of the Holy Ghost the fire is what makes it possible that demonic activities can't rule in your mind and can't rule in your heart depression shouldn't be able to rule when you're asking for the fire to keep it away no demon can withstand you when you remain intoxicated with this kind of fire no family curse no family curse can stand against you when you're operating in this dangerous frequency of his fire there isn't any family hereditary thing cancer or whatever Pride there isn't anything that can bypass the fire burning it outall glory be to God it's the fire that does that work don't ever let the devil tell you this is a this is something in breaded me I'll never get rid of it don't ever settle for that this fire can burn it all out [Music] the fire will Quicken you the fire of the Holy Ghost operates like electricity when it touches you it quickens you from within if you have been if you have touched a live wire before which how many how many's touched a live wire before if you've touched a live wire you will understand better I have done it several times on a fence or whatever it is and now you understand what the electric wire can do now now I understand what what the electricity can do you stand there and you you you stand there and some you touch a liar you will understand better the fire is the solution to spiritual dullness it'll wake you up it'll Quicken you you get spiritually dull the fire will wake you up the fire will make people look did you ever notice anywhere fire is burning the crowds gather it commands attention public attention this affirms the quote of John Wesley when he said set yourself on fire and people will gather to watch you burn where you at gobby I've been touched by a fire so let the world come and watch me burn shout it on the rooftops shout it to everyone has heard you going to sing it with me Ellie no all right still trying to get her to sing with Papa the lasting fire turns you into a fire it come on let's do [Applause] it emus is great enough you coming up or not you going to sing it all right go for it shouting from no no no I've been touched by a fire I've been touched by a fire so let the world come and watch me burn shout it from the rooftop shout it till everyone has [Applause] heard coming good job thanks m yes pretty brave boy there Grandpa and Grandma you better get that in check cuz he might interrupt me at the wrong time someday but I'm preaching fire anything fire touches it turns the other thing into fire is that right when fire touches wood it becomes the wood becomes fire when the fire of the Holy Ghost touches you it turns you to fire if I had one of those little uh things to start a fire what are those little torches lighter if I had one this morning it's just this little thing but do you realize do you realize that little thing that little fire you realize how how what it can consume if I were to get one of these with piece of paper paper going and within hours this whole building would be consumed by that little fire I might have a little fire god but it when it spreads out other places it can do a lot of thingsall see there's a good side to a fire too especially it's God's holy fire praise the Lord I I was out here in some of the land that I own by the old church I'm trying to sell it and uh I had to burn a bunch of brush and everything I didn't know I'd never done this before so I put the brush here it's the middle of summer everything's dry got that fire going and all of a sudden I realized it caught the side of the dry grass and it was moving slowly moving to both neighbors homes such a dummy I do things like this because you know I lived a very shelter life I don't know how to do properties Henry's Henry's done most of my work on my properties I can barely change a door knob I don't know about life I've been very sheltered and I stood there way too long until the neighbor say you better do something about that cuz it's not going to stop and it's headed to both neighbors homes so then I get in gear and get their hose over and get Buckets and did everything and thankfully stopped it but it wasn't stopping and so that's when you realize in the Holy fires of God I don't want it to stop in my life Josh brother Ken I don't want it to stop I'll take the Holy Ghost which is the evidence of saying Amen to the word of God but I'll take the fire with it am I'll take the fire with it because it's done only good to me can you say Amen now it's real easy to preach the fire as an outward thing of shouting and dancing and I believe that's part of it but the fire is going to go deeper it's going to consume whatever is in you that's not of him when it comes it don't stop burning after your desire for The World Is Gone most of you with the Holy Ghost my desire for the world is gone he burned it out but it don't stop burning things out of your life one when God comes he starts burning out the anger the bitterness the resentment towards others can you say Amen the resentment towards preachers the resentment towards people and congregations the the jealousy he burn he wants to burn that out of your life it's killing you the pride that you're better than others can't even connect with the body of Christ because you you think you're better the holy fires of God if you allow him will burn that out of you you're better than others you don't need others the gossip the no repentance everything that's not of God in our lives let the fire burn your kids can I have five more minutes your kids don't see the Unseen holy ghost in your life but your kids will see the fire kids I've got the Holy Ghost they gave it to me 20 years ago I've got the Holy Ghost you can say all those words but but the evidence of how you live every day and what the fire is doing in your life is the greatest evidence to your kids that he's a changed man amen they won't see the Holy Ghost they'll see what the fire of the Holy Ghost is doing in you because you're on fire for God or is this just an argument of spirit and a battle of quotes let me say something on my heart to all of us preachers let's let me preach on the preachers if we make this message a battle of quotes then we are lowering oursel with a lack of character we are never to go to battle with quotes with one another the Sheep see that and they're disappointed keep it holy keep it precious and let God interpret the quotes by bringing I read quotes all the time I read the Bible all the time but when we have an argument of spirit behind the quote we've left the character of the word I need to get greater amens than that that's for us that's for for for everyone else preachers and all to hear we have to die to our pride we have to die to things in our lives we have to die to become a fighter I don't want to be a fighter of the word I want to be a liver of the word help me Lord help me Lord not to become a fighter your kids don't see the Unseen Spirit but they see the fire do they see this message do your kids see this message as a law or a drudgery to you every day when they conclude it's just a it's a law it's a drudgery it's every day and they only see you shouting in church on yeah this is typical the which direction I go right where the rubber meets the road the fire is not just wanting to come and make you shout and dance but it's to bring character in our lives and to burn that which is not of God do they your kids see do my kids see the message is a law or drudgery or do they see it as a fire burning in you that's a love for God you're dying to your selfishness every day maybe that's why your kids don't respond what did they see in you and hear out of your mouth Through The Years blaming this one and blam bling this preacher and shame on us shame on me if this is what our kids see shame on us maybe they just seen this as just some membership in your life instead of a fire talking about the excitement of the word talk to other people all the time in church you can see them in church but this isn't just in church the kids can see they can see your heart sometimes it maybe not in it but hopefully they see your heart my heart is in this thing it's not just a duty but it's a fire of God I'm on fire for him and when I lose my fires a little bit I'm going to jump in and get on fire again I don't want to be lukewarm can you say Amen so now I'm bringing this down now to these quotes what I'm I'm directing in future home and is why I read in second Peter because do you do know that the same way God redeems this Earth which is a spoken word of God he will redeem it back to a millennium in Eden again the same way he works on the Earth is the same way he works on you right water blood and fire to bring you into a millennium dwelling place for God to dwell in so now the world to be redeemed for his redeemed person he uses the same method he baptizes in water after the ant antel livian destruction shed his blood upon it to sanctify that was through Christ and claim it see when Christ died at the cross it wasn't just to save you it was to save this Earth his blood Dro dripped out upon this Earth Satan tried to say I'll give it to you he said no sir I'll buy it remember Satan tempting Jesus I'll give you all the kingdoms of the earth he didn't need to Jesus didn't that I'm not going to take it from you I'm going to buy it with blood I'm buying it back amen he said no sir I'll buy it let me be Let It Be A Witness he was lifted up for an insign that he brought it he purchased this Earth next one but now it has to go through a baptism of fire Holy Fire from God which cleanses the earth and the heavens around it see the heart the heart has to be cleansed like that before God can come down in the person of the Holy Ghost which is Christ coming down and dwell in the human heart it first must be repented it must be baptized in his name to show who it belongs to then it must be cleansed by the blood of Jesus and then the Holy Fire and holy ghost from God comes down and burns out all the desire of sin all the nature of the world the same way he burns It Off the Earth and the atmospheres and the demon power do you realize when we're in the Millennium when the Holy Fire comes someday and burns this it's not just burning this Earth but it's burning the atmospheres of demonic Realms that's how the fire of God goes prise the Lord when we walk back on this Earth because he's not going to annihilate the earth when Peter says Annihilation it's annihilating the sin and the atmospheres of sin it's the same Earth but when he burns it with his holy fire we step back on this same Earth again that's right it'll be cleansed you'll never hear The Whisper Of The Devil in your ear anymore accusing you anymore you'll never feel a lustful Spirit come to you to try to tempt you to lust those atmospheres have been burned out you'll never have the temptation to sin anymore it's all gone you'll never have a spirit of depression come around
