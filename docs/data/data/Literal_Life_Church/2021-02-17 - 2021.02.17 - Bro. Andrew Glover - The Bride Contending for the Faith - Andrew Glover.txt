========================================

the book of genesis the third chapter and uh while you're turning there we want to uh so we appreciate brother paul and sister rebecca and the family god bless you all and appreciate brother seth for coming up with us this evening and gonna head back to uh towards lima after service and drop him off and pick my wife back up and we're headed headed south so if anybody wants to go you're more than welcome hey man uh tell you i've seen snow but not like this amen so we're headed a few weeks ago he was out in arizona and brother kenny was out in tucson there and went up to flagstaff and it was kind of like this and then we went back to tucson and it was 75 degrees and sunny and we flew home and got there and it was like 30 degrees and snow on the ground and i said i have got to be the craziest person in the world to leave 75 degrees and come to this hey man so but the lord has all different kinds of seasons and i believe you all are just blessed with it up here and so you can keep it and we'll keep the south amen and god bless you this evening genesis the third chapter i want to look in the first verse here a very familiar scripture to everyone here i know the bible says now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the lord god hath made and he said unto the woman yea hath god said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden god has said you shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest you die and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die for god doth know that in the day you eat thereof your eyes shall be opened and ye shall be as gods knowing good and evil and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and it was pleasant to be to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave ulcer unto her husband with her and he didn't eat and the eyes of them were both opened and they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons now if we could look in the book of second corinthians 11 chapter from the old testament there over here to the new testament in second corinthians 11 and verse number one i know very familiar scripture to you here as well just want to share a few things the lord has put on our heart out of this chapter 2 corinthians 11 verse 1 now paul here writing says what to god you could bear with me a little in my folly and indeed bear with me for i am jealous over you with godly jealousy for i have espoused you to one husband that i may present you as a chaste virgin to christ but i fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled eve through his septility so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in christ for if he that cometh preacheth another jesus whom we have not preached or if you receive another spirit which you have not received or another gospel which you have not accepted he might well bear with him for i suppose i was not wit behind the very chiefest apostles but though i be rude in speech yet not in knowledge but we have been made thoroughly manifest among you in all things have i committed an offense and abasing myself that you might be exalted because i've preached you the gospel of god freely he says i robbed other churches taking wages of them to do you a service and when i was present with you and wanted i was chargeable to no man for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from macedonia and in the thing and supplied and in all things i have kept myself from being burdened unto you so will i keep myself we ask the lord this evening to add the blessing to the reading of his word as we just bow our hearts together for a word of prayer here this evening how many just say lord speak to me tonight from your word god bless you heavenly father lord as your believers have gathered here this evening lord on this cold and snowy night on the outside but lord we are not here tonight just to be here we're not here for form or fashion the lord we're here to hear from your word lord we're here to feed upon you lord we know that your prophet has told us that we're the carcasses there the eagles will be gathered together and lordy has showed us how important it is that the eagles must gather around that word and feed up on that word and father i pray tonight lord for these eagles that stand before me tonight god lord i have nothing to offer them lord there's nothing i can say or do that will strengthen them but lord your word is your present and your word is still a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart father i'm asking you tonight just to send a blessing in this building may you anoint us afresh tonight god may you anoint your children lord those who would be at home watching by the way of internet lord i pray you would just visit the homes their fathers speak to the families oh god and lord whatever the conditions or circumstances would be may you move upon each and everyone's behalf lord we're hungry to hear from you tonight god and whatever is accomplished here we'll be sure to stand back and give you all the praise and all the honor and all the glory for to the wonderful name of our lord and savior jesus christ we pray and all the believers said amen and amen as you be seated this evening we say god bless you from those scriptures tonight for just a few moments if the lord would help me i'd like to speak to you on a thought here and if i would title it tonight i want to speak to you on the bride contending for thee faith the bride contending for the faith and i truly believe tonight with all of my heart that we are living in a perplexed time i believe we're living in a very confusing time i believe it's a time where the prophet of god said two hundred thousand thousand devils have been loosed out of the river of euphrates against the bride amen so we're living tonight in a perplexed time paul would say it like this in second corinthians 4 and verse 8 he says we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but we are not in despair i love paul's comparison there when he says we are perplexed but we are not in despair the word perplexed there means to be in doubt or to stand in doubt to be without resources to be in strength uh to be embarrassed not to know which way to turn so paul is saying amen we we are not here not knowing which way to turn he says but we are not in despair he's saying here we're not going to renounce all hope the word despair actually means to come under so much pressure that you actually denounce all hope and i think at night it's something how that many people get in trials and they get in situations and they get under pressures amen and they don't know where to turn kind of like the day we're living in today and they just kind of stand there and it's at those moments and those times that satan does everything possible amen to get them to turn from what they should be turning to but i think tonight they meant in these perplexed times that we are faced these situations amen we we may not know sometimes we're to turn at times we may not know where to go but there is one thing amen there is a bride upon the earth tonight who is not renouncing amen our hope and our hope is not politics our hope is not the government amen but our hope tonight is the lord jesus christ now amen you know as well as i know the word of god testifies that in the hour that we're living in there will be a falling away paul says we beseech you brethren by the coming of our lord jesus christ and by our gathering together unto him that you be not soon shaken in mind notice where paul says this that you be not soon shaken in mind or troubled neither by spirit nor by word nor by letter asked from us as that the day of christ is at hand let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first and the man of sin be revealed the son of perdition now think of this amen the falling away is not coming the falling away is here we're not looking for the falling away the falling away is here among us it's in the land and the prophet takes time here and i'd like to just read this to you he said brothers the time has come we're in the last day we're in the atomic age the time has come that they got a weapon that can shake this world from its orbit in five minutes time into the sun and cause a total annihilation they couldn't have done that before but the time has come he said the time has come where there's a falling away the bible said except there cometh falling away the man of sin won't reveal himself and he says the pentecostal church is living in the final of all times the time has come he said but the time has come for the signs to follow the believers we're at the end time we're in the latter reign we're at the time when men will be heady high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god amen truth breakers false accusers incontinent despisers of those that are good he said heady and high-minded the time has come when they're teaching doctrines of devils perverting the bible's teaching into theories and theologies to draw groups of people away after them he said the time has come that god will gather his church together amen under one great big banner of the lord jesus christ and pour out his powers among them and great signs and wonders will take place the time has come the time has come for the pentecostal church to make a stand he said the time has come to circumcise the church and cull out all this foolishness the time has come to go back to the old landmark the time has come for the outpouring the time has come for the gathering of the people and i love how he caps this all he said the time has come for jesus to come amen the time has come for signs and wonders to follow the believers the sign of the time has come amen for the great falling away the time has come for everything amen but listen tonight church the time has come for jesus to come we're we're not living in another age looking for the coming of the lord to come three ages out amen but right here tonight the time has come amen and if we're ever going to do anything brethren he said it's time to do it now the time is at hand and i think tonight as paul said there cannot be an end time amen there cannot be a falling away amen there cannot be an end time until there comes a falling away he says from the pentecostal faith and the pentecostal faith will be done away with he said and the dignitaries will set in and we're here right now and see that falling away see the church getting further and further away he said going right back again we're at the end time how many will agree that we're at the end time we're not looking for the end time amen but we're in the end time he said see paul goes on to say to timothy there would come amongst the church a falling away but notice what they're falling away from they are falling away from the bible faith see is that right he said is that a promise look at them today what are they doing organizing themselves pulling away don't believe in the bible don't believe in the real true word what is it it's maturing it's the end time signed seed he said when you see these things happening lift up your head say amen when you see them falling away when you see the churches getting cold when you see amen then replacing the bible faith with dignitaries and philosophies when you see that amen that's not the time to bear your head amen but that's the time to lift up your head amen we see the falling away here amen but there is a bride on the earth tonight that is ordained and is predestinated and is chosen from before the foundation of the world have been to stand in the hour of the fallen away amen i think it's amazing how that god amen deals in the prophetic do you believe that tonight amen god has a prophetic tithe now i think it's amazing here that if you study bible prophecies you'll actually see that there are two bible prophecies in the end time that's being fulfilled at the same time amen amen two bible prophecies in the end time being fulfilled at the same time the first one here is in first timothy four verse one now the spirit speaketh expressly that in the latter times which are these times that some shall depart from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils amen speaking lies in hypocrisy and having their conscience seared with a hot iron now look at what this word depart means the word depart actually means to draw away or to refrain or to withdraw oneself from it means to excite to revolt it means to desert what one used to embrace now think of that amen there's a time coming that god prophesied through paul amen to timothy and said the time's coming where some are going to withdraw themselves from the faith amen son is going to pull away from the faith psalm amen is going to have such a spirit upon them that they're going to produce a revolt and they're going to become excited by that revolt to cause others to leave the faith amen now that's one prophecy but here's another one in jude 1 3 amen beloved when i gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that she should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints so here even 33 years after pentecost jude is moved by the spirit think of this amen the sigh i feel like preaching amen the same spirit that fell upon paul he meant to ride into timothy and tell him he meant in the latter times some are going to depart from the faith is the same spirit of god amen that moved upon jew to ride and say there's some going to depart from the faith but there's some going to contend for the faith think of that tonight amen now contend does not mean to argue but otherwise it means to hold fast amen or to uphold or to stay put with as we call the street expression he says i want you to earnestly amen not just half-heartedly amen but with all your soul and might amen contend for the faith and i'll say tonight i don't believe that god has given you this bill and i don't believe that god amen has put a holy ghost-filled man behind this pulpit he meant to preach to a bunch of departers amen but i believe i'm looking at some tonight that ordained amen from the genes of almighty god amen not to depart from the faith amen but to contend for the faith think about that some are departing amen but some are contending some amen are withdrawing themselves but some amen has given everything that god and i say tonight let it be said of this church have been that every ounce of strength it is in our body every bit of breath it is in our lungs let it be given amen not as a departer amendment is somebody that says you can shoot me but i'll stand for this faith you can throw everything you've got at me devil but i'll stand for this faith i was not ordained amen to fall under prophecy amen ever fallen away but i was ordained amen to be a part of the gathering together unto christ to think tonight amen some are departing amen but some are contending amen now you say brother andrew what is the faith let me say it like this there are no two faiths there is only one faith paul will say there is one lord there is one faith and there is one baptism one lord one faith one baptism he said now to contend for the faith it's not a faith there is really only one faith now many people says well that's against my faith he said there's many faiths but there's only one the faith see amen there's a baptist faith there's a pentecostal faith there's a methodist faith but there's really only one faith and that is the faith now the prophet says if the scripture said he exhorted to earnestly contend for the faith not a faith the faith that was once delivered to the saints each one of us wants to say that our churches does that and he says the only way to be positive sure of this not church is to go back and see what kind of a faith they had to contend for he said watch now there's only one thing about it you can go and refer to your reasons and you can confine yourself to reason but god doesn't come by reason he said you know god by simple amen child like faith to accept his word you say it's the truth and believe it that's how you know god is by faith not by reason your reason power within yourself but faith comes from god amen can we say that together faith comes from god he meant now if we're going to find out what kind of faith we're contending for then we've got to go back to the source of that faith and a prophet here is identifying the faith that we are contending for is the faith which did not come from a man it did not come from a prophet it did not come from a school amen but the faith came from the god hey man to think tonight he said oh and it's the substance of things hoped for it's the evidence of things not reason he said there's where it comes from through here amen through the unadulterated power of the lord jesus christ that makes a creature a new person and baptizes him anew in the holy spirit and washes him and hangs him up and seals him in the kingdom of god then he stands knowing where he's at i love this and all the devils in hell amen couldn't shake him away from it amen see tonight the faith that is in your hearts is not a baptist faith it is not a methodist faith it is not a pentecostal faith amen there are people that's god about this faith and they went through the same things you've gone through and they're not standing tonight amen they've got a methodist faith been through the same things that some of you have been through and they're not standing tonight why because it's not a faith amen that can weather the storms but i'm talking about some recipients tonight amen that's got the same faith that moses had got the same faith that david had got the same faith that three hebrew boys had and that faith has not come from a man has not come from a church but that faith has come from almighty god and there ain't enough devils in hell there ain't enough devil's past there was present or enough devils in the future he meant to shake us away from that faith it's not a man's faith it's christ's faith now do you realize christ's faith is not earned amen christ's faith is given paul says it like this for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god not of works us any man should boast galatians 2 16 knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but by the faith of jesus christ even we have believed in jesus christ that we might be justified by the faith of christ and not by the works of the law but by the works of law shall no flesh be justified now watch this in philippians 3 9 and be found in him not having my own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the faith of christ he said the righteousness which is of god by faith amen now that's just a few of multiple scriptures that we can identify where this faith has come from and how we got it amen it came from god and we received it by god now in the message the door to the heart amen i'm trying to lay a foundation but y'all's pulling so we'll just preach okay amen oh there's just a lot of those doors he said let's find the door of faith here on the side he said now i have faith but don't you go to fooling with my faith he said there's only one faith and that's the faith of god he said that's right the door is all closed up he said because you don't want to fool around that door or let jesus around there because as soon as he stands in that door he will scream out i am the same yesterday today and forever and your creeds will bar that he said but he is the same no doubt now watch you'll come to church and watch signs and wonders if god be performed and you won't pay attention that because the creed has locked the door of faith in you and made you think that that is a faith notice this amen the creed has locked the door and made you think that that is a faith he said and there's only one faith that's the faith of god and the only one can bring the faith of god is jesus christ his son that comes into your heart he's knocked at your door through signs and wonders and miracles but you keep that all pinned up i don't want nothing to do with that oh if he could only stand and you would open that door it wouldn't be two minutes he meant to you'd believe every word the bible wrote think about that and say amen to every bit of it if you would just open the door and let jesus come in and give you the faith that he has to give you you've took the faith some creeds give you and you've locked the door on christ's faith but when you take christ's faith and then then you can recognize him think about that if you take him in the sap out of the peach tree and transfuse it into an apple tree amen then the apple tree will bear fruits and if you take a man's faith and put it into somebody the man will produce man's faith but if you take jesus christ the son of god and place him in the heart of a believer by a new birth experience amendment the same god amen that spoke out of jesus the word made flesh and cursed the fig tree and the next day it tried to that same faith will come inside the church in these last days and there'll be some messiahs amen amen i'm not talking about church members i'm not talking about theologians i'm talking about holy ghost-filled messiahs amen with a backbone to stand and say satan take your hands off my family take your hands off my church i'm talking about somebody that has got the same faith that was in abraham and moses and jesus has returned in this day oh i got to be hate myself here i'm not talking about a faith i'm talking about the faith i'm talking about a faith that makes devils fear you i'm talking about a faith amen that the devil can throw everything he's got at you and you'll still stand up and say but it wasn't enough amen i'm talking about a faith that you can receive the worst report possible and you'll walk out there and say thank you for your services doctor amen but i'm going to go see the great physician because he said by my stripes amen you are healed are you hearing me amen a man's faith won't do that amen by the faith of the son of god amen will call things that are not amen as though they are the faith of the son of god amen will stand and say greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world the faith of the son of god will say if god be for this church then who can be against it i'm talking about somebody tonight that's received amen the same thing they got in the upper room oh are you hearing me the same faith that was in the upper room is in literal life church tonight it meant the same anointing amen that filled abraham to stand there and say i know sarah's milk veins are dried up and there's no life in that womb and there's no life in this body but there is a god who can bring a son out of resurrection it's the same god tonight that is here performing in the power of his resurrection he said when we get so transfused by his power that we die to our own thinking and our faith becomes a genuine faith he said then the life of christ is transfused into us when our thinking is gone brother when our thoughts are gone then the thoughts and the life of jesus christ is transfused into us now we know tonight that we are living creatures of god the prophet said a dwelling place where the holy spirit can send his radiant blessings down to there and we're in the stature of christ amen now you may not see this tonight but let me preach to you from my heart amen he's not looking at you based upon what you were he's not looking at you ain't been based upon what you have been he's looking at you tonight amen based upon the blood and he sees you amen as a tube as a channel amen that he can manifest the radiance of his blessings through now we know tonight that there was a first adam and there was a first eve we learned that in sunday school didn't we amen there's a first adam there's a first eve amen but through a prophet's teaching we now understand that there is a second adam and there is a second eve the prophet of god said seek the first adam and the first e fail he said but the second adam and eve will not and cannot fall i love that amen the first they fail but the second adam and eve will not somebody shout will not and cannot will not and cannot fall now when you hear that you think well if there was a first adam and eve then the first was in a garden if there's a second adam and eve then there's got to be a garden and the prophet god said see if you get the tape satan's eaten he said many of you's got it he has made another garden of eden and 6 000 years it's taken him to make it just like god did at the beginning god made his eden and satan corrupted it now watch we've got another garden of eden right here by prophet and then we hear this who is the second adam in the book of first corinthians 15 45 and so it is written the first man adam was made a living soul but the last adam was made a quickening spirit first adam a living soul last adam which is the second adam was made a quickening spirit and the prophet said he would speak in the first adam was the one who had jurisdiction over everything in the earth over all the animals and he lost his power think of that and where he taught in the bible that what the first adam lost amen the second adam christ restored again to the human race what the first adam lost amen the second adam which is christ restored to the human race so therefore who is amend the second eve and ephesians or colossians 1 verse 18 and he is the head of the body the church skip down to verse 22 in the body of his flesh to death amen to present you amen holy and unblameable and unreprovable in his sight amen so the first adam and the first they fail but the second adam is christ and the second eve is the church it's the it's the bride of jesus christ then through the life of his son his cross the blood it says here of his cross that he might reconcile himself a body of bride which is eve second eve he said the same thing he did in adam and eve giving a type that they were christ in the bride he is the second adam and the church is the second eve think of that there's no question you are the second eve it's settled tonight a prophetess spoke you are the second eve he said as long as the second eve compromises then she's doing the same thing the first step done he said but god purposed and hid it from the eyes of the prudent and wise and revealed it to the predestinated babes who were predestinated to receive it now think of this the second he he is not coming by marriage she's not coming by what she's done amen but she's coming by predestination and she's not coming to receive something amen but she was predestinated before the foundation of the world amen to receive it listen church you didn't receive your identification at an altar you didn't receive your identification in a church if you are the second eve amen you was identified from before the foundation of the world he said now somebody shout now i love this now you can see now the end time message why it's rejected can't you amen see no denomination but the revelation of his mystery he said god is not known by denomination he is known by revelation then god in his body christ and christ in his body the bride he said god made manifest in christ and christ made manifest in the bride see and is bringing a pride out that won't fall by denomination amen and creed this second adam is bringing out a second eve that will not fall he said she is amen the second eve but she is not breaking and spoiling her skirts of purity and holiness to her husband she'll stay with the word regardless of what anybody else says you can't have all the ecumenical moves you want and all the affiliations in the masterpiece he said the second adam and the second eve now ready for the garden for the millennium amen in the masterpiece again the great masterpiece of the family he said now the masterpiece family has come again amen christ and his bride ready to come the second adam second eve ready now to return back to their home and the whole picture has been redemption from where it was he meant bringing it back see just exactly bringing it back again then do you realize what happened in the fall in the garden he meant the fall in the garden actually caused man amen to become unconscious amen he was made to be superior the prophet god said it this way he said god made man superior to everything on the earth but the power was operated by a law and that law was the law of faith think of that adam was superior to nature he was superior to the winds are you hearing me he was superior to everything adam was superior amen man from the beginning which is genesis was made to believe god by faith he said but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him there's no way for anybody to ever have anything from god except my faith and god has made that his way that was from the beginning for people to believe god by faith so we go all the way back to genesis where the first adam failed and we're the first he fell now can i can i dramatize something for you for a second can you imagine the prophet of god and then going back there and seeing adam amen walking through the garden of eden and he would see this big old this big old gray looking something and he would say i think i'll call that elephant and papa would say that's exactly what i was thinking then he would see a lion and he would say i think i'll call that a lion and papa would say that's exactly what i was thinking now think about this adam was there amen with jurisdiction over everything he could speak to the wind and the wind would come down he could speak to the stun and the sun would move over he could speak to a tree brother gideon and a tree would uproot and he would say get up from where you're at and go somewhere else amen and that tree would move amen and adam had jurisdiction but when the fall in the garden taken place the prophet said man went from being conscious of that authority to be an unconscious now can you imagine amen i'm not going to dramatize the whole thing amen but on that day that adam and eve was walking out of the garden amen and here they go everybody said i can hear those bloody those bloody lambskins as they're hitting the back of their legs and he says i can see papa stand up and scream but wait a minute and he said there adam and eve would stop and turn and he would say i will make a way back amen i will make our way back now you have to forgive me sometimes brother paul i get to thinking about things and i get a little dangerous okay but i just begin to think can you imagine as adam and eve walked out of that garden in that defeated condition i can only imagine what the trees were thinking cannot you say with andrew trees thinking well i just think they got a mind is that i can imagine the trees thinking is that the man that spoke to me and told me to move i can imagine the wind would see adam and eve walking out and say is that the man that spoke to me and told me to come down i can see the elephant look and say is that the man that named me is that the man is that the man the lion could say is that the man that told me to quiet down amen but i can also say this all of nature all of animal life heard father say i will make a way back and when man fell he lost the ability to speak amen and nature obey he lost the ability to speak he meant and trees move amen but i'll tell you this for thousands of years in the back part of creation's mind they remembered father's words i will make a way back in about 1960s in colorado he met a storm come up and a prophet stood there and said son come out amen and storm go back where you came from and something in me says i can't help but believe when the trees and the nature begin to hear that they said been a long time since we heard that voice amen but remember papa said he would restore it oh come on church don't you see tonight amen i'm trying not to put another door in this church right now amen but don't you see amen what adam lost amen what eve lost just back in the church tonight amen the authority and the jurisdiction of creation power is not just in wood it's not just in a pulpit it's back in the second eve tonight what was satan's attack in genesis it was on the faith of god how by presenting wisdom in genesis god told adam and eve what would happen when they disbelieved the word i want you to watch this the prophet said satan led her to disbelieve it think about that satan led her to disbelieve it for satan himself never believed in it think about that amen what satan was able to persuade eve to believe he himself doesn't believe now i got to be careful because i get carried away here amen the devil has led people a bit not to believe this message when he himself believes it amen the devil's led people to believe that william branham was not a prophet when the devil if you go to hell tonight and ask every devil down there you say devil do you believe william branham was a prophet amen from lucifer amen down to the footmen amen they'll all say william branham was a pro are you hear me what the devil needed was somebody to work through again and the prophet said reasoning come and took the place of faith so the fall in the garden was the beginning if i could say of the contest between wisdom and faith now what is a contest a contest is a test of strength remember the problem god said that the indians would build a fire and he said one group would get on this side and another group would get on that side and he said whoever could drag him in the fire one he said it was like a tug of war he said now watch satan study that out so perfectly so when he come to eve he had the best strategy he could use upon her and that was reason with the word he said and that's our strength is just accept the word eve began to stop and reason and when she quoted the word to him god said you should not eat thereof the day you eat that day we die and satan never disagreed with her he never disagreed with her now watch this he said certainly that's right he said oh surely see there you come surely you won't die but god said you would and that settles it and that broke the great tug of war then and pulled the whole human race into death because eve listened to reasoning against god's word he said god gave us our best defense just simply trust his word i want to say this god himself established the authority of simplicity of faith in the garden of eden just simply trust his word i know this is simple but i pray it help him just simply trust his word but the serpent come in and attack the simplicity of faith by offering wisdom and the prophet said what is satan's weapon against you is try to get you to disbelieve your weapon see and when you do that he disarms you amen hold that weapon don't you lay it down see amen you hold that weapon don't you lay it down the spirit of god actually comes into you a meant to agree with your weapon what is your weapon our weapon is the word right so the spirit of god he said god is known by simple faith and the very same thing god the creator who made all things and spoke the world into existence by his word that same spirit in you believes everything god says and there's nothing impossible if you believe it now you say brother andrew it can't work for me yes it can because god does not look at human prestige amen god does not look at who you are and where you come from and how much money is in your bank account and what kind of house you live in he don't look at that the problem of god said right here tonight he said there could be the governor there could be the mayor there could be the president there could be the all the most important businessmen in the city in this meeting he said they could everyone be sick and he said god would go right past them and honor the faith of a street walker he would honor the faith of somebody that didn't have enough money amen to maybe even buy something after church amen you know why because faith is not based upon respect of persons amen faith is based upon grace watch this amen now the serpent was more subtle than any beast to the field look at what this word subtle means it means shrewd it means crafty it means sly sensible and prudent then you skip down to the sixth verse and when the woman saw the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to one's eyes and the tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also under her husband with her and he did eat now that word wise actually means to be prudent amen i'm going somewhere wisely understood to have insight or to have success now there's nobody in here tonight that if somebody come to you and say do you want to be successful you'd say no every because there was a it's in first 1965 he said there's a thirst in everybody's heart for success he said but satan gets a hold of that thirst and he perverts that thirst and he changes it amen to where you're thirsting for success but you're thirsting by a perverted thirst so that's what satan did he prefer perverted the thirst amen in humanity for success in other words you really want to be right with god take my advice and listen to me he said did you hear that that's the hiss of the serpent amen that's the hiss of the serpent satan presenting knowledge now in genesis 3 i'll say it like this was the beginning if we said of the contest between wisdom and faith now do you realize there's only two sources we can draw our life from amen one of them is faith and the other one is wisdom he said see if we think of what wisdom produces and then what faith produces but those two sources we're going back this morning to show you bringing them up out of the bible show what they are what they're going to do and what they have done by the help of the lord he said now faith and wisdom now to begin with we'll notice in genesis the first chapter we find that faith was introduced we have now found amen the beginning of where faith was introduced was in genesis the first chapter he said and wisdom was introduced and today them two sources is still introduced to the human race we find out that god was the author of faith to believe for the people to believe in the trust his word and satan is the author of wisdom trying to get people away to accept his wisdom now say this with me and pull them are you awake and pull them and pull them away from the faith that is in god's word now that is amen that's a it may not sound like one but it's a shouting point amen you have now found where a lot of your troubles are coming from amen the devil is trying to pull you away from the faith that is in god's word because he knows what happened when he did it to the first eve he knows when he finally convinced her amen to leave the word he was able to pull her and the whole human race under his jurisdiction and the devil is after every believer in this building tonight amen but i want to say this we are in amen the final round of the great contest between wisdom and faith can you say man amen it's a battle it's a struggle but we're in the final round amen i know coven stuff's going on you can't really shake hands and stuff but look at somebody next to you and say we're in the final round hey we're in the final round brother amen right here tonight amen don't bury your head amen don't throw up your hands and quit we're in the final round brother paul amen you've been fighting this battle a lot longer than i have amen but from a young soldier to an elder can i salute you and say we're in the final round amen tonight church we are in the final round what are you saying i'm saying don't withdraw your hope i'm saying don't leave i'm saying don't come to a junction and say i don't know where to turn and where to go i'm telling you the time has come i know lukewarmness is striking churches i know pulpits are getting weaker i know people's losing their desire i know there's atomic rumors in the air i know there's wars and rumors of wars i know that paul i cannot preach it i know that men's hearts amen are failing for fear i'm telling you the time has come for that amen but gideon the time has also come amen for jesus to come who is jesus christ he is the second adam and my bible says he shall appear amen the second time amen without sin unto salvation what are you saying i'm saying if you keep on running you're going to cross the finish line i'm saying if you keep on swinging the sword the devil's going to come down if you keep on marching jericho and then the walls are going to fall we are not here ain't meant to lay down and quit we are here to cross the finish line there is an anointing resting upon you by the power of prophecy some are departing some are turning away but there's some contending glory to god i feel like putting my shouting shoes on there's some departing and i can't help it but there's some contending you know what i'm going to do i'm not going to waste my time on the ones departing i'm not going to worry about what they're saying and what they're doing there's some contenders that need to hear the word there's some contenders that need to know that god is still god and his word is still his word the mighty shout we're here we've arrived you say what are you so happy about the time has come for jesus to come the time has come for the judge of this contest amen to descend from glory and my prophet said he'll not put foot upon land he said we'll meet him in the air oh help me jesus it's a wednesday night and i feel like shouting amen i find it amazing amen that right here in genesis 3 it i find the amazing parallel between genesis 3 and 2nd corinthians 11. you say what are you talking about after the fall in the garden you know as well as i know the woman receives her own identity after the fall she goes from being adam's wife a meant to be an eve am i holding too long she goes for me an adam's wife amen to be an eve now watch this if you got a thompson chain you know that you can run the chain on the name eve now watch amen in genesis 3 20 and adam called his wife's name eve because she was the mother of all living first time eve is mentioned is genesis 3 20 with a name with an identity of her own then you come to genesis 4 1 and adam knew eve his wife amen there's the second place and she conceived and bear cain and said i've gotten a man from the lord do you realize from genesis 4 1 you don't find the name eve mentioned again until ii corinthians 11 when the bible says that paul is moved amen to write a warning that what happened in the natural can happen in the spiritual what happened in the first garden of eden he's warning you can happen in the second amen but here's the thing about it amen there is a second eve whose mind has not been corrupted he meant her womb has not been corrupted what does the bible say but i fear lest by any means does the serpent be godly through his subtlety sow your minds are you i'm tying this together so your minds what did paul say that you be not soon shaken where in your mind amen see that your mind should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in christ look at this word corrupted it means to lead away a christian church from the state of knowledge and holiness in which it ought to abide and the prophet said now there is a womb with a physical and there is a womb of the spirit and the mind is the womb to the spirit how is adultery committed spiritually when knowing better by the word of god he says the intercourse of the mind taking the lie of the devil against the word of god and when the bride of jesus christ lets man-made creeds and dogmas take the place of the word of god she is committing adultery he said why she let it come into his mind he said notice here what he failed to do mary did she took the word amen eve took satan's lie and mary took sex took god's word so satan was able by wisdom and reasoning to begin and lead the human race amen from living by the faith he meant to living by knowledge and living by wisdom and reasoning in science amen and wisdom comes from the devil amen wisdom of the devil comes from below but according to james 3 amen wisdom from above is first pure then peaceable then gentle and easy to be entreated full of mercy good fruits without partiality and without hypocrisy notice this there is a wisdom of god and a wisdom of god is stay with his word now remember what the prophet said he said a lie is only the truth mistold think about this satan by a lie was able to pull the entire human race amen through eve from following the faith amen but see before you can believe a lie you've got to deny the truth now watch this so paul is writing to timothy in 1st timothy 4 1 and he's showing you amen the same example brother kenny amen that's in genesis 3 he's using in second or first timothy four now the spirit speaketh expressly that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith giving heed the seducing spirits look at this word seducing it means to lead into error amen satan the seducer led eve into air and by claiming her womb he led the entire human race into error he meant by speaking lies in hypocrisy in the second seal seduces what seducing spirit in the church he said that's a clergy spirit workings of devils hypocrisy in the church heady high-minded he said see having a form of godliness but denying the revelation the power and the working of the spirit from such amen turn away notice this it's a strong warning amen from such you turn away in the ephesian church age he said here's where he received the true revelation the serpent seed here's what really happened the word says eve was beguiled by the serpent she was actually seduced by the serpent the serpent led eve into error watch this now right here someone's going to question me did god tell eve to watch out for the serpent or the serpent would seduce her god didn't have to say one thing about it he said just point out the story he simply gave the word he said not to partake of the knowledge partake of life and life was the word of god and death was anything that wasn't the word of god she allowed one word to be changed and right then satan had her god could have said don't pick more fruit off the tree then you can eat satan could say look that is quite right you see if you pick too much of the rod but here is a method of preserving the fruit and yet the same time you can pick all you want so you see you can have your way in god's way at the same time and the devil would have had her right there he that is guilty in one point of the law has broken the whole law don't you fool with that word are you hearing me tonight amen that same spirit come over in the book of revelation that same seducing spirit was what came upon jezebel amen to seduce the servants of god and to commit fornication and you know what god as far as it did hey because the bible said i have a few things because thou sufferest amen or tolerate that woman jezebel what are you saying preacher i'm saying this at the very siding amen of the seducing spirit is the time to stand up and draw a sword you say but then i don't know why brother paul's all the time hitting at this amen he's fine he's not fighting he's fighting spirits amen as a preacher you stand behind this pulpit and you're looking in a spiritual realm and you're seeing spirits swarming amen you're seeing demons coming i say tonight oh can i preach a minute here amen if any of you fathers go home tonight and you smell gas you know what you'll do you'll tear that house upside down you'll trace it down amen you'll crawl under the house you'll crawl through the attic until you find where that gas is leaking because you know if it keeps on leaking it's going to blow apart and it'll blow your family apart and i say tonight i think it's time amen if men will be that concerned about their natural houses don't you think it's time some men ain't got a oh i'm gonna preach here for a minute at the very side into the devil amen when that devil tries to come around your home don't you let that thing oh can i preach don't you tolerate that thing amen you've been anointed amen to draw a sword and cut the devil's head come on church amen departers ain't been departed because they were told with spirits but there are some contenders here tonight amen brother seth we ain't tolerating no devils we ain't given no room to these devils we are anointed amen to tear them down he said yes sir amen you as tolerant you amen you to seduce my servants to commit fornication and in this satire and church age hey it may get quiet here but i'm going to preach anyhow she is a dominating female he said she is mystery babylon she is the great she is jezebel the false prophet why because the true female is submissive to god christ her head second eve colossians 1 and christ is our head amen see she has no word but he has no faults but he has no leadership but he is but what about this church she has cast out the word she has destroyed the bibles and worthy essays of the godly she is slain those who would preach the truth she has taken over kings and princes and nations and controls armies and insists that she is the true body of christ and that her popes are the backers of christ she is entirely seduced amen by the devil until in turn has become the seducers of others she is the bride of satan and has produced his bastard child religions amen now i'm a preacher and i'm going to the house okay amen but it's time amen for the second eve to rise up amen it's time amen for the second eve to rise up and say look amen that jezebel spirit may be in denomination it may be around the world hey i'm going to go this far and say this amen nemo dominating spirits comes around messes churches and they encroach and they encroach and they encroach until they shut a pastor up amen for saying the truth amen but let me let the devil know there are some people here tonight there's some men of god in this message that are not unconscious of the fact that they are carrying the same power amen that adam carried in the garden are you hearing me tonight church husbands amen fathers don't become unconscious and let the devil say just because it's in your children or it's in your wife it's gonna be in your house if it's against god's word there is an anointing on you amen to drive out that spirit until the liberty and the power of the holy ghost can flow through that home oh to think tonight there are seducing spirits the bible says should do so if it were possible even the elect amen paul would say to draw away disciples amen another place seducer shall wax worse and worse amen deceiving and being deceived amen but he says continue thou in the things amen can i preach a minute continue thou in the things which thou has learned and it's been assured of knowing of whom now has learned them are you hearing me amen i didn't know brother gideon when the god when god give me the holy ghost as a young 11 year old boy i didn't know i was going to stand before intellectual giants and them tell me the holy ghost wasn't real i didn't know i was going to stand on foreign fields and men tell me what we need is to do away with altars and turn our altars into psychology boost i didn't know i was going to stand before that amen but god put something in me to stand there and say satan you're a liar the holy ghost is still here and let me just go and tell you you got a pastor behind this pulpit that still believes the holy ghost is big enough to bring a family together and i say as long as can i preach a minute amen there's an all-out attack right now against families there's an all-out attack against homes they've been suicidal demons and depressing demons are you hearing me church it's because the devil knows there is a second eve in the land that he cannot deceive there is a second eve who has received the seed of the second adam is there anybody here tonight can say devil you're too late my seed is done in my womb my seal there's a seal upon my womb i'm not receiving jezebel i'm not receiving anything of the devil i am the second eve that's called to contend for the faith jezebel only got as far as she did because nobody would say nothing well let's preach a minute and water baptism doctrines got so far off the left field because nobody would say nothing amen amen the teaching on the godhead got so far off the left field because nobody would say something but god said elijah in these last days who couldn't help but say something he would only see what god put in his mouth and i say that same word has now come into the bride and the same voice and spoke to the bridegroom it's now speaking through the pride saying satan take your hands off give me back my joy amen give me back my peace are you hearing that i don't know you may not understand what's going through this building right now but i'll tell you what it is it's a restoration anointing it's an anointing that fell upon joel and said what the palmer worm is eaten and the caterpillar locus and canker there was a spirit fell and said i will restore and i say there's some people here tonight the devil's done everything he could to eat off of this tree but there's an anointing behind us tonight and we're saying satan give us back our faith give us back our joy give us back our victory give us back the power of god give us back the anointing give us back the times of refreshing from the lord i have lost my mind there's an anointing behind this message saying satan we're not going to tolerate you are you hearing me amen we're not going we're going to continue in these things and we're going to continue in this message i'm going to just say lord i'm going to continue in the things which i've learned i am assured of the things which i believe amen the bible goes on to say they'll become reprobates amen depart from the faith and become reprobates concerning the faith but i want to leave you fish in second corinthians 13 verse 5 examine yourselves isn't that something in a day when everybody's right paul says examine yourselves whether you be in the faith prove your own selves know ye not your own selves how that jesus christ is in you except you be reprobates it's like a timothy 3 8 now it's janice and timbers withstood moses so do these who resist the truth men of corrupt minds they are reprobates brother well they reprobates about concerning the faith somebody say the faith remember says concerning the faith and connection to malachi 4. wow imagine that i know the devil chokes at that one but i'm going to preach it anyhow rapper bait concerning the faith uh he said you know what reprobate means says apostasy see right here in apostasy what is that notice this is to turn away rap probate's concerning the truth and the only one truth that i know is the bible i tell you that he will avenge him speedily nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth the bible says now that's the question remember i said now that's the question here's where i want to go revelation 10. here's a question if you follow in that line in this hour will it be finished notice this question will i find the faith will malachi 4 be fulfilled at this time restore the faith of the children back to the fathers the original the word paul tells timothy in first timothy 6 20 oh timothy keep that which is committed to the trust avoid profane and vain balance avoid them avoid them and oppositions of scientists falsely so-called which some professing have aired concerning the faith and this is what i love grace be with thee he brother getting he strongly tells him avoid it and then says grace be with thee superlander what are you getting that well here's what i'm getting at some were ordained to depart but some were ordained to contend you say so you're saying some are ordained to argue no because i've come to this conclusion you can argue with the departers until you get arthritis in your fingers by typing on text and facebook messages and emails i mean literally you can share you can get arthritis in your fingers arguing with and you know what at the end of the day this is the conclusion i've come to you're not going to change them but you want to hear the other side of that conclusion they ain't going to change us either so i'm not going to change them and they're not going to change me so they do what they want to do and i'll keep preaching the message is that okay i see i can't help it i was ordained to this i i did i didn't choose this god chose this we were i mean you didn't choose this message you was ordained to believe it that's why jude says when i give all diligence to write unto you and the common salvation it was needful for me to write a new that exhorts you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered to the saints for there are certain men which program says are not saints have crept in unawares he said which means they've come in the fold by means they've not come in the fold by the means of the door and are therefore robbers who were before of old ordained to this condemnation ungodly men turning the grace of our lord god in tootles cheviousness and denying the only lord god in our lord jesus christ watch same words paul uses avoid it but then he says grace be upon you amen see there's a grace upon you brother there's a grace upon the contenders and i close with this quote he said now if he will represent himself how many in here will say if he will do it will say by god i'll raise my hands i'll never have another doubt in my life so help me lord jesus if you'll come and confirm what the preacher said tonight to be the truth and what your bible says it is i'll promise you i'll never doubt no more will you raise your hand that and say i'll never doubt no more in my life he said god bless you now watch this amen i just want to stop here and ask this church is there anybody can raise your hand and say i'll never doubt no more i'll never doubt i may have had it out but i'll never doubt no more everyone says and god bless you he said now notice this why was it now i'm not i'm using this quote okay i'm not bringing it here in a way i am but i want you to understand what i'm saying he said why was it some of you kept your hands down now in case you're wondering i didn't see any hands down in here okay so i'm going to use the quote why was it some of you kept your hands down he said the one would raise from the deadhead yet would you not believe that's what jesus said in luke 16 he said yes no matter what would take place there is people in the world that were born not to believe [Music] there were people in the world born not to believe and the bible said they were ordained of old to this condemnation jude men of old ordained this condemnation not to believe no matter what what the what you do they wouldn't believe anyhow they were raised up for this same purpose but aren't you happy tonight amen i love this aren't you happy tonight that god has tendered your heart to look to calvary and believe how many can say now i'm really glad i can raise my hand amen the bible says in the last days amen that hearts will become hard amen that lovers of of pleasure more than lovers of god in the book of matthew it says amen that hearts would wax gross and ears would be dull of hearing and eyes would be closed amen but i say tonight and i'm done lord don't ever let my heart turn from calvary amen no matter how much i know no matter where all i've said and what i've done let my heart never turn from calvary amen calvary's the only thing amen that can keep a heart tender in this age do you love him tonight ah somebody say lord keep my eyes towards calvary amen amen keep me tender lord where i can believe keep my spirit fresh amen i was ordained to contend i was not ordained to depart and you know what sometimes contenders can do they can become hard sometimes you get so you get so hard in your spirit because you're contending for something you're you're standing for something and there's a resistance gonna be there amen let me say this don't ever forget amen it's only because of grace that we're contending don't ever forget it's only because of the blood of jesus christ that we're able to stand here tonight with a heart full of faith with eyes open to see and ears open to hear and a heart with eyes to believe some are born not to believe but you was born to believe as the musicians come tonight he said there'd be evening lights in the last days the prophet said so god's true witness said so there'd be evening lights what is an evening light the same as the morning light the prophet said there'll be a day where it wouldn't be night or day a gloomy time like it is outside the day just enough light to see how to get around but said the evening time it shall be light what would it be coming back going back to the early time there'd be evening lights in the last day shining he said there'd be a prophet rise in the last days malachi 4 giving the sign to the days of lot so forth also prophesying for the people to return back turn back to the faith of the first pentecostal fathers turn back to the original turn back to the bible turn back what are you saying preacher i'm saying tonight you was ordained to turn back you said but andrew how can we turn back god has to send the message of the hour you said what is the message of the hour the bible says direct quote the message of the hour is to repent and turn back again to the faith of the fathers turn back to the faith contend for the faith and continue in the faith how many can say tonight lord i want to go back i don't want to suffer into these seducing spirits you see these things creep in and i'll have an entire congregation before you know it was a there was a man the other day told me somewhere ways from here but he told me he said but andrew he said i just about the other day lost my entire family i said what do you mean brother he said well he said there's a brother who sent some videos into my family got it got my daughter's phone numbers my phone number my son's phone sent it to the entire family and didn't send it to me so they've been feeding on this guy's videos about how false the message is and how wrong it is and he said andrew i noticed there was something really weird in our house he said it was just a just a really weird feeling for about two weeks and i thought what in the world is it and he said it kind of come up out of nowhere he said i realized what it was he said it about destroyed my entire family i said brother that's what paul said seducing spirits they ain't got backbone enough to come in through the front door and you know what they are and you can put it on the internet you can tell the world i don't care they're robbers and they'll stand before god on that day as robbers rob the peace out of people's homes rob the joy out of families the church these things must need to be but there's a prophecy hanging over you to contend for the faith won't you once you rest yourself to your feet this evening she's staying together if i could leave you with any scriptures tonight it'd be this in caution 123 if you continue in the faith grounded and settled and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel which you have heard and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven wherefore i paul have made a ministry colossians 2 7 rooted and built up in him and established in that good established in the faith as ye have been taught abounding therian with thanksgiving but beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit after the traditions of men and after the rudiments of the world and not after christ this message tonight is christ you know what's amazing right now with this cold stuff going on everybody's this would be a really good time brother paul to be in the vitamin business because everybody's buying vitamins vitamins vitamins probably gone actually said the devil's got some vitamins he said he's got the vitamin p for pleasure and popularity vitamin c for common sense vitamin r for reasoning vitamin b for beauty vitamin m which is for modern he said but there's one vitamin that he failed to tell you in that he had the vitamin d in there that's the biggest one of them all he said the results is death eve took vitamin b for beauty and vitamin m for modern vitamin c for common sense vitamin p for popularity and pleasure and it all headed up in vitamin d for death but this second eve is on one vitamin and the prophet said it's vitamin hell which is life this word is life you love him tonight this word faith only knows one thing and that is life oh i don't know i don't know maybe what your desires or maybe what you've been praying about lately but this has just been my heart's cry god keep me true keep me keep me rooted and grounded settled established in the faith not a man's faith because if a man falls and your faith falls with the man but in the faith which is christ let's put our hearts together this evening approaching tonight i don't believe i've been preaching to departers tonight by no means i believe i've been preaching to contenders tonight as i said some time ago and studying and i was actually preaching the series there at home on the simplicity simplicity of faith simplicity of the gospel simplicity of the word and how god is hidden in simplicity reveals himself and i come across this scripture second corinthians 11 where paul says i fear as the serpent beguiled eve he would begow the minds and i thought lord why would paul place that right here i believe he's showing us something church that that eve's name would not be mentioned again from genesis 4 1 all the way to corinthians and paul would be writing a warning that what happened in genesis will happen again in the end time but this time there will be a second eve on the earth whose wound is sealed who was born to believe who was born to contend who is established and rooted and grounded in the faith all church i believe that's us tonight would there be anybody here could you say lord give me the strength to continue to contend not to argue just to contend [Music] brother ever said i'm not for oregon he said content means to hold fast wholeheartedly brother andrew i'm a sister i'm not a preacher i'm not contending oh yes you are walking through walmart going to school and raising your kids and witnessing the people in front of this ungodly generation holy ghost-filled women in this message witnessing the power of god to this world you're contending against satan's lie you you fathers and husbands and men here young boys living this message every day you're contending for the faith heavenly father lord all across this field and tonight as believers lord [Music] father i believe i'm standing before the purchase of your blood tonight sons and daughters that have been bought by the blood of jesus christ have been redeemed by a price lord i believe i'm standing before people tonight that are sealed lord they're not sealed until the next convention or they're not sealed until the next youth meeting they're not sealed until the next church service but lord i believe there are some contenders standing before me tonight that is sealed until the day of their redemption there is nothing the devil can do to break that seal upon that soul father i pray tonight lord as we as we see this prophetic time we're living in when you would send malachi 4 to to scream out to us the time has come for atomic age the time has come for the falling away the time has come for seducing spirits the time has come for men speaking hypocrisy and false doctrines and the time has come for these things but he would stand there and scream out but the time has come for jesus to come lord i believe there's some people here tonight that has not been gathered into a man they've not been gathered into a church or gathered into a personality but lord your prophet paul stood and told us we have been gathered together unto christ and lord i am not ashamed tonight to be identified in that number i raised my hand before you tonight lord and i want to say thank you father lord there was nothing i could do to earn this faith there was nothing i could do to earn this place for this grace that you've given my life lord but your favor and your mercy look beyond all of our faults and failures and you placed a seat of life inside of our hearts that in these last days when the others would be departing when they would when they would be seducing spirits leading churches and families and young people away and trying to rob and destroy you sent a word with a word of restoration that would say satan which is stolen give it back and tonight father i stand here as one of your sons as one of your god called sons and i stand here and i say satan in the name of jesus christ you were all god's children long enough what you stole from them i stand here tonight with the police of heaven behind me and i am convinced tonight that god is here satan now you've got to give back what you've stolen you've got to give back that loved one you've got to give back that peace you've got to give back that health you've got to give back that sound mind satan you're deeming a division you've got to give back the unity you cannot have it tonight in the name of jesus christ father i pray the holy ghost with strength in this church father i pray a blessing would come upon this pulpit i pray a blessing and come upon our pastor here may there come a blessing upon his family father lord as he stood here for so many years lord in the face of adversary in the face of unbelief lord in the face of all kinds of
