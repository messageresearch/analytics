========================================

few things from Sunday that I didn't get to and we were actually going to take a different subject tonight and I'll save it for Sunday the Lord's really dealt with us quite deeply on something and but we just felt to wait on that and finish what we started there on Sunday so we're going to read in Ezekiel one of the prophets chapter 36 and when we're talking about Redemption this is one of the greatest scriptures that we can look into in Ezekiel to see not only the power of His Redemption but also the process of redemption because I personally believe it's a process but once we come under the power of His Redemptive power then he launches the process then it's like you're engaged in it and God's engagement and he does it he doesn't go backwards Wonder once you're under the power of redemption there's only one direction that's forward and there's such power in it that despite yourself Redemption is to raise back up Redemption is to redeem back what was lost there's such power and it can only go in One Direction is to give you back everything you lost and it can only go upward amen it's just that powerful and once you come under that and you have to come under that by surrender and submission to him and and just saying Lord be it unto me according to your word amen so I'll just read a small section of scripture here and then we'll come back to the whole uh chapter he says here in verse 25 then will I sprinkle clean water upon you and ye shall be clean from all your filthiness and from all your Idols will I cleanse you a new heart also will I give you and a new spirit what I put within you and I will take away the Stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you a heart of Flesh I want you to notice he hasn't said that said yet those words I will put my spirit in your spirit he's this is he's only dealing with your spirit he is only changing your spirit he's only um he's only making your spirit more compliable more get alongable as it were so that you can get along so you can get in a place that you'd receive his spirit so he gives you a new heart he takes away your Stony heart he gives you a new spirit and then after that then he says verse 27 and I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statues and ye shall keep my judgments and do them amen it's not it's that okay I'm gonna do that I'm going to do them no there's something deeper I'll put my spirit in you and I will live it out in you amen Lord bless your word tonight I pray you an anointed father and God you know my heart in these times when we gather together the precious moments we have just a few minutes but I pray the Holy Ghost would speak to every heart even the youngest heart in the name of Jesus we ask it amen God bless you may be seated as I said I wanted to finish what I started there on Sunday in the subject and then leave room for this Sunday the Lord willing to go into something that's really God has dealt deeply with me about and uh but uh on Sunday we were talking about Redemption restoring relationship and I was being a little bit more specific than that and I was talking about on Sunday How Deeply sin uh became embedded in us after the fall in the garden every one of us that were born sin was so embedded in us in our nature it was so deep in us that then we know that the work of redemption has to be a very very deep work because sin was so embedded in us this wasn't a a you know I mean just say it so the children can understand it you know your body goes through many things your your body will have just cuts and bruises uh but then there's other things the body would go through that you receive a disease or you'd get some type of cancer or something like that and that's deeper than just getting a cut or a bruise a cut or a bruise on your body you can deal with it put a Band-Aid on it and the body heals itself and it's over within a few days but then the body can get something that's so internal and so deep that it's something that has to be dealt with deeper than just putting a Band-Aid on and so when we when we receive just something small it's one thing but we have diseases and some of the worst is the some of the worst I was reading it today the worst disease the worst diseases is ones that get in the bloodstream and the blood our bloodstream is our life stream so no so you can have a cut or a bruise but there are diseases that can go so deep into your bloodstream that your days would be numbered because if you're into the bloodstream if something's in the bloodstream your days could be very very much numbered we've been praying for brother Gabe tawari the pastor in Ann Arbor and he had really strange things happen since um December and they were they were saying it might Trace back to a dentist visit that he did and got something in his in his mouth and a germ went into his blood he got real sick in December and then he felt better but then he went right back again it's something got in his bloodstream and some type of sickness and then it was so potent that it went and started to attack his heart and when it did that then he had to have open heart surgery recently he's just recovering but I'll tell you you don't mess with those things because it just it's something that's deep and you can't you can't put a bandage on that you can't put a Band-Aid on that it's something so deep they say that that CAD coronary heart disease is the worst disease in in the world that's the worst disease and that's related to the blood the blood vessels narrow that's going to the heart and sometimes something is in the blood restricting the blood flow to the heart and that'll kill you and so serious measures need to be taken for serious things how many know that and and so it's not just a casual visit to the doctor when you have a disease it's not just something that's why when people come and be prayed for some needs are are very minimal but God cares about all of them but sometimes some needs are very very uh specific and very deep can you say Amen there's something that's uh all things are all things are possible With God all things are possible it doesn't matter how bad the disease God can take care of it can you say Amen but but if you had a disease then sometimes you you need like a heart surgery you need some type of surgery it's not just a casual visit to the doctor and I pray that we can come to church that not just a casual visit to the doctor but God if he needs to perform surgery on us then say I'm here for the duration can you say Amen because I want the Holy Spirit to deal deeply with me and he has to do that because in in the talking about our nature the nature that we're born with it has put sin in us so deeply it's not just a little cold or a little symptom it's life-threatening the nature that we received in our birth it has to be dealt with with a remedy that goes deep if you've got a deep problem then the remedy has to go deep can you say Amen you wouldn't take NyQuil for this it's not just a cold can you say man it's not just taking NyQuil and you feel better to sleep and the next day you're still a bit sick so you take Nyquil the next night no the the disease of sin that we're born with is deep embedded in our nature and because it's embedded in our nature then it takes a deep deep work of redemption for God to deal with it and as I said Sunday you can't deal with that yourself there's no way to drag yourself out of that myri clay there's no way to lift yourself up you might as well say I've fallen and I can't get up Lord I've fallen and there's no way for me to get get up I need your hand to pick me up and Redeem Me there are certain problems that only God can deal with can you say and we live and Leo to see us so we have a lot of answers for our problems we have a lot of medicines which I'm not against medicines because if God uses it to heal God use the devil that praise the Lord for that but you see we can become dependent and all Leo to see is answers for so many things that we need this and we need a new car and we need all this stuff and so we don't need to pray anymore because the world provides it for us but for the nature of sin there's only one that can deal with that problem not that you're a good person not Charities that you do not service to the church not your gift your singing your preaching can you say Amen you can preach like an angel and still have the desire for sin it takes God to deal with that and to deal deeply with you amen so that when serious uh measures are in our lives then it takes serious measures to deal with it and churches sometimes do uh things to make people feel better in these days just for a couple days they arrange our Sunday morning services to just make people feel better for a couple days but Redemption is the power of His spirit that saves you from sin and Hell and you say man Redemption is not just a casual visit to Sunday church it saves you from sin it lifts you out the myory clay so on Sunday we were given the first part of redemption and just taking it in pieces so that even the children can understand it and the first part of redemption according to the law is that the wages of sin is death God said to Adam and Eve at the beginning if you eat of eat thereof of that fruit then you shall surely die so if you sin if there's unbelief in your sin and you eat of that he said you'll die so that's the wages of sin so if you sin that's that's that's you you can't get out of it that there has to be a punishment for it and and so now the only way that you can get out of it is someone paid the price for that sin someone paid the penalty a penalty has to be paid and so the only way that something can happen is you pay that penalty but you can't pay that penalty and say you can't deal with the problem so the only way is someone paying the penalty for your sin the first step is somebody paying the penalty you couldn't get out you you would finish this life you would die in your sins uh you would go to a sinner's hell you could not lift yourself up you could not pay your debt uh and you were helpless you couldn't lift yourself up and and and so then if we were wanting to begin to believe the word and start to come back to God we couldn't even start coming back until the penalty of our sin was paid you say do you want to come back to God I want to come back to God I want to come back to him but you see you couldn't until first your sin was dealt with because you never come in the presence of God with that sin so and you can't deal with your sin so you're actually you're doomed without the grace of God you do without the grace of God and because of the penalty has to be paid that's the first step and praise the Lord tonight can you say praise the Lord he paid the debt for our sins he paid the full debt you ever heard of somebody who needed a surgery and it was life-threatening they had to have the surgery maybe you maybe you needed a surgery and and you couldn't afford the surgery you heard it's going to be two hundred thousand dollars for this surgery and the doctor's telling you unless you have this surgery you're gonna you're finished you gotta have it and you were poor you didn't have two hundred thousand dollars for that surgery you couldn't afford it you couldn't get it and so then and then then you you're as you're as you're just uh dealing with that somebody secretly goes to the hospital and somebody pays the 200 000 for your surgery somebody pays it and the hospital calls you and says listen you didn't have the money but somebody had the money the full cost and they just paid it you can have your surgery you can move forward how many remember I scored my story Sunday when my wife and I had that debt school debt and all of that there's no greater feeling than when the debt has been completely paid by someone else because you couldn't pay it can you say Amen there's no grade but if you want to Trump that by a hundred thousand times the debt of sin was paid at Calvary you don't have to pay it he paid it in full that's enough to shout about that's enough to Rejoice about right there we haven't even got to the rest of the work of redemption in your life and you can already shout because somebody's paid the debt you'd never be able to come to God come to this altar unless somebody had paid your debt for sin the first thing you can do is reach up in Brokenness and say God thank you for going to Calvary for me thank you I'm a sinner but I have been saved by grace because you paid the debt the first part of redemption is somebody has to pay a price for your sin and he's already paid it I think we ought to be thankful for that I don't think we should forget that I think it should warm our hearts with a deep conviction all the time when we think about we we didn't get off scot-free we wouldn't have got off scot-free God had to deal with us and pay the debt he did it so some of the quotes that I was going to get to on Sunday he says here in the Oneness message and I'm going to get through these uh just rather quickly and then I want to get to the I want to get to Ezekiel 36. you see nothing has a soul but man he's in animal form that's true but he put a soul on him the animals the dogs the cats they don't have a soul that's how you're different than the animal you have a soul so you have a connection with God uh animals have they have a spirit and so and they're temperamental and emotional that's why I don't have a dog but anyway they have a spirit but they have a soul uh you know if they had a soul I could probably deal with them better a dog but anyway uh they have a spirit that's why they're different temperaments and some are hyper and some are this and but all of them don't know how to train and go to the bathroom outside all of them have that problem but they have a spirit so they're temperamental but only man has a soul okay so when they were taken Lambs in the Old Testament and God said bring a lamb for your sin they they could they could do that to put off their sin and God said okay I'm satisfied for another year because something died for your sin but the spirit of that animal could not come back on a man again you see that was the next step that was broken is that the the spirit couldn't come and correct the desire for sin it stayed the same they still had a desire for sin but so the the lamb was killed but it stopped it right there but when Calvary took place uh um the man Christ Jesus went to Calvary for us and something happened because he was one of us can you say Amen then he went to Calvary and when he when he died his Spirit his Spirit could come back on us again to take us further into Redemption so we praise the Lord for that so that's why the prophets appear bringing it out he know right from wrong when his soul come on him remember when God created man in his own image and then he became a living soul for those who are listening I'm quoting a wonderful man of God William Branham you don't know who he is we'd be glad to share information I believe he was a man of God for this last days greatly instrumental in bringing us back to biblical truth so just if you want more on that that's who I'm quoting from right now and so remember when God created man in his own image and then he became a living Soul see he became that knowing right from wrong now notice now in this Jesus came and he was God not only the life of another man can come back on another man but the life of God making him a child of God putting him back into the same union he was before the fall now we're getting to the real Oneness what am I preaching our way back our way back our way back to Eden and our way back is that he could go to Calvary and pay the penalty for sin but not only that his Spirit God's old Spirit coming through that could come back on man again like it was in the Garden of Eden and we could be restored Back to Eden again that's pretty powerful the next one he said he paid the debt of sin now in order to get Oneness before between God and man again I'm saying again because that's what he's talking about he's saying to get that Oneness back again Jesus could not do it as long as he was here in a body of Flesh so he had to become the complete sin offering to take away the guilt of the believer take it away so that the Holy Ghost could come into man and make man and God won us again see there had to be something to re-establish re-establish what reestablish Oneness now we could re-establish we could reestablish when God's commandment is fulfilled could an angel fulfill it he has no blood could God have fulfilled it he has no blood and God became flesh and blood in order that he could pay the debt correctly and take away sin because that's the only way that's why God came down and became one of us because as God he had no blood our problem was in our blood can you say Amen it was a blood problem it was a nature problem it was the life in us that was wrong so God said I'm going to redeem my people but I can't do it I have no blood I'm going to have to come and create a blood cell in a little girl and then I shouldn't say a little girl teenage girl and then that's going to grow and I'm going to go but my purpose as soon as he was born he was born to die he was headed right towards Calvary with the purpose of paying the penalty for sin saw that his Spirit could come back on man again this may be simple to you but it's pretty powerful tonight we ought to praise the Lord because you needed it I needed it I don't care how good a preacher you are I don't care how good all of us needed the grace of God none of us could find our way in except for his blood and his Spirit coming back on us this is our way back to Oneness this is how you come in fellowship with God you don't ignore the Holy Ghost and say well I have my own personal walk with God no this is the way back say well I have a Bible I'm doing fine on my own not without the holy ghost in your life the only way back through Redemption is you repenting of your sins and his Spirit coming back on you again that's the only way back to the Garden of Eden again that is redemption the next quote says see that's the only way that man could be back I just said it that's the only way man could get back in his original state again is for that penalty of sin to be paid the penalty of sin of what death wages of sin is death and God said the day you eat thereof that day that you have this affair that day you'll die and when it did it broke his relationship fellowship and everything for man could not come back anymore until that penalty was paid and nobody was worthy to pay it because everyone fell with a human being all of us fell with the same fall in the garden because every creature is under the human being and he was Fallen the next quote the debt of sin was paid this is when I read Sunday Jesus had to do this send the Holy Ghost back upon the uni to the unite the people like it was in the Garden of Eden the debt was paid when Jesus died that settled it Amen brother if I could only get that to soak in see the debt is paid Hallelujah to the land the debt is paid and every man and woman hearing me this morning or will hear me by tape your penalty is paid don't you disbelieve God's word again come back to the word we couldn't even come back unless we could say my penalty has been paid and now I can come back to God oh blessed be his name I feel like shouting tonight I can come back to him I couldn't even come back even if I cried tears all night I couldn't come back unless the penalty was paid but now I can say I can come all the way back because the penalty has been completely paid amen come back to the word he was the word Glory I feel like shouting honest I do the penalty is paid it's all over I love that it's over I like to say it's over game's over devil games over devil can you imagine now we're growing in the Lord we grow every week we grow in the word we're growing in the Holy Ghost but can you imagine telling the devil that even when the price was paid 2 000 years ago you can tell the devil game over game it's over it's done sons of daughters of God were as good as saved and restored back when he said it is finished at Calvary it was over can you say Amen oh my no wonder Angel screamed and sang the anthems of Heaven ring out yesterday the lost sheep was found of propitiation was made for him to be restored again the Waters of Separation God's word that washes him from his iniquity when the word died in my place and was resurrected again and became preeminent in my life I love how that's worded when the word died in my place and was resurrected again and become preeminent in my life in my heart amen the penalties paid it's over we are redeemed we are redeemed I'm preaching to the redeemed tonight let the redeemed of the Lord say so I don't know what the devil told you today about yourself but tell him back tonight I am redeemed I am the redeemed the penalty has been paid Satan I am redeemed Hallelujah it's all over it's all over praise the Lord I know we got a lot of growing and we don't feel like we reached this week where we want to be but let's just remind ourselves the penalty's been paid it's over as far as God's concerned it's as good as done hallelujah praise the Lord sister Ashley here saying Amen to the word of God and you know there's been three or four incidents I've just preached girls right into labor that's what we're praying for you can wait around for a full moon all you want to but I can preacher right into it right here Hallelujah well that's good okay so now let's get back to our Ezekiel 36 now look at this powerful work I want you to notice something and I'm going to take it scripture by scripture we've got I got several minutes here so Ezekiel 36 look at this verse 16 moreover the word Lord came unto me saying son of man when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land they defiled it by their own way and by their doings their way was before me as the uncleanness of a removed woman wherefore I poured my Fury upon them for the blood that they had shed upon the land and for their Idols were with they had polluted it and I scattered them among the Heathen and they were dispersed through the countries according to their way and according to their doings I judged them and when they entered into the Heathen under the Heathen whether they went they profaned my holy name so it's it's bad enough that Israel left God and began to serve Idols then when God scattered them to all the Heathen Nations they get amongst those Heathen and they start profaning the name of God when they said to them these are the people of the Lord and are gone forth out of his land so these people in the heathens were saying this is the people of the Lord this is supposed to be the ones that are blessed of God these are the Jews and they're so far away from God they're actually profaning his name and they're saying but these are the people of God these were supposed to be the people of God that's how far backslid they were that's how far backsled you were with sin in your life amen this is all about the individual now because remember at the End of the Road God saved Israel as a nation but he saves Gentiles as individuals so everything that applies to Israel as a nation applies to you as an individual and you by yourself born in sin shaped in iniquity you're in a land you rebelled against the god you're out amongst the world amongst the Heathen you start acting like them you take on the nature you just you do what they do you smoke you drink you into all the kinds of things the worldly music and everything because you by Nature you have that nature so you're out there amongst the Heathen and a lot of times they're looking at saying hey didn't you have a better upbringing than that didn't you say this didn't you say that and they're kind of looking at you saying my that weren't you weren't you used to grow up in a Christian church or something I can't believe you're acting like that but I had a he's God says I had a Pity let's notice now I had a pity for my Holy Name which is the house of Israel had profaned among the Heathen whether they went therefore say unto the house of Israel thus saith the Lord God I do not this this next thing I'm going to do Redemption I do not this for your sakes o House of Israel but for my holy namesake which ye have profaned among the Heathen whether you went there's one thing we got to know about Redemption it's not just about you can you say man but it's about God said I made a promise that I'm going to manifest myself through human beings I'm going to glorify my name in human beings that's the purpose of God he didn't come in you to glorify yourself he didn't come in you that you're a super duper Christian where you're going to boast and I'm better than everybody else in Pride no no he comes in that his name could be glorified in your life and he does that through flesh the plan of God is for the word to be manifest in your flesh In the Flesh of Sons and Daughters of God but it's not about you it's about him in you and he's saying to Israel when I redeem you don't think that even that is about you I'm doing it to protect and restore my name and you're gonna read it he's gonna say I'm gonna do this I'm going to do that I'm going to do that and we could interrupt and say where do I come along how do I contribute there's none of us in it and guess what I'm glad there's none of us in it I'm gonna do this I'm Gonna Change you I'm gonna do that because when we inject into it and that's what he said about the children of Israel when they chose law over Grace they should have chose Grace and they said to Moses give us a law tell us the Commandments tell us what to do and we will do it they should have never said that that's not a good deal they should have said we surrender Lord you do what you want to do in US when they chose law over Grace and he says why did man chose law of a Grace prophet of God said is because man is always trying to do something in it we're always trying to have some type of thing that we can inject in it that we can do and maybe some of my discipline will help this along a little bit maybe some of my gifts could help God your gifts need to be surrendered to the Lord your life needs to be surrendered to the Lord this is all about him it's not about you that was a message from Little Lane to his mom on the way to church one night when she's stressed out trying to get to church she's stressed out talking about it the whole way and driving the parking lot and little lane says how is he Kyle he was probably too then or three or what for Mom it's not about you it's about God it's all about him so he was preaching a sermon before she even made it to the church preach the good one too and I'm preaching it tonight this isn't about you it's about his name being glorified in you and he will take you through a sanctification process he will take your life through a Redemption process and he's doing it all so his name could be glorified in your life and in your flesh and he's going to do it praise the Lord all right where are we at look at this we haven't even started the process here so I'm doing that for that so verse 23 and I will sanctify my great name which is profaned among the Heathen which he have profaned in the midst of them and the Heathen shall know that I am the Lord saith the Lord God when I see he never lets the devil gets the get the last word I will not let the last word be my name being profaned to the heathen there's going to be a glorious Church Without spot or wrinkle this bride's going to come to a Capstone love there's going to be a finishing work in here can you say man and the devil thinks he's got the climax to this Eden that he's created Satan's Eden but let me tell you something God gets the last word and the last word is going to be this bride coming to her position God said I will not let my name continue I think so now I'm going to take my people I'm going to redeem them because I'm going to get the last word Satan don't have the last laugh verse 24 says I will take you from among the Heathen and gather you out of all countries and will bring you into your own land he hasn't filled him with the spirit yet he hasn't changed their heart yet he said I just need to gather you out of all those Heathen lands and bring you into your own land and when your Christian Life Starts you don't know that God is beginning to call you and work on you even on some job maybe you were working in a bar maybe you're in a factory and custom with all the other guys and and so but if you're a Son of God he's he's already hunting for you God is hunting for you because he's going to find his sons and daughters wherever they're at and he's going to say I need to get you separated from that atmosphere a bit and bring you into your own land first so I can start to deal with you he took Israel by the power of redemption out of all those he's in Heathen lands and gathered them all by something that was in heart we got to get back to Jerusalem we got to get back to Jerusalem they came from all the countries and he gathered them back hadn't even dealt with them yet hadn't even restored them yet but the first thing is I'm going to bring them out of all those lands you don't know when God was working on your heart back in that bar you don't know who it was that God calling you when you were in prostitution you don't know what it was when you were a little girl that was abused you don't know God began to deal with your heart back then and begin to call you I will gather them to their own land verse 25 then I will sprinkle clean water upon you and ye shall be clean from all your filthiness because you're too filthy to come before the Lord and you're certainly too filthy to receive his holy spirit God's got to deal with that old nature first I will sprinkle clean water you should be clean from all your filthiness and from all your Idols will I cleanse you you see this is why I preach to people in different stages of their Christian Journey I preach every service and everybody's at different stages and some people think that they're in they're in another stage than what they really are but the word reveals where you really are you're still all filthy from the idols of the world walking in this church well then you you can't just act like that you're a holy ghost Phil Christian your life needs to be cleansed of the idols you need to be Sanctified by the blood of Jesus Christ hmm you shall be clean from your filthiness from your Idols while I cleanse you I a new heart also will I give you and a new spirit will I put within you and I will take away the Stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you a heart of Flesh now notice in the quote he says here now come back to the scripture in a minute you put a new spirit this is a quote in them in the inner Veil you put a new spirit God has to give you a new spirit or you couldn't even get along with him you're not even close to agreeing with the word or agreeing with God you're not even close with the spirit you've got so he has to give you a new spirit first that's a little bit more get along ability did you hear me he has to give you a moral a little bit more get along ability Spirit just so you can start getting close to start listening to God because the spirit nature you're born with and the spirit you hold never gets along with God doesn't want God resists God shuts him out so he's got to put it he's got to put a new spirit in you so he can get so you can get along with his spirit amen I will put a new spirit in them I will put my spirit in them he said after he's given you a new spirit that's you don't get it confused with God's spirit it's not it's your new spirit so you can get along with the Holy Spirit if he ever gives it to you amen because you in your condition can never get a you and your condition never get along you can't get along with your wife you can't get along with your husband you can't get along with your neighbor how are you gonna get along with God when somebody can't even get along with your neighbor amen so so you you can't get along with the neighbor how are you ever going to get along with God so he has to give you a new spirit for you so you can get along with him so he puts a new spirit in you and then he puts his spirit and you gives you a new spirit a new outlook a new Faith then he puts his Holy Spirit and you notice back there in the beginning when that same man fell for Israel out here on the ground every day the people eat it but notice those people who eat that Manna would get hungry before nine o'clock I've seen a lot of camp meetings and people go to those camp meetings and they'd shout the victory for a little while while the camp meeting was going on and then before the day was over with the night coming close they'll worry all along and say well you know I wish I could keep the victory hallelujah oh my I wish I had just I wish I had the victory I wish I had the victory I had at Camp I'll tell you this this so and so this is so and so oh my it's because you're not in the right place to eat the Manna and that's another subject in itself but listen we don't want to just be camp meeting people can you say mine and we certainly don't want to be someone that just keeps a Stony heart we want to allow God in this Redemptive process to be able to change our spirit and and see what do you do brother Paul you say Lord wherever I'm at be it unto me Lord if I'm not getting along with you Lord change my spirit if I've got a Stony heart that's just cold towards God and maybe everybody else God you got to deal with that Stony heart you got to take a Heart of Stone you got to crush it and soften my heart first I want all the glories of God and I want to grow into this full matured adopted Spirit-filled Christian but Lord if I've got things in my life that is not that can't get along with people and there's something agitating all the time take that thing out of me because that's part of the Redemptive work as well how many agree that's part of this Redemptive work it's not just that you get the Holy Ghost some preachers don't like me to say that but in this Redemptive work of God for Israel it wasn't just getting his spirit it's him changing your spirit first it's him dealing with your broken heart and some Sundays not everybody might get the Holy Ghost but somebody might get their broken heart their heart broken and soft before the Lord and then the next Sunday or even Monday they can be filled with the Holy Ghost don't say we haven't had church because we haven't had an altar call listen God is dealing with people at every level that they're at and his Redemptive power is here among us to raise us where we need to be I think we ought to clap give yourself time to praise the Lord it's God doing the work it's this Redemptive power Among Us that's what we want to see working among us too many preachers only preach on just the Holy Ghost and this is a whole Redemptive process amen you know Sister Genie whoever's up there I had missed one quote in Oneness if you go back to that last one and Oneness it starts out what is it you've got to get to the word with the word do you have that one I missed one you probably knew that I missed one before I knew that I missed it I just found out what is it this is one is that you've got to get with the word get yourself killed up I'm persuaded that many of us friends have received the Holy Ghost but we just receive enough holy ghost in us to make us to the place where we don't want to lie we don't want to steal we don't want to do anything but God wants to fill every fiber of his church this Redemptive process doesn't start when we quit lying and quit stealing now if you're stealing and lying you need help start there my goodness the same God that can save a a robber is the same one that can do the rest of the work so you say Lord I you know I I stole way too many Twinkies in life I had to repent of that I don't know if you did but I had to repent of as a young boy this is why I'm brother Ryan and his dad but Ryan now that he's in my church here brings me a box of Twinkies every now because some of you don't know the twinkie story as a young boy I snuck off with some neighborhood kids got under the wrong influence and one day they wanted to go every day this Twinkie truck pulled up at the back of this building and unloaded a bunch of Twinkies and the guy left the door open said we're gonna go we're going to raid that truck and I got under the influence of these guys I was a good boy until that point I'd never done anything like this before but I weighed the thought of those Twinkies and that was a thing that was starting in my life back then that I still struggle with I waited and I waited and I thought and they're talking about it and I waited this is a this is going to be a bad boy but the Twinkies I'll get out of the day wait and I wait it for for a long time like 30 seconds and then I was with them and got up there raided that truck grabbed as many boxes of Twinkies as ho-hos that we could get ran back into the woods and sat there and I couldn't take them home so I had to eat most of them and it was a blast and it's probably why I looked the way I looked today quit making fat jokes that's a thought that I just heard come across stole it if if you if life I mean it's all of our things got to go before God right whatever what it is if we bring it to God he can redeem it but he says some of us just want to get just enough Holy Ghost to make us quit lying or stealing make us a better person but that quote tells me there's more to the Holy Ghost than just sanctification there's more of the Holy Ghost than you make you a good person he wants to fill every fiber of your being he wants to fill you completely so don't stop at just stopping stealing don't stop it just I gave my heart to the Lord don't stop it just being baptized if you haven't been baptized I encourage you if you're being led of the Lord be baptized in the name of the Lord repent and be baptized but don't stop there don't stop there say God fill me with your spirit now I'm a candidate to receive the holy ghost in my own life don't stop in God until he's filled every fiber of his church he wants to fill your thinking he wants to fill your mind how we would raise your hand and say my I want to go there in this Redemptive work fill my mind fill my thinking that his thoughts would so fill my thoughts replace them can you say Amen what a wonderful wonderful thing praise the Lord back to Ezekiel 36 and then I'm going to bring it to a close here so he says I then verse 20 said I will put my spirit within you and cause you so he's he's dealt with a Stony heart he's dealt with he's given you a new spirit that will get along and then I will put my spirit within you to cause you to walk in my statues and you shall keep my judgments and do them and ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers and ye shall be my people and I will be your God I will also he's not done this is so powerful friends this is so such a deep work God wants to do a deeper work in your life deeper than just saying I grew up in the message and I believe God sent a prophet deeper than that that's not good enough such a powerful deep work it's a process and he does it all can you say Amen and um we just find that in these scriptures I was just looking for I must have said this at the uh had this at the beginning as he begins to deal with us it's just such a wonderful thing but when we look at this Redemption taking place then we we realize that in these scriptures in Ezekiel 36 the first thing that we have to know is that he he is doing it all I will sprinkle with you with clean water I will deal with your Stony heart it's almost like God responding to the all the eyes that Lucifer rose up in Isaiah way at the beginning Isaiah reveals he said I will lift my throne above the Throne of God I will set myself up I want to be worshiped by God I I and he boasted and he boasted and actually went in caused the fall all these other things so it's almost like God is responding saying no all right you've had your time I will step in for my people now and you gotta imagine friends the devil is the one that preaches no hope for this human being he's the one that takes somebody sometimes so far there's no hope for them there's no Redemption for that and then he tells you personally with your story I don't think there's I'm not sure this Redemption that is preached at the pulpit is for you everybody else seems to be getting it but I don't think it's for you and your family I think you're an exception to the rule that's the devil's voice that's the devil's voice I don't I don't I don't think and you know you you've got such you have been through so much and have such a Stony heart that I don't know you're a you're in a different category you're not in a different category and God wanted to tell Satan I don't care how deep the Stony heart I don't care how the spirit that won't get along with me I don't care they're scattered all over the Nations I don't care if they're defaming my name I don't know if they'll care if they're cussing I don't care if they're swearing I don't care if they're deepest pit that they're in if they're my sons and daughters I'm going to show Satan I'm gonna go get em I'm showing the devil that there isn't a dark pit black enough and deep enough there isn't a myri clay that is deep enough for me not to redeem my child somebody say praise the Lord he brought me out of the my reclaim he set my foot notice he did it can you say Amen I'll bring them out I'll do this I got to finish before I sing I will also save you from your uncleanness I will call for corn I will increase it and lay no famine upon you I will multiply the fruit of the tree I will increase the field that ye shall receive no more no more reproach of famine among the Heathen I you know it's not you're not done after he puts a spirit in you it's still he's still selling Satan I'm going to do this for my people I'm going to multiply your fruit of the tree then shall you remember your own evil ways and your doings that were not good and shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your Abominations not for your sakes do I do this saith the Lord heckles it again be it known unto you be ashamed and confounded for your own ways or House of Israel thus saith the Lord God in the day that I shall have cleansed you from all your iniquities I will also cause you to dwell in the cities and ways shall be building and the desolate land shall be tilled whereas it lay desolate in the sight of all that passed by and they shall say this lamb that was desolate is become like the garden of Eden glory be to God that's Redemption he's taken his sons and daughters back to the Garden of Eden and we're not stop stopping halfway sister Jane we're not stopping halfway sister Rebecca we're not stopping halfway this isn't a halfway Journey Redemption is not a halfway trip he's not wanting just to get you off your cigarettes he's not wanting you just to get you off of bad videos this is not a halfway trip God is going to take his people through Redemption all the way through the process all the way back to Eden again can you say Amen he's going to burn this Earth he's going to purge this Earth with his holy fire can you say amen and he's going to put his people back on it again this is your Paradise this is your Millennium he's going to give us a new body that's the Final Redemption as I get a new body not like this body I'm not really this ugly they used to laugh at that when dad used to say it I'm not really this ugly I got a new body I got about 20 year old 21 year old body in the other dimension where'd you get that in the scripture if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have one waiting in the heavens eternal if you know your Bible that's Redemption we can step into that other body but he says then I'll get you in there we'll have three and a half years of tribulation we won't be here for that but I have three and a half years and then we're going to set in a time of a thousand year honeymoon with the bride in Christ that's a pretty long honeymoon none of you men have ever got anywhere near that for your honeymoon thousand years of peace on Earth honeymoon and then at the end of that a new heavens and a new Earth wherein sin doesn't dwell I'll tell you friends this is a powerful work of redemption I'm going to end with that and say that this land was desolate and the people will say this land that was death has become like the Garden of Eden and the waste into desolate ruined cities are become fenced and are inhabited than the Heathen that are left around about shall know that I the Lord build ruined places and plant that that was desolate I the Lord have spoken it I will do it the devil's gonna know that heathen's going to know I'm the god that builds ruined places I'm the god that restores and the world's going to say at the end he's the god that builds ruined things broken lives ruined families broken hearts the heathen's going to say he's the Mighty God that heals ruined cities and ruined families and ruin hearts they're all going to know and I have spoken it I the Lord have spoken it and I will do it amen the Redemptive process of God is powerful this scripture it's powerful can you agree with me that the work of redemption is powerful we agree that it's a deep work and not a surface work it goes deep to the very nature of ourselves will you agree it's a process it is a process and would you agree that he does it all you ever need to be reminded go back to Ezekiel 36 where you're saying I will do this I will then and you'll get the four things out of it this is powerful this is deep this is a process and he does it all he does it all it's been good to be in the house of the Lord tonight it's been good to be in the house of the Lord let's Stand Together amen what song was I singing a minute ago
