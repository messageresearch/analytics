about praise the Lord in him I'm satisfied praise the Lord and it's what a wonderful blessing could we have uh Zion uh Eman come if he would come and sing tonight and U while he's coming and then after that if we could have April sister April come as well um after that maybe prepare just come to the side here and be ready to come up we'd appreciate it so much and I'll just take this moment while they're preparing and just say What U just the cream of the crop that's gathered here this year just quality young people uh such a desire for the word and hunger for the word and uh we've heard quite a bit the last couple nights and the servic is just about uh how God looks at his purpose in our life and he looks at us more of his purpose he has for us than our mistakes but I believe some young people that's heard some things to rise above your mistakes put them under the blood and go on with the Lord and I believe that's some of the things he spoke to us is that and you know brother uh Sam was on Jonah a little bit and Jonah is such a strange strange person in the Bible because he doesn't fit the category of maybe a David or something he made a lot of mistakes and ran from the presence of the Lord but he's still in the in the Bible he's still a Son of God and he's an example of some of us where you can't run far enough away from the love of God and so I was great to hear those things and to know that God loves us this much but you're a cream of the crop just wonderful I'm going to brag about you for many months now to that we I was able to be with some of the very best young people for their hunger for the Lord God bless you all give yourself a hand God bless you brother [Music] you give life you are love you bring light to the darkness you give hope you restore every heart that is [Music] broken great are you Lord It's your breath in our lungs so we pour out our praise we pour out our Praises your breath in our lungs so we pour out our praise to you

come and sing tonight praise the Lord just heard several testimonies from the camp already and some change lives and so you know I'd like to have some testimonies maybe uh tomorrow if we get time for it before we leave because I like to hear those things give the devil a black eye and God is doing great things in the life of the young people so I'd like to hear some of those if I can and uh so we appreciate that and then I was announcing something today anybody who is uh doesn't have a flight home or a long trip home Saturday and you're going to stay in the area Saturday when we leave the camp at 1 or so we have to be out of our rooms by noon uh but when we have lunch and and you wanted to stay in the area close to our church we've rented another facility to have some volleyball and snacks there anybody wants to stay over and I took a head a headcount for that today uh today and so you're welcome to come if anybody's staying over for our service on Sunday you're welcome and then uh we'll probably gather together not as an official service but we'll gather at the church uh for to bring in the new year and that's when I'd like to hear some testimonies as well so you're welcome if you're in the area to stay over for that and we'll just have some singing brother Jack Duff will be with us and his family and uh we'll have some singing also some testimonies uh to bring in the New Year together we usually do it here at retreat but the dates didn't work out so you're welcome in at our assembly God bless you Sister April God bless um I just want to say the inspiration of the song um so Jeremiah in Jeremiah 20 Pasha the priest had thrown him into you know wherever he throw him into um and Jeremiah was feeling really low and really down um but he said how can I be quiet when this fire the word shut up in my bones and he said I won't be quiet I'm going to speak um and my God will deliver me so the song is called it's just like fire okay Jerusalem was a shaken Pentecost had arrived in an upper room party well they were drunk on the new wine but Peter stood among them and he said there is no doubt that this Holy Ghost Fire it will make you dance and Shout it's just like fire shut up in my bones it's that Holy Ghost Fire and it's shut up in my bones it's just like fire shut up in my bones it's that Holy Ghost Fire and it shut up in my bones from his mother's belly he was born to prophesy the Prophet Jeremiah would lift his voice and cry well be quiet folks command it shut up and leave us alone but how can I be quiet when there's fire in my bones it's just like fire shut up in my bones it's that Holy Ghost Fire and it's shut up in my bones it's just like fire shut up in my bones well it's that Holy Ghost Fire and it shut up in my bones some people get offended because I dance and shout and they say that's too much emotion and too much moving about but don't you tell me to be quiet or sit down in my chair because if you felt what I felt I know you be dancing to it's just like fire shut up in my bones it's that Holy Ghost Fire and it's shut up in my bones it's just like fire shut up in my bones it's that Holy Ghost Fire and it shut up in my bones see it makes you want to dance and it makes you want to shout it makes you want to run and it makes you want to praise it makes you want to sing and it makes you want to shout why it's that Holy Ghost Fire and it's shut up in my bones it's just like fire shut up in my bones it's that Holy Ghost Fire and it's shut up in my bone it's just like fire shut up in my bones it's that Holy Ghost Fire and it's shut up in my bones it's just like fire shut up in my B it's that Holy Ghost Fire and it's shut up in my bones it's just like fire shut up in my bones why it's that Holy Ghost Fire and it makes [Music] you God [Applause] bless sing it again come on now sing it yes like fire shut up in my bones it's that Holy Ghost Fire and it shut up in my bones it's just like fire shut up in my bones it's that Holy Ghost Fire it shut up in my bones it's just like fire shut up in my bones oh it's that Holy Ghost Fire and it's shut up in my bones it's just like fire fire fire shut up in my bone well it's that Holy Ghost Fire and it shut up in my bone [Music] hallelujah [Music] hallelujah yes Glory somebody say praise the Lord hallelujah that's the way it is the fire shut up in our bones praise the Lord and your sister April you wrote that song you wrote that song you didn't write it but thanks for sharing it with us praise the Lord she's she's singing at the beginning of the service like we do at the end we're ready to Worship the Lord amen praise God we're going to have the choir come God bless you may be seated the choir prepare and they going to take a minute and I just like to say about songs and worship I you know I don't want to be controversial but you know I think when we worship and y'all listen to me don't look at the choir I I think we should have the freedom to worship I don't think we have to borrow from anybody and I want to thank the Lord for songs that are inspired by the Holy Ghost and sometimes the vessel that actually ends up singing it that we hear it from isn't a great vessel but what I like is if it's been inspired by the Holy Ghost whether it was 50 years ago 100 years ago or whether it is uh just you know two years ago if it's a song inspired in the word of God and inspired of the Holy Ghost but you take a vessel that has got a new birth and they're singing that song it makes all the difference in the world and boy you put that together and I think that's an inspiring thing and so I think that we should be able to be free not have restrictions to our worship I think we ought to be able to just worship and everybody worships different can you say Amen there shouldn't be any a certain category we put us in I think we should just give our hearts and worship to him whether that be weeping or whatever it is some people shout but we should never isolate it just a certain thing and God can be glorified in some of the quietest moments as well how many would raise your hand God can receive worship from your heart in some of the quietest moments and then sometimes it's just time to just really be exuberant and lift our voices to him and our hearts to him and uh when you have a song like sister April just saying it expresses what's in our hearts and we just going to express that to God it it's wonderful praise the Lord thank you sister April again praise the lord well Kenny takes a long time to prepare and uh so but you know he is the music man so uh we'll give him time to do that praise the Lord who need this mic anybody for [Music] [Music] why would I worry when Giants come calling my name my God is so much bigger than troubles I face and why would I hunger for power or riches or fame oh cuz my God is so much better than all of these things so I won't be [Music] shaken I won't be moved my God is faithful his promises true so I speak to the mountain oh it's time to move cuz my God Is Bigger better stronger greater than you my enemies scatter cuz they know the battle is done my God is stronger the victory

my walk with Christ and I pray tonight that you'll get something out of this uh thought here verse one and verse two it says behold there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of the Lord un bethl and jobon stood by the altar to burn incense they cried against the altar in the word of the Lord in said of altar altar thus saith the Lord be Behold a child shall be born unto the House of David Josiah by name and upon the shall he offer the priests of the high places that burn incense upon there and men's bones shall be burnt upon thee all right let's have a word of prayer father we are grateful for the privilege and the opportunity to come and to worship you uh tonight and and um I know Lord that's being um maybe looked at the final service for this meeting but I pray wouldn't be the end I pray it would be the beginning for many God that would leave here on tomorrow going back to their churches getting ready to enter into a new year uh may we just spend a little time reflecting on all your goodness that you gave us throughout this year and uh Lord may we uh enter into the new year with expectations that you would be doing something so much greater uh in our hearts than in our lives we pray every ear that is here with hear the word that you would speak to each individual right where they need to be spoken to and may you get all the glory and all the honor out of the service hide me behind the cross I don't want to be seen but may Christ be on display tonight it's in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you you can be seated amen um we want to just take for a topic tonight born to destroy amen born to D destroying and um for me I um I I enjoy trying to help this generation see where you fit in the economy of God um if if if if I could just make it very plain every one of you have a purpose with God Amen whether it's behind the pull pit or not behind the pull pit whether is behind an instrument not behind an instrument wherever your your your part is in the body of Christ you play a very vital role amen uh in the economy of God I want you to understand that you do have purpose each one of you have purpose and I I love just trying to help this generation see uh themselves according to scripture I think it's important that sometimes you look into the mirror of the word or you even look into the mirror of the message and you can see that hey this was being spoken about me amen it's it's one thing for brother brandom to see himself in the scripture it's another thing for your pastor to be able to see himself in the scripture in the five-fold ministry but it's a whole different thing when you begin to recognize who you are in Christ and when you get that Revelation when you get that understanding it brings you to a place of being settled it brings you to a place where the enemy can cannot just upset you with anything because you know who you are in Christ you know God has a purpose for you hallelujah amen amen and here you know uh I I wanted to remind you all of something as we kind of get started uh there is a mighty Revival that has been promised to your generation glory to God I'm going to read it for you in a second but there's a mighty Revival that has been promised to to your generation I want to say this it is not a manufactured Revival we don't have to make anything happen amen we don't have to try to do anything to to to make God's word come to pass if God has spoken it amen then it's going to C it's come to come going to come to pass whether we believe it or not Hallelujah and there's something God has spoken over your generation that makes you a very special group of people hallelujah amen I want to um uh just mention the wheels of Prophecy they turn slow but yet they're always turning all right and uh one meeting one service amen one youth retreat Hallelujah uh maybe one service at your local church at some point in time you are going to step right into this prophecy blessed be the name of the Lord amen your failures can't stop you from fulfilling this prophecy all right watch it now and and I want to I want to just kind of uh maybe uh say something that will hopefully strike our faithful tonight I know as as I read this in Ephesians Church age in a little bit as we read this this is a prophecy I believe about this generation and um and and I want to just say this amen if this is not the generation then tell me when is that generation going to come amen if it's not you that's going to fulfill this then tell me who is going to fulfill it amen and if it's not here then tell me where will it be fulfill because I simply want to be a part of all that God is doing in this generation here in the Ephesians Church age brother Brandon makes a statement to us and I want you to just catch this very carefully is uh explaining the the first couple chapters in The Book of Revelation here in the church AG book uh and he's explaining Revelation 2:4 he makes some comments this is his commentary amen for this and uh so here you know Revelation 2:4 says nevertheless I have somewhat against thee because thou Hast left thy first love it says to understand this you must realize that the spirit is not speaking to the the original Saints of Ephesus alone Hallelujah this message is to the entire age which lasted about 120 years its message then is to all generations in that span all right it says Now history here's the issue history keeps repeating itself Amen in the generations of Israel we see Revival in one generation only to see the fires fading in the next in the third Generations in in the third generation ambers may be glowing slightly but in the fourth there may be no vestage whatsoever of that original flame and I want to just hold that thought right there just for a second keep that on the screen let's see what brother brandom's trying to tell us in the first generation there is a mighty Revival Hallelujah and and what we have to look at let's count it from a prophet when God sent a prophet into to amen the Earth and and just all the meetings and all the services that we hear we hear the power of God moving God vindicating his Prophet we see and hear about the supernatural in his ministry What a Mighty move of God took place when the prophet was here on Earth amen the first generation amen he tells us that the fires amen are um I mean Revival fires are burning Amen in that generation however the Next Generation his sons would come along and in that generation the fires would start to fade hallelujah amen and and and then I have to put in my generation I would be considered a part of this third generation and uh in that third generation it's Embers glowing slightly now here's what happens in the fourth generation in your generation amen there says there's no vestage whatsoever of that original flame it was in your generation Hallelujah that we had a group of people rise up and begin to to declare differently about the message amen there were there were some that begin to just criticize brother Brandon for all these things this it's your generation that all kind of stuff hit the internet and it wasn't true at all a lot of people get tricked by what they see on the internet anybody can put anything on the internet and let me let me just drop this off for you if you're going to try to find out whether this message is right or not don't search the internet because that's not what the Bible tells you to do the Bible says search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they are them that testify of me so if you want to find out whether the message is right or not search the scriptures in your generation there was no vestage whatsoever of the original flame now let me tell you when you look at this quote from that angle that is a very very Bleak condition but the good thing about this quote it does not stop there the next slide says this Hallelujah then God this is in the fourth generation then God lights the fire again so when I say you are the generation that should be expecting a mighty move of God not something that you have to manufacture it's something that God has promised in our generation we've seen the worst but now we're preparing to see the best of God then God lights the fire again and the same process is repeated it's simply praise God I love this I love just reading this over the young people I know amen uhh just where to set your expectations God has promised to do something special in your generation if not you who if not here where if not now when look at what what the prophet says he says then God lies the fire again and the same process is repeated it is simply the manifestation of the truth that God has no grandchildren salvation is not passed on by natural birth anymore than is there any truth to Apostolic secession it isn't in the word you start out with truly Born Again Believers and when the next Generation comes along they're no longer just plain Christians but they have taken a denominational name and are now Baptist methodists Etc that is exactly what they are to they are not Christians you have to be born of the will of God not the will of man to be saved but these folks are coming together now by the will of man I don't say that some of them aren't right with God not for a minute do I say that but the original fire has died down they're not the same anymore the original fire has died down but I'm here to let you know it's in your generation where the original fly fire is lit again and let me tell you it's not a preacher lighting it it's it's not it's not your favorite preacher lighting the fire again it's not it's not uh some special meeting that you got to go to to have the fire lit again amen the fire is lit because God likes it again God does it so you you ought to be under expectation wherever you are God is about to light the fire again I believe the process has already be done amen the Bible says in John 10ap 10 says the thief cometh not but for to steal and to kill and to destroy I am come Jesus says I am come that they might have life and they might have it more abundantly now you know when we look at you know this uh the subject of Born to destroy we look back in the Old Testament and that was a wonderful game that they were playing there uh where you had to kind of choose which size I think I would have been out really fast cuz which right left which way I go I mean you all did a really good job with that but uh but in the Old Testament when we look back at some of the uh Believers in that time period they fought physical battles they fought physical battles there were physical Wars that they had that they endured but here in the New Testament in our day it becomes a spiritual battle hallelujah amen and I would have to say the spiritual battles is a probably harder amen than the physical battles amen we have to go through so much in this generation brother Paul brought this out on the um on the very first day some of the challenges that the young people have these are almost like spiritual conditions that you're fight fighting loneliness rejection um uh the standing for the standards that we believe in this is spiritual right he also mentioned mental health spiritual things that you are coming against but God has giv you power to even overcome the spiritual battles hallelujah amen amen I I want to just make it very plain you're not you weren't born to be destroyed by loneliness you were not born to be destroyed by rejection you were not born to be destroyed amen by mental health but you're you were born to overcome these things all right look at this look at what amen um I want to just I was I was as I was just putting my notes together I said down and say the Lord just kind of gave me a little scripture to kind of add to this when we talk about spiritual battles and last night brother Samuel came right up and read the scripture that I inserted in my notes I wanted to read it again 2 Corinthians chapter 10 this is the spiritual battle that we're in amen 2 Corinthians chap 10:3 it says for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal but Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds Hallelujah if you're going to defeat the Devil in the S you're going to have to use the word of God and let me tell you something the word of God is the best weapon you could ever have when Jesus was on the earth and Satan attacked him with those three wild attacks he did not use any Supernatural power to defeat the enemy but what Jesus used was it is written he kept telling the devil it is written you go back in Deuteronomy you'll find exactly where it was written if you are going to defeat your enemy in the upcoming year you got to have to know what is written praise God you got to use the word to defeat your enemy it's the most powerful weapon that God has put at your disposal use the word of God for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God and bringeth into captivity with mental health you actually have to bring into captivity your thoughts and that's not anything your pastor has to do for you that's what you do for yourself by amen reading the word of God listening to the word of God hearing the word of God you bring into captivity those thoughts that that enemy is trying to give you it says bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ and having a Readiness and and I like this I love this part having a Readiness to Revenge all Disobedience I want to just pause there just for a second you know we talked about that this morning how you know we we have a a generation of of of of children that are disobedient to parents unthankful Unholy incontinent however you know if you find yourself in that condition this morning I I want you to take courage that God has given you something you're leaving this meeting with something where you can have revenge on your Disobedience you can actually have revenge on your Disobedience let your parents see that there was a change there the money that they invested for you to come if they paid for you it did not go in vain have revenge on Disobedience look at this and having in Readiness to Revenge all Disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled spiritual battles that we fight Jesus spoke something in Luke chap 4 verse 18 Jesus spoke these words it says the spirit of the Lord is upon me because Heath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he have sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at Liberty them that are bruised verse 19 to preach the acceptable year of the Lord and and and and I like this you know what Jesus saying these are all spiritual conditions that people are facing see it's not a this is not a physical war that we're in but it's a spiritual war that we are under glory to God and here when he says amen preach the gospel to the poor this is not people without any money in their pocket these are people that pour in their Spirit some some situation some circumstance has happened and it caused them to get down in their Spirit but it's the gospel that lifs you up into a Victorious position he also says this amen he sent me to heal the brokenhearted and and and and what this is is is it's it's the Brokenhearted means people that have been overwhelmed by grief or disappointment Hallelujah he sent me to heal the brokenhearted and and we got a couple people uh in Scripture that we can look at but one in particular was the brothers that were on the road to emus they were brokenhearted they thought for sure that Jesus would come and do certain things and it didn't go the way that they thought it was supposed to go so they were brokenhearted on their way back to their old churches and Jesus had to stop amen the Bible says he was a stranger that just appeared as they were walking on the road to emus and what he did Hallelujah he didn't use any Supernatural power first what he did was take them through the scriptures he began to reveal to them did not this Jesus fulfill this and did not this Jesus fulfill that did not this Jesus they had no idea they were talking to Jesus but when he got behind closed doors Hallelujah after they had got encouraged by the word of God they invited him to to come in and come behind the closed doors please stay with us Jesus don't go anywhere please come and stay when he got behind closed doors this is when he worked his Supernatural power he began to break bread in only a way that Jesus could break bread and when they saw him break bread he disappeared they realized he was risen but what encouraged him it wasn't the supernatural first that comes after the revelation of the word we got to be settled on the word see he he brought healing to the broken heart he sent me to heal the brokenhearted he brought it through the word you know if you go back to the very first day brother brother Paul was taking us back to Psalms 1 and and reading that and showing how you know how you become stable how you become stable it's it's it's all applying the word of God watch this he also said that uh Jesus said he was coming to preach Deliverance to the captives and a captive is a person who has been taken prisoner amen and and and maybe it's not by their own will they've been taken prisoner some of Y all uh I'm sure amen the enemy has treding to take you prisoner for the entire year this year but somehow you made it to these meetings by the grace of God you're here amen and and we just kept hearing this theme as as uh as the Lord was using Brother Browning it's not our failures that God is looking at you may even get up from these meetings and you may go right into the next year you may fall again but don't look at your failure look at God's promise that he's given to you there is coming a time that you will not fall anymore you're going to get you're going to get victory over that that thing is not here to destroy you you will destroy it and and and I'm here to tell you you were born to destroy it here I want you to stay with me here it says uh you know a pre prisoner amen preach Deliverance to the captive captive is a person who's been taken prisoner and it's against their own will Legion was a man like that that was taken into prison it was against his own will now I need you to understand how Legion got into the condition he was in how did this man get 2,000 demons in him what happened to this man how I mean it's not you know young people you don't just go out there and do something in 2,000 demons entering you just like that it doesn't happen like that but brother brandom tells us what happened this man was asked the question and and he decided to lie with the answer and when he lied with the answer he said a demon stepped into him and then he tells another lie and another demon steps into him and then he tells another lie and another demon then he takes a drink and another demon then he takes a smoke and another demon before before you know the man is filled with 2,000 demons but it all came from telling One Lie but I want you to understand even though that man was in that condition as bad as it was away from his family kicked out of his house away from his family Jesus saw it necessary to go to the other side to bring Deliverance to that one man it shows you the value of one soul to the Lord Jesus and if the Lord Jesus would go across a stormy sea to rescue one man what would he do for you tonight there another beautiful thing I love about the story when Legion got set free those demons when they when they when they saw Jesus coming the demons asks says hey we don't want to go into the abyss but let us go into the swine and Jesus said sure you can go to the swine and here's the beautiful point that I like if demons can get their prayer answered I don't know if you heard it if demons can get their prayer answered what about Sons and Daughters of [Applause] God you should not leave here with that that type of thought in your mind that my prayer was not a demon got his prayer 2,000 demons got their prayer answered he won't he won't forget about you I can tell you that much right now preach Deliverance to the the captives he also said recovering of sight to the Blind and and I love this because if you're recovering sight that means somebody used to be able to see but they lost their eyesight somebody used to be able to see the truth but they lost their eyesight but Jesus comes to rec cover sight to the blind don't give up on anybody these are promises that we have in the scripture amen the other one that says he come to set at Liberty them that are bruised and and you know uh brother brother brother Browning as he went through Georgie Carter you're talking about a person being bruised a person that amen probably uh you know with what she was a piano player but going to piano practice her her uncle takes advantage of her rapes her terrible situation for her to be in and she develops this condition but yet God was send his Prophet right down to mil toown in order to pray for this young lady and when she got delivered Hallelujah she went out with her hands lifted praising God but went right back to the piano the very thing she might have amen she might despise I don't want to play the piano no more but she said no I go right back to the piano and I offer my praise to of God you're talking about somebody that was bruised but they were set at Liberty and I don't believe God allowed brother brother uh brother Browning to share that with us because he knows that there's might be somebody here that's been bruised bruises happen on the inside before they show on the outside before you see the mark on the outside there's something going on in the inside and and and what happens with people in their bruise something happens spiritually something happens mentally they get discouraged before it starts showing up on the outside but he comes to set at Liberty the Lord Jesus does this he comes to set at Liberty those that have been bruised the last thing he does is to preach the acceptable year of the Lord and that is nothing more than the Year of Jubilee and I love that because we understand that whenever the gospel s the gospel sounds you can enter into Jubilee right then you don't have to wait 49 years you don't have to wait 50 years you can enter your Jubilee as soon as you hear the gospel sound soon as God speaks to your condition you can accept your Jubilee brother Jack you don't know what I just did last night it doesn't matter have you heard the Jubilee trumpet sound if you hear the Jubilee trumpet sound for you you you no longer go back to that lifestyle drop whatever you were doing praise God you might have to delete some telephone numbers from your phone you might not be able to finish that text that you were about to send Hallelujah you might not be able to send that DM that you were going to send you can delete all that drop all those things behind you and enter into the Jubilee that God has for [Applause] you brother Brandon makes a statement in the message the infallible proof of the Resurrection says now when God promised a royal seed that would come forth as a savior he says it's been the work of God's enemy the devil to try to destroy that seed all the way down says the first thing when the righteous son was born Abel and the unrighteous was born Cain first he slew Abel thinking he was getting that righteous seed for he was standing there when God promised the Everlasting Earthly judgments upon the people and upon the serpent and upon the ground he promised through the woman would come a seed and this seed would bruise the Serpent's head and the serpent fought at that seed all down through the age and he's still fighting it that's why you're in the battle that you're in it's Amen Satan realizes Satan realizes who you are you may not realize who you are but Satan realizes who you are you are a daughter and a son of God Satan realizes that so he fights it says he's still fighting it he goes on he says then when he slew Abel he thought he got it because he destroyed the only righteous part of the seed then God raised up Seth to take his place a beautiful type of the death of Christ and the resurrection of Christ and then uh and and then he thought that he had him when he got the prophets he thought he had him when he got John but when he finally slew the righteous seed and he was buried on the third day God raised him from the dead the Lord Jesus he thought he had him but when he rose again he realized he had more trouble on his hands Satan has always been after the Royal seat now here in the Bible amen 1 John 3:8 we want to re read a scripture here in 1 John 38 it says this he that committeth sin is of the devil for the devil sinth from the beginning for the for this purpose Hallelujah since the devil's been sinning from the beginning for this purpose the Son of God was manifested what was the purpose of Jesus coming it wasn't just Amen to uh uh to go to a Manger amen and we all hear the Christmas story and and we just fall in love with the baby Jesus that was not the simple reason that he came Hallelujah it wasn't just to work miracles while he was on the earth amen uh he went to a the cross and wasn't just to go to a cross and die hallelujah hallelujah but when he rose again he changed everything for mankind am amen and here the purpose that Jesus came the scripture says the Son of God was manifested I like this that he might destroy the works of the devil the reason Jesus came amen is so he could destroy the works of the devil the reason Jesus has come into you is so that you also can rise up and destroy the works of the devil not be defeated by the work works of the devil destroy the works of the devil you were born to destroy this word destroy in this scripture I looked at it in the Hebrew or the Greek Lexicon and it means to ruin or demolish I wonder if there's a group of young people amen that can be honest with yourself I'm tired of going through the cycle that the enemy has had me on for this for this this this entire year amen I'm tired of the up and down in my life I'm I'm tired that I don't want to go into the next year with that same Devil with that same problem if there's any young people that feels that way I'm here to tell you tonight that God has allowed you to come into this Earth so you can demolish you can destroy you can ruin the plans of the enemy Hallelujah that's the very purpose for you to have the Holy Ghost so you can destroy it it's one thing when we call on the Lord Jesus and he comes to destroy but it's a whole another thing when you begin to chop Philistines and you begin to defeat them your your own self it's a whole different story Hallelujah when we get around the table in heaven all of us that have a testimony we can tell brother random say it's not God God can't uh pull you through and push you through amen and then stand on the other end and say blessed is he that overcame what did you overcome you he pulled you through he pushed you through how did you overcome what did you actually do to overcome so you have to develop your own testimony so you got to have to get back to the word yourself and get strength from the word yourself and you can say I I stood on the word of God I stood on this promise and when Satan came I said it is written and when I did that Hallelujah I got victory over the devil it's not just a feeling it's not just an emotion yes that could come but first it's a revelation of the word and your position in the word destroyed means to ruin or demolish I just feel like the Holy Ghost is going to ruin Satan's plans for your life in the upcoming year demolish those plans for your life in the upcoming coming year no I'm not I'm not going back to what I used to be amen I didn't come to the retreat just to say I came to the retreat I come to get something from God and whether I feel it or not I still got it that's right this destroy also means to loose any person or thing tied down or fastened this word destroy is to loose any person that's or thing that's tied down or fast if you've been tied down by the enemy the word of God comes to loose you brother randam says he's been trying to destroy that Royal seat ever since uh Cain and Abel he been trying Satan's been trying to destroy the Royal seat we he told us that he tried to destroy them Jesus and we know at the birth of our Lord Joseph and Mary had to travel uh back to their their their native land and their native City in order to have the baby because of some edict that was passed down by the ruler of that day and and here Mary is in her third trimester probably one of the most sensitive times for a woman to be traveling and she's pregnant expecting a baby here she's in the third trimester but asked to go back to this this native Native city of Nazareth go back there and she has a travel on the back of a donkey my God think about how hard this was but you know what because of Jesus purpose to come to the Earth and destroy the works of the devil God had to watch over Mary as she was traveling on the back of a donkey I want to tell you something because you have also been ordained by God to destroy the works of the devil God has been watching over you some of you death should have took you out this year an accident that you might have had death should have took you but God watched over you you have a purpose your purpose is simply to destroy the works of the devil Jesus amen uh uh the the the Satan tried to destroy Jesus at his birth also we know that uh when uh Herod heard amen about the Christ child being born he also sent out of edict that he was going to try to kill all the children two years old and under Satan was trying to destroy that Royal seat when Jesus went on the stormy sea to go across the other side Satan swore that he would drown him in the boat but his spoke peace be still Satan trying to destroy the Royal seat even at the cross Satan thought that he got the victory but according to First Corinthians 15 and 26 hallelujah amen The Last Enemy that shall be destroyed is death and when Jesus rose again he destroyed the works of the enemy that same power that Rose Christ from the grave that same power is dwelling inside of you you're not here to be defeated by anything the enemy has to offer but you've been born for a purpose you've been born for a reason you had to come in this generation and your purpose is to destroy destroy the works of the enemy Satan has tried to destroy God's seed we see it amen we saw in Abel Seth took his place brother brandom said that was a type of the Resurrection also he tried to do it in Moses when Moses was born Moses was hid for three months by his parents and then he had to be let go by his parents and pushed out into the river amen the N River and as Moses went out there into that River what a beautiful story Hallelujah as as his parents released him to the Nile River God orchestrated that not one snake not one alligator nothing would come against Moses while he was out there in the river if God protected Moses on the river God has been protecting you also in your River of Life Moses got down into the house there of pharaoh is Pharaoh's daughter takes some amen and and I just love the way God works when Pharaoh daughter takes men Moses his sister was the Spy watching what was happening to the the little little basket and when she saw that Pharaoh's daughter uh had uh had Moses she says do you need a a nurse do you need a a mother to come take care of this baby for you do you need somebody that can help help you and assist you with the baby she said yes I need somebody she went running back to her house she says Mama they need a babysitter for the baby and do you realize the way God does it he blessed Moses mama with a job inside of Pharaoh's Court to take care of her own baby and to be paid for it nobody can do things like our God can here Satan is trying to destroy it but God is using it as a blessing he tried to destroy the Hebrew boys when he threw them in the fire he tried to destroy Daniel in the Lion's Den but God brought him out he tried to destroy the entire nation of Israel when David amen was just a Shepherd watching over sheep but one day he shows up to bring his brothers some food and as he's bringing food there to his brothers he hears this boast from this Giant Goliath says you know what we every everybody don't have to die just send one man out here and if I defeat him then you all serve us for the rest of your days and but if if if he defeats me then we'll serve y'all let me tell you something never try to make an agreement with the devil because he'll never keep his side of the bargain David heard it David says who is this uncircumcised Philistine that's coming against the armies of the Living God who is this man David was willing to go into battle and and I and I like this because as David prepared to go to battle amen and we all know the story that he defeated Goliath but you know as he was preparing to go to battle Saul says David why don't you take my armor why don't you take this and why don't you do that and why don't you do this and and and and I thought now if Saul was so confident in his armor why did not Saul take that same armor and go fight Goliath see Saul wanted to Glory for the battle but he didn't want to go out and do the battle I think we have some young people that's willing to go out and do battle we don't just want glory for we want to get out and actually have a battle we want to show the devil that we are victorious that we are more than conquerors through Christ Jesus no we have a group of young people that's not going to run from the devil but they'll run to the trial they'll they'll face the next year with courage knowing that God will give them the victory in it David went out there and took his five stones in his sling and he took the giant down and then not only took the giant down but took the Giant's sword and cut off his head with his sword what a mighty God we serve David was raised up for a purpose David was raised up to destroy my God Amen uh I I I I want to just go back to our scripture that that we we read here in First Kings amen chapter 13 when you look at amen this passage it was uh a prophecy of a of a young baby that would be born by the name of Josiah and uh what we see is a we see a problem right at the very first verse where it says behold there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of the Lord unto bethl and jerob stood by the altar to burn incense jerbo happened to be the leader amen at this time the the Kingdom of Israel was splitting he was leading and um and here he had a couple tribes that were following him and uh and in this he built a altar or he built amen a sanctuary for the people to come into him to worship say don't go back to Jerusalem and worship because if you go there your hearts might actually turn and you might want to start uh uh uh you might want to join up with the other group but but and and rather than you join up with that other group rather you're going back to the place that God established for you to go worship let's just build these altars here he build these false places of worship hallelujah amen and and and jbam amen as he's going there and he's taking the sacrifices to this this false place of worship a prophet shows up on the scene and this is a young Prophet that shows up and in verse two what happens he cried out against the altar in the word of the Lord and said oh altar altar thus saith the Lord Behold a child shall be born into the house of David Josiah by name and upon thee upon thee shall he offer the priest of the high places that burn incense upon thee and men's bones shall be burnt upon thee now when this Prophet Cried Out amen and and gave his prophecy about Josiah coming uh it said Josiah is going to destroy this that you all built up there's a young baby coming one day his name will be Josiah and he will destroy what you all just did and here you know when uh uh when when when when jobal hears this prophecy he reaches out to try to grab amen this Prophet that spoke to him and his arm withered up right there on the spot now here's the sad part that I find is that when when he reached and grabbed this prophet and his arm with it up what he did it say please pray for me that my arm would be restored and the prophet prayed and his arm was restored but you know after he received that great miracle his heart did not change and here's here's here's here here here here's the problem often times people can come into Services they can experience the power of God they can experience the presence of God but in the inside their hearts do not change what good is it to experience the presence of God if your heart is not going to change Josiah uh uh this young Prophet that prophesies of Josiah he took off running and as I was sharing with my uh my uh my my my my my my uh group this morning amen that you know in the in the Book of Ezekiel it talks about when they would come to church they' come in through one gate and have to leave through another and if someone come through the south gate make sure they left through the north gate if you come through the north gate make sure you leave through the South and I said the reason that they had to do this is because when you come into the house of God you were supposed to leave different than the way you came and this the same thing that happened here in First Kings 13 this young man could not go back the same way he came and and I'm telling you young people don't leave this youth retreat the same way you came be determined to be different this young man left the the the sad part about about the story of this young Prophet is that he got tricked by an older Prophet a older Prophet heard about the prophecy and he sent his sons down there and he says hey go get that man and tell him to come to my house and God had told that young Prophet don't eat with anybody don't fellowship with anybody just go give the prophecy and leave go home but he got tricked the the the the older Prophet went and visit said look God told me to tell you to come to my house now young people I'm saying this and this is very important for you in this generation Hallelujah I just sit here this morning and told you how you have to respect your elders but remember the first the first part of that verse honor your parents obey your parents in the Lord because you're living in a generation where even pastors are walking away from the word of God and you can't follow a man as he leaves the word brother brandom says when a man leaves the word you leave the man [Applause] the word has to be first and foremost in your life that's right and if you can't take a take an example of this young man in the scripture he he he followed this older Prophet back to his house sat down in his house they prepared a meal he sat down and ate enjoyed the meal and while he was eating the old Prophet rose up and said thus saith the Lord because you did not follow God a lion will be waiting for you as you're going home and the young Prophet after he prophesied this great thing about Josiah this young Prophet lost his life because he did not fully obey God years later Josiah comes on the scene I'll just tell you where you can find it but in second cor 2 Kings 23 you'll see where he destroyed so many altars his prophecy was being fulfilled this this young young prophet's prophecy was being fulfilled Jeremiah Was destroying so many altars and one of the things that Jeremiah uh I'm sorry Josiah uh uh destroyed was even this the temples that Solomon built for his his his ungodly wives Josiah had a a serious Revival in the midst of Israel he destroyed everything I want to tell you something Josiah his purpose he was an eight-year-old King but his purpose for coming to the Earth was to destroy destroy all the false altars that were built oh you young people you young people don't realize how special you are in God's economy you were raised in a generation the fourth generation where there was no vestage of the original Fame but yet you are the group Waiting for God to light the fire again and I'm here to encourage you destroy every altar that is not built up to honor God don't compr romise with them destroy you were born to [Applause] destroy first John 38 says this again he that committeth sins of the devil for the devil sinth from the beginning for this purpose the Son of God was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil brother Brandon makes a a couple statements in the sermon spoken word is the Original Seed it says God is taking the elect out of the Pentecostal church that hybrid pulling it out finishing up the word and it's got to be so close until the word itself will blend with this word there Comes The Headstone crying Grace Grace Amazing Grace The Headstone here you are like this see on there see how uh how way way uh way wide down here it keeps getting closer and closer the ministry after a while here comes here a Luth here's Luther justification Justified Here Comes Wesley Sanctified bunch here come Pentecostals restoration of the gifts now God is taken from there honing out a bunch to make a Ministry just exactly like that word there because it's got to fit with the word there's the bride take her up let's keep going going it says now Christ was manifested to destroy the works of the devil he says you believe that he says now I can't explain all this I'm just going to go through it just quickly now hit the high place so you won't stay too long Christ was manifested to destroy the works of the devil is that right it says you all believe that that's that's uh what was he God's word which destroys the works of the hybrid Christ was the word which destroys the works of the hybrid the devil is that right he he has uh he was done uh he he was done or born to do that he was born to be that to destroy the works of the devil but the prophet didn't leave it on Jesus the next statement says now his body that's who is the body of Christ you are the body of Christ now his body is to do the same no you are not supposed to be defeated by mental health no you're not supposed to be defeated by loneliness you're not supposed to be defeated by any of these things that the enemy is throwing in your direction amen you were born you were created to destroy these things [Applause] somebody else say their testimony is I'm I I've been overcome by this no my testimony is I overcame [Applause] it I love the statement that brother Zion was making there it says you know you're you're you're not who your mistakes say that you are you're not your Mist whatever your mistake says that's not who you are you are who God says you are that's amen and if there's anybody that made a great mistake you look at look in the Bible you look at what Adam and what Eve did Adam willfully went out and committed sin willfully willfully did these things but you know what in in the midst of all that him losing his status or his position in the Garden of Eden he he had got kicked out him and Eve got kicked out but it did not change his position as a Son of God when you look through the genealogies in the Book of Luke you'll see amen it say uh uh Adam who was a Son of God it did not change his status his failures did not change his status your failures would not change your status the body the body now Jesus came to Earth to destroy the works of the devil but now the body has to do the same brother Ram says now it's bodies to do the same because the body is head and body is together that's right if Christ is the head was the word his body has to be the same thing as his head was that's right a church of the word born of the word virgin born from the word not a denomination now virgin born from the word the way the body operates is by the head that's right now here we have a commission we have to destroy the works of the devil and I'm and I'm just here to tell you somebody is going to manifest what the prophet just said there's going to be a group of young people in this generation that would say I am one of them that is destroying the works of the devil I'm not here to be destroyed by The Works of the devil I'm here to ruin demolish destroy that's my job that's my purpose brother random makes a statement Amen Let me just uh uh I want to uh yeah this is in the message exhortation exhortation of Divine Healing it says this now it says we know many Brethren has different ways the main principle way of Divine Healing is preaching the word so people could hear Faith cometh by hearing and hearing of the word and they preach Divine Healing and prove it by the scriptures that Jesus Christ died for our sickness and when he died for when he died for our sins and that is true I believe that's undisputable with the Bible scholars that that Jesus when he come to destroy the works of the devil that sickness is directly the work of the devil so if Jesus came to destroy the works of the devil he came to destroy sickness what about his body when you see one of your brothers or sisters amen going through in their body do you realize you as a son a daughter of God with the baptism of the Holy Ghost you can lay hands on the sick and they will recover you don't have to go get the pastor or the Deacon you can do that yourself you were born when you see it destroy it take it out don't let the devil have any space at all oh you know there's a a statement here and and brother Bram talked about even Joshua how Joshua had to go into certain cities when they were going to the promised land they had to wipe out everything he said g i mean God said don't even let the babies live when it was time for Destruction everything had to go don't even let the babies live he says because if you let the babies live they'll grow up to be adults one day and they'll create problems Hallelujah don't e don't let baby devils live I don't care how I mean it's just a little sickness just a don't let baby devils live destroy baby Devils here a statement that was made destroy your enemy before your enemy destroys you brother Brandon makes this statement here I um I want to just uh uh catch it in in Saul Saul Saul was raised he was supposed to be a king that was going to destroy the am malachit but what Saul failed to do and and and God told him to go wipe out he I got a problem with these amalekites go wipe them all out Saul I need you to follow my instructions my my direction wipe them all out Saul went he says you know what we're going to let some of the the best animals live and we're going to let the King live and we're going to let this and and and and Samu had to come say wait a minute what is all this that I hear didn't I tell you to destroy wasn't that your commission don't don't compromise with any Devils when God has giv you commission to destroy don't compromise with it I don't know what you're going through tonight but I know God has a word for you and whatever it is you have to raise up and you have to destroy it you have the authority you have the power it's been given to you by the Holy Ghost you can put the devil under your feet Samuel says Saul what are you doing why why did you make all these compromises why why why these animals why do I hear the blading of these animals what's going on here he says well I was just saving him for the sacrifice and I was doing this and I was doing that and then God had to speak a word a rebuke in 1st Samuel 15:23 Rebellion is the sin of Witchcraft and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry because thou has rejected the word of the Lord he hath also rejected thee from being King he lost his POS his position because he did not destroy later on we find out because he didn't kill all the amalekites when Samuel when Saul died he fell on a sword but he didn't die on his sword what happens that a little amalaki came along and says he says look I I don't want the the enemy to find me like this would you please take my life so that the enemy does not do great things against me and Malachi says yeah I'll take your life took Saul out took the crown took everything and took it to David and told David the story this is what happened I'm the one that killed Saul and here's the problem if Saul would have killed the amalekites he would have never been killed by an amalaki destroy your enemy because Satan's job is to steal kill destroy destroy your enemy before your enemy destroys you let me uh give you just one more here and I'll find my way out tonight oh my there's one character in Scripture that we're all very familiar with this man was born on Earth for one specific purpose but the only problem is that he kept getting his purpose all mixed up by getting involved with things that he should not have been involved with kept oh let me just let me just work with it just for a little bit this this this man he kept there were beautiful sisters in the church wonderful ladies they got dressed up for banquets they look really nice but this brother had a problem he never wanted to look at the sisters that was in his own Nation what he decided is to go after the sisters that were outside of the nation actually he went for the Sisters in the nation that he was born he was born to destroy and he constantly found himself down there asking his parents uh please go talk to her parents for me because this is the one that I want and his parents would be like would you why why we got beautiful sisters right here in the church why are you down there looking at these this she's not even a sister why are you down there looking at that lady so I just want to and let me tell you I can tell you why he wanted he had a a lust problem let's just get down right to the where the rubber meets the road he had a lust problem you see we go down there and first wife that he gets they they they they they they get her and says look we need to find out where his strength is what's going on with this guy Samson we need to know what's going on and and she was doing everything she can to try to get the secrets from Samson as to what was where your strength is and he come up with all kind of stuff he breaks away gives a riddle they can't get the riddle he does all kind of things that lady was working for the enemy his wife was working for the enemy not his not Delilah his first wife Samson should have known that any wife I take from down here let me just let me just drop this off for the young people this is why brother brandom tells us that under amen it's it's it's it's amazing how you all can quote it but in this generation we need young people that can live it not just quot [Applause] it Young Brother young sister I commend you those that will not go out and try to bring the Lila into the church and let me tell you Delilah we know she's represented as a woman in scripture but every person in here whether you're male or female you have a Delila that you deal with and I want to commend you young people even in loneliness that you refuse to go out and bring somebody else in that is not a Believer I want to commend you for that see you you have to be one to show that it can be done the right way and as you're showing that it's done the right way you know what you're doing you're destroying the work of the devil Samson found himself going back and forth back and forth into these conditions I remember the scripture tells us one time he went down there after he lost his first wife he went down there into a harlot's house what is Samson doing in a harlot's house because we have sons of God samsons today that find themselves in a harlot's house even in the midst of this when the Philistines surrounded him he comes out the harlot's house and he is he still has power to break free from the situation that he's in Samson should have not only broke free but he should have stayed free this year amen as you're as you're approaching the new year I I I I I I pray that some of you have broken free but in the next year stay free realize you have a purpose you're not supposed to be defeated by that thing that the devil keeps bringing in your life it's time for you to rise up and defeat your enemy destroy your enemy before your enemy destroys you Samson finally get gets to Lila he this lust Spirit he just cannot get over it he gets to Lila she's again working for the enemy this woman that he thinks he loves let me tell you something lust will play some really bad tricks on you he thinks he loves loves her and he there in her lap laying and she starts talking trying to get a secret what's where's your strength at Samson maybe he's telling about the Thousand Philistines that he beat down how he picked the gates up and put them on his back and and they couldn't get them maybe he's telling all them well you know St I just want to know where's your strength says if they bind me with seven green whisks that were never Dy then shall I be weak and be as another man and she said oh okay he fell asleep and she announces Samson the Philistines are upon thee hey this wasn't a game this wasn't a joke this this this this this this lady had every intention just like the devil has every intention of destroying you the lady that he So-Cal loved had every intention young ladies I said you know it might sometimes the rle is reversed sometimes you might not have uh uh her name might not be Delilah but maybe whatever his name is that the devil keeps sending you DMS through and he's not a believer whatever his name is it might not be Delilah his name might be [Laughter] delile but everybody has the lilas that they face and if you just keep giving up these secrets watch watch watch this every secret that he gave up got closer and closer to the truth to finally he gave her the truth the second time you know she says he says you you know you tricked me you trick me tell me where where your strength says oh if you bind me fast with new ropes that never were occupied then shall I be weak and be as another man Sam sending the Philistines upon you gets up breaks out of it and just shows all of his power all his might all his strength third one comes she said you just keep lying to me and she's crying oh all the emotions that now he's all tied up in the emotional part of this relationship say Samson you're embarrassing me I'm embarrassing you you're trying to kill me but he doesn't even talk with good sense anymore his reasoning Powers have been weakened he forgot what he was born for here he is now amen in situation it says now look I'm tired s you got to tell me the truth okay okay okay if you weaveth the Seven Locks in my head with a w did not be like any other man getting closer and closer to the truth Samson the Philistines up you gets up breaks through one more time oh Samson why did you embarrass me like this in front of everybody it's socalled love you know they have a say they have a saying that people sometimes are blinded by love actually I don't think you blinded by love I think you blinded by lust finally he agrees to telling he just opens up his heart and in judges 16117 he finally tells it the truth he says that he told her all his heart he said unto her there have not come a razor upon my head if I have been a Nazarite unto God from my mother's womb if if I be shaven then my strength will go from me and I shall become weak and be like any other man he finally told her his whole heart you know what she does with his whole heart she shaves his head causes him to lay down in her lap wakes him up when it's time for him to be destroyed this time she says Samson Philistines are upon you he woke up this time and went to swinging and doing everything and this time God wasn't with him and ended up in bondage so bad that they made sport of SEL Samson they took his eyes out he lost the ability to be able to see a man that was was was born was was was was put on Earth just to defeat Philistines now he's defeated by those Philistines I don't know sometimes you know I know when we when we read the story of Samson we hear the story of Samson often times we can identify with this character because we've gone through very similar situations whether with female or male here's the good news about this story wow Samson was bound wow he was in bondage this is when God be to move on him again somehow the Seven Locks begin to grow back wow he was bound but you know what samton come to a spot where he could also repent and when he finally got his heart right with God Samson could ask the little lad lead me to the pillar like what why you want to go to the pillars just don't ask any questions lead me to the pillars all the people making sport of Samson looking at him standing there in the pillars but they couldn't hear what he was saying out of his mouth CU God I know I failed you God I know that I was put on this Earth to destroy Philistines but now these Philistines are trying to destroy me but God I I got one more prayer in me anybody got one more prayer in them before they go into the next year just one more prayer one more time father I knew what my purpose was I was supposed to be here to destroy Philistines I'm sorry I failed you I'm sorry I I allowed amen these young ladies to keep coming in and out of my life I'm sorry that I did these things but but once more Lord if young people could have that same cry tonight once once more Lord I know what you've done for me at the beginning of the year but here I come to the end of the year and I know the struggles that I've had once more Lord Sam son was ready to do something that I hope that we're all ready to do Samson was ready to die with his enemy in our day we don't have to physically die but maybe some some of the the the the challenges God wants us to die to some of those challenges don't carry those things over into the next year but tonight is a good time to pray the same prayer that Samson prayed once more more Lord let me die with the Philistines and when he pushed the two pillars Samson killed more Philistines in his death than he did while he was alive God still got Glory out of Samson's life even in his death he was born to destroy and I'm here to tell you tonight Samson's not the only one Joshua's not the only one Jesus is not the only one Moses not the only one you are also born to destroy you're not born to be defeated by that I don't care what it is that the devil's had you bound with you are not born to be defeated by that you were born to destroy it amen you're born to destroy pornography born to destroy lust you're born to destroy sickness in your body you're born to destroy anything the devil can present born to destroy destroy your enemy before he destroys you let's pray father we thank you for your word it's the word that gives us Liberty it's the word that gives us freedom it's the word that gives us Deliverance father you know why this sermon had to go forth tonight only you know what your people are going through only you know what this year has been like for many of them but they've come they've heard your word and father we pray the spirit of God would come to bring amen Deliverance to the people Freedom this is what you told us that you you come to bind the Brokenhearted you come to set the captive free and father it's through your word that you do these things so father we're asking that you would just take control Lord even of this portion of the service we we don't have to manufact or anything that's not what we're trying to do but Lord we want to get to the heart of the matter we want to see you Lord we not just have a feeling or an emotion father and go back and and have the same old lifestyle but let a change really take place on the inside and let us be willing as Samson was willing to die with our enemy I pray Lord somebody would come Lord to us a a a place tonight where they will realize that you have given them the authority and the power to destroy that enemy that's been trying to destroy them tonight they can put their Stak down in the ground they can go free this is the time that the Jubilee trumpet is sounding for them I pray they would hear it they respond to it and go free because he who the son sets free is free indeed father we love you we thank you for speaking to our hearts it's in Jesus name we pray amen amen um the altar is always open we don't pull and push and do things like that to try to get people to the altar the altar is always open if you don't come to the altar I pray that you come to a spot in God tonight it would be complete and total surrender we've been hearing that throughout the weekend but I pray that tonight would be a night where you know what I'm coming to complete surrender I'm putting this thing under my feet tonight may be somebody's last warning whatever it is that you're dealing with whatever you've been fighting throughout the year tonight God wants to give you victory over that even when you go back to your rooms you know what you know sometimes we get and we just we have a lot of fun and games but you know you have a brother or sister there that's in that room that should be concerned about you spiritually that if you confess your faults to your brother or your sister that they would pray for you and you can experience Deliverance in your dorm room [Music] Our God will go wherever he needs to go to reach who he needs to reach we're going to sing something soft and I ask uh brother Gideon to come and and and help with some of the song leading and but I also wanted to say if you want to come here to the altar while we're worshiping feel free we'll pray with you tonight if you want to stay in your seat whatever you want want to do but you do what God is leading you to do destroy your enemy before he destroys you God bless [Music] you

you are God hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord hallelujah thank you Jesus Hallelujah I just want to say something we can go back and singing some songs I just wanted to say just moved in my spirit so much tonight because what in my what I desire is the depth of sincerity in young people and I know if they'll offer that to God there's nothing he would hold back from you it's all yours tonight I just wanted to testify while I was sitting there tonight and brother Jack reached a certain point he said he was going to close and there's something in my spirit I don't know what it was it just I said there's just still something more there's something missing or something unresolved and he was going to close and I just felt in my spirit I just said there's there's in talking about the enemy that we need to destroy before it destroys us I said I think there's still some youth here in the particular area sometimes of of lust and sexual sin and sexual mistakes or or even just a lustful spirit and I said it just seems like if if they don't really get a hold of God that enemy will destroy them so they need to destroy it I was just thinking though I said just seemed like there's a missing part it and he didn't close took his Direction into Samson and Delilah and that wasn't put in the Bible by accident that's a real real thing that takes place in the Temptation Of Satan that the enemy that Samson was called and purposed by God to destroy was now going to try to destroy him and I said Lord this is a move of God at the end that you're definitely needed to if you had some unfinished business to speak to our hearts this is this is what needed to be said and I'll just say thanks be to God because you know what I feel like like tonight when God goes that in that area and many areas he's went in he really loves you because he's saying there's something greater than your Rebellion there's something greater than your lust there's something greater than your mistakes and then the choir sings a song my God is how many believe he's greater he's there's something greater than our problems there's something greater than the mountain can you say amen amen and I I I stand just rejoicing tonight at the sincerity of repentance that's come in our hearts I want to see real change and you're sitting here tonight and you look at you say well somebody over there got something and I didn't don't think that way somebody over there shouted or they and praised God all of that is it's it's however but don't you dare let the enemy tell you that you didn't get something tonight cuz this wasn't for that person just that that rejoices and is more loud this this was God is here tonight he was here and visited us for every one of you tonight including myself Our God spoke to every one of us tonight and it's pretty it's pretty strong scriptures when he and he even read it tonight that our Rebellion is as the sin of winess witchcraft our stubbornness is as as idolatry but I want to tell the devil there's something bigger than our Rebellion there's something greater than our stubbornness I tell you in this day there has to be something bigger than that cuz there's a lot of stubbornness can you say Amen but that we serve a God that's bigger than any of our rebellion and you can Rebel all you want to you can resist turn down the invitation but God has got your number his love is greater than your Rebellion his love is greater than your mistakes I'm I'm here tonight it's not about Paula Fontaine or or Sam Browning or Barry coffee it's not about brother Jack there's a greater presence here than any of us could ever reach and it's got your number it knows your life it knows your house number it knows what you did last week it knows your mistakes that Spirit knows exactly what's in your life and yet he doesn't give up he doesn't withdraw himself he's here giving the invitation to you no matter what you've done his love is here saying I'm here to say I've got something greater for you so I want to sing it again and I I want to rejoice in the Lord tonight because his presence has done some mighty things how many raise I'm looking for real sincere change in my life I'm looking for real repentance in my life because I know that's a God can we got the God here tonight that created the worlds and came into chaos and and his word
