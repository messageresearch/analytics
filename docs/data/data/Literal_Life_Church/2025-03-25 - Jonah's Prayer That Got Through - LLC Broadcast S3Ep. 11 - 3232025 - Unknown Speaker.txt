Then Jonah prayed unto the Lord his God out of the fish's belly, and said, I cried by reason of my affliction unto the Lord, and he heard me. Out of the belly of hell, cried I, and thou heardest my voice. For thou hast cast me into the deep. In the midst of the seas, and the floods compass me about, all thy billows, and thy waves passed over me. Then I said, I am cast out of thy sight. Yet I will look again toward thy holy temple. So this is what he's feeling now, that the Lord has actually cast him out of his sight. And yet, even with that kind of discouragement and knowing the Lord had done it because of his rebellion or his running away from the Lord, he still said, "I'm gonna look. The Lord's cast me out of his sight." And so, I'm out of God's sight. At least is what he felt. We're never out of God's sight. But he felt like I'm so far for what I've done. And I'm in now in this fish the the the belly here and I I'm in a terrible state. But he's not gonna start looking stop looking toward the holy temple. Amen. That's the way we should be. Amen. It doesn't matter how low we get. We and we feel like we're cast out of the Lord's sight. We're not out of his sight, but we should always turn and look again. Verse five. The waters compass me about even to the soul. The depth closed me round about. The weeds were wrapped around my head. I went down to the bottoms of the mountains. The earth with her bars was about me forever. Yet hast thou brought up my life from corruption, the Lord my God. When my soul fainted within me, I remember the Lord, and my prayer came in unto thee into thine holy temple. They that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy. But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving. I will pay that that I have vowed. Salvation is of the Lord. And the Lord spake unto the fish. How many believes God can speak to animals? How many believe God can speak to anything? When he hears the cry of his people coming from and it makes his holy temple and his presence, he can speak to anything in your life. He can speak to the storm. He can speak to whatever it is and he can bring you out of it. And the Lord spake unto the fish and it vomited out in Jonah upon the dry land. And I want to title this tonight. Jonah's prayer that got through. His prayer got through. His prayer made it through. And it actually come from, brother Bram refers to about five miles down into the deep. I don't know how far it was. Uh but he says it was pretty deep in the ocean at the bottom cuz Jonah refers to it. And somehow he couldn't get out but his prayer got out. That's right. So it shows how powerful the prayer is of as a son and daughter of God. Even when they're in the state of running away from the presence of the Lord, there's something there that was something within Jonah that when he spoke it in the right position in the right thing, it was he couldn't get out, but his prayer got out some five miles below the ocean. If it goes that far, I don't know. But the thing is is that how that prayer made it through all that all the way to God. And as I was bringing it up, he didn't really deserve to pray at that time. He might not have felt that he had the worthiness to pray at that time. And so I want to I want to speak a little bit practically about our prayer tonight because there are hindrances to our prayer sometimes. But this is just an amazing uh just an amazing prayer. But it's amazing because it's set in a setting of a man who's actually being rebellious to God. He's a man that really don't deserve to pray. That's the way we we look at it. He said he doesn't deserve to bring bring anything before the throne of God. And I refer you to James. He said that confess our faults one to another and the prayer of faith shall save the sick. Confess your faults. And he says he he says Elijah was a man subject to like passions like we are. He had weaknesses like us and yet God heard his prayer. So So the prayer of a righteous man, the righteous man isn't perfect in his flesh, but he acknowledges God. He acknowledges his word. Can you say amen? Uh, in the last two or three years, I've loved preaching about Jonah. It's always nice to talk about somebody else's weaknesses instead of your own. But, you know, I I've been pretty rough in my preaching the last few years. Jonah is a type of all of us sometimes, and we all run from the Lord. We run from his presence. We run from uh uh responsibility sometime. We run from the word of the Lord when he gives it. We don't latch on to it sometimes right away. We come reluctantly because of our flesh. And uh but I look at his life. I look at how his life even ended after God gave him a victory and I say like boy, you know, you need to get your act together. That's the way I've said it. You you really need to get and as I've said, I think God could have chose someone else, but he couldn't choose someone else because he was a son of God. He was a predestinated son of God. And he maybe got out of his position sometimes. But when push come to shove, he reached inside of him and realized, I'm a son of God. and he brought who he was in the Lord out to his mouth in prayer and it somehow made it through. Hallelujah. And what I see in Jonah's life is that that that that great revelation for this hour, especially under the third pole. He that is in you. Greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world. Greater is he that was way deep down in Jonah than the situation he was in, the fish he was in. Greater, can you say amen? Brother Bam says, "Greater is he that was in Noah than the ark and the storm. Greater is he that was in Moses than all of Egypt's power." He kept emphasizing he that is in you. And Jesus said, "Greater is he that's in you that he that is in the world." So there's something deeply hidden down in a son of God that will always be greater, hallelujah, than the symptoms and the situations therein. Hallelujah. The problem is it gets smothered over. He that is in you gets smothered over sometimes with a lot of seaweed. Amen. That's the truth. All kinds of seaweed, all kinds of doubt, all kinds of uh you know, whatever it is, it it gets covered over so much that we forget. This isn't a surface gospel. This isn't a surface message. This goes deep and it reaches down into he that is in you. Right. That's right. That's the part God wants to work on. Amen. That's the part God's trying to draw out of you. We'll get to that more in a minute. But, you know, he sure seems backsliding to me. I've been run from him. But he was rebelling and running from the commission God had called him to do. And he becomes an example of us all. Brother Brandham said, "How many has ever ran from what God told you to do?" Just three of us. All right. H how many has ever ever got buried in your consequences from running from the presence of the Lord? That's right. Oh, yeah. All right, brother Brandham is right. Then how many then had God use you when you did obey and you got a victory out of it? How many's had that happen? That's what happened in chapter three. It's only four chapters to his life. Uh then how many got mad and still questioned God sometimes and lacked mercy and grace for others? How many's ever done that? The book of Jonah has four chapters. Chapter one, Jonah is running from God. Chapter two, Jonah is running to God. Chapter three, Jonah is running with God. Chapter four, Jonah is running ahead of God. So, Brother Bram says if if his life is a type of us all, we find our life in that. Can you say amen? And we've been all these things. We've had all these ups and downs. The man got mad because the Nvites repented. He turns against him. He goes in seclusion. He gets he gets out by himself. He's suicidal. He said, "Lord, just take me." He's angry. He's selfish. He doesn't look to others. He didn't even like the Gentiles. So God is I what I preached on Jonah is that though he was the son of God, God had a lot to work on on his pride and his prejudice, right? And his and his anger and his suicidal spirit and his depression. Yeah. And yet with all of that, God said, "That's my son." Yes. Amen. That's right. And tonight I'm preaching and he heard his son's prayer. Yes, he did. Amen. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. He heard his son's prayer. Yes, he did. Hallelujah. And he didn't deserve it. And so I'm thankful. So, you know, I want to look at the elements of his prayer tonight. This may seem very simple, but I want to look at the elements of Jonah's prayer that somehow this prayer got through. And remember, that's why his disciples, as you remember my service for a couple weeks ago, his disciples were asking, "Teach us to pray, Lord. Teach us to pray." Because his prayers had results. Right. That's right. The Jews were praying people. The Pharisees were praying people. The Jews, his disciples were praying men. What I know of the Jews, they're praying people, especially back then. But why is it they're asking Jesus, "Teach us to pray because his prayers were uh breaking up demon power." Hallelujah. His prayers were getting through to the father. His prayers were healing people. His prayers were delivering people. His prayers were getting through. His prayers were piercing the darkness. Uh it's an amazing thing that Jonah, his prayer rose out of the darkest, worst condition. When nothing else would help, when nothing else could help. Like the song says, when nothing else could help, love lifted me. Amen. He brought me out of the miry clay. That's what happened. He brought Jonah out. But what? Guess what got out first? His prayer got out. That's right. Amen. Because he couldn't get out by himself. Yes, sir. So, your prayer has to get out first. Yes. Amen. And then he he got him out. He got him out. And so helpless conditions, nothing else rose up except his prayer. Nothing else had resurrection power in it but his prayer. That's right. How many know that we could put down Jonah, and I've done that, but how many know that his he's the only prophet that Jesus referred to as a type of his life of resurrection? That's right. His life spoke of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. That's right. Amen. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Said I said to those Greeks or Jews, he said, "I'll give you a sign." He says, "It's the sign of Jonah." After three days, God brought him out of the uh the whale's belly and and God delivered him. His life is a sign of my resurrection. And that means Jonah's prayer had resurrection power in it. Jonah's prayer got him through to resurrection power to bring him out of that after 3 days. Amen. Hallelujah. His prayer, nothing else had resurrection power in it but his prayer. He could not rise but his prayer rose. His prayer faith made it up and out and came into the temple into the It's just amazing friends. His prayer went up all that way into the dimensions of God. When he couldn't get out, his prayer made it out first. That's right. He couldn't even move. He was bound by all kinds of seaweed around his head. He said he couldn't move, but his prayer could. Can somebody give me an amen tonight? Sometimes when we can't move, our prayers can move God. So now I think in this in this I think of David praying for 21 days and he didn't think it was getting through but it was it did make it through. But the reason that he couldn't see his prayer get through the answer was on its way but the answer got held up. So now you have the prayer gets through quicker than you think. Daniel didn't know that his prayer made it through but for 21 days the answer coming back got held up by demon power. Amen. the prince of Persia, all kinds of demons. The answer is coming back and there's a there's a fight going on in the other dimension. You know, I like to say it that God, I tell you, when he's getting a son and daughter of God, he's going to go after them. And you don't know how many years or how many things God fought through to get to you. That's right. That's right. That's right. You don't know how what it took to make you a Christian tonight. You don't know what it took for God to get through to you. That's right. Some of you are pretty stubborn. Some of you had spirits on you and God had to fight because of his grace fight through all of it to get back to answer back to you. Thank you, Lord Jesus. And he'll do it. Daniel prayed 21 days and by the time the angel got there, he says, "I heard your prayer the first time you said it." Amen. Hallelujah. I heard your prayer the first time you spoke it, but I had to fight my way through demon power to get the answer. So, what's the elements before we uh just bring it hone it in here tonight? What's the elements of Jonah's prayer? Well, number one, he wasn't worthy to ask. Really, we already covered that, but he wasn't worthy to ask based on his running from the presence of the Lord and running from responsibility. He wasn't worthy. I don't know if he didn't feel at the beginning worthy, you know, he's he's kicked off of the ship. He He told him to kick him off because he's the one causing the storms. He I'm I'm running from God and you'll be safe if you kick me off of this. He didn't know there was a big fish down there that God had prepared for him. Yeah, that's right. Cuz God knows how to get your attention. He does. Amen. God knows how to get your attention. And God knows if you're traveling a certain way and I and it's away from the responsibility of God and I'm headed that way because I'm running from it. I'm running from it. God has a way of creating a big fish to redirect your travel. That's right. Redirect your plans. That's right. He does. Right. God works that way in our lives. And and so now in feeling that once he got swallowed up there had if he was a man he had to be say I feel I don't know if I can go to my God because look what I've done. Similar to what you think this week I can't pray because of the kind of week it's been the kind of person I've been. I can't pray. Feeling unworthy to pray is what the devil uses so much. That's right. To cause sons and daughters of God to forget their authority in God. Feeling unworthy. But yet there was something laying deep inside him that he tapped into in that situation. And that he that was in him had to rise above the unworthiness feeling that he felt. Oh yes. Let me tell being basic tonight. You never get through to God unless you get over your complexes and your unworthiness and being beat up by the devil over your mistakes. Bring them underneath the blood. Amen. That's the truth. Amen. Get over that unworthiness and say, "I'm not worthy because of me. I'm I I I I'm worthy because the blood of the lamb. He has made me worthy to pray. He has made me worthy. He has given me rights from Calvary. I have a right to pray. I have a right to be happy. Hallelujah. And though I'm I I'm unworthy within myself, God has given me a right to pray, the prayer of authority. That's right. And I'll do that now. And that's what he did. He just began to pray not from the surface, not from the symptoms, but he began to pray from who he was as a son of God. And I begin to do that. I'm a son of God here. I'm still a son of God. You know, I'm still kicking. I'm still alive. I'm covered up by seaweed, but I'm still a son of God. I'm still breathing. And as long as I'm still breathing, I can pray. If you're breathing, let everything that have breath praise the Lord. So, who needs to praise the Lord? Everybody who's breathing tonight. That's right. Come on now. Some of you haven't even said amen to me, but nobody has a right to bow out. Let everything that have breath praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. He didn't feel worthy, but he tapped into something. The second thing, that's the first thing he didn't he didn't feel worthy. Second thing is he positioned himself right. He looked away from the symptoms and he looked toward he positioned himself in his heart towards the temple because that's what the word told him to do. You have to be in a position to have perfect faith. You have to position yourself. Brother Brandon says, "Now remember the disciples, they had the word and the word was flesh then and the word told them, I give you power." Amen. I give you power. And they had the power, but they didn't have the faith to operate the word that was in them. You see what I mean? But Jesus had it. He was the word and he had faith that what he said would happen. He said, "Oh, bring him here. How long will I suffer you?" He had faith with his power. How did he? He said, "I can do nothing in myself." Why? He relied upon what he was. He relied in knowing that he was the word and he had faith in God who made him the word. He was God the word and they was in him and that give him faith because he understood his position. Confidence, faith in what God had him for. You know, he didn't have him there for just a regular live a regular life. He had him there for a purpose. Jesus knew his purpose. God called him and this gave him faith and confidence in his position in the word. He knowed what he was because the scripture had said he was this. And here every scripture tied in to prove that he was exactly what the scripture said he would be. And he knew what he was. Therefore, he relied upon what God had made him. And if he did that, then can't we rely upon what God has made us as believers? It doesn't say just Jesus. No, it said him. Him that's in you. These signs shall follow them that believe. He had faith in what he was. And if you're a believer, you have faith in what you are. You are a believer. Maybe you just need to tell the devil when you feel unworthy to pray. Okay, I'm going to start from scratch here. I am a believer. So number three, he called the conditions and symptoms he was around lying vanities and he told us to call him that. How did he say it? He said, and you know, I'm teaching us to pray now. Um Jonah is teaching us to pray. How did this prayer get through? Well, here's elements to it. He didn't feel worthy, but he had to find he was a son of God. Number two, he had to position himself as a son of God. Number three, you have to not look at your symptoms because they're lies. You have to look at the promise. That's right. Right. He gave us some instruction verse eight and how you're supposed to pray. They that observe lying vanities, that means observe means look at. If you're looking at the at the symptoms, you should call them lying vanities. And if you're looking at that, you forsake your own mercy. That's right. You limit God's deliverance coming in when you're only going to look at the symptoms. And he calls them lying vanities. We can call them that. Jonah, I mean, I I can I can buy into his prayer. And part of our prayer means that we don't observe constantly the symptoms. That's right. Because they're lies. And lies are from the enemy. And our bodies are meant to be healthy. That's right. The the system was created by God, the winds and all these things. But when Satan gets in it, he creates a storm. He didn't create a storm, but he he bring I was reading he that is in you today. And he said when you come into the storm, that's always Satan. So you have something created by God. The the the whole uh system of of the weather and all that, all those things, it's created by God. But now when Satan gets in it, he's the one that brings the storms. So now when a storm comes in your life, now now you have to look at that as Satan's come into something that was meant to be healthy. That's right. So you speak to that. You have to speak Satan off of that. Satan, you don't belong there. This is my health. This is my body. And though you see symptoms, uh, the symptoms are lying vanities. That's right. Amen. That's right. I And I don't like people to pretend they're not in pain. I don't think that's what he's talking about. I think it's what you're looking at. You have to look at the promise in your prayer. You have to keep your eyes on the promise. And if the if the symptoms overwhelm you, then you've got to look at them like Jonah that these are lying vanities or you won't have mercy come from the Lord. You won't have a deliverance. So remember that there's no way to keep observing and looking at the symptoms and get a prayer through. Only one way to pray. Look at only God's promise and your right to ask for that promise. Number four, I'm trying to wrap it up here. In his prayer, Jonah offered up the voice of thanksgiving. He says, "But I will sacrifice unto thee with a voice of thanksgiving." I will pay that that I have vowed, salvation of the Lord. So now, he poured on the praise. He poured on the thanksgiving. Yes. Some have said, "Bring the praise first. Bring the worship first." I got a petition to bring, Brother Paul. That's so huge. I got to get over feeling unworthy. I've got to bring this before the throne of God. But you know what? Here's a secret. Start with praise first. Start being thankful first. Something happens when we bring the praise first. That's right. Something happens when we shout it out. Oh yeah, that's right. Hallelujah. Can you say amen? Something happened when he took six days and have him march around the Jericho for six days in silence and on the seventh day let out a shout of praise. Something happens. The walls of Jericho come down. Something happens when we worship first. That's why he said when he teach us to pray our father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name. You know what that is? Worship first before I ask for something. I'm going to bring adoration. I'm going to bring praise. Holy is your name, Lord. Hallelujah. That's right. Jonah. Jonah down there in that fish. He says, "You know what I'm going to do right now? I'm going to bring a shout of praise. Praise. Worship first. Bring your adoration first." You know, we're we're funny with the right. And I'm teaching sons and daughters of God how to how to pray in the right approach to prayer because quite often we go directly for the juggler. We go directly to the need because it's so urgent to us. Why don't you try praising him first? Why don't you try thanking him for a million things? But you try that first cuz then God looks down at this grateful heart that's saying, "Lord, really, I know you'll deliver me, but I want to take this moment just to thank you for what you have done in my life." Talk about some results. Number six, when God stepped in, he spoke to the fish. He can reverse and speak to anything and anyone at any time to deliver a believer. How many believe that? When you have no voice, let him speak for you. Talk about a prayer that got results. I'll tell you the prayer got results because God was able to step in and spoke to the fish. Number seven, in his situation, he had to hold to the revelation that God was greater than the fish and the God in him was greater than the fish and could speak and redirect that fish. He held a revelation in his heart that God was able to do the impossible in this impossible situation. He was a man that was having a hard time, but he had to look beyond the surface into the substance of who he was as the son of God and he had to catch a revelation that the God in me is greater than this fish.
