========================================

chapter 40 and a passage of scripture that is quoted many times Isaiah 40 talking about us renewing our strength and mounting up his wings as Eagles I know we know that from the song and many sermons that's been preached on it so we are appreciative of these things but I just wanted to elaborate on that tonight and speak about young men and women renewing their strength young men and young women renewing their strength so the scripture starts here in verse 28 hast thou not known has thou not heard that the Everlasting God the Lord the creator of the ends of the Earth faith not nor is neither is weary and aren't you glad tonight that our God doesn't faint he doesn't get weary he doesn't get weak he's never weak he's strong because when we get weak he is strong can you say Amen when we have where we're fainting when we're having when we're that way then we know that our the creator of heavens and earth does not do that there is no searching of his understanding verse 29 he giveth power to the faint and to them that have no might he increaseth strength even the youth shall faint and be weary and even the young men shall utterly fall but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount up with wings as Eagles so if it's about eagles we ought to perk up our attention because we're Eagles I mean he's an eagle here tonight and it was the end time to have to give the story about the chicken and the chicken the Barnyard and the eagle getting misplaced there and he never felt comfortable we know the story and so it took Mama evil to come above and scream and then he knew who he was and once he was able to fly then he could fly and get in his category so to speak that we are not just we're not called to be chickens but Eagles and the other scripture says wheresoever the carcass is and the end time there were the Eagles be gathered together so when something perks up when we when we hear the term the Eagles and they shall Mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary and they shall walk and not fade heavenly father bless your word as we do a study tonight and I pray that you anoint us that you make us bold in your spirit Lord and father we break things down so that we understand in this teaching uh the kind of lives that we can live that manifest strength in this hour and especially I see our youth so we commit this subject to you and we pray you'll bless it tonight in Jesus name amen unless you may be seated and from the text we see that this speaks of an extreme weariness that's taking place I actually believe that this could be prophecy for our day because we we realize that it's uh if you go and study the whole chapter then you see that they were given to Idols in verse 18 so it was a nation that's given to very much Idols when you have Idols you have images of the mind you have things take place where people are distracted from God and the true worship of God so this whole theme is is really related to the end time because we realize that we we are the ones that have would have the opportunity or the under the conditions to faint or to get weak or to get wore out and possibly even or to entertain thoughts of giving up that's how the devil wants us to think that we get weary and there's another scripture that says in the New Testament be you not weary in well-doing for in due season you shall reap if you faint not but we realize sometimes we get weak under the conditions and so there there's a there's a weakness that comes our our generation is marked by weakness and adultery Jesus said a wicked an adulterous generation brother Branham quoted it a weak an adulterous generation how many know that we're in a weak generation and by weakness it's not physically weak as such even though we know that the foods that we eat are breaking down our bodies and we're not as strong a people physically as we used to be but it's I when I think of weakness of this generation I don't think I think of weak Minds I think of weak minds I think of Minds that can't think Common Sense anymore I think of things that aren't strong the world thinks of strong and strength and men that are physically strong and maybe now women that are physically strong they think of strength and weakness in terms of that but it's not what about a strength in the mind what about strength in the Lord what about strength in your thinking can you say Amen what about remaining strong and so when the the whole world has got us in a weak condition a weak and adulterous and incidentally that's tied together weakness and uh an adulterous generation is sexual things and sexual perversion are tied to the weakness because when we are weak in the Lord then we're more vulnerable to sexual temptation so a weak and awaken an adulterous duration it all goes together when we're not strong spiritually we will be tempted with many times with sexual things that's why he called it a weak and adulterous generation but you see now when we have extreme weakness we have a fainting we have giving up and this this word when it speaks awareness it's an exhaustion exhaustion it's a depleting this age depletes our strength from us it's a weakening of our spirit many times and it's all related to the spirit and mind not physical but the spirit and the mind weak Minds weak thinkers not strong in Godly thinking or Godly principles that's the age that we live in and so much could be said about that that's not my subject tonight but I want to hone in on how it's going through this and saying when men are weak and this generation is weak he giveth power verse 29 to the faint and to them that have no might he increases strength who does it like brother Danny said last weekend it's not by our own abilities it's not by what we can offer but our strength is in the Lord and thankfully he provides strength when we are weak as a matter of fact when we're weaked and that's when he becomes strong he's the source of our strength and so if we go to the source then what are we going to be we're going to be strong we're going to be strong in our thinking we're going to strong in our minds we're going to be strong in our Spirits we're going to be strong in our soul God's calling a people to be strong in the Lord not weak in the Lord and so but he provides it but right in the middle of this he said even the young people shall faint and be weary and the young men shall utterly fall now that's interesting because when you have young men and you young people that are getting weary and faint it's talking about spiritually now um that's interesting because young people are known for their energy they got a lot of it I mean my my granddaughter they're living with us now and she goes from eight in the morning till about nine at night full steam ahead no naps nothing singing all day and playing all day and has and does not slow down and I'm going I don't know if I can keep up with this or not she goes constantly and so then they grow and they get in their teenage years and you know everything gets going and they've got energy and they've got all these things but here now look at our generation where it used to be older people that was suicidal used to be older people that was in depression now the last 10 15 years we deal with young people in a state of depression we deal with young people considering suicide so now the Devils come in and this weariness and this giving up Spirit comes to the youth and that's really bad when our young people are getting that way it gets you know the devil's really trying to take us when he takes the young hearts that should be excited about life they should be an energetic about life and looking forward to the future and you find a lot of them they're they're afraid of the future they're scared of what's going to take place next it should never be that way the excitement in their eyes the the excitement about the future what does God have for me and the energy and all that should be there and yet they're becoming depressed and of course I could elaborate how what encourages that depression with social media and all of it but that's what they become they become weary our young youth shall become faint and shall be weary and then they have the same promises every one of this a everyone in this age but they that wait upon the Lord they that pursue the Lord they that are looking towards the Lord they that have a Pursuit towards God they're going to find a place to renew their strength glory be to God there's a place tonight to renew your strength there's there's a there's a heart of God that's provided something for this hour that when you're weary in spirit when that Devil's telling you to give up there's a place we can go and set your wings can you say amen and you feel a renewal in the Lord oh my so you know being my subject is for the young people then we thank God that there's a promise that our strength young people if you're listening there's a promise that your strength can be renewed too we will have a source in this new generation and the youth will have that Source too I want to say that we need young people today that are strong in fact there's a calling going out during this in the middle of of Satan's Eden there's a calling going out to the new generation right now through the preaching there's a calling going out how many believe that there's a calling in the middle of Satan's Eden the vision of God is to have young people and what's he calling for he's calling for strong young people he's calling for young people their strength in their minds calling for young people that are strong in their hearts strong in their convictions so strong in their protective boundaries away from the enemy strong girls who can resist a weak Boy he's calling for strong boys that can resist a weak girl strong girls that know how to say no to the wrong type of boy strong boys that know how to say no he when when you talk to boys they always think that they're strong related to their muscle uh build up and their tone but God give us strong boys who stand for the convictions of the word that can say no to Temptation that strength in this hour you're just a statistic if you're just strong in your in your muscles can you say amen and go ahead and do that it's it's great and you know that's work your muscles do all that but listen Solomon said he said uh something about a man that could take and Conquer a whole city he said but his Spirit he can't conquer so he can Flex his muscles and say I've conquered that whole city with the sword in the Army and then he can turn around and he don't have enough strength to ward off the wrong kind of woman and Samson was that way [Music] when the anointing would come on him he'd pick up the fence of a city he would you know he could do anything but a woman that's where his weakness was and it weakened him until she cut his hair and found the source of his strength a woman did that found the source of restraint cut his strength off and so he might have been such a mighty man but what his strength today strength is young men and young women that can stand for their convictions strength is young girls who can stand against the wrong guy and say no strength is young guys who can say no to the Temptations on the internet there's a calling going out to young people today that would be strong young young people and let it be said that strength that does not come as brother Danny was saying this past weekend strength does not come from your ability it comes from the Lord strength does not come from your own mental exercise it comes from the Lord there's a source in the Lord as we wait on him as we look to him as we pursue God then we find the source of strength and the renewal of strength if you're weak there's a call for young men first John 2 14 says I have written unto you young men because ye are strong and the word of God abideth in you he's not talking about old man he's talking about the young man what's God's vision for young boys and young men what's God's Vision that you're strong why do you have to preach this because we got a bunch of weak Lily livered men stand for any convictions they're they're turned into one another instead of a woman and they're they're just you you hear them talk and they sound like a woman and and they they have no vision anymore they don't even know who they are anymore Lily liver no backbone can't even stand up and put their wife in order we live in a generation with men with no backbone whatsoever there's a calling for young men and he says I've written a human because you are strong the vision for young men is that they be strong and the word of God would abide in them and you have overcome the will of wicked one that's the men that God wants to write to that's the men that God wants strong in the word the words abiding you and you have overcome the wicked God give us young men that are overcoming the wicked one come on people say amen can you believe that that's the vision see well what about a woman well look here in Proverbs 31 10. proverbs 31 10 says who can find a virtuous woman for her price is Farber Ruby's skipping along to verse 17. she girneth her loins with strength and strengtheneth her arms now that's not a bodybuilder either don't use that scripture for bodybuilding for women no let's talk about spiritually let's talk about character that God wants strong women of God strong women that know where they stand and know their convictions and know their principles he said she girders are loads of strength of string and arms and then later in verse 25 strength and honor strength and honor are her clothing and she shall rejoice in time to come everything reeks everything comes from her is a strong woman of God it's strength even her clothing speaks of strength not him modesty but strength in the Lord modesty in the Lord a beautiful woman they don't have to dress like an Amish or something I'm not knocking the Amish but her clothing even says I'm strong in the Lord I'm not weak I'm not so I'm making my body cheap to someone else showing parts of my body showing a little more leg and all this stuff that's weakness everybody's doing that but the woman of proverbs 31 she's not only strong and she's not only uh virtuous and she's not only taking care of the things of her household and doing all these things but yet she's her loins are Gert with strength she strengthened her arms and strength and honor are in her clothing and she shall rejoice in time to come Hallelujah I don't have this scripture up there but I thought this was interesting as I found hundreds of scriptures related to this I can't read them all tonight this is about parents Ezra 9 12. says now therefore give Not Your Daughters unto their sons that's the heathen don't give your daughters unto their sons neither Take Your Daughters unto your sons nor seek their peace or their wealth forever that ye may be strong and eat the good of the land and leave us for inheritance for your children forever did you hear what that just said who you give your daughters and sons to will either weaken you or strengthen you parents heads up heads up don't be weak when it comes who you give your sons and daughters to and by the way you do give them away but if you start getting weak in who they're giving away to and give them to the Heathen you're not going to be strong it's going to weaken Generations so you pray about it with them this is a serious thing this is a sober thing well I fell in love well praise the Lord I believe in love but I believe love has a lot more to it than just a feeling he says to the parents don't give your daughters to their sons don't give your sons to their daughters that ye may be strong families strong in the Lord eat the good of the how many want to eat the good of the land and leave an inheritance to your children forever that's not a physical inheritance that's a spiritual inheritance I'm going to go to the story in first Samuel chapter 3 13 now I don't know how far I'll get tonight I suppose that if I don't get too far into it we'll pick it up and finish it on Sunday so you may get a teaching on Sunday as well finishing is up because I intend to finish the subject but the story of amnon and Tamar in First Corinthians 13 and a few a year or so ago I dealt with this and I didn't I didn't cover it all because as I kept reading it there was so much more in there and there's so much that young people can learn out of this story it's a tragic story it's a terrible story it's not unbelievers it's Believers within the kingdom of God it's it's terrible the story of amnon and Tamar is a terrible story it's but it's in the Bible for some reason and every time we have something in the Bible it's for our admonition it's far in for our instruction everyone in brother branham's mistakes uh in his early life I better be careful saying that I said every one of brother Brown's mistakes in his early life because he said he made mistakes he said I trust as I share my life testimony that these will be stepping stones along the way for the young people to see and to be able to learn from those things that you don't say make the same mistakes so first Samuel chapter 13 is a is a is a it's a it's a story and it's a there's so much young people can learn from this story it's so relevant for today because in our time love is not understood true love genuine love even the love for a man for a wife has been misconstrued it's been Twisted it's been perverted and where has it been perverted in the minds of the young people to where today they don't know when you when I say love and they say love it could mean two different things they're thinking about because the generation has uh uh tampered with the meaning of love and so it's uh love this is so important for today because love is misunderstood love is not understood love is Twisted it's perverted and another thing that's uh messed up and not understood is strength as I just spoke of strength is interpreted as I said in physical strength or what um Peyton Manning or uh Thomas Tom Brady could do in football and we look into our heroes for strength and their and the the you know there was a little uh documentary on Tiger Woods that we were looking at when we come home and uh from Ireland and I just I wanted to go through it and see and such a rise and such a tragic story because the push from his father to push him to the very top and he came to the very top golfer in the world and then to watch as he wasn't addressing things in his life than to watch him fall and have to go he went into sexual addiction and he had to go to different therapies for that and then he was in drug therapy and just this his life was all messed up and but yet you got this great Fame and this great strength and nobody could beat him and the world Praises them and lifts them up because the world's Twisted about what's strong but inside he wasn't strong his Spirit wasn't strong so we got to be real careful that we don't take the world's view of what strong is what strength is so [Music] there's some points that we're going to bring out of the story just now as we read it and I might just quickly read through some of it and then I'll go back and make the points and we'll have it up on the PowerPoint tonight and we'll see how many of these we get through but out of this story I've narrowed it down to Five Points of weakness that the young people should look for and Five Points of strength because what you find is Tamar despite the fact that she was alone with uh amnon not necessarily by her own choice but eventually she was alone with them despite her strong responses to this terrible boy despite her strong response but I I I hope I'll get to meet Tamar someday and compliment her because she had things taken away from her it wasn't fair to her but but if you look at her responses about five responses to this boy before the incident happened you will find she had convictions there but because she was in a uh an awkward spot of being alone then her virginity was taken away from her but under normal circumstances these type of strong responses I compliment for because you don't find many girls that's just strong to tell these boys and it's right in the scripture and I think the young people especially the young girls can learn from her convictions and what she said to this boy because you may not need to say it alone with them you may have to but if you got the wrong boy you shouldn't be alone with them anyway but if you're today's alone is not just alone in a car or somewhere else today's alone is on texting that's a loan and I hope that our young girls can get the strength to have these responses to the wrong type of boy in his texting so it says here in Chapter 13 First Corinth the first Samuel not First Corinthians I'm in the Old Testament first Samuel did I say 13. okay well it'd really be a good idea if I go over the second Samuel and it'd be a good idea if I put second Samuel in my notes too that would help all right second Samuel 13 and it came to pass after this that Absalom the son of David had a fair sister whose name was Tamar and amnon the son of David loved her oh so beautiful oh I tell you if you stopped with that verse quit reading I didn't tell you to go any further yet if you stop with that verse this would have been a normal love story she was fair and he loved her and all you can do is just go oh so nice the baby's trying to do it right there oh but now you get to see what this love really was okay if you'd have stopped at that scripture then you wouldn't have read the story right or his mind right or the whole purpose because he's calling it love and amnon was so vexed what what's going on here amnon was so vexed so I wanted to stop on the first point here and am I doing this up here now all right so I'll take it from here I'll take it here I'll take it from here guys this boy is calling this love but he proves it has nothing to do with love at every turn he proves he's using the term love but everything he does there's no love in it so my first point to the young people to learn love what is love love has honor love has respect love has obedience to God and to authorities love is rooted in truth not lies and does it sneak around Love Goes deeper than sexual or natural attraction infatuation is a real thing you can be infatuated and then infatuation can turn to Obsession that's what it did with amnon just an infatuation with their beauty turned to ABS into an obsession with her obsession is not love a lustful obsession is not love so the first thing you have to learn about this story he's calling it love but everything he does from this point in his fruits to his life shows it's not love and the young people need to know how do I know it's true love brother Paul I may be attracted she may be pretty he may be handsome he may be good looking great wonderful but when you start using the term love don't think that just looks is love don't think that just attraction is love don't think that physical attraction to her body I must love her because I'm attracted to her body Love Goes deeper than that because the problem with an attraction to a body and you're calling it love your body is made that it can be attracted to the next girl that's pretty as well so there's no committedness in that because you could be attracted to her beauty and say I think I really love her I do love her but a week later your body can be just as attracted to another woman come on now say Amen so no no no you're dealing with an attraction you're doing and so now love young people you're writing it down or you're putting in your mind love has honor to it and if it doesn't have honor it's not true love love has respect for that other individual love has respect and obedience to God and authorities love is rooted in truth love is not rooted in lies or sneaking around that's not love love goes deeper than sexual or natural attraction so if you're going to go about it you've got to know what love is you got to know what love is and if you start using the term which I love you is Loosely used very quickly in all kinds of situations I encourage my kids and our young people I love to talk to young people we're still doing it here brother Kyle brother Brandon brother Boaz whoever's helped us through the years we we keep laying these things into the young people because we feel it's our duty but we're going to let you know what true love is we're going to let you know how to go a bit about courtship we're going to keep saying it and we're going to actually say it even more in the generation we live in when your kids grow up in this church get ready because they're going to hear good solid teaching on it whether they get a hold of her or not is up to them but they're going to hear it because I feel I love to talk about uh next week when I go I love to go to youth camps and talk about it as much as I can I can't go very much today but it's an exciting thing to go talk about and one of the things is that do you understand what love is and we're finding more and more that the term is so weakened that they're using it right away after a few days uh I love you mom with nothing to back it up not a thing to back up that love I love you can we pee together sexually love has honor love has respect boy girl you don't respect them so you don't have love for them what you're reading is love has nothing to do with love so remember that first point and then he thinks he's in love but the Bible says he was vexed so you kind of wonder why is this what's going on here that he he was vexed that he felt sick for his sister Tamar for she was a virgin and so we'll stop right there because the he says he loves her but he's vexed to me that's an oxymoron I mean you're not in love and vexed because vexation means annoyed at somebody frustrated worried it's the cause of trouble vexation trouble Afflicted in some places in the Scripture it returns to him being vexed with the Devil it's tied to Demons Solomon uses the term quite a bit in Ecclesiastes quite a bit vexation of spirit he said I've got all the riches of the world but I've seen he said life is Vanity life is Vanity and vexation of spirit life without God is vexation of spirit it's constant worry it's a lack of peace it's attention it's demonic power holding attention that's being vexed and so his love he was vexed all the time and he fell sick this is what amnon did he had no peace in it his vexation even turned into physically being sick some young people become so emotionally and physically fragile over a relationship they become suicidal if they break up with me I'm crashing or the parents think they're going to crash I can tell you that relationship is based on the wrong thing because it's their their relationship is not in the Lord because if they're based by the Holy Ghost and the Lord they can break up and they're not going to crash and be suicidal because their first relationship is the Lord can I get an amen tonight if if they can crash and be suicidal from an Earthly relationship I've got to have this boy I gotta have this girl there's something wrong in their spirit and that is not love and don't you ever parents don't you parents ever call that love that's emotional fragile over a relationship they become suicidal sometimes infatuation can turn into Obsession and with amnon it had turned into a session and so the second point I want to make to you young people is being vexed in your spirit for the opposite sex is never of God provides peace if the relationship is right there's no condemnation there's no guilt a pastor tell me he says the reason I teach the young people I teach them basically this guilt-free living in Jesus Christ because everything you go do and sneaky and sin guilt goes with it so you got to sin but then you got guilt too and the devil jumps on the guilt and you'll be condemned for years unless you bring it to the cross and true repentance he's going to Badger you for years with that guilt so guilt-free living is like stay in the boundaries and the confines of God's weight and word in his protection why so you can ward off the guilt that comes in your life be in vexed in your spirit for the opposite sex is never of God God provides peace if a relationship is right one of the scriptures I use early on in my relationship with with a girl that I had proverbs 10 22 and I used it I used it with my wife the blessing of the Lord they don't have this up here I'll put it up maybe Sunday the blessing of the Lord it maketh Rich how many wants to be under the blessing of the Lord just half of us all right okay it's fine the blessing of the Lord maketh rich and he addeth no sorrow with it if you want the blessings of the Lord in your relationship if it's of the Lord and he's blessing it he addeth no sorrow with it there's no lack of peace and vexation of spirit there's no Obsession there's no I gotta make this happen there's none of that that's not love that's vexation of the spirit that's a get the job done as quickly as possible all right so remember that one be being vaccine your spirit for the opposite sex is not of God God provides peace if a relationship is right all you older people say amen anyway you know this is truth anyway even this though some of the things apply to us can you say man some of these things apply to married people principles of God's word are for all of us can you say Amen so here's the next thing in the Scripture it says that he was he was uh Vex he felt sick for his sister Tamar for she was a virgin and amnon thought it hard for him to do anything to her stop it was hard to get to her because he wanted to do something to her he asked the question why what kind of mind is wanting to do something to her but he can't because she's around the hedges of her protection so now the mind's going to try to think of a way to get around the boundaries of protection what kind of mind is that it's not of God so it's the part of his frustration he could not get to her he had come to a place that he wanted to get to her and do something to her his mind had reached a point that he wanted to do something to her sexually he was vexed with a lustful eye and a heart towards Tamar but the pitiful thing is he's seen it was hard to get to her it was frustrating it was annoying I can't I want to do something to her and I can't get to her and was looking for ways to get around this huge protective boundaries Godly things in place in Tamar's life normal things that protect our lives can I say it that the word of God is Not only given us Doctrine but is get us give us tons of boundaries and protection to keep our life safe from the temptation of the enemy and where are they at they're laying in this Bible and God gave them to you you live in a world that ignores all of them says they're not important I say they're still important today children of Israel people today whoever it is God says in that generation I'll not only reveal truths of Doctrine but I'm going to give my people some guidelines to live by because they're going to live in this present world and he said my desire is that you live soberly and godly in this present world didn't he say he says a man will be tempted but with every temptation I will make a way of Escape you ought to hold on to that promise and you ought to hold on to the way that he helps you escape the Temptation when he gives it to you and for me most of it is being in the word of God so now if you're in the word he says with every temptation temptation is common to man he says but I promise you in every Temptation there's going to be something come to you there's going to be a scripture come to you there's going to be something planted in you I'll Make A Way and that's your way out a lot of people don't take the the ticket out they ignore it they ignore even if they're healing a voice saying well brother Paul taught that or I read that in the Bible I've been taught this since my youth this and it's all coming up and it's screaming sometimes it's screaming at you if you haven't squelched those voices and still young people will override it and say I want this lustful thing God has put boundaries in place and he put that around Tamar and Hamden was trying to think of a way to gather when we start allowing our minds to think in ways to bust down the fences God has put up with his word we're on Dangerous Ground I said when we let our minds start thinking of ways to bust down the fences that God has put up with his word we're on Dangerous Ground it's not a very shouting service tonight we're not going to be doing a Victory lap probably not but it is every bit the truth it is every bit the truth when our minds start to think of ways to bust down the fences God has put up his word or on dangerous crown and then you hear I don't like the boundaries anymore I don't like that that I can't have her it's so hard to do what we want to do and everybody's making it so hard we just want to do this and everybody's making it so hard it's a hard way to live this way of the message it's too hard I can't do it I feel restricted by the boundaries I can't get what I want well there's the problem right there it's what you want I can't get what I want I can't wear what I want in this message I can't even wear what I want because because of what the message says and it goes It goes on this this reveals what is in this guy's mind and sisters young girls listen to me and young guys with girls nobody could see what was in amnon's mind we don't see what the thinking process is that boy that you see or that girl that you see we only see the physical first so we judge them physically then we get to know them we judge their personality I kind of like their personality it takes a while to see what's in that mind young girls you ought to wait a long time to see because it won't take you too long it'll start spilling out what mind what does this guy think about because as a man thinketh so is he so if you judge the first week in town you love him the first week guy if you're judged by you're just judged quickly I love her you know I love her I love her right you don't know what that's in in that girl's mind you don't know her so I'm encouraging young people young guys and young girls I'm encouraging you that's why we encourage taking time because you don't know what's in their mind yet you don't know if they have the Holy Ghost until you know that they have the Holy Ghost and when you know they have the Holy Ghost then you start to know what's in their mind because uh what they've been feeding on it's going to come out this came out what amnon had been feeding on came out in a bad a bad a and I think girls and guys should look because nobody can see what's in that person's mind guys and girls look past the physical and the Winsome Looks To Die For and he's so hot and she's so hot and wait and see over time and you will see what's in their mind and heart who he really is and who she really is so my third point to you any boy any boy or girl who is trying to push back god-given boundaries and protection is not to be trusted if you could take this girls and get you a magic marker and write it on your purse or something I don't know even this one any boy or girl who's trying to push back the god-given boundaries that's been laid in your hearts for all these years push back the boundaries and get around the protections that's a boy not to be trusted that's a girl not to be trusted so the next point is that he thought it hard for her to get to verse three but you don't have to go to the scriptures if you're reading along with me the next thing the next point I want to make is but amnon had a friend whose name was Jonah dab the son of shimia David's brother and Jonah dab it wasn't just a friend but was a very subtle man interesting word that comes from the fall in the Garden of Eden that the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field and so this Jonah dab somehow became the friend of amnon and he was subtle wrong kind of friend to have animal not only had a mind that was perverted and messed up he also chose the wrong type of friend young people are you listening if you got a mind that's messed up and then you choose the wrong friends of course if your mind is messed up you're going to choose the wrong friends uh you got a double whammy going against you Amna not only had a mind perverted and messed up he also chose the wrong friend I think the definition of a friend today has been watered down you got a lot of friends on social media that you don't even know how did that become friends we don't even know him I think the definition of friend has been watered down we make choices now to follow somebody and we don't even know them we follow them I'm going to follow them and follow them we befriend someone to follow them and then we friend them and then we unfriend them and then we block someone and then we follow people that we don't know we follow an influencer I'm going to join them I'm going to follow them be a follower of them no check of their life or anything else you don't even know them Harley from Sam and you're following them on the Internet it's all based upon whatever you feel of the time and when when you get lost in all this true meaning of what a real friendship is now you choose the wrong friends you don't choose the correct type of friend young people are you listening and the top people to follow on Tic Tac are called influencers and uh they're the most popular they're the most and so relationships then I've said before become really shallow these days social networks like Facebook Twitter Instagram make regular users more shallow and less moral this is what the psychologists say these all make the users of it more shallow in their friendships and less moral than what they were before how can so you do that well it's happening we got the fruit there it makes young people less moral than they were before according to a new study by psychologists because social media sites often lead to fast and short responses it is a it is a killing the art of reflective thought researchers said you don't think about it you just choose that friend you follow them and whatever they're doing you're just obsessed with it and you go into it betrayal is everywhere there's more friends but there are more shallow friendships there's less deep relationship trust is broken Satan exploits our Satan exploits our pure desire and thirst for friends and points us to the wrong friends you have a thirst in you to have friends you have a desire to have true friends but Satan exploits that and puts you on there to people to make your friends or sometimes even within a church that's not the right friend and so he exploits your desire for a true right friend and you settle for second best and you form a friendship with the wrong one I want to say that because of petrayum because of loneliness in young people's lives people feel their desire for friendship and social media and games and other things and choosing not choosing the right friends they escape into movies and phones and books they don't really need people anymore they don't need to be face to face with anymore they don't need to be in the word anymore hours are spent playing video games hours are spent on the phone that becomes your friend almost uh and marriages have been lost because of that I know marriages that have ended because someone else becomes their friend on the internet because their wife is not their friend anymore animals become more important than the people in their lives oh I shouldn't have said that one Minister that you know and I think he said it was at our church years ago he was a latchkey kid he came home and his mom was never home until later he became lonely as ever and he says that home he says home became his video games Holmes became pornography because he didn't have a home he had a house but A House Is Not a Home and he didn't have that relationship with his parents in a relationship with his siblings and he didn't have that thing to come home to to make it a home if we don't have a good home to come home to then pornography becomes our home the wrong friendships becomes our home oh if you pour yourself into that it becomes subtle and you're filling a need for True friendships with the wrong friends I wonder if it becomes subtle a subtle friend like amnon subtle friend here uh and and so this is how the path that we go down so here we pick up amnon wondering if we can answer why a boy in a royal family would carry out such an act as this with Tamar amnon's mind was given over to standards against what he had been taught the story is very revealing to show that with the slow decline in his thinking through whatever he was feeding on top of that he has a friend in his life and becomes a subtle friend and amnon could never go around the barriers to have this girl that he wanted but he finally made it through and the whole incident would not could have been stopped but it wasn't he could have got on right track you know what amnon could have got on the right track and get his mind cleared up if he'd been around the right friends the story would have read different his mind was messed up but if he got around the presence of God good people good older people some good young people and the right kind of friends this may not have happened but a combination of two of them it was just it created the wrong situation amen I need to pass some of this and get down to it here James chapter 4 says from whence come Wars and fightings among you come they not hints even of your lusts were war in your that war in your members ye lost and have not ye kill and desire to have and cannot obtain you fight and War yet you have not because ye ask not ye asked and receive not because you ask a mess that you may consume it upon your lust ye adulterers and adulteresses know ye not that the Friendship of the world is enmity with God whosoever there shall whosoever therefore young people listen to me whoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God you can't have the best of both worlds you can't keep wrong friendships and be in relationship with God it doesn't work that way so in order to have the right friends you must know how subtle your enemy is and that you must choose the right friends Point number four out of this lesson you must purpose that you can never have a close intimate relationship with someone who rejects your Christ or the convictions and principles you live by if they reject them they are really rejecting you maybe it hasn't happened yet but I got to tell you you know the story the moment this was over his love changed to anger and he ditched her out of the room hated her which which doesn't mean he loved her because how can you love her and then you hate her after the moment that you get and fulfilled your lust honor so you must purpose young people that you can never have a close intimate relationship with someone who rejects your Christ or convictions and principles you live by you should never have a close friendship like that acquaintances be cordial be nice but never form bonds with somebody who rejects your Christ or disrespect your Christ or disrespects your convictions I had some friends in school but they respected my convictions but the devil works on somebody and you form a close relationship with somebody who's mocking your convictions and trying to get you to wiggle around them that is not friendship that's not the friends that God has provided for you brother Brian says friendship is a gift from God so do you want God's gifts to you or do you want your own friends that you've chosen I want God's gifts to me and guess what you may have very few in this life but I would rather have few than to have too many wrong ones in my loneliness I would rather have few friendships that are solid and feel a bit lonely sometimes than to have many that are wrong the last point is amnon and his friend conceived the plan to draw Tamar out of her protected world out of the protection and headship of her parents into being in a place alone with him into amnon's private world and I wish I had another hour to preach on this we'll pick it up Sunday again he drew her out in other words a girl can draw a girl can woo somebody out of their world not just physically but he can woo you out of the world of protection that you used to around the grace of God around the things of God the wrong girl can woo a guy out of that draw her by her looks or whatever her you know you go into Proverbs that describes perfectly her attire of a harlot any way she does you know I've I've decked my bed with tapestry she changed her whole bed and it's all a fantasy it's like Disney World that's not the way her bed normally looks but she changes it all because that's a fantasy I've done all this for you come into my and so uh a girl can woo somebody and a guy can lose somebody by a lot of different ways and if they're willing you out of the protection and boundaries God has provided for you and he this boy he he wound her into his private world something should be said before I close about this being a danger zone your private world never ever in history have a people been able to be drawn into their own private World outside of any accountability or any eyes to watch you never before in history do we have the ability to do that like we do now no zero accountability and zero eyes to watch what you're doing well I'm an adult I can do that I can go to an adult place principles of the word don't change for a 60 year old and a 16 year old they don't change and and so now never in history has there been such a moving into your private world it's none of your business this is what I can look at I have a right I have an American right and the whole scriptures again it against it because we realize that first of all there's no place that we can live that God doesn't see us how stupid to think that you have your own private World guess what you don't have a private world you don't have a place where all I see I always can't see there is an eye watching you so accountability to God and accountability to eyes and accountability to boundaries is the scriptural way the Nev That Never Ends I'm 57 I don't want that to end and if it ever would it's it's a weakening if we change that principle I don't want that accountability to ever end I've lived with accountability man I've I want more accountability in my life I want to call people and run things across them I don't live in my own private world I want to be submissive he said pastors congregations submit yourself to your pastor Pastor submit yourself to your congregation I want another accountable in all things that we do here okay that's I want to continue to live that way I want to live that way anymore because that's the way the Bible tells us to live and there's no age that stops that it's all right it's all right you can be quiet that's fine the private world of and say this before I get to my final fifth Point there's five more points and I'm saving them for Sunday aren't you glad to hear it I'm only doing five tonight try to come back Sunday if you want if you don't you know but I'm gonna get I'm gonna get to these other five points and they are more positive strengths than weaknesses all right the other five the positive things that Tamar is offering up to this boy all right and so now I want to get to the fifth point but I'm saying this that in the private world of texting and Instagram and many others give young people and adults places that they can say things watch things hear things that they would never normally say or look at in front of others so it can't be of God can't be of God what does it do it's it's what Satan has brought to weaken you to weaken you in your private world so private world is not of God because why it weakens you God's calling and young people to be strong strong in convictions strong in what they stand for strong in the Holy Ghost young girls that are strong in their conventions strong in the Holy Ghost filled with the holy spirit that the word is is a guidance to their life it's not just some Sunday morning thing but the word is guiding their lives God is calling young people to be strong in the midst of Satan's Eden the texting and all these other things I have to say it again brings Youth and adults in places they can say things watch things and hear things that they never would normally say in front of others him up sometimes I see an Instagram or something like that and go wow did they actually say that did they post that did they wear that they'd never wear that at church and they go to my church and so then we might as well say that uh it encourages a boy or girl to get really good at living in Two Worlds because you got your private world and then you got your church life world so is it right to be living in Two Worlds absolutely not you're living in Two Worlds you're two-faced book you're being two different people you're a person to everybody at church but privately you're a completely different person this is what the world encourages this is the World by the way it's the wisdom of the world it gives you permission to be that way to put on something to somebody else but I think we should be who we are and if you want to be like the world I'm not encouraging you to do that I'm encouraging not to be two people can I get an amen tonight I'm standing here as a gospel Minister don't do both don't be lukewarm get in or get out can you say man I'm encouraging you to don't ever be two people don't be lukewarm don't be something at church you put on something holy but your heart is not in it don't be what Jesus said my they honor honorary with my lit their lips but their heart is far from me no if you're gonna do this sell out Lock Stock and Barrel through repentance and say I'm all in I believe this I'm not two people what you see in church is what you see in my bedroom what you see here is what you see at home can I get an amen I'm not two people this is who I am culture provides us a place to be two different worlds so Tamar was drawn out of her world of boundaries and protections to a world alone with her what time is it 8 8 22. all right Tamar was Drew out of her world and her boundaries and her protections to a world all alone with him and I have never been fond of guys or girls being alone together until they have matured and grown into a courtship a little while that's been my principle now I don't have any straight things from the message on that but I do have bib Bible here I do have the Hebrew law that says that two people should not be alone together in a room alone and that was the law that was married people should never be in the room alone not that they would do anything but the temptation to do something so you just put the law there don't be together alone in a room when this rate took place David enhanced the law and said two single young people from here on out should not be alone him and the priests changed it for this incident just expanded it so I made a I'm going to expand it just a little bit more and I say until they've matured or come into their courtship a little while and we see where their hearts are I don't encourage my kids to be alone with the opposite sex under any circumstances there's a time it'll come it will come but never just within right away no it's like you know it's not a good thing why it has proved to be dangerous ground and thousands of incidences if not millions in fact with kids it's happened to pretty decent kids pretty decent kids and all they did was go out too long alone together and decent kids found that their flesh took over and they messed up amen so they did fine in a group but too much alone opened the doors they didn't have the Holy Ghost didn't have strong convictions to keep things holy and just went South most parents tonight most parents tonight should be in agreement with with me if you grew up in the world I have a lot of appearances to open the world and they didn't do everything right they didn't know about the word and some of me in the group The Message made mistakes but then when they hear this preachers a lot of parents are saying preach it brother Bo preach it preaching barefisted tell it like it is and by the way I'm doing that tonight preaching parents just right behind we wish we could have heard this don't stop preaching it but it's amazing how some parents even when they messed up when they were young won't stand behind you and the guidelines from the message are devalued they're not important they're not relevant anymore brother Brown got towards the end of his ministry and started to say things that like science has proved that the sex glands your sex glands the same sex glands are in the lips so when you kiss a girl before marriage you potentially commit adultery with her start to say that 64-65 so don't kiss her he said till you're at the altar until you marry her he laid that in there a lot of people were following the message for years and had already kissed you know and it's like he's making adjustments kind of like David making that enhancement of the law saying hey we need this in place let me ask you a question he said that in 64-65 introduced that totally new oh boy that's the legalism that's just we're not doing that but let me ask you this question in the world you live in now was that a good principle to put in place for the young people it's exactly God breathing in the mouth of a prophet through the mouth of a prophet it's saying my young people are going to need some standards in this Satan's Eden so I'll breathe through my prophet and say don't touch her sexually and don't kiss her until your wedding day yeah when you raise your hand say we needed that 99 of the world is going to reject that and laugh at me tonight if they get it hear it they're going to laugh unfortunately some message people are going to laugh I've heard it said that somebody said well is that really reality to expect that the kids and times we live in God have mercy on you for saying that yeah it's a reality it's not your reality it's the reality of the word of God yes it's still real reality it's the word of God it's the message of the hour and we teach it and preach it here maybe God give us young people that will follow it can you say Amen the guidelines for the message are devalued in in so many ways but but we're preaching those things so my last point and number five and we'll bring it to a close tonight any guy or girl that draws someone else away from accountability and protection into being alone too much is not the right guy or the girl for you this applies even to private messages in private messages if he's drawing you out of the protection of your what you believe and what you stood for or for your what your church stands for or what your your parents is dead or any guy or girl that's not the right guy a girl for you it's not and this applies even to private messages can you say Amen praise the Lord so hey even the youth will become weak and faint but they that wait on the Lord even the youth the ones who wait on the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount up as wings as an eagle can you say Amen they shall run and not be worried they shall walk God give us young people that'll run and not be weary walk and not faint God give us young people that's strong God give us a church that's strong in the Holy Ghost and in the principles of of the word notice what happens within seconds of being alone with a guy like the mind and lustful Spirit of amnon within seconds of being a once he was in that place he could do whatever he wanted to because that's why I say when I go into the five things of the strength of Tamar when he began to force her his her responses were the right responses and I want to get into those responses they were the right responses but I tell you even the strength of responses didn't work because he was alone you see so that's why I've emphasized tonight when you're drawn away alone into the world without accountability that's when you really set yourself up for tremendous compromising of all convictions and dishonor and disrespect and all of that comes when you've placed yourself alone with somebody how many married brothers and married sisters can say the same thing the rules still apply for us too no doubt about it no doubt about it we live in the same world the young people do and so these things is God's word that he's given us that we can renew our strength by these things when we become weak in these areas we we look to the Lord to renew our strength that we become strong young people strong marriages how many would raise your hands say I want my marriage to be stronger not weaker the devil's trying to weaken your marriage but I want my marriage to be stronger I want my life and the Holy Ghost to be stronger I want to go to the next level higher with the Lord how many young people raise you I want to be a stronger young girl the right responses to the wrong guy amen I believe your heart is pure tonight and want those things well praise the Lord we'll we'll finish this unless the Lord leads me another Direction we'll finish this on Sunday hopefully you'll come back and I believe it'll be good can we stand together and pray thank you for studying the word with me tonight God bless you Heavenly Father Lord I just wanted to share my heart tonight in a teaching to the young people but really all of us Lord as we see the weakening brother Danny read that scripture of of the our enemy Satan as he was exposed in Isaiah and when he looked at him he said is this the man that caused all the nations to tremble and thus weaken the Nations is this the one all those years that we can look at that Lord It's you're showing us that the devil's job is to weaken the people and weaken the Nations and weaken families and weakened convictions and take this message and devalue it Lord this message was exactly what this generation needed it was just what the doctor ordered Lord God I want to preach it more than I've ever preached it before and I know there's influences Lord to devalue it and take away from it and and say well just pick and choose what we want of it oh God I respect it Lord and what you breathe through your Prophet to bring us back to scriptural ways I want to live it and Proclaim it with all of my heart I pray for the young people here I pray for the young people next week at the Youth Camp that's why I taught these things tonight Lord I just want to get familiar with the subject my heart is to teach them Lord if you give it around the world wherever they would listen uh Lord when we when we train the youth we're training for the future I pray they'd get a hold of it tonight I pray there be a young girl a young guy say God dropped this word in my heart drop it deeply in there Lord so that in the hour of Temptation I've prayed up I'm ready I know how to go against the enemy I know what his voice is give us young people like that give us adults and families like that Lord that's your promise for this hour we thank you for this teaching in the word may it find its lodging Place into the people's lives we pray we ask in Jesus name amen praise the Lord God bless you Saint super
