========================================

in chapter 11 verse 1. now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen got two special Words Their substance and evidence and then of course Things Not Seen meaning it's in another dimension and will perhaps pick up on that a little bit later and then verse 2 for buy it the that's by faith the elders obtained a good report and through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear and so they were framed by the word of God so I think we have a basis for faith if you imagine faith in the picture that the frame all right is uh is the words that that frame our faith the word of God frames our faith it's the borders of our faith so and then let's just drop down to verse 5 by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him so again we have this concept of another dimension for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God now what does it mean to please God or answers that in the next verse 6 but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that comes to God must believe that he is first of all that he exists and that he is a rewarder of those them that diligently seek Him may the Lord add this blessing to the reading of his word that's powerheads Heavenly Father once again Lord we just come before you we come before your great throne of grace and of mercy and Lord we just pray that you would undertake uh this morning for every need that's present here or online with those screaming Lord we just pray that your Holy Spirit which is certainly not bound by space or time can reach out to every heart that's uh that's listening this morning and even those that would listen later online and on the archives Lord we just pray that there'd be something in the service for each one of them this morning and Lord may your word go forth with power and the Lord with life and Lord May there be a resulting surge in faith this morning as we read your word and we we frame our thinking with the within the confines of your word not man's word but your will and Lord we just trust that you would meet with us this morning even as We Gather here Lord and move me out of the way let your Holy Spirit be the teacher this morning we ask it in Jesus name amen right you may be seated right we nearly at Battle speed all right so we're going to jump right in uh to this um passage in the Amplified because I want to just give you some uh some more of this framework of how we understand faith so as we mentioned last time that Faith was a bit like gravity it's something that we can easily describe what it does we could even describe a little bit about how it works but if you ask somebody that knows Professionals in the field of physics and you ask them what is gravity clueless they can write big books about how and why but they can't explain what it is and so similar with faith so we have a whole Bible full of Faith so we can certainly read it we can certainly see how it works we can see how God can can make it work but when we ask ourselves what is faith that's a little more tricky and it's because it's in another dimension it's something that has to come by revelation and if we understand that concept where 90 of the way there and we and I just want to say this we understand that it's a gift that God gives it to us and he given to everyone The Measure of Faith a portion of faith we we have to have something within us to respond to God in the first place right so he has to put the deposit in and then he can start to build on it like we talked last time and you get some Faith muscles going through practice and through exercise and I don't want to say too much about exercise so we'll just leave that to your imagination it's one of those things I can talk about maybe not quite produce it myself but I can certainly uh understand when it works for somebody else but faith is a muscle that we have to exercise we have to use and that's why God gives us Valley experiences so faith is the Assurance the confirmation or title deed of the things we hope for so I mentioned last time it's worth repeating faith is the things that happened in the past faith in in is the written word the things that we can read the experiences that we've had in our own lives uh help us to have faith for the future and so it's the things we hope for so those are the hope is what's in the future but love remember faith hope and love love is the glue that binds those two things together the love of God our love for God and that's what holds that Faith together with that hope I hope that makes uh some sense so it's the Assurance or confirmation of things that we hope for so if we did not have faith if we did not have the scripture if we did not have the word of God if we did not have past experiences with God it would put our hope and Jeopardy and so if we know that we have hope guess what we must have and we must have faith so we go oh do I have faith well let me ask you this question do you have hope do you believe that you're going to be with the Lord one day you believe that he's going to give us a change in the body that's going to be a catching away we believe that oh we've had faith so it goes together and the way we know that we have that is because the love of God is abroad in our hearts because of what he's done for us because he loves us and he says that it's the proof of things we do not see it's the proof of things in another dimension and I just want to remind you of my one of my favorite verses Romans chapter 1 verse 20 for the invisible things of him from the very beginning are now clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even his eternal power in Godhead so that they are with that excuse so when the scripture says it's proof of things we do not see well there are things that we can see that's proof of another world of another dimension of another place that we can at least believe it exists or it's hard for us to imagine or picture but we know that it's there the scripture tells us it's there and by faith we believe that but it's the proof of those things things that gives us the foundation that we need for our daily lives and it says it's the conviction of their reality so the things we don't see the things that in another dimension it's it convinces us of their reality and Faith perceiving as real fact what is not revealed to our five senses amazing it's so powerful and and it does bear a little bit of study and reading it and leading the Lord just drop this into your heart for by faith and now we're reading that verse again trust and holy further born of faith the men of old had Divine test and he born to them and obtained a good report so right away Paul goes back to past experience he says now the reason we know this thing about faith is look back at those other guys and he spends a whole chapter on that and then he finishes that chapter with but they without us to not be made perfect and so that is our Our Heritage brother and sister that is where we stand today is built on the foundation of the Apostles and the prophets that came before us that's our foundation we're not making this up this isn't imaginary this isn't wishful thinking this isn't mysticism this isn't myths and legends all right this is the word of God and we have the reality of a whole chapter of God's Hall of Fame if you like his whole of faith of people that we can look back and say if he did it for him he can do it for me the same and we praise God for that and it's so it's such an incredible chapter but I love the way it ends and right they obtained a good report and so we want to brother and sister have that good report and now I'm not I don't have this on my slides but I'll just read it um end of Hebrews chapter 11 verse 39 and these all having obtained a good report so he goes back to that concept through faith received not the promise they hoped for a better future they had a vision of what God had said was going to happen but it didn't happen for them it wasn't yet time it wasn't fulfilled so we also have to have that kind of faith that when we're waiting for something like a house to sell that we can have faith right that God is still on the throne that he still knows the end from the beginning he still has a a plan and a purpose in everything that he does because even if we don't receive the promise today we know that one day we will receive that promise and so that's exactly what he says in verse 40. God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect wherefore now chapter breaks can be sometimes confusing in scripture because if you're following are wrong you'll notice that the wherefore comes in chapter 12 but I want you to ignore that chapter break for now and realize that wherefore is a connecting word it's a conjunction and it's bringing together the previous thought so not really make sense to perhaps start another chapter right here but if we understand that we can just keep reading that they without us should not be made perfect wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses to Faith witnesses to Faith people who aren't guessing about faith people who aren't wondering about faith people who've already obtained a good report they're testifying of the goodness and greatness of God even though they hadn't yet received the promise and that's our testimony as well we should be testifying even though we may be seeing a delay a little bit so wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside and run the pace the race with patients so I just want to emphasize the clouds for a minute Jesus ascended into heaven he was caught up in the clouds and we know that at that time there were Believers from the previous uh ages that had come up when Jesus resurrected and was seen about the streets of Jerusalem and then they ascended with Jesus on the on on what we call the Ascension Day and that that is what made the clouds the clouds of witnesses with these old men of faith and Women of Faith and they had now been caught up Jesus was now in their midst as as proof of their faithfulness of their good report that that what they had done was pleasing to him he was now in their midst as a beautiful picture of what it will be like for us one day so we have faith and we have hope and this passage gives us both shows us the faith that the people had and the hope that they without us should not be made perfect so if these people are going to get it I'm gonna get it there's no question about that because otherwise God's going to shortchange these guys he's going to have given them such a such a glowing reference here if you think of this as a as a reference their testimony right that they've got a great reference from God about how wonderfully they had done and then he's going to let them all down because we're not going to have that resurrection that we're looking forward to impossible so we know that this is a faith that we can hold on to now having said that we're going to emphasize this point in the natural we fight in the natural we resist the enemy in the natural we have to dedicate ourselves to God to to remember our said about washing the clothes which by the way I got in trouble because I left the stain on one of the shirts wow so it had to be put back in the Washington I'm not an expert yet so but I mentioned the fact that in order to wash clothes you have to dip them in a liquid you can't just rub them so it works on its own can't get you anywhere but if by faith in the word of God and under the blood of Jesus we can put our lives into that liquid and now anything we do is going to help so I also want to stress in the natural we work in the natural we're doing things but it's not a natural battle what wasn't against flesh and blood it's not a natural it's a spiritual battle which means that we're fighting in another dimension that's why it's important for us to understand faith comes from that other dimension because it's in that Dimension that we're going to do better and so when brother Adam says I must fight if I should Reign he's saying fight a spiritual battle the the greatest Battleground is in the mind and increase my courage look he says this is not a picnic ground this is a Battlefield and I've often said this when I realized how the Lord Works in our lives and he sometimes raises the steepness of the mountain like I talked about last time and makes us have to put in a little bit more effort I realized that when we sing the song I don't know if if we sing it here or not and if we do forgive me but it's every day with Jesus is sweeter than the day before I think some of us might um have a little bit of a difficulty at times singing that with conviction all right because in one way it is obviously in the spiritual realm in the great big scheme of things but sometimes when we're going a long life's journey it's not so much the the bed of roses that that song would imply and certainly brother Renner mentions that this is not a picnic ground it's a battlefield and so we're still on Battle speed we haven't yet hit ramming speed but we're going to get there if we're going to finish on time today so he also says this and God brought his people to Jordan when it was raging the highest now this isn't the passage that I'm going to be talking about today this wasn't category this was when they actually had to cross over so as if God hadn't put enough obstacles in their way with Giants and and the hittats and the amorites and the jebusites and the mosquito bites and everybody that was surrounding them at that time that was making them fear to go across the Jordan at karishbarnia all right now that they actually can get across now he says okay let's try this at full flood and let's see how your faith is now but of course all the faithless ones were gone so uh God certainly knows how to test his people and so we read that in Joshua 3 verse 15 and as they that bore the ark were coming to Jordan and the feet of the priests at all the awkward dipped in the brim of the water for Jordan overflowed all his Banks all the time of the Harvest oh gee thanks it could have just been a little little trickle right I mean we could have made it easy but no that's not God's plan and Brethren says oh I wished I had some way I could place that into the heart of the people maybe you've been brought up against the difficulty right in your Christian experience that you question God why and this is not a place where we lay back and say now Lord you just come and force it right in me and then I'll do it oh no he says God never did it that way so in Joshua chapter 1 verse 3 we read this great promise every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that have I given unto you as I said unto Moses so now the banner the the has been the Baton has been passed from Moses to Joshua and God actually says to Joshua I'm going to establish you in the eyes of the people I'm going to make the sign that they're going to believe that as I was with Moses so I'll be with you and then he gives Joshua the same promise that he gives that he gave to Moses and the the difference is that what Joshua learned what the people learned in this is that in the natural footsteps of possession in the natural we have to take the step of faith we have to believe that there's a Supernatural That's guiding the natural but in the natural we have to respond and I'll spend most of the service today uh talking around that concept of our responsibility in this process so he goes on to say that land is yours every bit of it that was the promise to Joshua and I love that every bit of it and by the way if you're thinking what is the promised land for us today it's this you remember the promised land was bordered by water on all sides it was the Jordan the Euphrates the river of Egypt and the Mediterranean if you like the great sea and so the promised land was bordered by water and we have the water of the word of God that borders our faith that's the framework in which Faith exists all right and it's bordered by the Water by the word of God every every bit of it now the people today are expecting God to reach down and get them by the next say yes that's right you bring me out to clean me off heal me I'll believe you God doesn't do this business that way he gives you the promise but you have to fight for every inch of ground that you possess he gives you the promise to establish Faith From Another Dimension from the dimension of his word and remember from the dimension of his character remember we talked about you can believe him because we know him and we believe in the character of God we're not just reading words on a page it's a there's a person a trustworthy faithful person behind this word and that's the one that we're believing in we're believing in him and so he says but you have to fight for it so it's not it I mean it's it's it's relatively simple right we're not in that other dimension we're in this Dimension a warning sin-shaped iniquity we are we are sinners uh saved by grace so there's a battle that goes on Paul says between the spirit and the flesh there's there's this other dimension that is trying to get a hold of us and and we're in touch with gravity we're in touch with that other thing that's holding us back and so guess what we have to fight against that and Paul says I died daily because of that because there is a natural battle so we keep going now here's what it is it's easy to feel the power of God on the mountaintops that's what we talked about last time but the problem with the Mountaintop is your fruit will freeze up there are at fruit grows in the valley and by the way just uh while I'm thinking about it I did have a picture but it's not very clear they just recently discovered the tallest tree in Asia uh uh forget all the details but they they have a photograph it's growing in a Gorge it's growing in a valley and the valley is so deep that for this tree to have survived it's had to grow hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of feet for 800 years it's been growing seeking the light out of this dark Valley and so the tallest tree in Asia is growing in a valley and so remember we talked about us being like trees right the planted by rivers of Living Water so in order for us to grow big and strong and tall in faith in Texas Valley and so we we we don't appreciate the belly so much at the time but we understand that we're going to grow through that experience all right so then he says it's easy to feel the power of God to see it when you believe but then when it comes to The Showdown are you able to possess the thing that you profess to have that's the physical side that's reaching into the other dimension reaching into eternity and grasping what we say we have do you remember Luther if you've ever seen the old Luther film make sure it's the old one um that uh he said to his friend he said the problem is I've got it here and I can give it out here he was a theologian he said but here something's still missing all right and so we've got to go from understanding it in the mind that's where members soul body Soul spirit that the study have done many times but it starts in the spirit and then it goes to the soul and then it goes to the body that's how it works so the spirit is where we get convicted the spirit is where the word of God speaks to us that's what that other dimension that's the spiritual side of us that can be in touch with that other damage and not our natural senses but our spiritual senses so when we have those spiritual senses tuned then our mind can receive what God wants us to have and then from there it drops into our soul and from there it starts to manifest itself in our lives that's the way it works so the thing that you're a he says are you able to possess the thing that you profess to her in other words Hazard dropped from knowing it as I think toza said faith is more than just a mental Ascent to truth it's not just agreeing with the word of God it's more than that so are you able to possess the thing that you profess to have that's something that we can really stop and dwell on and ask the Lord to help us because only he can give us that so when fear strikes we'll spend some time talking about fear right in the path of Duty so we sometimes feel no no that's not fair I was doing your work Lord and and this happened and that happened listen brother let me say this if you're walking in the light having fellowship with god with his people when the Holy Spirit is upon you and you meet an obstacle right in the path of Duty don't stop just keep printing on God Will Make A Way through it and he's using that whole Hebrews chapter 11 to back up this statement it was not worthy all right even though they had all these difficulties they're in God's Hall of faith God is giving them a good testimonial a good report and he says God Will Make A Way Through It so in Deuteronomy 6 23 as we come back to our uh our story about Joshua and the 12 Spies at kadeshbania in Deuteronomy chapter 6 verse 23 they're recapping this and he says he brought us out from there from Egypt that he might bring us in to give us the land which he swore and and to our fathers so he's just saying this isn't uh the end here we're in Deuteronomy things are looking pretty bad here we're going around and around this mountain by the way if you're struggling with faith right now you might find yourself going around the mountain a few times because it's a little bit like brother rap would uh would uh would tell me that if they don't pass the test they have to take the test again all right and they didn't pass the test so God put them another lap around the mountain and it was 40 years that they went they were slow Learners and so they went around the mountain for 40 years before God got rid of that generation and was able to take a new believing generation into the promised land and so this is what Moses is reminding them of he brought us out but it wasn't just to bring us out it was to bring us in so it brings us out of the world but he brings us into his word Numbers Chapter 13 Verse 30 and I love this and Caleb Still the people they were all like oh these are big people oh it's terrible and Caleb's like whoa nope wait just a minute may I say something and he's still the people before Moses and said let us go up at once and possess it and I want to stress that at once now we may not see the Fulfillment at once but we have to have the response at once I remember I said delayed obedience is Disobedience so we do not want to delay our response God can delay that's his prerogative he knows what he's doing he knows the end from the beginning but our response can't be delayed we have to go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it and I want you to notice the anointing that was on these people that came up against what Caleb just said this is the very next verse but the men that went up with him said we be not able to go the same phrase just they're a little little word and where do we remember that from Garden of Eden Thou shalt not surely die so this little word not is a very uh strong indicator of who's actually speaking here and this isn't those 10 spies that's their voice but the the the the spirit behind that is the same spirit that tried to successfully get Eve to disbelieve the work that's the same spirit that was on these ten spies because they said we'd be not able so Caleb started a church and his church was called we be able and then then another church came up and they had a different denomination and they would be be not able and so that's what we've got to be conscious of is which side are we voting for are we on the voting for The be able side or the not able side and that's exactly the choice that God places before us in these valleys of decision that's the purpose of the valley you go into a valley you're either going to go forward you're going to go backwards you can't really go up the side of the mountain and so if you remember The Charge of the Light Brigade into the valley of death wrote the 600 all right and it's because they were forced to go forward there was no there was nothing else they could do because they were in the valley of decision and once you commit to that path you've got to go through it and that's exactly what we have to do we do not want to be listening uh to the uh those that don't have faith so it takes courage this is an interesting word because we think of faith and we think of our spiritual walk as being all God of course the foundation the the experience the work everything is of God everything is by the hand of God but we have a role to play in that because in the natural we've got to take possession of what we're being given in the Supernatural realm in the spiritual realm and it takes courage to let go of the natural things the things we can feel taste here smell and touch anyway those five natural senses that's what we have to let go of in order for those five spiritual senses to be able to be in touch with what God is telling us and then we've got to come back and apply that in our lives but we've got to let go of what's familiar and comfortable and we read this when they actually start to go through now into Canaan in Joshua chapter 3 verse 4 that you may know the way you may know the way Joshua's name actually is Jesus in the Hebrew it's Joshua Savior and you may know the way by which you must go for you have not passed this way heretofore before in other words this is a new experience for you and it's going to be a trial it's going to be a challenge there are going to be missteps remember Aiken's wedge there's going to be all kinds of things they're going to March around this huge City for seven days they're going to do things they've never done before and I want to say that's a characteristic of a valley experience that you're going to be encouraged to do things that you've never done before to let go of the things that are familiar and comfortable and go into a place that you've not been before and that's what faith is Faith takes you to a higher and a higher and a higher level and it never stops until this body has changed so there's no point in trying to avoid that we we are going to go through challenges but it's our response to the challenges that makes the difference so if you're taking off like the pilgrims did and you want to discover a new land you've got to go where you've never been to get what you've never had that's what going where we've never been to get what we've never had God wouldn't be wasting our time if I can put it that way trying to get us to achieve things that we achieved five years ago so when we look back at our experience with faith with God and we go oh you know I I've I've got it I had Faith um let me see it was 1972 I think and no that doesn't work that well right it's going to be from glory to glory it's going to be adding like we said last time from Faith to Faith we're going to have to exercise that muscle it's going to be a growth process this isn't a comfort zone process this isn't going up at one stage and then stopping and I want you to Picture This Jacob's Ladder you always and we're gonna have to speed up right here so Jacob's letter Jacob saw the the path to Heaven if you like as a ladder but I want you to know that some ladders I don't know if you've seen this but some letters like a rope ladder actually has the rung sticking out past the edge of the of the Rope right you you have the rungs going up but it's not like your normal step ladder stops at the sides the rope ladder the rungs go a little bit further out and the picture that I got was seeing this path to Heaven as as Jacob's Ladder was that Satan doesn't mind how high you climb up that ladder all he wants to make sure of is that at some point you could not that you go back down not that you go oh no I don't believe any of this you just take a step sideways the smallest little step sideways and you park yourself on the side of this ladder and others are going up but you're stuck on the side because you've sit that far and no further and that's a trap of the enemy you feel like you're still in the same position but in actual fact you're not because now you should have gone another couple of rungs up the ladder but you're parked on the side and I can tell you that Caleb demonstrated that this idea of no we are able we can go further we can go into areas that we haven't been before and he said this um I'm just paraphrasing he says God's called us to be climbers not campers all right we're not supposed to just have be in our tents here and be content to sit and wait this out on the banks of the Jordan we have to be climbers we have to go the other step and to get where you've never been you have to uh to get what you've never the way you've never been you have to get what you've never had so the only way to discover new oceans and lands is to lose sight of your own Shoreline so I've been uh on the ocean I grew up in Durban and so I've been on the ocean you can see the shoreline in the distance it's very comforting when you get a little bit over the horizon and it's blue ocean all the way around you that's a little bit disconcerting that is definitely disconcerting depending on how big the boat is it wasn't a very big boat and so I was a little bit concerned and it was quite a swell and so yes that was uh that you know I enjoyed the experience afterwards and it was fun to talk about but at the time I was about 10 11 hours a bit nervous but you see if you're gonna discover some strength that you didn't have before you're going to have to lose sight of your own Shoreline you're going to have to lose sight of the familiar and the comfortable you're going to have to lose sight of the safety net that you think is necessary in your life and you have to be able to put all your trust and faith in God because these people said we be not able to go up for they are stronger and so they overestimated the enemies strength position and it destroys faith it erodes confidence and it warps our perspective so when we look at a situation from the perspective of our enemy when they saw when we were like grasshoppers in our sight is because their perspective had been warped by what they saw rather than by what God had said and we have to be so careful of what we see versus what we believe what did God say not how does it look to me that's irrelevant it's how does it look to God and if we can believe that then we can have faith now I was talking about myths and legends maybe this is another one so I don't know if you're familiar with this story I love the story it's uh Legends of the Texas Rangers all right and it was a riot in this town and so they sent off an urgent telegram to the Texas Rangers town in Riot many dead sent help I said telegram Telegraph and so they get a reply back from the Rangers and they said help is on tomorrow's train so they were relieved and so the next day all the townspeople gather at the station and they're all waiting for the Ranger to show up and they've got their reception committee and you know people are dying things are just chaotic and the town prices are burning down and so they have confidence that when the Rangers arrive they'll come and clear up the mess and suddenly they'll be uh they'll be saved unfortunately when they were waiting at this station they see one lonely Ranger get off the train and then up where's the rest where's the backup where's where's the Army you know we've got a riot going on yes hundreds of people dying and whatever and the ranger just straightens his back and looks at them with those Steely eyes you know and he says one right one range and we have our Ranger don't we it doesn't matter what the fire is doesn't matter what Riot is going on in your heart it doesn't matter what the circumstances are all we need is one Ranger and that's our Lord Jesus Christ that's all we need and he doesn't need an army he is the army so Israel perceived the Giants to be greater than his promises in first John 4 4 you're of God little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world and if you see Memes uh on the internet you'll have seen something about uh the the Giants before you or nothing compared to the God within you and it's based on this verse and it's absolutely true it wasn't so commonly used I would have I would have brought it up but it seems like everybody's using that these days but it's the Giants before you are nothing compared to the god that is within you so remember faith is the substance of things hoped for but Israel wasn't focusing on the substance they weren't focusing on what God had told Moses what God had told Joshua they weren't focusing on the past experiences of all the times that God had delivered them and their shoes didn't wear it they were fed every day they found water in the middle of a desert all of those things were somehow brushed away by the evidence of their eyes the land was well fortified the children of anarch were giants the size and strength of the enemy made them forget who they were and the ten spiers said seeing is believing and I've heard that before seeing with the eyes of faith is believing that's what we should be seeing we should be seeing the promise we should be seeing the word of God we should be seeing by revelation but not with our natural thinking with our natural eyes the eyes of Doubt only see problems the eyes of Faith only see promises so the substance of faith is based on what they had experienced before that's what they should have been holding on to Lord you've done all these things first we're going to read your hosapets jehoshaphat's uh uh prayer here soon uh and um and and I want you to see how he plays on this the past experiences and how he he gets God's attention with his prayers it's wonderful so they had experienced something before but it was blotted out when the Israelites heard the bad report of the faith of the spies so now we're remembering this scripture it's a substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen so even though they had experienced all this it wasn't enough you see they needed a revelation of what was happening of what God was doing in their lives and so they needed not to be basing their faith just on those experiences those experiences help but there's got to be something a little more than that a little deeper than that and that's the revelation of God's will in your heart and they knew God's will God's will was have brought you out and I'm going to take you in and they lost sight of that they had no Revelation that God the same God that brought them out was going to bring them in that he was as the New Testament says the author and finisher of our faith so these 10 faithless spies the Bible says they brought up an evil report of the land now that's interesting because it wasn't evil because it wasn't true it was an evil report because they overestimated the power of the enemy in the face of the promise of God so when God gives a promise that's it it doesn't matter what the report is from the doctors or from your parents or your teachers or whoever it might be that's not what counts That's overestimating The Power of being and we do not want to underestimate God relative to the problems that we're facing Israel got so close right at the water's edge to God's purpose and they were on the brink of fulfilling that promise literally and figuratively right at the brink right at the Jordan and they turned back in fear and here's the consequence of that because they believed the evil report they became bitter hard-hearted unbelieving and there was only one way God could deal with that and that was to wear them out in the desert until their faith or lack thereof became evident and they died whether it was disease or whatever we'll get to that and so we remember the scripture sing the song I Love It Isaiah 53 verse 1 who has believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed and that's a rhetorical question who has believed it right he's not curious he just wants to know if you believe it do you believe his report and that's the one that we want to hold on to don't believe what people say teachers parents doctors doesn't matter real estate agents we have to believe what God's word says now when I talk about training for reigning this is that tree that grew in the in this deep gorge and how it struggled to find the light and just went up higher and higher over hundreds of years it's because that's where God trains us for reigning we know that we're going to rule and reign with him in the Millennium that's the promise that we have and so we have to be trained for that we're not going to learn these lessons in the Millennium when we're in our in our Supernatural body and our Supernatural form we have to learn those lessons here we have to be trained here and so these were some of the values that if I had time I would have gone into of course we're talking about ashkol now but we'd also go to ajalan and in the wilderness of Edom but eventually we're going to talk a little bit today about and that was the most wonderful experience that I I I just can't get enough of that story and we'll talk about that yet for a few minutes and if I had time I would just read the whole chapter because it's so inspiring please read the chapter that's why I put up all the verses 1 to 27 I'm just not going to have time to do it today then some came and told Jehoshaphat saying a great multitude is coming against you from Beyond the Sea from Syria and they are in all right and so that's the valley that they were in all right and so now that there's a problem a great multitude is coming against them and here's uh part of jehoshaphat's Prayer he said oh Lord God of our fathers and I can guarantee you this was not a whispered prayer this is heartfelt desperate prayer they are faced with their absolutely insurmountable group of armies that are coming for them and Jehoshaphat is praying and here is the nature of his prayer he's I'm sorry he said O Lord God of our fathers art not thou God in heaven aren't you the man aren't you the one we've put all our faith and trust in all these years aren't you him aren't you the guy that we can counter in times of trouble aren't you that one the God in heaven and don't you rule over all the kingdoms of the heathen and in your hand is there not power and might so that none is able to withstand you what a prayer he's not pleading he's possessing he's taking ownership of what he believes God is and who God is and how God can respond in the situation he is showing his confidence in the word of God but it doesn't end there he keeps going aren't not thou Our God who did drive out the inhabitants of this land before the thy People Israel aren't you the same yesterday today and forever unto the Lord that changes not and I I just love the negative way that he's doing it it's like it's like it's like rhetoric it's like he's got a certain Cadence to his speech and and I don't know who his speechwriter was but he was pretty good because this reads in such an exciting way aren't you the god aren't you the one that rules don't you have all power [Music] right and he did and so we've jumped the story and so on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley for there they blessed the Lord I'll tell you what happened God's tunic buttons were popping after that prayer he goes whoa this guy really trusts me and he has confidence in my character who I am that guy I am the man oh now he says aha under these conditions I want you guys to all set up the bleachers and I want you just to take a seat at the Battleground because the battle is mine tomorrow it's not yours and it's not the Kings the Battle Is Mine and I want you to sit back and see the salvation of God and he says the same thing to us today and we can pray the same prayer and we can have the same rejoicing on the fourth day after everything is done and they've seen God and their whole praise team was called out and they went marching into battle singing uh the Praises of God the beauty the beauty of holiness and singing great other other ways Lord God Almighty from revelation can imagine that great praise team one day in Revelation chapter that four or five now five I think and he says Great and Mighty are thou Works Lord God Almighty for thou has created has all things created and for that pleasure they were created and that's the song that we're going to be singing and that's the song they sang into battle against these folk when God was fighting the battle for us we have that same God fighting the battle for us today and what does mean it means a blessing a benediction invocation of good it's what they began to understand about God after that experience they probably didn't know that beforehand but afterwards they knew where there had been this was a valley of blessing this was a valley of benediction this was a a good value but that only happens afterwards so we're going to look at these principles I think we're going to hit battle speed I know we're ramming speed number one it's brought you through valleys before right and that's what um that's what jehoshaphat's prayer was and once you're through this Valley God will have become more real and your relationship will have increased in depth and you'll be even more secure in his love so that's why we have value experiences and he says aren't you our God who did this this and this and this all right and then he said and gave it to the Seed of Abraham thy friend forever and so we are Abraham's seed by faith we have the faith of Abraham and so it's our promise as well and in Jeremiah 33 verse 3 says call unto me and I will answer thee and show you Great and Mighty things God wants us to call on God wants us to pray jehoshaphat's prayer aren't you aren't you the same God save me didn't you heal me the last time didn't you save me didn't you do something for my family Lord aren't you the one that rules I'm looking to you Lord and faith is cultivated in the valley so that's where we have to grow the fruit and once you're through the valley God will have become more real relationships will have increased in depth and you'll be even more secure in his love and that same passage in in Chronicles that we've been reading he says Be not Afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude for the battle is not yours but gods and so because we're talking about another dimension because you're talking about faith coming from another dimension it's not our faith it's his faith that he gives to us the battle is not ours it's God's he is fighting the battle and he's giving us the tools to do it so this is not your battle you shall not need to fight in this battle is the way God continues in that Passage stand ye still so we're talking about fighting we talk about footsteps opposition we're talking about taking hold of the promise and not just being a professor but a possessor in the natural but in the spiritual you do not need to fight this battle this isn't something you're gonna win in your own strength greater is he that is in me than is in the world not greater is me it's greater to see that is in me and so we do not fight the battle that battle is fought in the presence of God and with a revelation from God he says stand you still and see the salvation of the Lord fear not remember I said fear is the is like the second side of the coin of faith fear is just like faith but in a negative sense and so we do not want to believe things that do not come from scripture we do not want to believe what people say what the devil says we want to believe what God says so we do not fear nor are we dismayed tomorrow go out against them for the Lord will be with you and Jesus promised us that he would be in us even to the end of that so the promised land can't be attained by human ability so even though we're talking about all these natural actions it has to come from Revelation it has to come from the spirit realm God by faith gives it to those who are willing to put their complete trust in it and remember possess the promise and you'll possess the enemy's Gates that's what they learned at karishbanya we've got to get it we've got to take it it's ours but you'll fight for every inch and so we don't think of this as a picnic we don't think of this as a bit of roses we don't think of this as the as the the Primrose path we think of this as a Battlefield we think of this as an uphill battle because we're in the flesh and what we're working with is coming from another dimension it's coming from a different world and everything that we do here in the natural is from the perspective of God's revelation in our heart Deuteronomy 1 verse 21 behold the Lord God has set the land before you go up and possess it as the Lord God of your fathers has said unto you fear not neither be discouraged so God is Not confined by our limitations this is principle number five if you face the challenge don't give up and say well I can't see a way out of this you're looking at the circumstances you're limiting your understanding of God of Faith by what you're seeing with your natural Arts so you facing a challenge no question but don't give up in the face of the challenge because if you think there's no way out that implies that you've thought of everything and I hate to say this but it is of strong possibility that God might have thought of something you haven't it's just a very small possibility that he knows something you don't know is is that possible yes he knows a lot of things I don't know and so for me to give up is to go okay well I know there's no way out of this and if you want God to be proud of you and to give you a good report that's not going to work he doesn't want to hear that you're giving up right and I will say this and we kind of took off the ramming speed for a minute when when we know what God has said and we put our faith in our trust in that all right and we know that he's still on the throne and we know that we can't know the end from the beginning or the future we know that he knows all those things and so we look to him the author and the finish of our faith we don't look to the circumstance we don't look to the difficulty so we may not see a way but God has already seen the future and the way in which your problem will be overcome he already knows he's already provided for it while you yet speak I will answer you isn't that amazing before you ask I'll hear you and while you yet speak I will I will I will answer you I'll stop trying to quote that verse so we continue with this idea of God's Not confined by our limitations when you can't see a way around the problem look away from the problem and look to the sufficiency of God and I'm going to give you this little story I read I've got a big picture book at home it's called Earth and its photos from the original space missions the guys orbiting around Earth and one of the pictures is of the Himalayas or as some people say Himalayas and they're looking down right on the tallest mountains in the world at least the ones above sea level and they're looking at Everest and they're saying we can't even really see which of these Peaks is Everest because they're looking down so when you're looking up at a problem it looks enormous but as Zechariah said these mountains shall become mole Hills from God's perspective he can't even tell that there's a problem what problem I can't even see Everest let alone your problem I can't see these tallest mountains in the world I I just see little snow-capped Peaks because he's looking from above and so when we have a revelation of Faith from God we get God's perspective looking down into our situation and he does not see the difficulties the way we see them so instead of looking at this great big mountain in front of us from our Valley perspective let's come up a little bit higher and see it from God's perspective and focus then on God's sufficiency and faith is where we look beyond the problem and see the security of knowing who God is knowing his character When Faith is quickened the circumstances crumble it's like the whole Mountain just begins to dissolve when we're looking at it from God's perspective and then number six principle is hearing and obeying hearing only counts I want to tell you this because we often quote this scripture quite rightly faith comes by hearing hearing comes by the word but hearing only counts when we start to obey what we've heard those uh those israeliteshwania they've heard it they've heard it all they had heard all the preaching they've seen all the Miracles the only thing they were missing was acting on what they'd heard being willing to act only Joshua and Caleb were willing to act on what they had heard and so we have to obey what we've heard that means to apply it and to act upon what we know I think I missed one saying you believe and not acting is what happened to Israel at California saying you believe professing but not possessing I mentioned about the laundry I love this saying as well faith is like a Swiss Swatch it takes good works to make it useful it's got to be a sound mechanism it's got to have something that shows you what the time is in our lives we're not trying to impress God God doesn't need to be you know his information to be reinforced he doesn't need to take up temperature he knows exactly how our faith is but we need to have our faith temperature taken he needs to show us so Romans chapter 2 verse 13 for not the hearers of the law are just or Justified before God but the doers of the law shall be justified very important scripture Revelation chapter 1 verse 3 blessed is he that reads and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep act and apply those things and keep those things which are written there and for the time is at hand so we mustn't accept the Judgment of Our Own Heart our own thoughts God's thoughts are higher than our thoughts his ways are not our ways and so we cannot trust our own way of thinking that's where we run into difficulty that's what happened to Eve that's what happened in every case of anybody that failed God in the scripture they were acting on their own thoughts and ideas about how things should be and the fact that you've failed in some way doesn't affect God's love for you it doesn't matter God is not looking at you day by day and and putting you in the scales of justice and going oh tilt yep yep we went over there sorry I'm gonna have to bring you all the way back to the beginning now we're gonna have to start this process again so you want to come to the whole thing you want to get saved and you've got to get baptized and we'll keep we'll start this process again nope no because he's already got a picture of us in his wallet he carries around the picture I don't know if God's got a wallet but it's a good idea right and he's got a picture of us and when we slip up he just takes it out and he takes a look at it and he goes ha that's the one I'm looking for that's the picture he took of us at the foundation of the world he knows our destiny he knows where we're going he knows how we're going to get there and he knows what he has to do to bring it about and so he we are not letting God down in the sense that we have to go back and start again it's just for us to know where we stand that's what this is all about it doesn't affect his promises and the fact that you've failed doesn't affect God's love for you he still loves us so hearing and obeying we read that oh I'm going backwards so I wondered why it's coming up again so we have to slow down our ramming speed so what is number eight what is another principle for life in the valley faith in the valley it's our goal that we manifest Christ in the valley it's a little bit easier on the Mountaintop but in the valley that's a little bit more challenging but we are going on to our Heaven reward our goal is not to fight Giants by the way we think oh we know we've got to have all these battles yeah not exactly he'll provide the giant killing strength if we need it but killing Giants is not the destination remember possessing the land was the destination manifesting The Life of Christ in all situations that's the destination that's God's purpose that's why we're here that's what he's bringing about in our lives and so God expects us to possess that future right now he's called us out of Egypt he wants us to be his beautiful bride without spot and without blemish a glorious Church and he wants us to be the beneficiary of his inheritance and every step we take toward that promise will be prospered by God because he said every place on which you put so true I've given it to you footsteps opposition it will be prospered by God God will and detect for you but we have to possess those promises not just talk about them so this happened in Jerusalem as we close here just the last couple of slides and when he was come near he beheld the city and Jesus wept over if we all know when Jesus wept over Jerusalem saying if you had known even though I love that even thou I wonder is that talking to us today is that why it says even though that we go even Stephen even even you yeah yes you you know that that's what it looks like to me he says if you had known even you at least in this thy day and we all know this is a particular day the things which belong unto your peace can you see what Jesus is saying he said oh Jerusalem he said all of this today this was your hour of Deliverance this was everything the prophets had looked for this this was where you would accept your Messiah and if you could only have accepted it that would have been the Peace of Jerusalem that was promised but now they are hip from your eyes for the day shall come upon you that your enemies shall lay the even flat on the ground because you knew not the time of your visitation and so I want to say this When Faith arises that's the time to step in when God gives us that Revelation when we see what's happening in a spiritual sense in in the Eternal sense in what God's plan and purpose for us is and when we recognize that and we step into it when we possess those things then we're recognizing our day and its message not just in a doctrinal sense but in an everyday faith-filled life since that every day we need to have that experience with God in trials and in good times we need to have that touch if I can put it that way that experience with the supernatural we can't just put everything into a natural realm and then at another time another place a spiritual realm no those two things have to come together we have to live in that Realm by God's grace and just to show you that in the same Valley we're a whole nation found failure two people found faith so this isn't common this isn't easy this isn't something that you can just lay back as for the random said and just expect it to happen that God take you by the throne push you into this situation where he can show himself Mighty on your behalf he wants you to go but Lord aren't you that God aren't you the God who did all these things for me and didn't you do this for my brother and my sister the other day and I believe you can do for me the same and so two people found faith I want you to remember this as a principle of God one in a million you remember the same word that we believe the same word of faith the same faith that we hold on to when when things are tough we hold on to their faith from the word of God he says that faith that rock is a stone of stumbling to those who don't believe you see the the same Circumstance the same Valley the same enemy everything's the same the only difference is two people trusted the word of God and so we have to be super on our on our guard at guard against falling into a trap where we don't reach out and take possession of what God has given us now you might miss an opportunity that you can ever get back maybe there may be another come around the corner but that one you may have missed so don't be slow to obey action is can you obey quickly and the Hebrews Disobedience as we get ready to close the history of their time in the desert is brief and it's bitter and the desert was a place that their Journey their wilderness wanderings was a desert of the disease defeat and finally death and for some reason I can't see my notes so I had I had some statistics here and I'll try and remember them but for that period of time that they were wandering in the wilderness after kadeshbania where disease and defeat resulted in death they estimate that there were about 90 people a day that had to die to get rid of that generation and those that were alive had to dig and bury the dead they had to dig a grave and no sooner they dug one then there was that and there was another one too and fat and another one and so they were dying and falling dying and falling every day for the next 40 years to get rid of that generation and so you can see the consequence of sin when those people that had listened to the faithless spies and they went back on their journey and they were digging Graves every day they were thinking back to that decision that they made at kadishmania to listen to those ten spies when they should have listened to Joshua and Caleb because those people all died and the tip for the generation of kids that came out of Egypt not one of them except Joshua and Caleb made it and so I'll finish with this as the musicians come Isaiah chapter 54 13 great shall be the Peace of your children they shall be taught of the Lord great will be the Peace of your children Jesus said you would have had peace if you could have just heard my voice if you could have just responded you would have had this peace and II Chronicles chapter 16 verse 9. for the eyes of the Lord ran to and fro throughout the whole Earth to show himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him he wants to show himself strong let's stand he wants to show himself strong he wants us to call upon him he wants us to say Lord I can't do this on my own I know you've called me and I know I'm part of your plan but Lord I need you every hour of every day I need you to come and give me the faith give me the strength give me the revelation of your word in my heart that Lord I can face this battle I can face these Giants without fear and without disappointment without discouragement but with confidence and that we can go where we haven't been before through this trial because we know what your word says and so let's bow our heads Lord Jesus we do want to come before you've thrown the sea this morning Lord or this afternoon we do want to acknowledge you in all our ways and believe that you will direct our paths and Lord where we lack faith we pray Lord that you would fill us up bring from that Heavenly realm Lord pour into us the faith that we need for our circumstances for every trial for healing Lord for deliverance for whatever the challenge of the day may be Lord we know you have a solution from your kingdom Lord that you can pour into our lives Lord we love you we love what you've done for us we love what you have done for us in the past but lord it's a new day it's a new trial it's a new opportunity Lord for us to rise in our faith and Lord we pray that you would help us to come up a little bit higher Even in our daily lives Lord in this Natural Life and Lord may we have the faith and the courage to take another step to move into those areas that we haven't been in before and to see what you have plan for wrestle through the trial the testimony that you want us to have we pray Lord that you would take away everything the obstacle that would prevent that Lord every unbelief every doubt every circumstance that we give too much power to that Lord we would realize you are the all-powerful and Lord I just pray and speak to every heart call all of us that are going through a valley Lord I just pray that you would come and meet us Lord with those streams of Living Water and that Lord you would just fill us to overfly wash us with your word Lord cleanse us Lord Jesus and give us the victory that you've promised would be ours we ask them all in Jesus name amen thank you brother Michael [Music]
