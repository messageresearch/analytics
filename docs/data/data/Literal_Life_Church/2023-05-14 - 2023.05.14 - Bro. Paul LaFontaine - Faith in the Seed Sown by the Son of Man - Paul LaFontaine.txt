========================================

apologize for some of the babies yelling out in the background there doesn't make it as peaceful you might have put some of those babies on the project Henry because that's that probably fits that's normal you're going to hear that in your home too amen well if you can stand with me we're going to read in the scripture together James chapter 5 a portion of scripture there and in Matthew 13. yes so we have a gift for you in the back all the moms so make sure you pick that up there in the gym after the service James chapter 5 and then we'll go back and pick up one verse in Matthew chapter 13. James chapter 5. and verse 7 and 8. be patient therefore Brethren unto the coming of the Lord behold the husband men waited for the precious fruit of the Earth the husbandman is the farmer the farmer waited for the precious fruit of the Earth in half long patience for it until he received the early and latter rain be also patient establish your hearts for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh amen Matthew Chapter 13 and verse 37. and he answered and said unto them he that soweth the good seed is the son of man I'm going to read that again verse 37 and he answered and said unto them he that soweth the good seed is the son of man father we ask you give us our Lord the the portion that you have given us for today and Lord you spoke in the scripture and says give us our day our daily bread and that's what we're to pray and so Lord you give us every day what we need to sustain us to spiritually be strengthened and so Lord we pray that you'll provide that for us today as we break bread together your bread your word it's your life Lord and so I pray father that your word will go out and minister to every need there's no way that a human being could meet these needs there's no way that a man just with a sermon Lord could meet the needs and these precious people but Lord your word has provided a place we can come an atmosphere we can come your spirit whether the anointing is upon the word and choosing the foolishness of preaching Lord to save some we pray that salvation would come today we pray that encouragement would come today and Lord through the channel that you've given to your people I pray father that each person would be affected in a positive way and come closer to you as we commit this service to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen God bless you may be seated this morning I was uh inspired yesterday as I was last night as I was coming through the uh gym and I seen some of the gifts out there that they had prepared for the moms and they had a little sign by the gifts uh a scripture I think in another version but it's the scripture that says he that soweth to the spirit will reap and I just read that for a second and walked away and I was extremely inspired by that scripture and I think it's an appropriate scripture an appropriate thing to apply to mothers and that is that he that soweth to the spirit because basically that's really what moms do is they're in the sowing years and they have the ability uh to sow many many good things into the child can you say Amen she truly is that she's A sower mom and God must have trusted her to set her in life because he God set this up God created human beings he created the family and created how many years and all those things and then he set up mothers and fathers and so in his plan for some reason God set it up that the mom would have the child in its first formative years in other words mom would have the baby and the child first before anybody else I think God's mind was for that God was thinking and he must have trusted that if it was the right kind of mom that the best person that could be with that child in its most formable years is the mom right there close to them to the to embrace them to teach them to live something in front of them but also to speak to them and most words that are spoken in the early years of our life are spoken by the mom and how many know that words have a powerful effect on us how many know that words are so powerful that you can remember something that was said about you even from your childhood you can remember what was said about you and those words can have still today a powerful effect upon your life and we would raise your hand and say my mother had a powerful effect upon my life and God set it up that way and it was mostly not just her actions but the words that were because you see words are seeds words are something that you plant can you say mine and and so you could live the life in front of them but it's getting across something to that child to that baby and then as they come in as toddlers mom is the one that's with him the most and and those words are seeds being sown and when seeds are sown then later you look and see what results come from the seeds that are sown because the law of harvest and the law of planting it applies to everything in our lives and that is whatever is sown there's going to be a harvest from what's being don't you just don't get to see it till many years later but I can tell you whatever is sown there will be a harvest from that in our lives the principle works and especially with words that are spoken over us and moms do this uh uh in the early years of Our Lives those words from her lips wield such great power over our lives and that spoken word from mom is kind of the Original Seed the spoken word is the Original Seed and those spoken words from mom is kind of the original seed for our lives on Earth can you say Amen building who we are your hair is so shiny and pretty today you have such nice handwriting of course my mom never said that about my handwriting you're brave to go out there and and and play basketball I think you are kind I'm proud of you for trying harder in school I'm glad you're my daughter I'm glad you're my son I'm proud of you I love your dimples they're just so cute these are some practical things that are words that are spoken but guess what she's the first one that says those things and hopefully she's a mom that doesn't always point out to all the flaws in US you have to do correction or you're not a good mom either you have to get a hold of that will or that will will get a hold of you so you have to kind of just break it a little bit but if all that is there without some words about the good can you say Amen then then it's going to be detrimental so this is the kind of I'm just giving simple examples of things that are said that can have a lifelong effect upon us and uh and mothers say that mothers say these things and they give us things in those early years and we may not remember everything although some things you can remember we may not remember everything but there's something in us that and gets embedded in US embedded in our minds and we can go back to something that was said over us personally now Mom can compliment other things mom can compliment dad mom can speak of other things that she enjoys but when she brings a direct a direct compliment to you and your personality and how God made you and that you're fearfully in one word and I love you the way that you are that's a direct personal thing to us and let me say friends if that has a much that much effect upon us oh mother's word spoken to us how much does the word of God have power over us and what he says about us how much the more what he says is true and will have an effect on our spiritual life can you say Amen so having moms with her with their babies of course is the best thing and today we praise that and we praise a man who's able to keep her home that's where she should be is at home with the kids if you can if you can accomplish that so we are thankful for that because that's best for the kid and it's such a powerful impact can I say if a mom can I say it again if a mom could have that by her words in life how much more can God's word affect us for our lives Jesus said my words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are alive my word will have an effect on you the most powerful thing is when he speaks something over our lives the most powerful thing is when God speaks and he's spoken many things but when he speaks personally over our lives can you say Amen it's such a powerful thing everything changed in Abraham's life when God spoke his word for Abraham and guess what when God called Abraham and spoke to him it was a personal word for Abraham and it changed his complete life he was an idolater he had a certain identity and probably would have been an idolater the rest of his life until God came and spoke to him and said no you're you're not you're not an idolater notice God saying a different identity you're not eye doctors because God's going to be speaking from the Lamb's Book of Life can I get an amen here this morning God will be speaking not from the identity you know but God will be speaking from the Lamb's Book of Life and he said to Abraham you're not an idolater I'm going to make you he said who are you said well I'm Barren my wife can't have a child I can't have a child I'm an Abraham that's my that's my name that's my identity I'm Barren and I'm also an idolater and God says no I'm going to change your name from Abraham Abram to Abraham and you're no longer a Barren idolater but you're going to be guess what look at this I'll make a bear in person the father of men Nations when God speaks over your life it changes everything somebody say praise the Lord the power of a mom's word over your life but look at the power of this he said I'll change your name there I'll take Abram and I'm going to stick Abraham on Mr H in there which is actually God which means God I'm going to put myself I'm not gonna I'm gonna identify myself in your name and guess what what's your wife's name Sarai change I'm going to change her name too showing us showing us there's a new name how many knows a revelation speaks of a new name but it's not just the Christ but it's the bride gets a new name as well Hallelujah I might change her name too from Sarai to Sarah I'm going to change your name I'm going to change your life by what the spoken word of God and he says Abraham get thee out from thy Kindred I want you to leave all your Kindred I don't know all the reasons God said that he says I can't bless you and I can't show you who you are and I can't let this promise come to pass unless you're willing to separate from your family members that are idolaters how many would raise your hand this morning and show the whole congregation and to all that are listening would raise your hand God did that with me I had to separate from everything dear to me in order to find what God said to me to come to what he said about my life oh I may get around some family members and I'm praying that they come to the Lord and all that but I had to separate like Abraham did to come to this change of life can you say amount the change of who I was Hallelujah so now he had a different future when God spoke over him and he came from an idolater to you're the possessor of Heaven and Earth Abram Barren to Abraham the father of many nations his identity changed everything changed that's why in the New Testament it says when you come into Christ you are a new new creature completely old things pass away All Things become new wouldn't God come and speak words over Abraham's seed in the end time as well if he talked to Abraham and we're Seed of Abraham said you'll be the father of Many Many Nations not only the natural seed of Israel millions of people come from Abraham he started a whole new nation and he says the father of many nations 12 tribes spread into millions people around the world Jews but then we know that Abraham had a spiritual seed the faith seed how many millions were there of those throughout the generations I believe I'm Abraham's seed this morning and wouldn't God just like he spoke to Our Father Abraham come in the end time and talk to the seeds of Abraham and tell you you are not a church member can you say man you are not a harlot you are not just some some person that's just looking at television all the time and and taking up with Hollywood and a drinker and a smoker and just all those things you're not that you're a child you're a son and daughter of God can you say amen and many this morning are living that way that God come to the sons of Abraham at the end time and spoke again and said you're not what they said reminds me of that service in Chicago where there's a prayer line and brother Branham is bringing them all up and there's one woman there in the film there's actually a film of this if you want to watch it deep cold through the deep and there's a woman that he's praying over and he says and the discernment comes to him to be able to tell what's in her life and what her problem was is that there were many people that was telling her that she was the witch she was a witch she was kind of seemed like a spiritual woman and they were calling her a witch and so she had come into all these physical problems and all this happening here because someone else had spoken a lie over her life did you realize that lies can be spoken as if their truth and it can bind you for almost your entire life and this woman was believing this lie that maybe I am a witch and come under physical all kinds of ailments and he had to pray for the physical ailment but he had to deal with he said they're telling you you're a witch and I love it in the film where he looks her in the eye and he points his finger to his head I want to tell you you're not a witch you're a daughter of God you're not a witch and in a moment's time change the whole lives that listen friends glory be to God lies have been told on your life can you say man don't believe the identity that what everything's been said about you but start to believe God's word and what he said about you can I get an amen this morning the moment you stop believing what your past life was and start believing what God Said your deliverance is there praise the Lord there's one other element oh I want to read a scripture I missed it Isaiah 55 8 and this is expresses now we're Isaiah 55 8 for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my way saith the Lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts for as the rain cometh and the snow from heaven and returneth not thither but watereth the Earth and make it to bring forth and to Bud that it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth so he's talking about the sowing he's talking about the former ladder rainbows which by the way is throughout prophecies and scripture of our day a former and a latter rain coming together but how is he going to bring it by the words spoken from his mouth and guess what they are it's my thoughts it's my words it's what I think about you somebody say praise the Lord you can believe whatever you want about yourself but one day God's going to come and say this is what I think about you this is my thoughts and guess what my thoughts are higher than your thoughts there's something that trumps everything that the devil tells about you and that's what God's word says about you you go ahead and believe your whole life if you want to what the devil has told you what your your family has told you you go ahead and believe it but I'm you want to start believing because those thoughts are not as high as God's thoughts and he says I'll bring the rain I'll bring the former latter ring and he says it'll begin to Bud something else so shall my word go forth out of my mouth and by the way if you know your Bible what is the mouth of God how does he speak it does everybody know what the mouth it's a prophet scripture says it the the mouthpiece of God is a prophet that's what he brings his word to sow the seed is through a prophet I want you to hold on to that because that's what we'll get to today so shall my word be go forth as a my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing where unto I sent it for ye shall go out you know what that's saying if it's my thought and I spoke it and it's planting the seed there is nothing there is no devil in hell there's nothing going to stop that from budding and coming forth three for ye shall go out with joy and be led forth with peace the mountains and the hills shall Break Forth before you into singing and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands sounds like a Revival sounds like a pretty happy time sounds like a good thing what when God's thoughts are revealed to you about yourself and he plants that seed of his word and it shall not return void it will bring forth can you say Amen that uh that makes even the trees clap their hands that makes everything break into singing that's the thing that brings Joy that's the thing that brings peace nothing in this world will bring peace but what he said about you is a seed that's been sown now there's an element in when God speaks his word and I think it's with Mom too and I want to stress it just a little bit there comes a time when Mom has invested so many words and so many things and the father does as well but there is it comes a time when you have put all in and you invested so much teaching and training and you've said this what they've done wrong what they've done right all these other things there actually comes a time when you you have to it naturally happens you have to back off a little bit because they will eventually go it will be empty nest and it's kind of a I get mixed emotions about the kids leaving home joy and happiness no just kidding no it's mixed emotions because I remember when Solomon just went here recently and I told him you know he needed to move out before at the first of the year I gave him a deadline he said you're kicking me out I said well you can word it that way that's not really what I said I think you need to go out and get used to things before you get married and the expenses and get you a place of your own think you should do that before and not the day of the wedding it's just my advice to them and so uh I think he still views it as kicking him out but anyway uh I remember yeah we got to do this we had this I was very confident it's time for him to move on you know uh he's 40 years old no he's not 40 but he's you know it's time for him to go and so I remember the night that he was packing up back here first of the year and I was fine with I was glad the whole time okay this is this is good for him and this is good for me and uh the night before I went down and helped him pack and I started to get emotional so then I said okay I'm done with this and I went to bed and I stayed up till three in the morning and I'm late I'm over here in the bed just bawling crying I said to my she said would you please go to sleep she said you wanted him to go and now you're crying I said I don't want him to go now I I can't do this you know she said get out of here and go down and tell him so I went downstairs I woke him up just let you know I love you and you don't have to go you know what you don't want of course he's looking at me like I'm crazy you wanted this and I'm doing this but when it hit so it's mixed emotions but the day comes the day comes and so now and there's another natural thing that happens is that there's a certain backing off for several reasons of weighing in on all this glorious wisdom that you have for their life you think that they're going to be welcome to hear that for the rest of their life um but you know there's several reasons but there's a certain backing off to rest in what you've taught them what you've invested in them and you've done enough and you've said enough and and you give that but there's a certain natural okay now let's see let's see how all this is done instead of because sometimes they're they say okay you know you've said that already the last 20 years of my life all right so I don't need to hear it again that's not really what they have but it's just more okay I got it Dad you know okay so there's a certain um after the seed's been planted and after you've invested there's a certain amount of Separation that has to happen and then you kind of get to see and watch What the Lord Has Done in their life but watch what you've dispensed and done everything you could and there's some things that you there's no perfect parent did you know that if you are please come and tell me I'd like to get your manual there's only one perfect parent and that's God our father he's the perfect parent but if I can take my image from him and and borrow from him and use what he used and learn from him then I can be a better parent but there is no perfect parent so we don't do everything right but hopefully we invested some things of the principles of life from the word of God and I always reminded all my kids this is not daddy's things and not Daddy's thing this says the word of God because that's what we've based our home on and we've applied the token to our home and we believe the word of God we believe the message of the last days it is the manual the Bible is the manual for our lives and the message is the light that's brought back the truth of them the manual I just it's not it's not dad's rules this is mostly based upon the word of God and so you look you step back and mothers kind of have to do that uh and it's a bit scary but if she's in invested the right things into her children then you step back and you've invested the right things especially the word of God you ought to rest in that say okay now let's see the Harvest that comes from it and guess what parents have a promise even how they lead their children if they'll set them in the right direction and invest those things you moms have a promise step back because if it's the right things you have a promise they'll it it'll never depart from them can he say Amen they might try to depart from it but what seed has been sown it'll never depart from that a lot of parents have to go through that when there's a season oh Lord what have I done wrong what is going on in that girl's life what is going on in that guy's life my son my daughter there are some parents that have to go through it but you know what you need to rest in you need to rest in the Lord because if it's his seed if it's his word it won't return void so this is our subject today when we talk as James in the Bible brings out about the husbandman or the farmer and he's expressing that first of all that we are in the season of the coming of the Lord and when we're in the season of the coming of the lord I want you to notice some prophecy there because if it's the season of the coming of the Lord he said the the farmer has great patience to wait until the crop comes now if you have the coming of the time of the coming in the Lord and you have that type then it says there that the farmer is waiting patiently for the fruit to come up now he couldn't be waiting unless God had come before the coming of the Lord and planted the right seed otherwise he had nothing to be patient over there'd be nothing to look for but it's because the son of man has come in the end time before the coming of the Lord and he's planted some seeds that's why the farmer can rest and be patient can you say amen that's the number one reason is that he can do it because there's been a seed planted he wouldn't be waiting unless but also guess what he knows why is he patient because the opposite of that is being impatient the opposite is being nervous being unstable oh I wonder what's going to happen and parents can be that about their kids wonder what's going to happen I don't know which direction they're going to go you can be nervous about it but this man knowing the coming of the Lord is nigh he knows and can rest in something that God has planted a seed by his word the son of man comes at the end time and speaks to a prophet and that is planting seed for our time now if we know that he's planted seed and it's him that's done it not the farmer the son of man has planted The Good Seed that's why the the husband men can sit back and say I'm not going to get impatient I'm not going to get nervous because he the son of man has come in the end time and he's planted his word seed and it will not return void it will accomplish now if I had planted the seed or a denomination had planted the seed or theology had planted a seed you better be nervous that's not the seed I'm looking for and if you don't think some materials that are out there is man seed instead of gods you don't have much discernment you better be Discerning what's God's seed what's God's spoken word from the original or what's man seed because if he plants man he plants his seed it'll just bring forth if a denominational system plants denominational seed it will bring a denominational crop but I believe that the son of man plants his seed by his word it brings forth Sons and Daughters of God and it won't return void that's why he has patience this is why the husbandman he's not nervous he's not he's not scared he has patience and then the next verse and so now and then it brings in the former latter rain which is prophecy for the end time the former and latter rain coming right close together and incidentally the former Reign he he showed in the Greek meaning or the Hebrew meaning was a a teaching Reign it is a teaching range so something comes forth as a teaching Reign but that's not the only rain right close together then there there is the spirit that the rain that comes to bring forth the our the Harvest these are all prophecies for the end time but what good would the rain do if he hasn't planted his word see and what good would the word do if he doesn't send the rain what good is it if he opens up the entire Bible and he doesn't send his spirit and pour it out upon the people can I get an amen this morning I can't get no help this morning this is what God is doing in the end time don't worry about politics don't worry about the economy look at what God's doing he's planted his seed and it will come forth in a harvest it'll bring rapturing Faith to a people I tell you I want to be that crop I want to be right there and I want to be patient with what God has planted as in you it wasn't some preacher it was God spoken through a prophet that planted the seeds for this hour I believe it with all my heart and so now James is this so much could be preached on this but this early and latter rain and break down what it is and that without interpreting it because whatever still has to come to pass I fear in interpreting that I just know here's here's where I'm settled what's coming what's coming and let me say something whatever has not come yet for the bride we should be very careful that we're not interpreting what's coming that's where we get in trouble God doesn't need you to interpret what's coming next and it's actually what creates nervousness in certain groups and nervousness of people and here's another thing that happens is that when you have a delay of that okay when is this going to climax when is it going to be this full swing of rapturing faith and get the bride out here when is it and when you're nervous about that the tendency is to try to create something and many men many men reach back into their comfort zone of their past experiences in Pentecost and say I'm comfortable with that God moved on me back then so maybe that's what's going to happen be careful let's just keep close to the word let's be patient let's let this word bring forth the way it's supposed to bring forth let's surrender Our Lives let's be dedicated Christians let's stay filled with the spirit but let God bring the final work of this of rapturing Faith the way he wants to bring it is that okay with everybody be careful that men don't catch you into some type of movement that's bringing back the pastor trying to interpret what's supposed to happen this is the bride's Revival I think we should let God interpret his word by bringing it to pass that's what he told us to do what is it his patience this husband is not nervous God's plan the son of man has planted his seed in this hour the son of man is planted in Sea so he hath long patience I'm waiting I'm waiting I'm waiting and while I'm waiting I'm not sitting on a chair somewhere not doing anything I'm waiting for this word but I'm I'm being a witness I'm being a vessel that can be used of God you should do that Lord where's the last elected sea let me be a vessel let it come through me can you say Amen we might have to cut this part out I wouldn't want them to hear this but I brought it up Wednesday night and I don't bring it as a praise to me but I know who I am I know he's placed his word in me and I know when I pray I believe my prayers are answered I prayed for that and made that works for us I prayed for her sister to come over last last Thursday I went to one of our homes she was cleaning it with her mom her mom starts to cry because it didn't look good that her daughter would be able to come from Cuba and I grabbed their hands and I said we're going to pray right now I said God we've been praying this but Lord I want to say one more time supernaturally open the doors for this sister and this daughter to come home we put it before God her mom just wept see the son and daughter they don't believe in God at all but the mom does and she believes two days later paperwork went through and she was here what night did she come home they flew over she's about 12 hours in Miami and going through immigration but she had her papers within days she's here that's that's Friday night she's here already with her family and they're rejoicing but I just want to add this and we like to take this out The Joy it gives me is that the dad I thought it was the mom but the dad mostly he's an atheist he doesn't believe in God and his wife told him that we prayed and two days later they opened and he says God's hearing that man's prayer I believe there is a God now that may seem very basic to all of us message people let me tell you something that's what I live for if I can be a vessel to take an atheist and say I'm starting to believe in God there's a real God he can answer prayer that's what I'm here for and you're a vessel too your prayer is important to God but this husband and he waits and the thing about the waiting is it's you know people who act different to when they have to wait for something Americans are not very good Waiters we get everything quick you know we got we got drive-throughs which they're not as quick as they used to be but we got drive-throughs we've got instant potatoes and we've got poof this and poof that and microwave and bang right Bang Bang Bang and it conditions us we want stuff right now I want that loan right now I want that new truck or that car right now we're conditioned by America and then we come over to God and we say God I want it right now probably shouldn't say that just pray with faith let God bring it when he wants to bring it even if it's 20 years later because you spoke it it's before a high priest he acknowledges what you've spoken let him do the work but we get impatient we don't and even though the scripture says to be still and know God you forget that when you want a prayer answered right now we forget the church says they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength there's a renewing of your strength by waiting and being patient on God come on people say amen but you know there's something that happens when people get impatient and they can do a lot of you know they can they can just they get sometimes they start doing crazy things I believe that some of the craziness that follows our movement is people waiting for the coming of the Lord and waiting for what's next and so they start kind of going Lulu with false Doctrine and interpreting things and going off this way and going off this deep end and a lot of it is the nervous what's coming next what's coming next and they get and they try to make something happen like Abraham and Sarah when Sarah said it's not happening it's not happening take Hagar have relations with her maybe that's what God meant is Hagar nothing but a mess every time we get ahead of God we produce ishmaels in our lives in the movement within our movement in the message there's ishmael's produced by people trying to produce something and push it brings in denominational seed you know people get nervous when they're waiting for something we used to have a brother here and instantly brother Bill Chandler he's passed away years ago he helped me start the church and he's actually the first one who started up our building fund he says we need to have a building fund this this building is some of it is result for him 35 years ago saying we need a building fund we start need to start saving money so he's gone but that was a lot of his contribution but brother Bill he was a uh he was a good very good brother helped us start the church and just very uh faithful love this message with all of his heart uh sister Shelley is here this morning she probably remembers Bill Chandler and his wife Phyllis and they were just wonderful people and he he was he was he had a lot of health problems he couldn't come to church the last couple years he's just so bad such in bad Health but brother Bill you know when I was single in town here he would invite me over for dinner and but he was a guy that some people are okay with people being late when you call him for dinner brother Bill wasn't good with that and you know some people they just okay we'll just wait not brother Bill it's like he went hysterical he went off the deep end and I loved him to death but man within 10 minutes of me being late he's calling me and if he wouldn't call me he's calling the police looking for me I'm serious he called the police looking for where where's brother Paul I'm nervous something has happened to him he finally get a hold me I said I'm on my way I'm sorry to be late and he's just he was going to have a heart attack just just because you know it's late you know why what is he doing and I love the man to death we had a lot of things in common he loved hamburgers uh mom got me suspenders for my birthday so thank you it's probably the last time I'll wear them for Mom for his mother's day but I'm trying them they're holding everything up hopefully um what's that talking about oh brother bill so I mean you know he just you know and and to me you know it's like when people when you ask somebody to come to dinner and they're late you know I don't really care I usually just go ahead and eat it's their problem their loss you know if they're 10 min okay I'll give them 10 minutes but no but in this this shows how people in the delay how many knows there's a delay after God speaks something then there's a delay there's a there's a seventh seal with silence doesn't look like God's doing very much and it's in the delay that people get nervous and start going crazy and making up things and they're waiting they're waiting but this scripture for the coming Lord tells us that we are to be patient unto the coming of the Lord none of us thought we would be here till now by the way none of us thought we'd be past 77. none of us thought we'd raise children none of us I never thought my my kids would graduate high school none of us we thought we would be out of here but it's not up to us it's when his seed that he planted is going to bring forth a crop can you say man and bring rapturing Faith by a lot of rain for the people when that is coming to its full fruition then we'll see God finish his work but we never believe we'd be here to 2023 but people get nervous they try to make up things they try to oh we got to do this no he wants us to say be patient unto the coming of the Lord for he hath planted the seed and if he's planted it we're waiting till the crop comes up the way that he wants it he has sold the seed can you say Amen so this farmer it's confidence in the seed and who sowed the seed it's the good seed because the son of man has planted his good seed in the end time through his mouth and through his Prophet so shall it be in the coming of the son man Jesus himself said it he said so shall it be in the coming of the son of man so in other words when Jesus said in Matthew here about the parable of the sowing when he says the son of man is the one who plants and sows The Good Seed and then the same Jesus you're listening the same Jesus said so shall it be in the coming of the son of man as in the days of Sodom as in the days of Noah so shall it be in the coming of the son of man he would come and say well yeah he's going to come and meet us in the sky no no first of all what's he do he comes with The Good Seed places it in the generation and now the bride just says Lord I'm having long patience for this because it's not my own righteousness it's not me trying to put something on I'm not going to try to make something work I'm going to enjoy worship and enjoy what you give me in the word because I know you're continued to mold me into an adopted son and daughter of God I'm going to continue that but the final result in the climax did all this I cannot make this happen you've planted the seed you're sending the former latter rain I don't want to touch it and produce an Ishmael I don't want to do anything to it and I'm certainly not bailing out does anybody see in the scripture where the farmer is saying I've waited long enough I'm out of here I'm leaving this message you can't find it in the elect in the end time the elector's saying he's planted the seed the son of man has come indented in the end time and I'm staying until I see this good seed bring forth what God said it would bring forth I'm here to stay can you say Amen can't find that farmer running off because he know it's the good seed and he knows who's planted it he didn't plant it himself but it's good seed and it's going to bring this Harvest oh hasten that day Lord but he said the son of man so the son of man is going to repeat himself again if anybody doesn't understand the repeat process of scriptures you're not going to understand the Bible because you're what you're going to say I believe everything here but I don't believe God can do it again in our day you don't understand the repeat process because what he did in the past he can repeat it again if he raised the dead in the past he can raise the dead this morning if he opened up blind eyes back then he can do it this morning don't you dare interpret God's word and if he sent a prophet in the past he can send a prophet in our day if he said that the son of man will repeat again and what he'll be doing is planting The Good Seed then if Jesus said that I believe it and that settles it no matter how long it takes for each elect to find it he has long patience for it it's a and that's my title this morning faith in the seed sown by the son of man Faith what we need is faith we don't need in faith in something from a message from the past we need faith in the seed that's been sown now how many believe that we need faith in that faith that he has faith that he has sent the former Reign the teaching Reign it's already out there in the field something should be said about this impatience and this nervousness further because even John the Baptist himself who was the Forerunner of the first coming of Christ once he spoke it once he said Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world and then he says when he proclaimed here he is then he said I must decrease he must increase the office of John with the spirit of Elijah was fulfilled at that day and he stepped back you can no longer just follow his office you had to follow Christ a transition and so he said Behold the Lamb of God but look what happened to John he gets in prison he gets depressed sends his disciples he's wondering is he the one got his eagle eyes filmed over what can happen during the delay Satan can bring you a bunch of doubts so we're not talking just see Jesus said there's not a man risen greater than John the Baptist and the greatest one of the greatest prophets to initiate this this Covenant with Christ coming in one of the greatest prophets sat in the prison and doubted he had already said this is the Lamb so our human minds and the nervousness is it's not happening quick enough when's he going to set up his kingdom this is the Messiah this is the Lamb of God when's it all going to happen and it wasn't happening quick enough and he began to wonder is this the one but he didn't have this principle I'm preaching to you this morning and that is that if you know who's planted the seed and you know you've spoken the word of God by saying behold this is the Lamb of God then you see you you rest in the word of God G the logos was a word of God and why did God Rest the seventh day does anybody know because the other six days he had spoken the spoken word of God and spoke all things in existence even his own son creative power and on the seventh day after he created it all he stepped back and rested and what did he rest in he rested in his spoken word now that this is spoken there isn't any devil in hell that's going to stop it can I get an amen if God spoke it no devil in hell is going to stop it if God's got a hold of your wayward child there's nothing going to stop and there's no devil in hell that's going to keep them from coming back to God if God's got their number and their predestinated seat of God they're going to come back no matter how long it takes if God's involved he doesn't say something in the oh I shouldn't have said that we do that sometimes we say it was I shouldn't have said that God's never said I shouldn't have said God has never said I should have said that when he speaks it the first time it's done it'll go out it'll bring a crop and it will not return without a prospering can you say man a harvest everything he said and it would happen it's going to come back just the same praise be to God and the next verse he says and hath long patience for it and then he says again be patient unto the coming of the Lord ah be patient unto the coming of the Lord and I like how he words it I'm going to have to go back and word it just the way he said it here Hebrews excuse me James 5 be patient he says it again be patient unto the coming of the Lord please find it brother Paul please uh establish your hearts so where does our stability come from not from trusting in a screen because that can work sometimes and it don't work other times 99 of the time it works because those guys make it work way to go uh this is be patient I already said be patient the former latter rain come he's put in the crop be patient establish your heart for the coming of the Lord joth night does anybody see instability nervousness that's what the world's in right now because they don't know where we're at they can feel brother Branham says that animals if you look at them out that little that little sheep out there there was a lion he said he watched a lion over in the bushes and he's trying to figure out why this sheep is nervous he senses that line he couldn't see that line then he could see it see why the Sheep was nervous you see Nature has a sense of what's coming this world is scared to death and they have no trust in government they have no trust even in Donald Trump there's nobody going to fix this so but we're not a part of the nervousness we're not a part of the instability and why is that because God has planted his word in this generation God sends the rain to bring forth rapturing faith that's why you can't find instability or hearts that are failing for fear not in the elect be patient first time he says be patient to the coming of the Lord because we know he's planted the seed now be patient establish your heart for the coming of the Lord drawth nigh I find my stability in establishing my heart right here right here can you find it this morning I'll go right to the simplest question to you all of you here if the Lord comes tomorrow where is your heart right now are you saved have you received the Lord and for those who are going to rapture we know that it will be the ones that go in because Jesus said there'll be wise virgins and foolish virgins some who are left behind they're virgins they're very dedicated Christians but Jesus separated two crowds and said the one who have oil oil is the Holy Spirit the ones who go in the Rapture are the ones who have this Holy Spirit so what Jesus said it's what Jesus said I didn't separate him he separated him I'll tell you I ask you are you ready to go do you have the true Holy Spirit in your life and the identification of the response and obedience to the word of God praise the Lord amen so I'm going to bring this down here with just a quote so this in this time of the coming lord it's strange times during the former and latter rain and these close together the sowing time and then waiting time it does not look like God is doing anything although he is doing things but what we're hungry for for him to do um because whatever God's going to do we're hungry for it that's what gets people in Troublesome they're hungry or something they try to produce something but if you have the hunger for God to manifest himself the way he wants to in the last days before the Rapture if you have that hunger I read the quote Wednesday night why do you hunger thirst he said why do you hunger Church why do you thirst Church why are you hungering for it he said it's the father trying to get this hidden Mystery to you but you let so many things get in the way let me remember that quote from Wednesday night it's a powerful quote friends because it's the father he's not given up he's trying to get something to you but we let the cares of life will everything distract us from it we ought to be reaching back to the Lord just as much as he's reaching to us show me this Lord open my eyes let me see where I'm at right now that's where my stability is but in this time it's a strange time it doesn't look like God is doing anything or you know doesn't look like God's doing things so let's make some noise and make it look like God's doing something but the real work of God that he's doing is a crop coming up and there's really no noise to any of that now I I know friends what the what it says that wherever God's working there's going to be some noise where the a birth is a mess we know that by Nature you know I doubt a dry-eyed repentance if somebody's broken they're repenting then there's going to be a mess they're going to be messed up I used to watch women and they repent and the true repentance and alter and the mascara is going down and they look pretty ugly when it's all over with but they got a hold of God and so I know the birth is a mess and I know just like we heard this morning when there's the stimulation of Revelation and God's work in our hearts we want to come and worship freely if you worship quietly to raise your hands and weep or if you if you want to dance around the whole room praise Lord we have that sometimes I say praise God we're not afraid of any of it but the complete evidence that God is Among Us is not noise and we should never use it as the evidence that God is Among Us because the deepest things in God don't have any noise to them this crop that's coming up the farmer is not out there listening for the noise in the crop the prophet said the son is the most probably the most powerful force he said when the sun comes up and Rises it's so powerful and if you get up early enough to see the sunrise it's coming up but you can't hear it it's the most powerful thing arising on the Earth but there's no noise to it but is it powerful is it going to pull the crops up is it going to work can you say man is it going to give us daylight can you say man it's ever been powerful and the Son of God is ever been powerful to do his work but it isn't always with a lot of noise but is it a work of God yes the crop is coming up can you say amen he grows it quietly and he brings it to a harvest remember the Rapture will be a secret it's not going to be a public show the Final Phase of all this is not some public show that's all over the news God like a thief in the night takes his bride away she feels that sweep in that wave and she goes in another body and change and most of the world won't even know that it's went on can you say Amen be a secret just like your relationship with the lord it's a secret it's a secret communication it's a secret relationship with him it's deeper than just a shouting but the real work he's doing is a crop came coming up and when it's mature when this Harvest is mature the former Reign the teaching the sowing and then the latter rain bringing on that rapturing faith so that we can get out of here and I'm going to read one thing through here and I want you to know something very as I use this word strange he's going to use it here strange strange time when it's in the delay waiting for something else waiting for the next thing to come strange times I found this last night I was so inspired it's what I built based the sermon on this morning and it won't be much longer but let's just read this together let's read this together and this is in the pick up your pen and write inside of the programmers Church age when brother Branham refers to uh pick up your pen and write and this is the things he said and it is related to the seed as well now I want to be careful here and and see this God has promised that at the end time Malachi 4 is going to be fulfilled it has to be for it is the spirit quickened the word of God spoken by the prophet Malachi Jesus referred to it is just before Christ comes the second time Jesus referred to it so there was a forerunner to the first for those of you don't know there was a forerunner to the first coming of Christ a man with the spirit of Elijah who was that John the Baptist and then Jesus said Elijah truly shall first come and restore all things so before the second coming of Christ he'll use a man with the spirit of Elijah it's not about the man but if he did it before he can do it again and Jesus said that he would now he is not Christ but he will be used in order in this generation to begin the process of planting the seed and bringing it on to the coming of the Lord he said now is though it has to be for the spirit quick and word of God spoken by the prophet of God Jesus referred to it it is just before Christ comes the second time by the time Jesus comes all scripture must be fulfilled the Gentile dispensation will be in the last Church age when that messenger of Malachi comes he will be right with the word he will take the whole Bible from Genesis to Revelation he will start at the serpent seed and carry on to the messenger in the latter rain but he will be rejected by denominations now there's a principle throughout the Bible true prophets of God from Moses to Elijah to to uh uh to Noah were rejected the world rejected their message what are the distinctions in God's true prophets is they will be rejected but he will be resurrected by denominations he has to be for this is history repeating itself from the time of Abraham Ahab Israel's history under Hab is happening right here in America where the prophet of Malachi appears so here's Israel's history as Israel left Egypt to Worship in Freedom pushed out the natives raised up a nation with great leaders like David Etc and then put on Abe Ahab on the throne he married Jezebel with the Jezebel behind him to direct so have we done the very same thing in America our forefathers left for this land to worship and live in Freedom they pushed back the natives and took over the land he is bringing our day with back in Israel's day when they had all the good men of God and then and then they got an Ahab who was a backslider married the wrong woman and during that time is the same time he sent Elijah history repeats itself he's saying that our nation if you don't understand what he's saying Kennedy was the first Catholic President we left Europe to come to this country to get away from the oppression of religious organizations like Catholic and like brother rap brought up the other night in our Wednesday night studies of the church ages it wasn't just it wasn't just the Cox system but it was actually the Church of England started to put pressure as well on the pilgrims so anytime you have religious organizations like that they're putting pressure on there's no freedom of the spirit it's not the people but it's the systems that start to bind people it's Babylon it's in the book of Revelations by the way and so now we leave there to get away from that system and in 1963 I think it was or 64. we elect our first Catholic President bringing that system back in again that's a big change and all of a sudden you have to wait a minute Ahab Book of Revelations attaches that system to The Jezebel as brother rap did the other night clearly in the Book of Revelations Jezebel types in the Bible that religious system Ahab marries Jezebel so our president is married to that system comes into the presidency he's a fine man I'm not talking about the man he's a fine man but it's just the whole symbolism of what's happened right at that time I'll send Elijah he has to send Elijah if the type's true our forefathers left for this land of worship and live in the freedom they pushed back the natives and took over the land mighty men like Washington and Lincoln were raised up after a while other men of such poor calibers succeeded these worthy men that soon in Ahab was set up in the presidential chair with a jezebel behind him to direct him it is at such a time as this that the message of Malachi must come then in the latter rain will come in Mount Carmel Showdown watch this carefully now to see it in the word John was the Foreigner of Malachi 3 he planted the former Reign and was rejected by the organizations of his day Jesus came and had a mount Transfiguration Showdown the second Forerunner of Christ was so for the latter Reign Jesus will be the showdown between the denominations and Creeds for he will come to back up his word and take his bride in the rapture so that's the ultimate this is what's going in the rapture but what brings about that faith and that sweep to bring us into Rapture first God sends through the mouth of a prophet to plant the seed for rapturing faith and that's already happened now has it happened individually for you I can't answer that question he's done it dispensationally he's sent his word and sowed his word seed but you have to have that happen to you individually the first Showdown was Mount Carmel the second was about Transfiguration and the third will be Mount Zion the strange behavior of Moses now here's where I want you this is the quote I want you to read as I'm closing right the strange behavior of Moses Elijah and John withdrawing from the people into seclusion left many confused now I read that isn't that interesting it happened in all three of these men Moses Elijah and John and he says when they when there was a withdrawing from the people into seclusion which you watch in their lives at different intervals or specific times I should say we watch that happen and when they do it when they withdraw just like John he comes out there I just said Behold the Lamb of God then he goes into prison where's John what's going on and that creates that creates left many confused as time goes on it's like what's what's going on next what's happening next confusion matter of fact some people say well man there's nothing to this I'm out I'm bailing out I read to the scripture last Sunday Jesus had 5 000 followers at the beginning of John chapter six at the end he's got 12 followers and one's a devil how did that happen many of his disciples just left him after that there they exited I'm done because they don't understand the completeness of the word and what God has put he's saying it right in John 6. my words that I speak unto you why was 5 000 people following Jesus because he multiplied the fishes and lows and they were fed of that and they're they're all hyped up about the Miracles and signs and wonders they were going to make him a king but very few want the word can you say Amen to see the word planted in their lives they all leave and he says the strange Behavior Moses Elijah and John withdrawn from the people in seclusion left many confused they did not realize that it was because their messages had been rejected Bible patterned as a whole their message was rejected but this is the part that I wanted to close on and Shout but the seed had been sown the planting was over that's where you find this husbandman with great patience to the coming of the Lord because guess what the seed has been sown by the son of man and these Godly men these prophets you know why they just backed off because even I've been preaching about Elijah in the cave third part of his ministry Mount Carmel Jupiter tree depression thought everybody rejected him Jezebel's running after him but then the cave God shows him I'm not in the earthquake I'm not in the wind I'm not in the fire I'm in the still Small Voice taking them on to that third mystery of the third pole you see and so now when when we speak of Elijah coming into that he withdraws himself into conclusion but guess what the word has already been planted that's why they would they withdrawal because I'm Lord I brought your word and the whole world seems to be rejecting it that's what Elijah felt in that cave and Jupiter he said nobody's believing me Jezebel's nipping at my heels here what's going on and they go into that they'll go into hiding what's going on where you at Elijah because they the whole world is rejected and then God had to tell Elijah wait a minute wait a minute There's 7 000 out there you don't know them if you could just meet them they'll believe in your message but they went into seclusion because their message was rejected but guess what guess what the message was have been rejected but this is the parliament the seed has already been planted and if the seeds been planted if that work is done all we need to do is stay filled with the spirit say God let this word bring forth Christ in my life it'll do the work you don't have to help it you yield to him and let him do this work in our life have patience to the coming of the Lord the word seed has been planted the son of man is planted it that's why message is nothing else to me but the revealing of Jesus Christ I can't see anything else but Christ in it in the last days it's Christ revealed in the last days it's his work everybody see that he sent another Elijah again but it's not about Elijah he goes off the scene Elijah went off the scene Moses set up for Joshua what's the type of the Holy Spirit to take the people in the promised land Moses office was over Moses was done don't glorify Moses anymore and then the other one when Moses does that he brings it on to Elijah Moses couldn't even go into the promised land and then you have the next one Elijah he goes out but Elisha comes in Elijah Fades out Elijah comes it's a type of the Bride John phases out his office is over you were willing to for a season to rejoice in John's light but don't rejoice in that light anymore I don't want to just sit in services and hear stories about William Branham his office has been fulfilled he is the one who said listen I must decrease he's here now he must increase the seed has been planted and now there's going to be a harvest and if he can do it that way in the past he can do it that way again I'm here to tell you if you're a visitor if you're listening he's done it again the son of man has planted his word seed in this generation and we are praying Our Lives we're just like you we're hungry for more of God and we're praying God let this word be born in me let this word be born in me let this word bring forth so quiet It's So Silent it's just like but you see I like to encourage your friends because you don't know see I've been coming around this word for many years and sometimes if you look at these eyes and the other people's lives you say doesn't look like much is going on that's where we become critical of other people that's where we become critical here everybody else I said to it Wednesday I said Wednesday night or Sunday I can't remember anymore when I say things but I said something about we always have expectations of people especially pastors they should be way up here by now they've been sitting in my church 20 years they should be way up here I but I don't decide and you don't decide when God chooses to bring somebody to repentance please keep coming I love having you and I'm going to keep preaching I'm going to be in your face the same way every service and I know why some people keep coming but I'm not going to change I'm going to preach this word God has sown and seen and I'm going to preach it to you this is the son of man this isn't Paulo Fontaine this isn't Paul lafontaine's Church I'm just echoing what the seed has been sold in this generation by the message of the last days but keep coming I'm going to keep bringing it to you but listen I don't decide when somebody's going to really truly repent the Bible says it's God that leads you to repentance so he might lead you in this service today repent I'm wrong God I lay everything else down I'm a Seed of Abraham and I'm leaving my Kindred and everything dear to me to come to this word with others that don't come that easy and I've always said if you're a Son of God you'll come hard you'll come easy but you're coming but don't delay if you're feeling a pull towards God don't delay come to him but I don't decide who it's all different times when people feel all right I I God's pulling me too much I can't deny it God's pulling me too much I just can't diet I must respond to him I can only tell you and I don't say this as a threat to put you over hell I can only tell you if if the Holy Spirit In Me Is Right and some of the other Christians that I'm talking to we are very close to the final stages of this anybody knows their Bible knows the message and those things and look at the events in the news and everything where we're at right now and I can talk about it but just you just if you get into the word and you have the Holy Spirit we are not we are here so I wouldn't delay in repenting saying God I'm not I'm going to quit messing with this thing if you have religion if you have religion it's nice but religion won't get you in a Rapture in the coming of the Lord thank you if you have books and tapes of this message and you believe God sent a prophet thank you that won't get you in a Rapture that will not coming to Paula fontaine's church or any church does not get you in a rapture you need to repent you need to say God fill my life the things of the world become strangely dim and may I die to the things of the world I'm ready right now to give it to you that's when God has you as a candidate he can really begin to do something in your life how many believe the seed has been sown by the son of man it's already been sown so we can rest it in let your word be born in the main let's stand together if you would and pray just pray let it live in me let it start oh live inside this house of clay and Lord it every day [Music] singing again now we're gonna pray just prepare your heart to pray let your word be born yes Lord oh God let it live in me let it start let it start [Music] with the manger we should pray together now we should bow our heads and speak to him [Music] I try to put out of my mind lately and I wish you would all of my history and all the sermons and all the work of the Lord that we've done I try to put on mine because I don't want to depend on successes that I really can't call mine they're actually gods but sometimes I won't have a Brokenness and a closeness with the Lord because I'm living on that I'm okay and I've done enough good things in the past I'm all right I want to be one with the Lord in Brokenness before him every day I don't know more than any other pastors I'm not a very deep preacher I mean that sincerely I I just have my contribution God gave me to give to the bride but I don't want to live on a pride that I'm okay I want his word to be established in my life I want this seed to be planted and bring forth his crop his Christ manifesting in my life that's what I that's what I want no longer concerned about who but the position is or how I measure with the whole message the movement I just want to be close to him I want to love his people I want to love him more when they picked up Stones against Jesus Jesus said I've done these works they said it's not for a good work that we Stone thee we like when you do good things it's not for a good work you do but being a man you call yourself God I am my father one that's why we pick up Stones against you and the devil's always the same way he'll be upset at me not because I was a preacher or preached in conventions the devil will be mad when I come in complete Oneness with Jesus Christ and manifest you that's what makes him angry so today I ask you if your heart is there repent before him and say Lord forgive me of my sins forgive me of my pride forgive me for knowing it all and thinking I know more than everybody Lord I don't know nothing I need to be re-taught I need a new Foundation I want to be that wise part of that group it has oil in my lamp oh God would you receive this people here Lord but let them not fall short let them find the full rest and confidence and patience in the word that you've already spoken help us to rest in it help us to be established and it help us to be stable all nervousness and scare and fear he purged away from us Lord just rest and letting this word do in our lives what you said that it would do let it be born let it bring forth the crop Lord that she said it would let Christ be formed Christ be formed in me Paul said I travail until Christ be formed in the people Let It Be Lord Christ be formed in these individuals your word will not return void and that's what we have confidence in in the name Lord Jesus Christ we ask you amen
