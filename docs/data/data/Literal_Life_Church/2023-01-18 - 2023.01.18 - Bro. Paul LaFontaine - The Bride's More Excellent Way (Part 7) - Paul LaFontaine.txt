========================================

13 and we had a little section there that we were talking about tonight the last part of the at the attributes of divine love but this series is called the bride's more excellent way and so we've been going through these characteristics and uh we want to talk about these tonight out of verse 7. Divine love beareth all things believeth all things hope with all things endureth all things read it again Divine love beareth all things believeth all things hope with all things endureth all things I want to add a couple scriptures to that in First Corinthians chapter 15 if you don't mind First Corinthians 15 and verse 57 but thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ are you glad tonight that he gives you the victory in the battles of the Lord if he fights our battles there's always a victory amen and then it says in second Corinthians chapter 2 a similar thing that we want to add second Corinthians chapter 2 and verse 14. second Corinthians 2 and verse 14. now thanks be unto God which always causeth us to Triumph in Christ and maketh manifest the savior of his knowledge By Us in every place the first part of it says we thank God which always causeth us to Triumph in Christ always the victories in mind always the Triumph is in mind doesn't matter how low it gets he causes us always to try up so he's got the victory in mind for our lives amen that's what we want to talk about in this part of divine Love Tonight heavenly father bless your children wherever they would be listening father the ears to hear as it says over and over in the church ages of the Book of Revelations the churches that says to him that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit is saying to the churches and so Lord if you're speaking we want to have an ear to hear tonight and whether they be online or the archive or here tonight in the service we pray that you will bless the ears to hear maybe it's some morning somewhere somebody's listening father but father whatever time it is I pray that you give them spiritual revelation we commit this service to you in Jesus name amen praise the Lord sometimes those you may be seated sometimes those video glitches and those things that happen to cause problems technically in all the equipment and no we won't have any of this equipment on the other side praise the Lord but sometimes it's just the devil getting all the equipment because you don't like what's being said praise the Lord so we want to look back look back at this here again tonight and finish up with this series and uh you know I I want to just look at this as something that we not look at Divine love should not be looked at as anything that originates in human at all no human being can produce this on his own this isn't just being good to people if you're being good to people that's a good thing but this love this Capstone love this Divine love this perfect love can only be in one it can only originate in one place and that's our Lord he is love he's the substance of love Christ is the substance of love and so if you didn't receive the right kind of love in your life there's a person who can give it to you and besides that if it comes and lives in you then you can project this love to other people and so when we look at we want to know the point that this love is not a human love in the beginning of time it's amazing that in the first two or three scriptures of the Bible we could have the key actually to all the chaos that's in the world today because in the second verse of the Bible you go back and read it if you got your Bible you can go back and read it sometime we already have the answer when the whole world was without form and void and empty and chaos and so there was nothing to fix fix that there was nothing to make that right can you say Amen there was no source of itself that could redeem the chaos that was in the answer I think is in verse 3 and the spirit of the Lord moved upon that chaos the spirit of the Lord moved upon the waters and then light it said let there be light and then Light Came where'd the light come from it came from God so when he the spirit moved on this that's when chaos turned to an Eden it's when the spirit of the Lord moves on your life and you respond is when your chaos turns to an Eden can I get an amen tonight it's when the spirit of the lord it's not when it's not within yourself it's not something you can produce within yourself if you're in chaos you can't change the chaos you can't just have a psychological thing and change and people can get pretty strong in their minds but when there's that type of chaos and the type of chaos that's in the world there has to be something come from another source and that's where it came from the spirit of the Lord moved upon the face of the waters and that everything begin to change and became at Eden he can do the same thing to your life so when we look at this love we have to see it is that it's not from Human effort the answer is is it doesn't the answer doesn't come from an outside thing of human effort in any form this love will only come from the person of Love Christ and he will be the only source of it and so then when you have that buy a new birth when you have his love within you the next step is getting past the Flesh and the mind and the clouds and all that be moved away and with all that and that's why Paul said be transformed by the renewing of your mind this is so someone who's already born again this is someone who already has the Holy Spirit and in the Holy Spirit is that love but see our minds are clouded by things so the next step in a Christian journey is now to be transformed by the continual renewing of our mind and that it gets all the cloudiness now all the past out all your past thinking out and when it keeps purging all of those things and washes it away guess what can happen the love of God is released out of you to other people I'm going to say it again when you get all your mind and your past and your thoughts and and and you you get the clouds moved away so then his love what will happen his love can be released out of you what happened at Calvary what happened at Calvary you say well our Lord died there he he brought the sacrifice he he was the the lamb that took care of our sins yeah we got all those explanations and that's exactly what happened but what happened at Calvary there was a death and guess what love was released to you can you say man what happened to Calvary the love of God was released the love of God came forth from Calvary and but it had to be released it was there but it had to be released and how was it released it was released look at this now through a death through a suffering through pain through the death of Christ and when we start dying to ourselves when we start dying to our own will when we stop fighting for our own will and learn how to respond to God then maybe the love of God can be released when he died at the cross it released the love of God to us when we can die to ourselves it releases more the love of God can I get an amen because we're asking Lord how can I have this excellent way how can I have more of this perfect love released in my life well through Calvary the love of God was released through a suffering through a death through a dying to himself and he died physically we die in our minds we die to our own will there is a death we go through or else our Lord would not have said take up your cross and follow me he didn't say take up his cross he he went to his cross but there's a cross you have to bear and so everyone has a cross and that's dying to our own will Jesus himself had to die to his own will he's prayed in the garden father not my will but thine be done there was a death in the Garden of Eden before there was a death at Calvary and there would have been no Calvary unless there had been a Garden of Eden excuse me a Garden of Gethsemane excuse me there would have been no Calvary unless there had been a Garden of Gethsemane there have been no doubts at Calvary unless there had been in death to his will and he prayed in Gethsemane not my will but thine be done it's when we die to ourselves that the love of God can be released this excellent way we find this excellent way when we die to fighting for our own will and our way to respond to things and I want to get into this a little bit tonight it's when we die to these things maybe love can be released this love that we're searching for more of it the love of God the the True Love Of Christ can be released how many tonight would raise your hand how many raise your hand if you're listening online how many razors say I want this love this excellent way I want it to be released and projected more to people you say well I've got it but it needs to be released and one of the things and just a note for personally here one of the things I've learned as I'm preaching this I'm being challenged in this every day I'm so hungry for this more excellent way and more of this love but I'm I'm seeing it more and more as a battle and a death to myself to make a choice and sometimes it's actually embarrassing and humbling the decision you have to make because I'm confronted with now what do I do there's two things and I'll get to this a little later but I'll say it now when people are confronted with a bad Spirit or a bad situation or or circumstance in life psychology says that we don't do one of the two things fight or flight my wife and our fellowship some good fellowship with sister Julie Smith's here Monday morning and uh that's why I said we're taught we either human beings will fight all right I'm ready fight back oh they're run did you know in this excellent way neither of those are are right that's psychology that's a human being that's what we do we're going to get our fist out or we're going to get our guns out we're going to fight for this fight for my own way or we're going to run and that's not always good either so we learn to fight for our own will we learn to fight for our way and sometimes you're confronted with that decision and I've been confronted with these things over and over again an embarrassing humbly thing thing in a decision will I take the more excellent way will I eat Humble Pie Humble Pie doesn't taste very good when you're until later do I eat Humble Pie do I take the more excellent way do I die to myself or do I respond like 99 of other human beings respond respond to confrontation and to evil and to be being done wrong that's the decision every believer will be faced with do I respond the normal response do I fight do I fight do I respond by could I say that a big a big majority of Christians respond the same carnal way or do I say Lord you've got a more excellent way and it's not fight or flight It's Your Love being released Christ died at Calvary and because of that death and suffering it released the love of God and that's what I want in my life I mean raise your hand say that's what I want I I want to make a reference to the word Christian first time I was mentioned in Acts 11 26 they were first called Christians at Antioch and uh the writer Barry petite says the original Greek word for Christian is christianos which comes from the two Greek words Christ and shun the word Christ means anointed and Chun means little so the word Christian literally means little anointed ones we're familiar with the term little Messiahs Christ the Messiah and Messiahs because if you put the same spirit in the Messiah in Christ the anointment in the Believers like happened on the day of Pentecost they're not just people following Christ they have his anointing on them they're little Messiahs can you say man so Christian does not mean like I used to think christ-like and we're following we're duplicating how Christ would treat people and we're putting that on we're not putting anything on Christian means a little anointed one and that means you have the same holy spirit that was in him in your life he goes on to say so the word Christian literally means little anointed ones during his life Jesus was called Messiah which meant the anointing one and we heard his little anointing ones who have been anointed by his holy spirit to represent him in this world interestingly the word Christian is only found three times in the Bible however how do you know if you are truly a Christian I can say I I can say I'm in a car because I can't say I'm a car because I'm in a garage or uh if I'm surrounded by a chicken fence that doesn't mean I'm a chicken I believe being a Christian is more than just saying a few words but is rather a changed life and a new way of living life according to the scripture it's the life that's in Christ that has to be in you and thus Christian takes on a deeper meaning it's not just you join Church you signed a membership you shook the pastor's hand or you gave heavy in the plate that doesn't make you a Christian but it's having the Holy Ghost is what made them Christians and they said in the book of Acts Church they said they took note after they've seen certain signs take place in the Believers they took note they've been with Jesus now some of those disciples after the upper room there's just three thousand Souls saved some of them worked physically with Christ but they took note the disciples had been with Jesus many others but some of them hadn't been physically with Jesus but they said they've been with Jesus why because his Same Spirit is in them they're doing the same works and didn't Jesus say that the works that I do shall you do also can I get an amen tonight he said the works that I do shall the Believers do also so it's not it's not us imitating Christ it's it's being Christ and thus that love is released to the people now that are the the confrontations the the the the the the the disappointments the people that have done you wrong the hatred in this world the persecution whether it's for you're a Christian or whether whatever it is there has to be something without ourselves come inside of ourselves by the Holy Ghost by a new birth that manifests a different response than what a human being would respond well I'm just going to be nice to that person well that's nice to be nice but we're talking about the love of God here and this love is not just some mental exercise This Love In Jesus had power over demonic forces I may believe that love is the strongest force in the world the love of God it has power over demonic forces you don't have power over demonic forces and maybe some of you listening you don't know if there's demonic forces or not there is demonic forces there's a real God there's a real devil there's demons there's hell there's Heaven there's other dimensions the Bible says that can you say Amen so now all this demonic realm is against you especially if you choose to be a believer and filled with the Holy Ghost all of Hell's guns are trained on you how do we fight it that with yourself good luck fighting demonic power on your own good luck fighting demonic power with your mental exercises there's one force that can defeat Satan's demonic power and that's the love of God somebody say praise the praise praise be to God so now let's look at these four things just a minute if you would again and uh we've already read the scripture but this is what it says this is the part of love we're finishing up tonight it says Divine love bears and protects things Divine love believes the best of things first Divine love always has hope for all things Divine love endures and holds up during difficulties now I know all of you have heard this uh recently before but I'm asking you to act like you've never heard it before and amen like you've never heard it before I can't help that the devil got in the equipment and nothing got recorded Sunday and so now if I'm gonna preach it to us again then you say Amen as if you never heard it before love and bears and protects all things love believes the best of things first love always has hope for all things and love endures and hopes up during difficulties holds up during difficulties in the Amplified this scripture says love bears all things regardless of what comes it believes all things looking for the best in each one it hopes all things remaining steadfast during difficult times endures all things without weakening it's strong can you say Amen it's faithful can you say Amen it's consistent can you say man and uh we find that in these statements that it's positive all of this is positive it's not cynical it's not this oh I'm I'm not sure that you'll make it this is positive it Bears all things it believes all things it's got victory in mind these statements this love has victory in mind no matter what condition you are in this love says you may be in that condition but I'm believing for something better how many would like crazy I'd like to be more of a positive person this Divine love is positive that you believe the best in somebody that you believe there's going to be a victory for somebody I like to be around people like that that can correct me but there's a victory in mind that's why I read to the scripture he gives he's given us the victory in Jesus Christ he didn't give us Jesus Christ in Christianity and the message of the last days to bring us defeated people and to go into our apps are defeated he brought it to end this in a big victory the Rapture is a big victory talk about Satan being upset when the True Believers leave this earth in a Rapture you talk about an ultimate victory it's just like Satan will be laying out completely faded I did everything I could and they're gone and that's it we'll just you just you know fan him just a little bit yeah it's a victory for the bride it's a total Victory so now all this has victory in it it has it's positive I mean it would like to be more positive it's getting past what you see to what you don't see and that's faith you can't find a cynical spirit in this you can't find a sarcastic spirit in this you can't find a doubtful spirit in this you can't find a pessimistic attitude in any of these scriptures of divine love you can't find a pessimist you can't find someone that just always leaves a doubt you'll never make it you're a dirt bag look where you're at there's a you know you might get help but I doubt it you can't find that in here it Bears all things it believes all things it hopes all things it's steadfast to keep believing all things no matter how many years it takes it's going to keep believing it endures things without weakening that's that's our Father Abraham he endured through doubts through unbelief through all the things he went through his faith remains steadfast I'm gonna believe Sarah Sarah do you feel any different today because he's going to have a son through this old grandma you feel any different today it's just foreign no I don't feel any different Abraham praise the Lord we're going to have a baby anyhow 25 years how about today Sarah Abraham you asked me that the last 30 days you've asked me the same question I'm sorry I don't feel any different praise God we're going to have a baby anyhow you're not going to have a grandson he's going to have a son that's 75 years old then up to 90 90 years old he's going to have a son what kind of weirdo what kind of weirdo believes that he's he's a grandpa type age he's not going to have a grandson he's going to have a son he reminds me of my dad collecting all those things for his grandchildren all those toys he collected didn't even have a grandchild yet but he went to McDonald's and bought the Happy Meals in his drawer was I looked at one day I looked into my dad's drawer and he's got all these Happy Meal toys he don't have any grandkids yet but he's getting ready he's gonna have grandkids someday and the he ended up I mean mom how many has he got how many grandkids now fifty thousand nine but I I seen dad and the drawers for all these toys from McDonald's you know and said Dad what's this he says for my grandchildren you don't have any grandchildren he's like Abraham but Abraham wasn't a grandchild it was a son at 75 years old you feel any different Sarah feeling different today no I'm sorry I don't feel nothing so right we're going to have it anyhow God told us we're going to have it it's a steadfast believing through the weakening times through the enduring things enduring criticism and during whatever it is and incidentally he had some times in the Old Testament Abraham that he didn't look like he acted like that but the New Testament Accord of him or account of him basically just recorded that he was a man of faith and he believed against hope believed in Hope praise the Lord so now uh so so you can't find cynical in here you can't find sarcasm you can't find doubtful you can't find a pessimistic attitude in any of this because Divine love is not out to look for a reason to condemn beautiful that's right he said I've heard this somewhere before well tonight is the first time because you can't get the archive of it Divine love is not out to look for the reason to condemn first but the reason to save to create an atmosphere that however bad it looks that there's Redemption there's hope it's Redemption you can find in this in this love you always find redemption in this love you now it's not a lack of Truth it'll never compromise on truth if someone's living a rebellious life then you can't justify that you can't say they're okay they're not okay but your hope believes that they're gonna be okay someday that God's going to bring them out of their Rebellion somebody say praise the Lord so this love is not wishy-washy compromising and and justifying things people do but it never finds the condemnation first it tries to say listen I know you're in a state and I know you've done this to me or you've done this to you this and you you've done all these things but listen now I'm going to pray for you because I'm believing all things for you and I believe God can save you it's got positive Hope and Faith in it can you say Amen so to create an atmosphere however bad it looks where there's Redemption if you do this with your kids your kids will be a lot healthier in life in this atmosphere in the home of a positive there's always redemption in every mistake how many want to raise positive kids or help us parents help us parents that they get corrected and they know where they're wrong and they feel conviction don't raise kids that don't you're going to cover and get get rid of all convicted convictions good they need to feel bad for what they've done but they need to be a positive atmosphere that that's not a judge of your character you're going to come out of that thing you're going to be better for it uh create a home like that create an atmosphere where there's Redemption so first it's a the first confession is to speak Faith and Hope not a denial of the person's condition not that not a denial of truth but speaking positive instead of negative First the power and lot power the power of death and life are in the tongue can you say Amen not looking for the negative First Christians and our friend our Christian friends they have a duty in the right thing to expose something that's wrong in my life and wrong in your life that if they don't do that for me or you it's not love love is corrective love is corrective this world and the church World removes all the correction in love that's not love God corrects us because he loves us so you don't remove this love doesn't remove the correction but but it's the type of correction that has value in it it has something no father a father is correct for their own benefit the Hebrews talks about it but he says our father corrects us for our own benefit that we could bring forth the fruits later he's got the fruits in mind he's got the victory in mind so he may correct you but he's got something in mind there's a victory for the correction there's a victory coming at the end of the correction help our parenting to be that way Lord help our parenting to be that way the ultimate in is a victory over something it's a positive hope over something can you say Amen you're not defeated for life because you made a mistake you're not doomed for life because you made a mistake make a mistake own up to it bring it to the cross go on with God There's Hope in that I love being around someone who has a value for the god in me can you say I don't want to be around people that just that they don't ever correct me that's that's immature but I want to be around someone who has the value for God in Me and they encourage that God in Me and they have a welcoming spirit that I can come to and if they have a welcoming spirit and they've got Divine love expressed to me I can listen to them when they come to correct me just okay with everybody the gospel is good news it's good telling it's a good story it's the true uh can you say it man it's it's something that ends in a victory there's always a victory it's not just a story but has power with it there's the power under the salvation of it there's power for redemption in the love of God I'm going to say it again there is Supernatural power in Redemption and in the cross and in the blood and in his Spirit there's power for Redemption for salvation of any situation I wouldn't stay in a church that did not preach against sin or against hell and the nature of sin why because it's in the Bible and so if it's in the Bible it needs to be preached but when you preach at hell when you preach the truth when you bring conviction to me which I'd love to have more preachers preaching conviction but when you preach it to me please preach the gospel with it preach it in its power and give me a Lifeline give me something to deliver my life from that hell don't just preach hell but give me a Lifeline give me a way out don't give me an intellectual sermon on the blood preach conviction under the word with no denominational restraints and let the life come from that gospel to save me there's life in the blood can you say Amen tonight you can't have access to the blood without the full word it's not a symbol in the cross it's a power it's a substance of the Life of Christ preach that to me preach out to me give me a lifeline give me something to grab a hold of that if I Repent he's going to save me from my situation somebody said praise the Lord this is this is a positive thing but it's not positive thinking people think that the gospel now they've preached on TV and everything it's it's it's it's positive thinking the blood is not just positive thinking in the mind of positive thinking it expresses confidence and hope that something is going to happen you see if you just talk positive thinking there's no blood in that there's no power in that oh there's the power of a mind that can think the the what's the the book called The Power of Positive Thinking yeah there's a certain power but with that they were building the Tower of Babel it was positive thinking that built the Tower of Babel till God himself said if we don't confuse their language I can't stop the power of their positive thinking seminars positive thinking seminars rebuilding the Tower of Babel because something completely against God so we're not when we when we look at the Divine love of God this isn't positive thinking this is the has the blood in it and it's a positive hope that the power of the blood can change you and bring a real victory in your life it's positive because the blood has positive effects always praise be to God the blood always has positive effects the blood will always have problems the blood will always cause us to Triumph Triumph the blood will always bring the victory in our life there is no defeat in the blood of Jesus Christ there is none we will always Triumph through Christ praise the Lord Hallelujah it Bears all things it believes all things it hopes all things it expresses confidence and hope uh that something is going to happen it's a complete coverage of all things because it keeps saying all things Bears all things beliefs all things it covers everything it's a god response to everything it's Faith Faith Works by Divine love and so if we have more of this Divine love Faith Masters every circumstance faith will bring more of this Divine love can you say Amen praise the Lord so we'll come back to this quote in just a minute but look at this now we're we're reading here from Pastor Stephen Cole there's been some great things come out of the messenger of the hour out of this series and some other writers that I've read from as well I like how Pastor Stephen Cole says some things here and on this particular four sections of the uh of the uh the love of God these here he says he takes the first one and it to love bears and protects things to protect and it means to protect by covering stick with me here now we'll just we'll just wrap this up it's to protect by covering this love protects by covering love doesn't broadcast the problems of others love doesn't run down others with jokes sarcasms or put-downs love defends the character of the other person as much as possible within the limits of Truth love won't lie about weaknesses but neither will deliberately Expose and emphasize those wickedness weak weaknesses love protects love bears love protects love is a covering and that's where we have that statement that says love covers a multitude of sins it's not that the blood can't wash away sins but but as far as people's weaknesses it's covering it's covering those those things those weaknesses and it's not out broadcasting the problems of Others May the Lord help us to stop broadcasting the problems of others may the Lord help us Believers to stop being sarcastic and jokes and put Downs of other people just to make us feel better in Satan's even the message Satan he says if there's sin in your heart if there's fault in your heart if you've got anything pray now and ask God to forgive you you pray for me I'll pray for you God bless you is my prayer till we meet till we meet you sing in that song till we meet and God be with you too we meet again do you love one another John said little children love one another love one another for love covers a multitude of sins love covers love protects love theirs it doesn't endorse a lie or endorse endorse sin but it protects can we see that when it says love believes all things in the NIV it's translated love always trust and always trust this does not mean gullibility it does not it does mean that love is not suspicious and doubting of the other person's character and motives without good reason even if his actions offended you even if his actions offended you that love is not suspicious and doubting of the other person's character and motives without good reason you better have some good solid reasons I've been thinking about this this week and that is that you know when we go through and try to work out uh things from the past you know you got several scenarios there uh you you sometimes hearing all the scenarios helps you see the picture a little bit better and be a little bit more forgiving because you didn't know the whole picture so so here Paul says you're supposed to as the church be able to judge things judge matters you're not supposed to take one another to court because you should have the maturity and this Divine love this mature love to judge matters amongst yourself but when we go to judge our judgment has to be it can't be limited to just our opinion it can't be limited just to Eliza this is what I heard so I'm making a judgment call that's not what your judgment so now you wait to hear all the facts and and so now you got the facts and the facts can be truth so once you hear the facts oh now I can make a better judgment call but guess what even after you got the facts then you got where that person heart their heart was and guess what you're not a prophet you don't know their heart so ever more so careful we must be ever more so careful how we quickly judge matters how many want mature judgment love judgment with the Divine love so it doesn't jump right out and make a judgment call that's it you know that's that's how I no no no wait to hear all the facts and then when you hear the facts oh yeah it this happened this it's truth we're not denying it but then you're looking at the person's heart we're going to get to it in a minute I'm going to end this with a quote and a live action she said live action in The Prophet's life where he was confronted with something such an evil spirit but you're going to see this principle is that if you make a quick judgment call a lot of times you're not you're not acting by Divine love a quick judgment call is not acting by Divine love the facts and then you got the person's heart I want you to really hold that in your heart because I'm going to elaborate so he goes on to say that but love believes the other person is innocent until proven guilty not guilty until proven isn't it if there's a problem love doesn't jump immediately to blame the other person in the family this trust shows Itself by not grilling the other person about every detail of a story like an attorney cross-examining a defendant it means believing in your kids expressing confidence in them I'm thankful that my parents this writer says this uh this pastor says I'm thinking when my parents trusted me as a teenager it made me want to live up to that trust one of my friends had parents who did not trust him and he lived up to their distrust sometimes you will get ripped off in life when you trust people but don't give up on trusting because what love never gives up so someone broke your trust someone ripped you off someone Did You Wrong okay but don't give up trusting because love will persist in trusting oh somebody say praise the Lord you won't but this love will it's going to trust it's going to say I'm going to believe the best for the next thing for the I'm going to believe the best I'm going to lose all my trust you know we live in a world there's no trust anymore there's no trust in churches there's no trust in Christianity hardly there's no trust in Preachers a lot of preachers have failed you see the humanness and preachers sometimes trust is everything we live in a world doesn't have a trust in anything the trust the government they don't have any trust in anything there's got to be something to trust in I can tell you something tonight you can always trust this word you may not be able to trust people or maybe some Churches have done you wrong and maybe some preachers but listen you can always trust his word he's the same yesterday today and forever he's never failed in his word can you say Amen my daughter's writing a song about that now he's the same yesterday today and forever I believe his promise because his promise has always come through he's always kept his promises so there is something we can trust in this world The Love Will persist in trusting it'll just keep trusting well I'm gullible got hurt over and over and over again yeah I guess he forgive over and over again because if we lose trust and we lose and we get pessimistic and we just you know there's not much to live for anymore there's no hope there's no skip in your step there's no smile there's no joy anymore because everything's negative you don't trust anybody I want to be around anybody I just sit in front of my you know my phone and I don't it's a pretty boring life but the Holy Ghost for life is a vibrant a live life that believes the best and believes something better is coming it's positive praise the Lord love hopes all things that means it's not pessimistic it does not expect the one love to fail but to succeed you ever met people that I'm expecting that person to fail I just expect that they failed their whole life so I'm expecting them to completely fail that's not Divine love Divine love has an expectation I don't want them to fail I want them to have a victory it's not pessimistic it's it's it's it love hopes for all things There's Hope always in it never take the Hope out love refuses to take failure as final it exudes a Godly optimism which says I know you can do it brother because God is God in you is able to do it my brother it does not ignore reality it doesn't close its eyes to problems but it rests in the promises of God that he is working all things together for the good can you say Amen praise the Lord to those who love him though those are called according to his purpose and so love always always hopes it always hopes because brother I know God can do it brother I'm believing God can do it I know it seems impossible but I'm believing with you that's what we want to hear out of believers and when when they were getting ready to cross into the promised land and canis barnia and they they sent spies over and most of the spies come back and said it's not doable it's not a doable thing let's go back let's go back to Egypt give up the whole congregation was discouraged and that's when Caleb and Joshua rose up and stilled the crowd I always like to think if there's that many people there if Caleb and Joshua were sick of the pessimism and sick of the attitudes and sick of we can't do this and we can't do that I always think if there's a lot of people to think they just they still the crowd they didn't just say can I say something foreign please Moses could I say something no I think when they still the crowd they said ever everybody be quiet I got something to say shut up everybody be quiet I've been over there with these guys and I'm bringing a different report they see the Giants they seen the walls if they want to see themselves as grasshoppers let them do it I'm not a grasshopper I'm a Son of God and I'm bringing back a good report here's the evidence and I'm going to tell you we are more than able to take the land sometimes you got to steal the pessimism sometimes you say everybody shut up sometimes you they used to interrupt conversations at The Retreat I forget what it was called but when things turn negative at the table somebody would hijack the conversation that's what they called it they hijack it turn it to the word turn it to something positive and a lot of times you're gonna get some funny looks when you do that what are you doing what kind of weirdo are you get ready to be by yourself but that's that Joshua and Caleb said but I think things are going to get better I believe this brother's going to be okay let's pray for him let's not talk about him can you say Amen shut up steal the people we're well able to take the land can you say a match because love hopes all things Hallelujah the last one love endures all things the word endure in the middle is a military term that means to sustain the assault of an enemy it has the idea of holding up under trial of perseverance in spite of difficulties it means that love hangs in there it's with our song we've been singing Love never gives up from Bill Gaither love never lets down that keeps on trying through Smiles or frowns love never gives up it's a military word that when there's an assault of the enemy it's holding up it's persevering in spite of difficulties it means that love is going to hang in there love hangs in there it is not just passive stoic attitude it's a positive triumphant spirit that sticks it out until the end praise the Lord there is an epidemic among Christians of bailing out of tough situations the excellent way that I'm preaching to you believers is that we are not to bail out just because things get tough we're not to bail out of marriage just because the marriage gets tough I'd say if we ask of a show of hands that every marriage is not perfect and every marriage has tough times but the world has taught us to bail out the world is taught us I can make it on my own well not if you've become one with that person and had a vow with that person with the Lord you ought to battle it out together say we're going to get through this tough time but we've been taught to bail out and we've got a lot of reasons for doing it many times but this Divine love it has something in it there's hope there's a door how many like a door out there's there's the Door of Hope can you say amen there's an epidemic to bail out or test situations people don't like something that happens in a church they go find another church more of their liking they run into problems or disagreements in their marriage they grow tired of the effort and they bail out but you and so these things definitely are happening every day in our world uh and he says I'm not minimizing the the seriousness you know an adultery in a marriage it destroys trust and creates all sorts of problems in marriage I'm not suggesting that it's easy to work through it takes a lot of hard work to rebuild from something like that one brick at a time but God's best is to forgive and renew the marriage my question is do you have this excellent way this Divine love do you have that forgiveness or do you have human forgiveness because what the scripture tells me is that God's very best is to forgive and that forgiveness begins to work to renew the marriage if we don't have true repentance and true forgiveness we cannot get out of situations you can intellectually say these things and read quotes all you want to but until you say God I Lay My Life on the altar give me the true flood of forgiveness in my heart because in that is the power to give a Door of Hope just a little door that things are going to work back into a Reconciliation somebody say Amen tonight you've been taught by the world to find reasons to bail out but you see now God's best is to forgive and renew the marriage not to bail out love endures all things oh my goodness that covers a lot how much can you endure God can give you Grace to endure things friends if we've lost forgiveness and repentance we've lost everything for our families for the church for following the Lord everything those are essential things but they can't be mechanical somebody somebody think about it now they can't be intellectual you can forgive somebody intellectually and there's no forgiveness in your heart there's no release of the love of God there's no Door of Hope don't tell me no no we want the real thing say my hurt restricts me from really forgiving well you've explained it well because you're hurt is more important than finding this substance of the Forgiveness of God and when the Forgiveness of God becomes bigger than your hurt let God heal your hurt then it becomes a power to give you a Door of Hope to be released back to reconciliation I believe that and there's some tough situations sometimes that seem impossible hurtful situations I'm not talking about here I'm talking about hearing my whole life even amongst Believers tough family domestic situations that seem impossible and sometimes it's just but but but what if you're if your partner doesn't do it hopefully both of you will you can find a release of the love of God yourself somebody say praise the Lord this is how love acts it's selfless wholly dedicated directed to the building up of another person of course nobody can love completely like that and human it's got to be God's love so put Christ as we said this Christ in these scriptures now that we're finishing up with the characteristics of divine love it says charity we're calling it Divine love that's the same thing put Christ in there Christ is patient Christ is kind Christ is not jealous Christ does not brag Christ is not arrogant Christ does not act unbecomingly Christ does not seek its own Christ is not provoked easily provoked Christ does not take into account a wrong suffered Christ does not rejoice in unrighteousness but rejoices with the truth oh my there's a whole other sermon in that right there that I got to go back to that this love rejoices in truth it pursues truth and when it pursues it and gets to the bottom of it it rejoices in it not only does truth have victory in it and freedom but but truth is the thing that brings us to what we want and love will always pursue the truth and not act too quickly it pursues it and it rejoices when truth prevails so powerful uh Christ always protects Christ always trusts Christ always hopes Christ always perseveres if you want to love one another we must focus on his love for us and walk in his spirit for him to produce this Divine Capstone love in us can you say Amen tonight this goes on in conclusion he says love at first sight is easy to understand but it's when two people have been looking at each other for years that love becomes a miracle but it's not really a miracle it's a result of yielding to God did you catch it now love at first sight that's easy right and it's easy to understand but now it's the ones you're around all the time and the ones and your boss for 30 years yeah that's when this this really gets its test but it's not a miracle it's a result of yielding to God repeatedly confronting our selfishness and daily practical biblical love in our homes and as the old Apostle John they said was so weak I brought this up in some Services before the old Apostle John was so weak he had to be carried into church in Church meetings at the end of the meeting he would be helped to his feet to give a word of exhortation and he would always repeat just one word of exhortation little children love one another the disciples grew weary of the same words every time finally they asked him why he said the same thing over and over again and he replied because it is the Commandment of the Lord number one and is the observation of Love Alone that is sufficient so his answer to everything was Brothers you're debating over something you've got a disagreement you got this just love one another the observation of it is of it alone is sufficient someone has said that if we discovered that we only had five minutes left to say all we wanted to say every telephone booth every phone cell phone would be going and would be occupied in those five minutes by people calling other people to stammer that they love them Selfless Love is our priority the excellent way is the bride's calling it is our calling it's not just a teaching it's our calling prophecies will fail all these other things will fail but love will endure forever and love is the most powerful force in the world in relation to this I I I don't think I read the I'll just read the first part of this perfect faith is a master of circumstances perfect fake Masters all circumstances no matter what it is it Masters it now watch when you believe anything do anything and you got faith in what you're doing no matter what the circumstance is that don't have one thing to do with it see it Masters that circumstance isn't that wonderful and that's this love that produces faith that no matter what you're confronted with no matter what circumstance you're confronted with it only has one response to it it's Faith it's love and instead of the circumstance mastering you it Masters the circumstance the evil in front of you and it it goes beyond what the quick response is now I'm just going to end this by um reminding you of things that you you probably know but remind you of some uh there's some examples and brother branham's life that he gave and one goes all the way back to 1950 um in Portland Oregon and he gave some examples of different times of when something really struck him um and I you know the story so I'm not going to get on I'm just going to focus on this one because it's been really special to me to look over the different times he gave this account of when he was praying for the sick and when this Maniac man came in in Portland Oregon ran up to the platform the two small policemen couldn't hold him back because they were small this was a very large man demon-possessed and really lashing out some pretty hard things and he said you're a false preacher I'm gonna I'm gonna break every bone in your body tonight and and the brother Brown says he could do that with his size you know and he's just spilling out this Venom I don't know where it came from they said that he had had some domestic trouble before but he's unleashing all of this evil upon him and so I've been reading some of these things and just reminding myself of these stories going back to 1950 and one of the things I catch in all the stories though I think one of the things that I'd like you to just see before we close tonight is that in each of those incidences when I was confronted with stuff like that and with this maniac and Portland he said something come over me something very unique come over me and he said many times he said I wish I could have that all the time well if he's got the Holy Ghost he's got it all the time but see it's got to be released especially in moments when someone is hating you and he said these unique situations and by the way this is before the Seven Seals were preached I I hate to bring that up but he's moving into something there that I want even for the book of redemption is opened but you see now he said something he said I wish oh I wish I had that all the time and I wish you as a congregation could have that all the time but it come over him and what it did he says all of a sudden now I love this man with a deep love and I wasn't so now he's not reacting with the normal human reaction of fight or flight any man and he was a man he would react saying I've got to get the defenses up I've got to do something here he's not going to talk to me like that police get him all those other things he's having something else come over him how many would like to have that happen to you and that's something else that come over him was way more powerful you know Sunday we've talked about security here this was way more powerful than any human security this is a force that could break down demonic power and he says all of a sudden this that come over me he said I love the man there's so many different accounts and he goes into it he gives details and each time he tells the story It's a Wonderful story and he says as he come to the platform he said he hawked up and he gives the oh and he spit across the stage and spit right in brother brahm's face this big Globus bit and he's saying I'll tear you up I'll break every bone in your body I'll show you who's boss just all these things and so this is just one account but he says he walked up to me with his hands like this and his teeth set together and he and we got to me right in my face I just stood and looked at him and you know what I wish I could always feel like I did right then and instead of despising that man instead of hating that man I felt sorry for him I loved him why I thought that man here's the thoughts that man don't want to be like that no matter what he said it's not him talking like that he wants to be a normal man he wants to love his babies and his wife is a sweetheart he wants to come in at night and take up his little babies and play with him and go out and work and come in and put his his arm around his wife and have a home like any other man and you know what he's saying is the truth any Normal Man that's not possessed with demons that's the normal life he wants to come home to your wife to come home to your family to provide for your family have love in the family to love your children to provide for them a normal good spirit in the home it's when these other demonic Powers come that we have divorce yelling separation arguments that end in fights come on somebody say amen that's not of God the son of God and so he said I wish I could feel that all he said I I felt sorry for him and that man don't want to be like that he wants to be home take his little babies and play with him go out and work and come and have a home like any other man and that's not the man he'd be my brother that's the devil in that poor fella and listen close and that happening I wish that could happen right now here listen now I wish that could happen that come over me to Every Soul that's here right now he said there wouldn't be a feeble person Among Us in the next five minutes and you can't make yourself do it it has to be a gift of God and while standing there I love them I thought poor fellow and right while I was speaking projecting to him now you can't Bluff yourself that's what somebody was so-called Christianity you're trying to act like something that you're not you can't fool a wild animal many times I walk right face to face with kind all kinds of wild animals and someone said are you afraid brother Brown no sir I love them and they know it you can't fool them I walk I used to have a lot of writing I've rode for many years and so forth I walked into wild horses and somehow in a few minutes he'd have his head laid over my shoulder and I just put a blanket on him and walk him around a little bit with a blanket on and then throw the saddle on him and the first thing you know I'd be riding him along he loves you and if you really love him he knows it now listen I want to tell you something human beings are more intelligent than animals you can't tell people you love them they won't believe it unless it's the real thing there to prove it so you say oh brother you know we have such great fellowship and down in your heart you're holding a grudge in your heart you got too much fake Christianity oh I love you with the love of the Lord but brother you better make sure that's real in your heart instead of holding a grudge for years it's always amazing people can come and worship in the same congregation for years they can worship together even take communion together sometimes but they can't Fellowship just I'm just saying it doesn't really make sense I don't want to be around that person holding a grudge in your heart it has to be real God make it real your neighbor your neighbor knows it you got to be clean and above war and say Lord God created me a clean heart to love and when that poor fellow staying there in the depths of my soul I felt sorry for him and just as I was feeling sorry the Holy Spirit begin to speak and the man fell across my feet it's wonderful to see what God can do love is the mightiest force that there is did you know God is love he that loveth is of God now I don't mean affectionate love I mean Godly love affection of Love creates lust but I'm talking about Godly love real love I just like to open up my heart and tell you a little um inside of my life and would like to let you know you strangers we're children of strangers and children of God that are here this is just on my heart to say this now I'm going to I'm going to something else but I want to say this I'll tell you a little bit of the inside of my life I'm so grateful tonight the Lord for the to the Lord Jesus for he's let me do what he's let me to do for his people I love people and so he goes on and talks about this love of he talks about how it's manifested and I could say so much more but but the accounts of this bring out so many facets of it to where that man fell at his feet and he was delivered of his his demons at that moment because this something come over him the most powerful force in the world and it dismantled this spirit dismantled this Spirit he said the Lord said through him today you'll fall at my feet and he says I'll show you whose feet who's going to fall whose feet and he started to run towards brother Branham and all of a sudden at the last minute he just crumbled and they had to come and take him off brother Bam's feet because he was just there he was he that once a man is delivered of stuff like that and he just has no hardly any life left in him what did it he was able to project past my point tonight as I close is that this love came over him and what did that love do what did it do it didn't react like we would normally react fight or flight I'm running I'm getting out of here I'm fighting I'm getting my fist up you know brother Brandon was a boxer he probably could have did some damage but we're not talking about how we react like the world does right and now they respond to confrontation they respond to evil people they respond to demon power you should not let demon Power Make You Afraid you should be praised that I have the love of God let it come over me now and manifest because it's more powerful than this demon may we as Christians yield ourselves to this more excellent way in whatever we come upon in life whatever it is tomorrow you may face something you probably will somebody or something or some spirit this is what I teach it this is not just a teaching I'm saying Lord let me find this love and faith to react perfect Faith Masters every circumstance let not my reaction be even to something like this that the prophet encounter let it not be the normal 99 of human beings the normal thing of fight or flight fighting back how am I going to deal with this and you're going through their mind how you're dealing with us all of us do that it's that's normal right but if we were to yield back and say now Lord I have access to the same Holy Ghost love that the prophet did let me just step back just a minute let me examine and then then that projects past the demon and it's looking just like all these attributes tonight love bears all things love believes all things love believes the best and guess what God has in mind and that love has in mind for this Maniac in Portland Oregon you know what God has in mind and this love has in mind of victory not the demon not him spitting in his face listen friends if someone Hawks up and spits in your face all that it's a test but all the normal things of reactions went out the door and something come over him he said oh I wish I could have that on me all the time and it was such a powerful force it broke that spirit this is the more excellent way this is not a teaching this is an atmosphere this is his love this is a substance that Believers have access to and I believe this Series has done us all good I believe this series was of the Lord I believe it's the pastors that he's wanted us sheep to feed in for a while and I there's a few scriptures left in First Corinthians and I want to go on with them but the attributes we've kind of finished but I want to go in because really the theme at the end prophecies will fail these things may fail but love will never fail and so the the end result now by the faith now abideth hope but the greatest of these is divine love so what's the end of all this thing it's the end of all this what's the end of the message what's the what do we what's the culmination of all this Fellowship woman sister Julie about it what's the what's the Well it can't be just a mechanical intellectual stepping into a rapture there's going to be Supernatural to this there's going to be a quick short work in the bride how many believe that it won't be a public show but there's going to be a quick short work in The Bride of Jesus Christ The True Believers around the world something's going to energize the faith to Not Just Produce something that's publicly but something has to bring that Faith to pass and I personally believe the end result is to find this more excellent way and live by it and in that he can do all things you know when that Maniac when the police drug him off his feet he said do you know at that moment and I didn't read this till today he said at that moment they come out of the structures they come out of the wheelchairs they come out of the the blind eyes were opened no prayer line when they seen the love of God manifested that way all the demons broke up at that moment come out of their structures come out of their wheelchairs all over the building there was spontaneous healing you see it's not a public it doesn't have to be a public show it doesn't have to be worked up can you say Amen live by this true genuine substance the love of God and let it do what it's going to do but I guarantee you it's going to do the supernatural because when Divine love projects Grace takes over Sovereign Grace and things will happen you never dreamed of you never dreamed of because in this substance he can do all things praise be to God let's give the Lord a handcuff a praise amen let's Stand Together living by faith in Jesus above trusting confiding in his great love from a harm safe it is Sheltering on I'm living by faith and I fear Noah love never

would open your eyes to the other dimension and you could see the invisible you could see the Lord here you can see the Angels here what if your eyes could be opened would it change how you look at it
