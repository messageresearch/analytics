[Music] believe that you chose me [Music] I'll hold you in the beginning you will hold me in the end every moment in the middle make my heart your Bethlehem be born in me Matthew 1 and verse 18 now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise when as his mother Mary was espouse to Joseph before they came together she was found with child of the Holy Ghost then Joseph her husband being a just man and not willing to make her a public example was minded to put her away privately but while he thought on these things behold the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream saying Joseph thou son of David fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost and she shall bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name Jesus for he shall save his people from their sins now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet saying Behold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name Emmanuel which being interpreted is god with us then Joseph being being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him and took unto him his wife and knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son and he called his name Jesus I want to speak on the birth of Christ under strange circumstances and when it worded it this way when it said the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise the Amplified says there the birth took place under these type of circumstances and when I was reading it the other day I realized that the setting that his birth took place was kind of a strange setting and that's why I've titled that this morning the birth of Christ under strange circumstances because the circumstances and the setting and what took place and how it took place was uh from the carnal mind a pretty troubling type of setting it was a pretty strange setting and as a matter of fact we wouldn't believe that God would be doing something as great as send coming himself and connecting with us as God he would do as it says in the scripture for the purpose of saving his people from their sins I'll tell you that's a pretty big condescension that's a pretty big moment that's happening right here that he's beginning the process of saving his people from their sins how many know that you're a sinner this morning we're all Sinners without hope without Christ coming can you say Amen so this is a very amazing spot of Prophecy to be fulfilled it's one of the greatest uh places of Prophecy to be fulfilled that it's called Emmanuel this would be God with us this would be so significant it's God With Us it's God condescending to us and we know he came in a little baby at first and began life that way but it was actually God condescending to us it was God coming and connecting with us it was it was the birth of the king not not a king it was the birth of the ultimate King and and and yet it's enshrouded it's it's it's surrounded and clouded as if I could say that the whole greatest thing of the birth of Christ was clouded by very strange circumstances and in fact I can safely say that that it this this um this situation that Christ was born in was actually out of sync completely with a normal thought patterns of the world and also I want to emphasize this he came out of sync with the normal thought patterns of the religious organizations completely contrary to the way they thought he would come because even their minds in relig religious denominations and organization even their minds although they were worshiping God their minds had be become Twisted by their Creeds and their dogmas that they weren't looking at God correctly they didn't see God right so when he slipped in in Simplicity and enshrouded with kind of a a situation that was very very strange and looked ungodly when God came in that they were so messed up in the way they thought about God is that they couldn't understand why God would do this and so uh because it was against the thought patterns and the normal thought patterns it seems that it's a strange circumstances and the carnal mind the carnal mind would never see this never understand this if they seen God behind this it would take a revelation to see God behind this circumstances can you say Amen so you can really say it this way to make it understandable this wonderful Jewish believing couple believed in Jehovah God this wonderful Jewish believing couple Joseph and Mary fell in love and they got engaged this wonderful Jewish believing couple Joseph and Mary fell in love and got engaged and then she turns up pregnant before they got married said she turns up pregnant before they got married and they hadn't been together yet to have a child they're only engaged a spouse to one another the final marriage hadn't taken place and they were not together yet and she turns up pregnant so you could easily you could really say that this is circumstances that are very very strange for God to be born in and come in his kingdom and first of all It Don't Fit with how God in our minds would do things remember how many believe it this morning remember God is a righteous God he is righteous he's the ultimate of righteous he's where we get righteousness from how many believe God is righteous how many believe he's the only one that's righteous and so we know that and most people go we know God is righteous and it don't seem like God like his nature to reveal and to bring his righteousness to us with circum es that did not look righteous at all and when you take the laws of God and the things that were're still today teaching young people about uh saving sex before marriage and saving that honor for the marriage day and all these things that were Tau to the Jews in the Old Testament we still teach today because they're are God's principles they're God's laws and they are true can you say amen and they still apply to the human being can you say Amen so this is what Joseph and Mary believ this is is what Mary's parents believe this is what the church is still held on to as a matter of fact the law they held on to so long if somebody committed adultery then they held to the Old Law that they had to be stoned they actually had to be stoned if they broke that and were found pregnant before the marriage so now this is what happens and so the carnal mind could never look at what's happening and see God behind it I'm just stopping for a minute and I'm saying why Lord why Lord did you do it this way yes and I don't even have all the answers CU I don't understand all of God but I know I can look through the Bible and see a pattern of him when he comes he reveals himself in Simplicity and also he comes and he's working in a in in a thing that if we looked at it from our eyes carnally we wouldn't find God in it why don't I talk about you when you're living in sin and when you're out there and then God begins to work in your life and you still got habits and different things but God's being beginning to work and nobody knows what's happening it's a good thing God didn't judge you right there it's a good thing he could look inside and see the seat of God within you it's a good thing that somebody could look beyond what was happening in your circumstances I'm preaching to you today we have to look past the circumstances that surround our life and we have to be looking for the god that's trying to reveal himself L we miss god brother Paul I've had some trouble this year that I never dreamed would happen in my family domestic life whatever has happened I've had some things you wouldn't dream it's unprecedented well it's not unprecedented it's probably happened before but you think it's unprecedented but when you look at it with from the carnal eyes and the embarrassment of everything everybody else that sees your life you can only be looking at your circumstances but there's only one answer from the message that we're to look at circumstances we are not to bow to our circumstances we are not to read read the wrong thing into our circumstances we're actually supposed to embrace our particular circumstances because we know that in those things God can be revealing himself if I have any lesson for the church this year this is my this is my New Year's revelation we better stop looking at the outside and the surface we better start looking for God to be revealing yourself I'm looking for God where is he trying to reveal himself is everybody with me because you can judge matters and think you got it right and you're completely wrong you can judge another person by even how they would act or dress sometimes and you could judge it completely wrong we have to grow up and not judge things by the flesh Paul said we know no man after the flesh including Jesus Christ he says I know we knew him after the flesh he lived here for 30 but we can't even know Jesus after the flesh we have to know him by this Elohim this being this Christ that comes into our lives but we can't know any man after the Flesh and so now we find then that first of all you don't see God that would fit into these things because he's a righteous God I'm going to get into that a little bit more in a minute what righteousness really is it don't seem like God would reveal himself and bring his righteousness in circumstances that were not righteous at all and yet we know from 1 Corinthians chap 1 verse 27 it expresses to us that God will stumble conventional wisdom and will hide himself in base things this is the way it's worded 1 Corinthians uh 1 127 but God had chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise and God had chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are Mighty and base things of the world and things which are despised hath God chosen yay and the things which are not to bring to not things that are that no flesh could glory in his presence God's got an agenda God's going to make the world look stupid one day come on can you say amen God is going to confound the wise God he's already done it he'll do it again that someday they're going to say there's no way that God sent his last day's message through a package like this there's no way you can do it but God's going to confound all the wisdoms of every University of every Seminary of every God is going to make them look stupid when he shows that's exactly what I was doing in the end time and you missed me so we know by First Corinthians 1 that's God's nature to do that so it's not like God in our own minds to do things this way and then Through The Eyes of everyone around Mary and Joseph think about it now when this happens and she comes to her mom and dad and says I'm pregnant you know uh Through The Eyes of everyone Mary's parents Joseph Mary the church that was around them would who would eventually hear you know word bad uh negative travels faster than positive oh yes and so uh everyone's going to know about it and through the Through The Eyes this all looks very very bad and also it looks embarrassing one of the Traditions that we have and I've told you before we we watch during Christmas time I don't know if it' be tonight or tomorrow we watch a movie it's called The Nativity Story please don't tell the whole world we watch a movie but if anybody hears it's about movie about it's one of the best movies about the birth birth of Christ and how Mary went through all those Transitions and so we watch it every year and uh I love it because it's so real in some places a lot of the you know the the movies of Christ are just really glossed over and but this one they're really real and and so when when Mary and Joseph's parents and I can't remember completely I should remember it because we watch it every year but I can't remember what Happ was but I know the tension and I know Mary's dad he became he didn't know what to do when when he heard this she's sitting there by herself saying the angel told her this and their spouse he's encouraged this engagement with Joseph and Mary he's real proud because he's got a business and he's watching out for his daughter he's got a good Mary was a little reluctant in the movie to to go with him but they you know they eventually fell in love and so now this whole he's very happy why is the Daddy happy this is going to be a normal thing I got somebody to take care of my daughter this a normal life and then the girl his daughter comes and says I'm pregnant what what and it's just you see the tension mared mared he's he's you know he's pacing the floor and then he looks at Joseph and Joseph's going because in something like this you're trying to find somebody to blame you're trying to find what's going on this is interrupting the whole plan the whole normal let me tell you something God will interrupt your plan you people that are control freaks get ready for a less and if you come close to God God's going to show you you're not in control of life you're not in control of your family and so Mary's dad felt that's this is all in the bag everything is normal and she turns up pregnant and so now the people are going to hear with everybody who looks from that point on this whole thing is going to be embarrassing it's going to be looked down on and yet in the middle of this is what God's doing to bring his kingdom to the world to the earth I don't I don't understand all that I don't understand some of the people that are sitting here this morning I don't understand some of you you shouldn't be here in church with your family worshiping the way that you're worshiping everything in the caral mind says no not you when you look at when I'm looking over your lives and seeing some of you shouldn't be here some of you come up under a real strict background and so sometimes that strictness makes you distant towards God and your hesitant towards God because you come up in a legalistic background but some didn't we got some drug addicts here we got some people that slept around we got some people you're sitting next to you that weren't perfect you got all kinds of testimonies here this morning you shouldn't be here and that's why we have to mature and grow and not judge things by the outside appearance because the circumstances can look very very unrighteous and God's trying to birth true righteousness it's easy for us today to believe this was Emanuel 2,000 years ago it's easy for us to believe because we see he was birthed we see that he grew up we see he had Miracles and signs and wonders there's no man like this in the face of the Earth that's lived for 33 years then we see it all end in a death burial and a resurrection his he has an empty tomb so now it's easy for us to say today that this was Emanuel but back when he was being born nobody could identify and say there's no way way that Emanuel God With Us is happening in these circumstances after seeing all that Jesus did in his life most will say it's God now but in that hour the circumstances around it would have you very confused that can't be God that can't be God working it's just not the way that God would do it and verse 19 speaks of Joseph now I want you to start bringing this out verse 19 Matthew 1:19 then after we they all find out about the pregnancy then we find out verse 19 then Joseph her husband being a just man and not willing to to make her a public example was minded to put her away privately so now here's the next thing I want to show that we can do sometimes is that when you have something embarrassing take place and and and and and you have something even in your own life a mistake or whatever and you have something take place we're always trying to what can we do in our minds to cover this up what can we do to fix this how can we minimize the gossip how can we and so Joseph and and Mary's dad is in this mode of trying to to to to to get something together here to keep this private because it's embarrassing to the family what do we do here why can't we do this and and and he so so the thoughts and this is when circumstances happen in our lives that are not pleasant that are negative the first thing we engage in is our mind and our thought life to try to figure out how to fix it try to hide it because no human being likes to be embarrassed and so when something happens when your testimony something's going to go out that you're not uh uh coming out smelling like a rose we will do things in our mind to try to private and he says he's a just man I think it was very honorable I've preached that to young people this was an honorable man because he's thinking of Mary and all that's going to go around about her so he's thinking I'll just go ahead and SP start the divorce proceedings even before we're technically married and we'll keep this as private as we can and we'll do this that and the other and so that was all fine that was all fine that was just but that wasn't God's plan and because Jose was going to act upon this and not marry her the angel of the Lord had to step in like he has to step in with your life sometimes when your mind has figured everything out and you're going to do it this way to cover for yourself the angel of the Lord May step into your life and say no no you're not going to do that because what you don't see is what's happening is the word is being fulfilled in your life how many would raise your hand and say I thank God for his grace in my life that he sends his angels his Messengers his five-fold ministry and when I was about ready to act upon foolishness and act upon something that I thought was right the angel of the Lord over the pulpit stood and said don't do that stop sit still watch I was looking for a quote last night I was looking because there's some situation where that I can't remember who it was maybe it was just a few months ago but it's just like sit still God's doing something sit still God's doing something don't act too quickly cuz God's doing something and that's the way we got to be in maturity we got to be careful that we don't act too quickly with this can I get an amen this morning we got to be careful that we don't act too quickly when our circumstances make us embarrassed and we got to do something about it maybe sit still God might be doing something sit still and see the glory of God stand still and see the glory of God we act upon our own carnal Minds because sometimes of the embarrassment of what going to look like to everybody else and this is the mode that Joseph was in and he's a man of honor and respect to help cover for Mary he sets out to do a private divorce really thinking to think through all this and figure out a plan we do that in our circumstances trying to figure out ourselves the best way we can do things because it makes us nervous when something happens out of the normal it's going to make you look bad and human beings do not like looking bad often human beings do not look they don't like looking bad and often they deflect the attention to someone else by gossiping and putting another one down people criticize to make themselves look better my my my point is to you this morning is we step into action quickly sometimes to deal with situations and is amazing what we do to cover up our shame and our embarrassment so that we can look righteous and holy in front of everybody life dishes out some abnormal things and we want to appear normal we want to appear good to everyone this action and effort to make ourselves look good to everybody is flawed because it's trying to work it out ourselves it's trying to make us appear right to others but the main reason it's flawed is it might be against what God is really trying to do he says by but while Joseph thought on these things what's he thinking about how can I fix this what can I do put it away privately we got to do this we got to cover it up while he was thinking all those things the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream saying Joseph the son of David fear not why is he saying fear not because he's living under fear because of his circumstance aren't you glad when God rich in Mercy comes and says stop fearing the future stop fearing your circumstance stop being fearful because what's happening in Mary this that is happening was already spoken by a prophet and you're trying to cover it up you're trying to no no no the word the word is being fulfilled in your life marry that woman you know that I'm just going to close this by saying I got a bunch of quotes I wanted to read and everything so I want to say this was the next the last scripture says in verse 25 verse 24 then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had been him and took unto him his wife both Mary and both Joseph when they got the picture from the angel of what this really was and what was going on they both offered to God what was needed to begin the process I tell you friends it doesn't take just God's word it takes a heart saying be it unto me it takes a heart said I'm willing to Bear the reproach I'm willing to live like a young girl and dress like a young girl should dress I'm willing to follow God I'm willing to his word to be fulfilled in my life a young man it takes a young said like Joseph okay now it's settled I'm all in I'm here for the duration and we will carry this word I will take care of this word I will raise this son even though he's not my own I'm I'm all we need young people to say I'm all in we need people to say I'm not on the internet toss between two no I'm all in that's finished I'm done with that I'm all and I'm carrying a burden I'm carrying a reproach people are going to laugh at me but I'm ready to carry the reproach I'm ready to follow through a lot of you done it years ago and you've been carrying it all these years God bless you we're going to continue to
