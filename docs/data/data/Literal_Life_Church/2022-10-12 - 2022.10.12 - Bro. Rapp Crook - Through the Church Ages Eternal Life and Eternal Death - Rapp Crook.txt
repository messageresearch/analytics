========================================

we don't we don't realize that but God's been so good to us while we're standing perhaps we can just open our Bibles up to the Book of Revelation chapter 2. um by God's grace this evening we're going to continue um through the smyrnian church age and look at the one of the next doctrinal topics brings up and that is um eternal life eternal death and that there's no eternal hell that's the whole thing I try to take a look at this evening eternal life and eternal death but no eternal hell this comes up first in Revelation 2 11 even half an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches he that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death and what is the second death we can turn over to Revelation 2014 or just read it on the screen at the anterior death in hell are going to be cast into the Lake of Fire and that is the second death but we're told in Revelation Chapter 2 that he would overcometh will not be heard of the second death we can have the first death can touch our bodies but if you have Christ on the inside you'll not be hurt of the second death so that's your inspiration this evening may the Lord add his Blessing to his word you may be seated just uh I just uh want to express my appreciation brother Anton it's good to see him again haven't we saw each other uh many Summers we spent a lot of time together way back and appreciate the Anton on your work and uh he and his friends in Lithuania were a big inspiration to me when I was 16 17 years old I said man these are young guys like me are completely dedicated all their studies everything they're doing is completely dedicated to serving God translating the message man what can I study so I can be just as dedicated and that was a I really appreciated that dedication one of the things I I've really gained over the last year or two as I've kind of gone over the church age book and I say this um I just I I I trust these servers are being helped to you but what I'm really wanting my my the desire of my heart is that um to miss the church age book it has what economists call her High barriers to entry it can be really intimidating because you think man it can be it can be tough to get into I won't understand anything so we just don't get into it I wonder what I've tried what I'm trying to do is break down little pieces here so after I go through a chapter you can go through a chapter on your own because I want you to my my goal is that we can make it our own that we can get our own book and it becomes and it becomes our own Revelation not something that you hear from Mom or Dad that you hear from me your brother Paul or another Minister but it becomes your own I just pray that will be the case and I know growing up in the message like I I did um especially nowadays in the age of the internet criticisms of of Truth might decide Spurgeon said that uh um in the time that it takes truth to get it to boots on a live around the world in no time and you do it you do searches on the message and this or that and the lies just come up there and you get bombarded and yet what can I even say where can I start and I just love going through um the church age book here because brother Branham lays things out on a very biblical basis and I love taking a truth like we have tonight and we have a very Firm Foundation to stand on they're just like you do a study like this wow thank you Lord this is this is this is truth because you know we have a doctrine that is false in some way it affects excuse our view of God in some way so when we can when we're getting true Doctrine restored that's opening up the potential to have such a greater close relationship with God because you're corresp you're relating to God on the basis of truth and that's that's really powerful this doctrine of uh of eternal hell which most Evangelical churches are going to teach the messages kind of exceptional but it doesn't teach that I can remember I went to a small Baptist Church School and I can remember being a first grader in the chapel service I can remember I was in first grader because I was sitting right on the front second row and they had a an evangelist coming through who is doing some teaching and things and the end of the the end time coming and the Rapture and all these things and for the Friday Chapel he took questions and answers which is a kind of a scary thing to do with a bunch of little kids because they'll ask anything and somehow the question of Hell came up and I can remember as a first grader raising my hand and asking the question how can you be in Hell For Eternity because wouldn't you have to have eternal life then and I just remember the question because there was something inside this that can't be can it and that's right it can't be it's some of those things that a little kid can get that just that reaction I didn't understand all the doctrine but that's just the reaction it says no that doesn't make sense and God puts those things in this so that we can look tonight and see why this might be the case so in the in the first section of the spirit and church age about the promise of the Overcomer um brother Branham says after he quotes these two scriptures he says of course that means that all those who were therein in death and hell they were cast into the Lake of Fire now then I want to bring out something here for you it no doubt will cause people to comment on my strange Doctrine but I stand here on the authority of the word of God and deny that the unbeliever goes to an eternal hell and burns there eternally and this is something that the most most Christian churches are going to affirm and if you don't believe this it's it's it's her it's just as her radical as not believing in the Trinity it's it's amazing the uh the response it gets but um I'm going to talk about this evening take a look at uh II Timothy 1 and verse in verse 10 especially how uh now is made manifest by the appearing of Our Savior Jesus Christ what did Christ do he abolished death and he hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel and that last phrase is important Christ brought life and immortality to light through the gospel because these were very misunderstood by paganism it took the gospel to bring it to light the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ that is the gospel bring life into mortality to light since Jesus rose from the dead he makes eternal life available to us which means if it's available to us by Christ's gift we didn't have it to start with whereas most church today say everybody has eternal life it's just all that Jesus gives us is a happier eternal life but that's not what the Bible says he says he gives us eternal life he gives us immortality because we didn't have that to start with so this evening by God's grace we'll try to do this we'll try to cover the idea that every human possesses immortality that's Pagan it does not have its roots in the Bible only God possesses immortality but Believers can share in it through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ it is the gift that God gives to Believers however through the church ages Pagan philosophy distorts Church to teaching and as it distorts Church teaching it also distorts people's perceptions of God and that's a big one that's a big one and then lastly God has restored the truth on eternal life and eternal death as opposed to eternal torment through the message of Malachi 4. and we'll see that brother Branham is restoring Biblical teaching but he's also restoring what the church followed what the early church fathers taught that's what the message of Malachi 4 does so starting off the teaching of eternal hell comes from a Greek and Roman mythology not the Bible and there's a story um in the thought in the Greek mythology about a man named titios and he does he somehow offends the goddess later and he the the Greek gods are very good at undertaking the Vengeance they um their vengeance is theirs and they will do it again and again and again so once um teach us dies for his foolishness he is sentenced to this field of punishment and he is chained to the ground nailed to the ground and his punishment was every day two vultures it was swing down and they would pluck out his liver tear it apart all day long tearing it apart and then they would fly away in the evening time and at night his liver would be completely restored so the next day it could happen again that's how it goes on and on and on throughout eternity it's never ever ending it'll be unending torment the same day everything the same if you ever read Dante's Inferno this is uh another perception of Hell in the time of the Catholic Church um this is the there was one man sentenced for a particular crime and he had to roll this big huge Rock up a hill he did it all day long only at the very top it would roll over top of him you have to run back down and repeat the same thing and Dante does a great job trying to make the punishment fit the crime so it'd be appropriate in some way but this is eternal this unending and look at look at the Pagan God Zeus he's the he's the god of the sky god of thunder and what a different pers this is this is the perception that many people have of God a God just waiting to throw a thunderbolt down I gotcha the god of the Bible though doesn't have a thunderbolt in his hand he's got his arms outstretched and when Satan comes in distorts Church teaching on how God's justice has taken part in eternal hell what he does is he takes the god of the cross takes Jesus down and he puts God with a thunderbolt in its place that's why this is important because it completely changes someone's perception of God so we can observe from this myth these pagan gods are vengeful they are easily offended well who created the pagan gods the pagan gods are gods that men made in their own image and in the pagans Gods you see man's worst attributes writ large exaggerated it's easy to make your own God and it'll have your own attributes exaggerated but God does he takes man and transforms man into his own image that's a miracle but the devil tries to get us to do it backwards and gives us it makes us feel like we're on a power trip as we're doing that but the vengeful the pagan gods are eventual they're sadists they Delight in punishment the god of the Bible Delights in Mercy and then so they're very they're also very unjust we don't see the punishment being proportioned to the crime they want this punishment to go on and on and on and on so we know that guy really really suffers and you know what when someone does us wrong that is the tendency that we have they did that strong and says man something bad happens to them yeah see that's their Just Desserts I hope they really feel it that's how we feel but that's not how God is God Delights in Mercy and but he help us do the same so and also the basic assumption behind this myth is that everybody has immortality no matter what and in the in the Greek mythology after the physical body died the person's Spirit went down to the underworld and they would just hang out there they would be in in limbo that comes from Greek mythology they would just be there and if they lived a good life they'd be down to this kind of Happy Hunting Ground if they didn't live such a good life they'd be um like teachers there on the field of punishment one church historian says that this Assumption of universal immortality that every single human is Immortal just it's a default characteristic he says that is one of the clearest areas where Pagan philosophy influences Christian doctrine he says two Christian doctrines are perhaps the most reliable indications of the continuing hold of Greek philosophy on Christian Theology and one of them is the doctrine of the immortality of the soul but the soul is Immortal just because that's the way they're created immortality though according to the Bible is a gift of God but Greek philosophy says everybody has it First Timothy 6 16 says God only has immortality that's pretty clear nobody else has immortality only God for page two if you're following along yet God gives this to his children he wants his children those who come to him and ask him for repentance forgiveness of their sins that is a gift of God the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ Our Lord whoever believes in him should not perish but have everlasting life this is immortality is a gift of God we're not we're not born with it we don't earn it um it is completely a gift of God and that Paul teaches this yet we also see that the early church fathers taught it here we have a quote from irenius's book we talked about irenius two weeks ago he says the soul participates in life because God Wills the soul to live thus it will not even have such participation in life when God no longer wills it to live so life is given to us oh and we only have life as long as God gives it to us we do not have immortality without God giving it to us another man named Tatian who is a student of Justin Martyr he says in itself the soul is not Immortal but mortal we can only receive immortality if God gives it to us so despite the pretty clear teachings of Paul that life is eternal life is a gift of God if it's a gift we didn't have it otherwise it wouldn't be a gift um early church fathers taught this yet like we said for a long time Evangelical churches have taught that um that um the hell was eternal here's a from the um from one organization I pulled this off their website The Gospel Light Society he says um as awful as death is to us the truth is that those who die are not forever extinguished from existence they simply pass from this life to another realm of Life a place where they still exist and they're just as real but a place for people in this world cannot see them and when we die we pass from the Physical Realm into the spiritual realm we still exist we are no longer tied to the physical world our souls travel to face God where we'll give an account of all that we've done in their physical lives and after you die you will be ushered into one of two places to spend eternity and the title of the article is where everyone will spend uh will live somewhere forever where were you where you choose your destination where are you going to live forever we're all going to live forever somewhere and there's truth in the article yes we're going to appear before God everybody will but the question posed is everyone going to live forever somewhere yes they they say that but the Bible doesn't present us a choice of living somewhere forever the Bible presents a choice of Salvation and perishing between life and death somewhere forever sounds really good but you don't find that Concept in the Bible it's between life and death between salvation and perishing First Corinthians 1 18 the preaching of the Cross is to them that perish foolishness but unto us which are saved it's the power of God um II Thessalonians 2 10 with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish not in them who live in the Underworld forever but in them that perish that and then because they've received not the love of truth that they might be saved John 5 24 talks about them having everlasting life because they've passed from Death unto life so living somewhere forever is not the choice the Bible presents the Bible prays a choice between perishing and salvation that's the that's that's the biblical choice so in in his teaching on on Hell brother Branham is taking something that the Bible teaches that the early church fathers taught yet was gradually lost over the centuries and He restored it and this is something he'll refer to as Loose Ends being tied up and this is one of the Mysteries that the seventh angel um is tying up Revelation 10 7 talked about the mystery of God should be finished he's tying up the various loose ends that were left about history and it's interesting just taking a short little Rabbit Trail here think about what are um Loose Ends um the thing about Loose Ends could be teachings that are out of balance in some way because they're not truly connected to Christ there's definitely truth there but some has gone way overboard and you can't accept the truth the way it's presented here but there's a real kernel that we wish we could get that in the right setting and then that would make a be a beautiful Gem of Truth I mean noticed a wrong Doctrine we'll give a wrong image of the nature of Christ and you can have a lot of people around who will believe a truth that's out of balance and they're going to have a skewed view of God because of it and it's really can be really difficult to talk about that because you'll talk past each other because they're believing a part of Truth and that'll be completely continually repeated but it's a loosen it's not really connected to the nature of Christ as it should be and if you have a lot of loose sins your faith is going to be unstable at the bottom of page two um brother Branham talks about Christianity it has many loose sins well there's just really One Faith and going over on top of Page Three someone says if the methodists don't want us we'll go over to the Baptist the Baptists don't want us to go to the Pentecostal the assemblies don't want us to go to the united we just keep going one after the other and we become then Mission Trotters hardly know what to believe and it says because there's too many Loose Ends it's not being connected to to uh to Christ what the word what the church needs is to get back to the word and back to God and a loose end is someone who hardly knows what to believe and it's not really tied to Christ and the message believed from the heart he says we have accepted the word on the intellectual basis and we've seen so many total failures until it's brought people to a place that they just hardly know what to believe because one person was a great leader another person was a great leader another person was a great leader and become the great manners of the great God then disappointment disappointment disappointment now what do I do and as does and then people look at each other yeah as long as you're sincere that's the main thing as long as you're sincereable that's not what the Bible's talking not what the Bible teaches it just got where you have a lot of loose ends to their religion they run out on limbs this way and that way and they come to an end they got to come crawling back um so if you have a bunch of loose ends you're not really tied to Christ you don't really know what to believe and a loosing could be a truth or a mystery that's not completely revealed explained or taught and I like thinking about ellucian I can also regard our our personal life if something in our life that we're really focusing on isn't tied to Christ it's a loose end um we have to we have to I mean everything we're doing God wants to be the Lord of all of our life not just a part of it we want to have a we want to be all anchored in and tied in with Christ Romans 1 1 says Paul is a servant of Jesus Christ called to be an apostle separated unto the gospel of God and the loose end is just separated from but we want to be separated from and also separated unto because if we're only separated from we're in danger of becoming a loose end ourselves expending a lot of energy trying to say good things and do good things but we're expending energy and not really they're not tied in what God's doing and it's all in vain we want to be connected with what we're doing is connected that we're saying Christ's word but also with his nature because if you just say the word without his nature the wrong thing is going to come across you want to have those two together otherwise you're kind of in threat of being a loose end yourself and loose ends you have a lot of unfocused growth in that last uh quote there on page three he says uh if you cut a tree back it'll bear better don't let too many Loose Ends get run out on it that's what's the matter today we have too many Loose Ends running out this way and this way and that away too many societies too many of this and too much of that but let's come back to one thing Calvary where we can sing with our heart well we're all we got the Dutch having the expression will get all noses pointed in the same direction if you've got that then you're tied in with the same vision you're connected to to Christ then you can get a lot done a lot of accomplished otherwise it's just spending energy this way that way that way that way but not focused not together not doing what what God might be calling us do and the way he's called us to do it and this doctrine of no eternal hell this was a loose end it has been out there the disciples taught it Paul taught it the church father taught it but it needed to be tied back in this is the mystery of God could be finished like Revelation 10 7 says so kind of talking about in the afterlife what does brother Graham teach about what does the bible teach about it and he says in the afterlife there's going to be three places and this is questions and answers on um on Hebrews two he says don't never lose them three places now there's the place of the wicked the place of the righteous and Hell itself and other places he talks about these three causes the regions of the Lost the regions of the Blessed and then hell itself is don't lose these three places don't get them blurred I'm talking about the regions of the Lost um and and the Old Testament this I mean let's talk about when the English words are being translated hell that's the Hebrew word sheol and here at Isaiah 14 9 it says hell from beneath is moved for thee to meet the ethi coming it stirs up the dead for thee so that the dead are somewhere after they die their Spirits are somewhere they're they're in the place of of waiting and Hebrews called sheol and this is if if this was a person who wasn't following um God who it wasn't a Christian who hadn't been a believer in Jehovah in the Old Testament that's a region of the lost but they're still there and they're going to be brought up and and come to stand before God so that's uh in the temple from Isaiah and the Greek that's called Hades is the region of the lost and in Revelation 20 John writes I saw a great white Throne on him that sat on it from his face the Earth and Heaven fled away and there was found no place for them and I saw the dead small and great come stand before God and the books were opened and another book was opened which is The Book of Life and the dead were judged out of those things were written in the books according to their works so this regions of the lost this this Hades is where the dead are before they come to this day of judgment they're waiting somewhere and then they'll come before God at that white Throne judgment and the Sea gave up the dead which are in it and death and Hell delivered up the dead which were in them this is the place where they go the dead will go they wait and they're waiting to be judged before God but this is a this is a terrible place um because you already know you're lost um just like a little kid at home with Mom all day and he's been mischievous he's been doing all kinds of things he's not supposed to be doing and pushing Mom keep pushing mom and keep pushing on me you know you all know if you push mom far enough there could be fireworks but this time the kid pushes mom so far there aren't fireworks and that's even more dangerous because Mom just says you know what you go to your room when your father gets home he's going to decide what to do for you that kid knows he's not going to the region of the Blessed he's going to his room and that is the region of the lost and he might be there for an hour or two and all kinds of nightmarish thoughts are going through his mind what is my dad going to do to me what is he going to do and he hears a car go down the road they try I mean the comic books have no appeal to him anymore nothing is any appeal to him anymore here's another car go down the road it's the neighborhood and finally dad comes home and his dad please forgive me please but no this is the region of the lost this is Mom has you've pushed mom so far we're going to have punishment here and when dad comes home that's the great white Throne judgment there's not gonna be Mercia there there could be sentences there could be all kinds of things there could there could be lashings you'd be on the rack it could be all kinds of terrible things could happen all that is going on but this is the region of the Lost he hasn't been judged yet he's awaiting the judgment sometimes that's almost worse in the Judgment itself and this is this region of the lost this is what brother Branham sees as a young boy after he's involved this hunting accident and his legs get shot up and he's in he's losing blood and he wakes up as isn't he's in the hospital and he goes into this other realm and he's just descending descending descending into this Blackness and then these these things it just Spooks him out I mean you don't want to listen to that tape kids before you go to bed you don't do that but this is this is the region of the law this is this is this he's saying whatever you do don't go there so the region of the lost it's um it's a prison house it's a jailhouse and the brother Brown is clear and it's distinction the region of the Lost is not the burning fire of hell that's just the prison house that's kind of like if you get caught by the police you get put in jail jail in prison are different you get put in jail when you go before the judge the judge sits you to prison the region of the Lost is jail where you're awaiting sentencing so on the top of page four and the message um Souls that are in prison now brother Branham says Jesus went and preached the souls that were in prison which is Hell locked up until the day of judgment because you see the Judgment isn't now and there is no burning hell now somebody to tell you that the guy is burning in hell now he says no that's wrong see a judge of this Earth is just enough to never condemn a man until he's brought to trial so right now somebody dies and they're in sin they're going to go to the region of the loss that's like my son being sent to his room waiting for Dad to come home he knows he's lost he knows it's without hope he's going to have judgment coming what it's going to be that'll come after his trial because God will never throw a man into the fiery furnace until first he's condemned by God's Own laws he rejected mercy so you see he first has to have a trial and the trials the great white throw in judgment but now he's in a place called a prison house that's just that is the region of the lost and it's a nightmarish place because you know judgment's coming your conscience convinces of you of this but there's absolutely nothing more you can do about it because you're dead you've heard and you'll be thinking all the sermons that you've heard and you'll be thinking I should have done this I should have done it and you'll be going back I could have made this choice I could have made I couldn't I just wish I could I can't I wish I could but I can't that's a terrible terrible thing and what a gift life is what we just say all my life you have been faithful my goodness it is not anything of our own goodness that we made right choices it is the grace of God but he's been so faithful but if you go that far and you find that you're you haven't trusted Christ and then you're in you die and you know the judgment's coming that's in that region of the Lost awaiting the white they're on judgment brother Bradham says in the message remembering the Lord don't wait till some region yondering in the Damned in that Dimension where you cannot go in the presence of God and your time is up on Earth and that nightmare of horror you'll remember you had your opportunity and turned it away what a privilege it is in this life to experience the presence of God I tell I tell my kids at school at in the chapel so many times it is such a gift of God where you can feel him pulling on your heart never take that for granted that is the greatest thing there is in life God pulling on your heart because Genesis says God said before the flood there will come a time where my spirit will no longer strive with man so if God's pulling on your heart that is the best thing that can happen to you jump in go for him because he will meet you there he has promised he would so brother Graham said don't forget those three places the region of the lost and then he's also talks about the region of the bless of the region of the law says where someone who dies who's lost goes to await judgment which is the white Throne judgment the region of the bless is where someone will go after they've passed away who has had faith in God and John 5 24 says verily verily I say unto you he that heareth my word and beliefs on him that sent me has everlasting life and won't come in the condemnation but passed from Death unto life so when you when you're given everlasting life you you're you're you're you're living you pass away and then you jump this whole region of the lost you don't have to enter that Dominion at all you jump over and you're right into the region of the Blessed it's it's so much I mean I get out of jail free card from Monopoly isn't it isn't comparable you jump right over it has no threat on you no claim for you you just come out of it yes I'm done and just fly right over and we and you land there and you're in this region that you've hoped for once you're there I mean just imagine the kid comes home from school he says mom I did such a good job I got a hundred on my test to teach that was fantastic and Mom says oh I'm so happy for you it'll be awesome when Dad gets home and you can tell him and then every time that I can't well the car has been oh it's the mailman but dad's still coming you have this blessed blessed expectation blessed anticipation because the joy that you have and knowing that when dad comes home the reward is going to be even greater I mean just the everything the devil has is such a a knockoff it's a poor imitation that just damns us but God has the pure so if you if you have if you believe you pass right from Death right into life you're right there waiting for it even you're you're close to God and even better is coming I think it's just beautiful Luke 14 14 says you shall be blessed for they cannot recompense the if you if you do something that's good to somebody who can't uh who can't pay you back you'll be blessed because they can't recompense you God's will you will be recompensed at the resurrection of the just this resurrection of the just we can call a couple different things based on different scriptures revelation 20. so keep the resurrection of the just in your mind Revelation 20 let's talk about the a resurrection the first and verse 5 what resurrects first is the the sorry let's read dead verse 4. I saw Thrones they sat upon him and judgment was given unto them and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus for the word of God which had not worshiped the Beast neither his image neither had received his Mark upon their foreheads or in their hands and they lived and reigned with Christ for a thousand years but the rest of the Dead lived not again as the thousand years were finished so the rest of the Dead they're going to come up later but this first group of dead people who had been beheaded for the word of God who had given their lives for God they come up first that's the first resurrection and they're going to be coming up into this so they come out of the region of the blast where they're waiting and they come up first to Christ so there's a resurrection of the just and the first resurrection you are the same thing and then you can look at um verse 6 blessed and holy is he the half part in this first resurrection because on such the second death hath no power there's no risk of the person who's who has skipped over the region of the lost and right into the regions of the blessed there's no risk of them ever coming into the Lake of Fire because that that that can't touch them they the second death has absolutely no power over them the devil thinks that he has death has power over us in this life but it doesn't it can't touch us all it does is liberate us and get us into Christ's presence all the faster and uh so this this first resurrection uh the resurrection of the just that's the same thing as what we read in first Thessalonians 4 16 the Lord himself will descend with a shout with the voice of an archangel with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first that's this first resurrection the resurrect Resurrection of the just these are all talking about the same event where they're they're dead they're righteous and they're waiting to be called up and they get their reward first we together here I think about Hebrews 11 also think about this last night at the end of Hebrews 11 is the great faith chapter and all these Heroes of the faith are talked about this person who's Samson it was a the Bible talks about Sam's as a hero of the faith it's just wonderful when God looks at us through his blood-stained spectacles wow even Samson's a hero of the faith all the Abrahams Sarah all these different ones and then he says they without us cannot be made perfect they're waiting for us they're they're waiting what are they doing as they're waiting Hebrews chapter 12 says we're running a race and this is this great cloud of witnesses who are there in this region of the Blessed watching us cheering us on because well they want to get in there and get their rewarding the faster we get our reward we'll all be there together they're watching us from that great region so we got the region the Lost region the blessed and then brother Graham talked about this third region is is Hell itself and Matthew 25 26 um says that let me see I haven't printed out um some show these Sinners shall go away into Everlasting punishment but the righteous will go into life eternal and this gives some confusion is this Everlasting punishment as Eternal as the life is that the believer is going to enjoy and I want to talk about this what because you interpret scripture with scripture if you look at this one isolated scripture it appears that there is Everlasting torment and everlasting life on the other side but if you interpret scripture with scripture I think we'll see something different first of all hell's purpose is to annihilate a talk the second death is talking about well death what do we know death to be death is the the end of something and um if you look at the first death is death or a physical body the second death is death to the soul when we talk about our physical body dying it's it's gone when the so that's the image God gives us to understand the second death if the first death has our body completely going away the same would happen to our to our soul death is not an eternal process I would say it's better to look at as being an eternal result and let's look at Jude 7 here this is also a scripture that's often pointed to us sure look hell is eternal Sodom and Gomorrah the cities around about them and like manner they gave themselves over to fornication going after strange flesh and they're set forth for an example suffering the Vengeance of Eternal fire and people say look the Bible talks about eternal fire eternal torment that's how hell is going to be but I grabbed this this picture yesterday this is the state of California at the picture taken from a satellite of the forest fires that were there now I just want to suggest that if Jude 7 is talking about Saban Gabor having Eternal fire you would be able to take a satellite picture above the Middle East somewhere and you would still see smoke Rising above there because this fire is completely going that's not what you see because this destruction is not an eternal process that goes on and on continuing throughout eternity but it's an eternal result we're destroyed for all eternity no sign of them ever coming back they're gone completely gone NADA and that's what happens when when our body is dead it goes back it completely it's gone when our soul dies after the second death someone's Soul it'll it'll be gone that's the purpose of Hell to annihilate and then we also see multiple scriptures showing there's a there's a great um finality in God's judgment I've got just some of them here Malachi 4 1 says the day comes that will burn them up it'll leave neither root nor Branch nothing's going to be left after this this fire goes through there nothing Matthew 10 28 says to fear Him who's able to destroy both body and soul and Hell destroy is a pretty Final Act um Philippians 3 19 talks about those whose end is destruction Hebrews 2 14 that through Death Christ might destroy him that had the power of death but it's the devil does the devil have any chance of coming back after this no he's destroyed gone just by illustration I can remember I was in the when my wife we bought a house in the Netherlands and we love the backyard here as we had the the house and there was a little canal and between behind the canal was this railroad track but between the River track and the canal it was filled with trees it was we fell in love with it and then right before we go and close on the house we go look at it one more time it's this protocol you go through and look at it and we walked in the house we looked out the window all the trees had been cut down all right because that was the property the railroad and every 20 years they just kind of turn everything back like man this is not what we thought we were buying but we went ahead and got it but you know what they weren't destroyed those trees I remember one of them had been named pretty much is you had you had the stump there was just taken out of the stump well a year or two later I go back out there and what do I see from that stump there are shoots coming forth I thought it was just destroyed but no it wasn't but when God destroys something Malachi 4 it'll leave neither root nor branch because when that when the railroad took off those trees they left potential for things to come back that's not what God's talking about with hell that you can come out of hell and be in bloom again that's not what God the purpose is to annihilate never a chance of coming back again there's a finality in God's judgment if it's not final destroy doesn't mean much doesn't mean anything it's kind of mean Junior High people say I want to destroy you they don't mean that God doesn't joke around with that kind of a word when he says destroy he means destroy let's see here questions and answers brother Bears I don't believe the Bible teaches an eternal burning hell it doesn't because if hell is eternal and people that go there will be punished eternally the only way they could be eternally punished they'd have to have eternal life and there's only one form of eternal life and that's in God see so they have to come to Annihilation that is their physical part becomes annihilated and then their spiritual apart becomes annihilated that's completely consumed there's no more of it neither Rootin or branch of the Bible quote they are completely done away I think that's true and but brother brother Branham talks about eternity there can't be any eternal hell because there's only one form of eternal life and that's from God it's not just an argument from from from logic that Eternal life's only from God you and any other form of it's not that way no brother band's teaching on on the eternal life the Eternal um death without the eternal hell focuses everything on God's life and that's not a loose end that's being completely tied in with who God is and what God is we'll talk more about that here as we uh as we come toward the end brother Randomness I believe in Eternal death yes I believe in that because it is final the process isn't but the result is it's an eternal death same as I believe in Eternal heaven but not in eternal hell there is no such a thing as an eternal hell was created so if it's created it can't be Eternal because something that's created has a beginning that's Eternal doesn't um and again I'm not gonna it sounds like it's a stomach it can sound like brother random says this he's just um parsing words but it's not that way at all he's bringing it right back he's rooting his Doctrine and who God is and that's the best place to root something it was created for the devil and his angels God Jesus did not come to bring death he came to bring life he did not create um hell so I can he can be Zeus up on high look at all those mistakes people made in a week into the righteous get to have a great time in heaven looking over and seeing all those bad people who did them wrong and they will be falling into the flames and that's not the that's not where we're going to get our kicks in heaven not at all um it was created for the devil and his Angel God doesn't send any man to hell in fact it's not necessary that anybody should go there God doesn't send no one to hell you send yourself to Hell God has done everything in the world he can to keep you from going to hell and he lets you determine to go to hell he puts on free moral agencies because we're amazing His Image God is a moral actor he has a choice we're Made In His Image we also have a choice God wants people who love him out of a free will not a robot either he lets you make may make a choice yet you fight over every barricade that God puts in your way and you can look back and see you have to work you have to make a choice here you have to make a choice here and you can remember somebody's told me I shouldn't do this somebody told me I shouldn't do that God's putting barricades there yet you just go right on on over it because if you follow if you choose to follow the devil you will end up or he ends up it's a principle of leadership at the white Throne judgment people will be judged according to their works and according to the light revealed to them so when Dad gets home he's gonna have a conversation with son or daughter as the case may be because daughters are not always Saints either they have this this conversation and did you do this did you do this yes I did be judged Base According to you worked did you know you shouldn't do that yes and sometimes in those conversations something comes up and maybe they didn't know all the way and then that'll be ground for mercy and then it's a really awkward position to be in sometimes you're you're as the as the judge you're all gunned up to be this righteous judgment oh wow there is some cause here to show mercy and then God will do that a righteous judge if if a parent finds out that there is a misunderstanding somewhere or the to the kid's cell phone went off no battery and they didn't get the message and the mom's so mad at that when they get home I'm going to read them the riot act they're going to be grounded for life but then but Mom I didn't get the message and you looked and all of a sudden you can't ground them for life you would be unjust to do that um you might want to show there are such thing as Chargers you can have those kinds of conversations but grounded for life is kind of unjust so Luke 12 shows that you'll be judged based according according to your works that servant who knew his Lord's will and prepared not himself neither did according to his will shall be beaten with many stripes he knew better and didn't do it someone who didn't know his Lord's will yet still did commit things worthy of stripes shall be beaten with few stripes there is Judgment according to work it's not everybody getting the same Eternal punishment there'll be judgment according to works for unto whomsoever much is given of him shall be much required and then Matthew 11 21-24 Jesus Christ out woe unto the courage and woe unto thee bethsaida and capernaumi includes in the next verses for if the mighty Works which had been done in you which were done in you had but an entire Insight on they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and Ashes but I say unto you it shall be more tolerable for tire and sidon at the day of judgment than for you God's a just judge he will make a difference in judgment and that can be lost sometimes in this idea of there being an eternal hell because everybody's burning for return you say yeah the Adolf Hitler might be burning a thousand degrees and you'll be burning at 400 degrees but is there really a difference there ever that the Biblical teaching does show that God is a just judge and lastly here a hell of eternal torment or you the this torture this physical sensible torture that you would that you actually sense in the sense that you're feeling it that's inconsistent with God's revelation of his own Justice because how can something being done in 70 years of time how can it be just for crimes could be over 70 years of time be punished for all eternity that just it's like that's Overkill it can't be I can see Zeus doing that he's right I'm going to get I'm going to make you hate life I'm going to make you go over this every day Zeus would do that but not adjust God an exodus if any Mischief follows that you will give Life For Life eye for eye tooth for tooth hand for hand foot for foot burning for burning wound for a wound strike for a stripe this is proportionality punishment fits crime punishment fits crime but you have a terrible life lots of bad things being done in a short amount of time but to say that that all of a sudden is worthy of Eternal punishment I think it kind of flies in the face of what God reveals about himself and what real Justice is here in the book of Exodus so brother brother branham's teaching if we kind of contrast now um at the bottom of page six eternal life versus the idea of eternal hell brother brand name is teaching against eternal hell he's it's all about eternal life he's focusing all of our attention what is eternal life That's the basis of what this is anything that is created had the beginning and by definition it can't be Eternal only that which had no beginning can't have no end but like I said this is more an argument from logic there's just one form of eternal life that's God's life and God's life's indestructible he's the only one who has immortality it's indestructible Hebrews 7 verse 16 uh or um who is Christ is Melchizedek is made not after the law of a carnal commandment after the power of an endless indissoluble indestructible life what do we get when we get Christ's life inside of us or the invincibles who are indestructible Satan can throw whatever he wants to at us but we have the power of an endless life indestructible life inside of us in the what um what blesses me the most is we kind of close here musicians you can kind of kind of commit work work your way up um if we just have the idea if you're going to live somewhere forever if you live a bad life you'll be forever in a bad place if you live a good life will be forever in a good place that makes eternal life all focused about real estate location location location but that's not the focus of the Bible's teaching of eternal life but the Brand's Focus the Bible's focus is not location not our works but the focus is Jesus Christ God's life brother Branham says when he's talking about just at the bond of page seven from this is from the church age book page 146. there might be those who say eternal life signifies the welfare of the children of God it's their welfare and enjoyment that's at stake on the other hand The Sinner goes to his punishment so that we could reduce the second death to a matter of punishment and place eternal life just means Heaven Eternal punishment means Hell location location but you know what that does it makes eternal life a matter of geography instead of a person eternal life is God the Lord Jesus Christ we're not working to do good work so we can have a mansion on the hilltop someday the mansion's not our Focus our focus is Christ in John 17 says this is life eternal that they might Know Thee the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou has sent so I like how we talked about the idea of an eternal defaulty of there being an eternal hell this is a loose end because it's not rooted in Christ it's not directly tied to Christ the brother Branham brings us right back eternal life is not geography it's not about place it's not about the mainstream the hilltop as opposed to a burning fire in hell it's about knowing god knowing Christ that is eternal life eternal life is just knowing and being in Jesus Christ and what they what a wonderful opportunity we have to to have that so I I trust we have a greater value for for God and his word and the truth that's it's what we believe is anchored in the scripture and not just in the scripture it's anchored in the very nature of God hope we can see God's heart that he's not uh not uh this is like this Pagan God Zeus with Thunderbolts waiting to to to the judges and we're all going in heaven going to have look over and have this sadistic Glee and seeing people being being punished no the hell was created for the devil and his angels not for anybody else that's why Jesus came let's pray heavenly father I thank you Lord for the gift that you give us of eternal life Lord and I just want us to take a moment and and be aware of the awesome gift that we have even to be in a church this evening and to experience your presence and I just if someone's here and says no I've I've been perhaps I've been raised in church if maybe I haven't I don't know but I've I've resisted the pull of God in my heart for too long I want to stop doing that because I want to know Jesus Christ that's what Christ came here he did not come to condemn anyone to judgment he came that we might be saved if you wanted to share his nature and his life with us and if the Lord's pulling on your heart I just pray that you'd open it and accept his life inside of you because if you've got that there's no way you'll ever come up short you'll be with him in this life you'll skip over all that region of the Lost you'll go right into his presence if we die before the Rapture and they'll be just waiting they'll be caught up into his presence and Lord I just pray you'd come quick because we can call directly into your presence Lord I pray that you'd be with each one Lord I Thank you for your for your truth for this restoration of this truth o God in Jesus name amen
