========================================

heaven we thank you for this wonderful atmosphere for our most noble brother for the words that he said father i know that you are a family man because you have a you have a heavenly family you were just lonely by yourself but you had your thoughts were part of you they were with you all the time father these thoughts are right now money manifested in our midst we are part of these thoughts and so it's so important to to have a father not a religion father this message brought us the right picture back lord we forgot it in 2000 years who you are how you feel how you think but this messenger could reveal amen the mystery of god not mysteries but the mystery of god lord heavenly father have your way this morning may you just use me may you prepare the hearts to receive the portion that you have in store for each and every one father bless the bride wherever they are here in michigan in ohio father my own most noble brothers and sisters the church back home and may you bless israel because those who bless israel they are blessed so we ask it in the name of the lord jesus christ amen hallelujah god bless you rich while we're standing let's open the word of the lord i mean thank the musicians really for you for for for your gift and for your talent for your work may you open the word in matthew chapter 21 beginning from verse one lay a background to a thought for this morning are you preaching matthew 21 1 and when they drew nigh unto jerusalem and were come to beth page unto the mount of olives then sent jesus to disciples saying unto them go into the village over against you and straight away you shall find an ass tight i hope i pronounce it right look i'm a german a dunky tight and i called with her lose them and bring them unto me and if any man say unto you you shall say the lord hath need of them and straight away he will send them all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet saying tell you the daughter of zion behold thy king cometh unto thee meek and sitting upon a donkey and the cold the foal of a donkey may the lord add his blessing to the reading of his word we may be seating now i wish you all god's blessings in the house of the lord and it's a great honor for me to be here and brother paul rightly uh rightly said that we are more just we are just friends we don't see us all the time but but friendship is not a question of a certain amount of calls that we do per month uh friends and brothers is a question of fellowship of vision of a certain chemistry okay and uh thank you very much for the part it's an honor for me to be here i i came i could connect this trip as he has invited me a long time with the youth camp over there in toronto and so i'm bringing greetings from the brothers and sisters from germany our pastor about the rhode world from the places that i have been brother dun guava the ericsson brother chad and everybody is greeting you by the way paul brother paul and um yeah we are very very thankful for this morning for the afternoon and as brother paul said when i'm traveling i always say this i say don't take me as a german huh i have the holy ghost that makes me different huh and but take me as a friend take my other brother and um the subject for today is is leading into into into that father's day and most of you that don't know me maybe they have seen or some of you were there on the wednesday but uh let me let me introduce it that way so that you are not fearful or have too much reservation during the whole service we believe one thing and i don't want to hurt the feeling write it in my first sentences but but but the message that we believe does not come from america in all respect it comes from the presence of god i mean brother brandon was just a voice explaining what our father had to say he was the voice there is a voice behind that voice amen this message is not a denomination why should we become denominational sometimes there's people who say well we make a circle and we are putting somebody into the circle and somebody out of the circle i said look i come from a heavenly family nobody will preach you me into something and nobody will preach me out of something it's a family affair between god and his children the rest is just denominational approach that we brought into into the message of the hour as many times said we have many people they have the doctrine of the message but they have still the old set up of the pentecostal movement and whatever baptist or whatever we come from the holiness movement this message that we believe is not a cult why should we become cultish this message is not a sect and we know it's not but why should we become sectarian amen this message what is this message it's our father speaking to his right now in the catholic of the uh in in in the in the um let me say in the in the picture of a catholic uh religion the mother the the son can be the husband that's uh that's the subject or that's that's that motive that they got from babylon now the sun sitting on the lap of its mother and it's the lover at the same time and it's completely a false picture the right picture is my father is my bridegroom my father is my brother my father is my friend my redeemer is my servant my king is my helper only christianity can produce this and the book of i think in the book of hebrews says those who sent the one who sanctifies and those who are sanctified both come out of one therefore brother abraham said he's my father he's my mother he's my sister and my brother he's everything to me can you say amen so so so only to understand the preaching today comes really from the message of the hour and we understand we are not branhamites we're christians but we understood the ministry of the seventh angel as as as as the star who let the three young men uh from babylon to to or from from mesopotamia from from irk from chaldea down to bethlehem that star was not leading them to himself the star was leading them to christ which is the words which was the king we have seen his star it was the seventh type was the seventh angel and the seventh angel never sent us or led us to branham tabernacle it lends us to the it was leading us to the king to christ to the word can you say amen so so so that's what it is so brother brother brother paul thank you very much for the invitation to my friendship to brother stephen and his family to brother rap and his family i said i will pay attention i'm too old right now i don't i know i'm here among friends uh but i we learned a lot i mean you have to understand one thing if a minister is young he has to learn no matter how big the gift is he has to learn he makes his mistakes and a young minister always needs older ministers to help him to correct him too because he's young i mean and those young people they need somebody who is standing in the gap for them because when we were younger i always said this i said i thank god that all of my first sermons are not recorded [Laughter] because we were so much in in balance we come out of a legalistic background and we meant well but to mean well and to do well is different to mean what and to do and it takes someone who has a little bit of a life experience to bring us back into some kind of a line so every minister needs friends it needs somebody who cares who let him don't let him fall and unless of his appearance because no matter how a menace a person can be brave and hard remember he has still feelings he's still human beings he needs somebody who sticks with him corrects him at the right time and you remember there was i know i'm among musicians and the great musician arthur rubinstein he was asked a question mr rubinstein is it difficult to play piano and rubenstein said it's very simple to play piano is very simple you just have to press the right buttons at the right time i mean that's all you see and to correct a person is very very simple you just have to be the right person at the right time in the right place in the right spirit saying the right thing and the other one must be in the right spirit to receive the right thing what you meant for him to say so it's so easy to be corrected so so you understand we need a lot of grace for one another and so i'm happy for the ministering friend there i'm a little bit of a joker uh i i i it seems i got your haha spirit somehow you know and even if i'm a little bit i like to imitate and even um our precious brother tremendous but don't take it personally okay don't take it first we're not in politics we're just feel home feel feel i feel really to be among friends and blessed be the name of the lord and so i was making yesterday that the joke i said the snipers are already here so i'm very much waging my words there is a um there is some of the things that i have to say that is my opinion and i will tell you this is my view i learn on it it's a comma okay i'm sure my opinion is right but but look there is a quote that brother brahm said you we have to protect this message in our lives by our behavior but we have even to protect their doctrine because their truck dream is the way of life to find christ so we cannot just bring shadows where is no shadow we have to stay with what the prophet said okay but we can we don't have to be just to be parrots we can be eagles we can rise up we can we can see a picture that brother brandon doesn't doesn't say that way but then we have to say look this is no marcus okay we have a right to do because we're not just parrots we are eagles ourselves and we the the bride is a prophetic class of people there it's more than just repeating brother brandon everybody can repeat brother ben but the bride has brother said prophetic insight the holy spirit gives her insight into certain things the bride can read between the line because this bible is a love letter only the bride can read that that love letter the right way the rest they have just dates and facts and commands and so forth but everything that we preach between the lines must be somewhere in the lines too if not we end up in all kind of fanaticism and and so forth if there would be a thought that i said look we can look it that way it's not the only way then i would say it's just marcus and uh um blessed be the name of the lord so let us let us start with a picture i would like to call that sermon for today uh for our father's day your king cometh or the tent vision and try to bring it right in our and in our day in our time it is not a doctrinal message i would dare to come behind another man's pulpit and try to bring any kind of a doctrine unless i'm invited for it brother marcus sometimes people say brother mark is an evangelist somehow he's more like a teacher i mean in comparison to brother stephen i'm nothing and that's for sure but i would not come to bring some kind of a teaching but it's just to give a certain insight when we speak about a father and his children if if if we can start with their scent then i will make that kind of a drama okay but we'll start with the first picture if you wouldn't mind can you say amen so when we were preaching last time in in brother chess there was another minister by brother sham and he has a very unique approach he said now we are now going up on a flight uh he said so flight attendant is everything everybody buckled up he said there will be some turbulences during the preaching okay but let's let the airplane go up okay so i took that little little subject in that way so if if you could just have the first uh picture you make there's some turbulences right right behind but we know uh everything is in god's hand and we're doing doing very fine yeah i see it over there already ah there it is okay you see now look at this now we're starting you have to understand i many times speak to young people let this message change from a religion to a relationship with your father you see no i'm a father of a of a young girl you see i'm not not 18 okay but i'm not interested that when i'm coming home that my little girl now kneels down okay and she says father comes home he brings the money i can go to whatever god is not interested in muslimic worship islam means pure obedience in form of legalism god wants your heart god wants your soul god wants to have a perfect unity that he had before the garden of eden we were separated for 2000 years but this message brings us back into the bosom of god i always said this when god in the coolness of the evening as eve was coming out of adam when god called adam where are you two people came two people came not only adam because eve didn't have a name for himself for herself she was just the woman so god called adam and two people came she was called and you say brother marcus where is the picture right now it's very simple you remember brother branham had that had that had that vision with the staircase and he was arm and neville and the angels were petting him on his back and so forth and and he was so happy now armor neville was called enter for the into the joy of the lord and then brother brain said and then he heard william branham you know the story and when he went up that staircase he saw meter coming on one side and hope on the other side but god never called william hope meter god called william branham and his wife was called with him so brother brahman said he said when christ was at the cross when he paid that price the family of god was was was redeemed there is even a quote that he says we paid for our own sins at the cross only the messenger could bring these things so what happens is now this man he is not grandfather but he is the father and he has cancer and he will die soon but but i was so touched because i thought here's a father who understands what his what is what his little one needs he doesn't have the holy ghost he is not a christian this is somewhere in europe and here's some journalists they're putting it together the father has very short time to live and the little girl is his own daughter and what they do is he was asking uh for donations to make that event happen they were playing a marriage though the young girl is still in her teens she doesn't have a husband yet but he knows one thing i'm the only father to her that will bring her one day to the altar nobody can replace you if you're a father nobody can replace your plate take your place if you're a mother nobody can take your place so what he does in the emotion of a child so what he does he's going with that little child to the altar giving her to the priest to the preacher and the ceremony here stops and when that little girl will marry in a couple of years they will continue exactly at that spot where they left that ceremony and i thought by myself if a father without the holy ghost can have that kind of an understanding of a father what about us how much is god caring for his children and brother if we understand god we become good fathers we cannot separate the doctrine from our everyday's life if you understand the message you become the message there is no there is not that kind of nonsense of i'm i'm uh i i i i i understand the deepness of the message and all my family is is run i i run the car against the wall it doesn't work there is something that we understood through the message to deal situation with god can you make the next one so we we so we see that we have jesus and it is the time where he should come down on mount olives now brother brandon preaches about that message in the message what is the attraction on the mountain and he takes this as a little drama and we see jesus that he is calling and now let me say in my words for a donkey because i know even the english is tricky you got it you got it you got it okay so there was a donkey and he was still tired let me call him tired in situation in life but jesus has need of that donkey and be sure for the world you you are nothing else than a donkey with your long hair and your long deers and and your tie and on sunday morning sitting into a church and let the world think about us what they want but the lord is in need of us the lord needs you because brother blame said he only has your hands and he has your feet and yes your tongues so god untied us to use us for his ministry and he was sitting on that little donkey and coming down from mount of olives and this is the direction from the temple to the mount of olives here on that special day there was now sitting the messiah on a donkey and he appears and brother blame said it was a nervous day and the people were waiting down in the valley and brother brain said somewhere for him most of them were against him but somewhere in between they really didn't know he said but here appeared he the lord on a white donkey now the bible doesn't say it was a white donkey but you have to understand brother brandon was a prophet he was not a reformer he could see things i remember when brother biscuit told us that little story of brother but but suffolk but was a smoker in the church and nobody knew so when they were going out to hunt bud was taking care of the horses and everybody said buddy is a nice brother but what was smoking while he was taking care of the horses because they were a little bit away in the distance yeah and brother brother but himself he gave later that testimony he said he came back and he was taking care of the kitchen and so forth and brother graham laid in his hands with his hand behind his back he said hey bud how long are you a christian for how long and he said oh brother abraham since many many many years and after some minutes brother branham just spoke to god hey but when you were a non-christian did you ever smoke in your life and bought it yes and after some minutes where the brain was just calling him he said hey bud when did you stop smoking and bud said right now you see but he said he knew that brother bram saw him but you see god loves to correct his children but he will never break them god will never expose us god will never embarrass us because he's a father god is not interested in disciples like in north korea god wants to have personalities but who are under a certain headship can you say amen now as every father is the head of his own home every pastor is the head of a local church every messenger is the head of a church age but christ is the head of all seven messengers i'm sometime asked the question brother marcus does somebody have a right to correct the prophet i said sure god has a right god has a right god did it all time through the bible when a prophet didn't say exactly what he said god corrected him god has her because he's the head of all the prophets can you say amen so it's a question of a headship and and brother abraham saw jesus coming on a white donkey and he said this and i have to memorize it he's what happened on that mount of olives he said history was made prophecy was fulfilled that's what he says and here he comes down on that mount on that on the on that little donkey and here is a group uh fanatically screaming because they saw who was sitting on that donkey it was elohim it was the i am those whose eyes were opened spiritually could see who was sitting on the donkey that it was god and they were not standing just there and said oh that's deep man sometimes sometimes we have young people they come back from some kind of a camp and i said brother marcus it was tremendous i said tremendous we heard things that we never heard before i said yes you heard it never because before because the prophet never said it therefore you haven't never heard it before and then they say it was so deep and i said okay what did you understand uh nothing but it was tremendous so so we have to understand we are not here to impress people we have we are here to help people to align our vision in the vision for this day amen so they knew one thing and i'm just quoting it right from the bible it says in exodus 13 30 he said every first thing of an ass or donkey thou shalt redeem with the lamb and thou will not redeem it then thou shalt break his neck and all the firstborn of a man among the children shalt thou be redeemed so every every donkey is redeemed by a lamb and here was that group that could see a lamp sitting on a donkey and they knew one thing that's the messiah now my my thought is always this who was sitting on that donkey the lamb or the lion was both at the same time amen because because behold the lamb of god which taketh away the sins of the world that was him but the prophecy says tell the daughter of sign behold thy king cometh unto thee therefore i will say i will say don't be true dogmatic many times don't be doctrine because many times the same medal has a second side and if we are if we are just preach to enforce our camp it will not help for none of us to help that whole situation because maybe the picture is bigger than we thought so therefore we always should say make a comma but when these people saw who was sitting on that little donkey they they put off their garments and throw this on the floor it said behold who cometh in the name of the lord it was not a doctrine it was their redemption coming and brother brother we we there is a lot of people they say we are you know that expression slain in the spirit and we loved it i mean i i i love to be slain in the spirits but it must be so important to be slain in the world i always tell the young people a youth camp is not that superman comes you know and and he has a big ass and then he goes and he has in his suitcase some kind like a revival the revival is in the world we can encourage them we can bring on the right wrong way but if you don't go home and you eat the right thing that revival will die out and then you have to invite back the man of the hour and to just so because we want to help people look i always say this and that maybe i'm repeating myself because i have no notes just these pictures we were we were not believers at that time we were young people my family didn't believe god called me with an audible voice out of a discotheque an audible voice we didn't understand the message we just came to christ and after the years now we understood the message behind it you see sometimes you are just in the world or are you you're a new christian and you want to evangelize and you have always somebody who tries to steal away your experience with god i'm always there it's nothing behind christ it's nothing behind that kind of christianity and then you have to say he said honestly you're come too late you're too late because i see what god did in my life you're too late honest and we have to understand one thing there is people they are now discussing about with the young people uh about were there 13 people who fell from that bridge or 14 people who fell from a bridge i always said i wasn't there it was right before i was born i'm not interested in it but i know one thing it went from the prophet to the prophecy it went from the messenger to the message so i'm not interested so much in branham details about his life as a man but i see if somebody says and this message is nothing behind i can say today honestly you come too late we come before because we have seen how this message changed our life this message is more than just learning and seminary it has transforming power for our life and the holy spirit feeds on the word for our day [Applause] so so don't discuss if they were third because you were not there and the critics was not there neither then let us discuss uh was really paul on the way to damascus when the pillar fires who was there where was the webcam where was it if you start if you go on that level the whole bible just becomes a historic book i mean somebody says to me is that brother michael but the bible is god's word yes and the message the same way it does not come from america it comes from the presence of almighty so you can tell a person look you're come too late honestly we can discuss about dates but we will not discuss the message because i became the message still in process so look at this now you're looking now from to the mount of olives and we are going back and you go you see uh the temple of jerusalem make the next one please by the way i'm thinking so much you see i'm a little bit of a of a nervous type of a person so i'm so happy that i have nothing in my hand because there will be electrical shut down in in in in toledo if i have something in my mind to a remote control you know so so this is the view from mount of olives to the temple the only problem is we have the wrong building over there but i mean you you this you put you put it to my ignorance okay but this is not the temple this is just the mosque of omar when you watch from the mount of olives in this direction you struck straight west straight west not south east you look straight west and when the doors were open in the temple you could see from mount of olives up to the curtain you could see right amen so jesus went when he entered into jerusalem and these people were screaming fanatically he went from the east to the west i when i'm preaching about that subject about what happened in this week you know i said it started with just a demonstration of message believers who received their messiah but this week ended with the coming of the theophany bodies or let me say in other words with the resurrection of the saints because it was the sunday and the next sunday was the day of the resurrection in between of a week it changed from a doctrinal way of seeing up to a supernatural event that dimensions now mixing together this message is not reformation i know brother bram said when we go into the rapture uh we we were passed by the moon about the stars and at the same in the same message brother graham said when we're going to the rapture we're not changing the places change of dimension and our sister said yeah but i believe the first version i said okay let's both go into the rapture and we will see how it was okay i mean definitely so but we are going we are going now right to the west please make the next one and we understand one thing that the bible is right the bible is correct because when cain left the garden of eden which is located in the area of of israel northern africa um that place of of the river river euphrates that that area cain went east at what the bible says and the first civilization that we have is china so the bible is correct and from there civilization went to the west and the messengers went to the west and the gospel went to the west and it went over three seas mediterranean sea then over to england and over to the atlantic ocean and brother blame said that's justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost but this was not the end of the story because when it came to the changing of dispensation the voice said to brother branham had you have to go west there was some kind like a force let me say a forced state far is the number of human deliverance that what the prophet said now look when the picture was made of blood with brother brandon was the pillar of fire and i always say this that's what the prophet said we say that brother branham was the pillar of fire but brother graham said god wanted to make a picture of himself and he allowed that i was on the picture too so it was not brother brandon was the pillar of fight it was the pillar of fire with brother branham on it god wanted to make a picture of himself it was made by a kodak eastman film and brother branham oh it is exactly kodak eastman and that is exactly where brother bryan lived all the days of his life but when there was the time for the revealing of the word the voice says to him cersei's is the time now go west and remember that brother brandon that here is a a medium and you have to understand one thing things that are in the denominational world great is small for god amen because brother brennaman in the early years of his ministers i mean 400 000 people in bombay india 100 000 people in durban south africa we would say this is a tremendous ministry but that was not the message at that time that was the preparation for the message to come all the healings was just the preparation god wanted to say something so when you go into a denominational world the everybody acknowledged that brother brandon was a prophet benny hinn reiner bonker jimmy swaggart everybody would say william branham was a true prophet but at the end of his ministry he failed because he wanted to teach now for us the first part of the ministry was not as important as the last part of it where where denominations say brother brandon's ministry failed we said now it started really because now the word is open amen because the word comes to a prophet but brother brennan was a young man and here comes that medium and she says this i can tell you your date of your birth because there's a light following you i'm i can tell and brother ben didn't want to know but he could exactly so say as a young man there's a there's a star there's a light for i tell you the date of your birth and it was correct and what did that woman say she said your success will be in the west and brother baby said these mediums know more about the gospels than many preachers we cannot approach when we came into the message of the hour we were not white sheets we had already our background and many of us see the message through their glasses and they have their quotes to defend their little little doctrine that little petty doctrine but but this message we have to die everything many of our people they still live with the old husband denominational husband they have the doctrine of which i can see god send a messenger but this old husband has to die so that we can really marry christ which is the word can you say amen so it went to the west make the next one please so here brother branham in there preaching please make the next one in that preaching the prophet of god he now makes the link to sunset mountain in the message uh what is the attraction on the mountain he said oh there will be a truman true former and later reign in the last days upon that little group that come with him on this little donkey low humble no denomination and i always say no denomination outside of the message and inside of the message somebody said brother marcus here's the new wave and the man of the hour comes and here he said hey the bride found the man of the hour the bride is in the new wave already since many many years she's already in okay i mean lo and harmer crying hosanna to the king that comes in the name of the lord what's the matter today what is the attraction on the mount and brother brian bring brings that story of mount of olives to sunset mountain so what we have is we have a hey let me call it a generation but maybe i'm not i'm just missing some words who are afraid to go into the deeper part of the message because it's not as uncomplicated but don't fear those things because the same god who revealed you who the messenger is is the same god who reveals you the seven thunders it's not a question of working above seminary of being intelligent amen i'll give you just an example amen here is here here is that airplane over there in memphis and the plane stops and cannot go away because of the tornado or whatever and brother brandon hears the voice he said go go and he continues and here was that woman and i don't know if it is politically correct but let me quote the prophet he calls him a negro mama okay or an auntie he says sometimes okay and you have to understand the picture she is now laying over the fence and she says hello parson and brother brahm said how do you know that i'm a minister you see you have to understand normally it was brother branham discerning the people your name is eva i see you in a car accident but here that woman discerns the prophet and the prophet doesn't know who she is you get it he said he said this he said you are the prophet elijah and then she says some which is even greater she says and i'm the shunammite woman it was not brother brandon revealing her it was her revealing brother you say brother marcus that is a tremendous testimony i say that's the same holy spirit who showed you who the seven messengers the same one who revealed you this is the same one who brings you up higher don't only believe don't fear god can you say amen the same holy spirit that showed you come in amen as i was preaching on wednesday when when when joseph in the time when the lamb takes the book when joseph revealed himself to his brothers he didn't say you're a reuben you're a cebullon you're this he just this i am joseph and while he was revealed the brothers were revealed automatically you see now joseph could have gone before pharaoh i am joseph and pharaoh would say so what so what but when he said i am joseph the whole family knew who joseph was and at the same time the family knew who they are so when god revealed himself there was not one service that brother bram said the bride the bright age or the the the presentation of the bride not one preaching one sermon but when god unveiled himself the mighty god unveiled uh who is this who is this melchizedek automatically bride found herself while he reveals herself she is revealed with him nobody can tell you this it's your father revealing from where you come and where you go back to i mean this is just a little a little illustration but before the foundation of the world god made a picture of us and here we were there is no need to be arrogant brother brahm said if you want to continue with god never have an arrogant spirit among you amen but we are proud of our father so god made a picture here we were in what form ever amen just in the mind of god not to bring any kind of questions upon him and god took our souls and was throwing them in seven church ages amen and seven continents and god knows one thing he placed part of himself in our hearts because the bible says david said in the psalm he even placed eternity in our hearts there's only one who is eternal that's god himself you don't become an eternal being by the baptism of the holy ghost amen you must receive the holy ghost because you come from the mind of god it belongs to you amen you were already in the mind of god you had you had you are like him definitely so come from the same force source so god was just throwing his every pose he knows one thing my sheep he will hear my voice and when seven church ages are over the whole family of god will be together again nobody is missing and this messenger could say us god is not any more complete without you you are not just a number in the church you are part the manifestation of one of his thoughts can you say amen so here is that group and brother brandon brings it if you just make the next one we know that the prophet says now when he speaks about that event he said three years ago it was a prophecy now it's it's history he said what happened on sunset mountain revelation 10 1-7 is fulfilled this day this scripture is fulfilled so what happened they had the headstone came christ i mean we're still waiting for him to meet him in the air that's not another question at all okay but christ the worst king now here's what the brother brandon says now friends i believe that he is the same yesterday today and forever i believe he is just as able this afternoon to cause in this building a paradox because that he promised it would happen and how much more has he promised how much more is he leaving in the bible to this very age that we are living the ephesians again of the church keep in mind not ephesus again ephesians again we got seven church ages and we are promised that at the loud you see a church age there would be another ephesians that's right and we are here i believe with all my heart that jesus christ who made the promise so it's not an 8 8 8 8 h or back to a ephesus but it's in ephesians so somebody says brother marcus we are still in loud he's here amen definitely so because because the president of the millennium will not we're still here but brother marcus we live in a new day definitely though amen but it's part of a church age it's in ephesians in between of laodicea amen therefore brother branham starts here 1964 shalom good morning i mean a star shines in the night that was brother praise me but there was a changing a trans transforming in his ministry and he starts that year shalom good morning in finnish it's yuma so therefore i said this if we really live in this time our preaching must be different i mean our songs must be different every revival has four has its own own songs so this no imagine this here is now the people of israel they are just in bondage you know whipped out okay evening they have service miriam sing a song for us when israel was in a gib and everybody said that's the truth egyptian land let my people go so god came remembered brought them out brought them over the red seas everything was rejoicing and here comes mo he said miriam just sing a song for us yes i got something chorus number 365 when israel was in and mostly hey miriam that song doesn't fit right now to the to the present time i'm a singer song of today amen every revival has their songs can you say amen so so it's nothing wrong to play old song but everything has a balance the lord will come soon and when we sing the song he is here we sing it different than denominations we must think it's completely different they don't know what they think they're just thinking of a little blessing a little a little but we think about the person who came down i'm in christ in christ the full words now the entire holy spirit is visiting the church can you say amen i mean so we see these things different so what happened so oh ephesians church age okay therefore as the church is subject unto christ so let the wives be they're subject to their own husband and everything husbands love your wife and then it says this this is a great mystery but i speak concerning christ and the church so this is the ephesians though what we read for every marriage so i don't know if somebody wants to marry this morning if there is any kind of quick decisions you can do we had already a scripture for it we are reading it for every marriage and what time are we living in ephesians 8 it says it's it's a spiritual union between the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride that's going on right now can you say amen blessed be the name of it it's a tremendous time people say nothing is going on right now because we want to have some kind like a denominational thing but this is a revival like never before can you say amen i mean therefore the messenger will do two things bring the hearts back to the children and will reveal i think brother man said the seven thunders which will literally bring us to the face of our father i mean two things so this is now going on that means the capstone is landing the the the um the full world what wants to take his place and now my question is this now we want to meet him somewhere we want to get to him somewhere please make the next one you have to understand one thing when brother branham came on the scene he was like david brother branham did not bring a pentecostal revival in fact brother branham was a young man when he received the holy spirit himself the question is why we need the message why do we need the message when brother ben receives the the holy spirit without the baptism the baptism without the message why do we need to make is it just theory is it just nice thoughts nice to have or no amen let's be the name of the lord so when he came with his healing gift there were now many other evangelists they came up in the front it was like when when when when israel was facing goliath here comes david and his smiling relies and the bible says and all israel now restraint in their faith in faith and courage and just go went on when the ministry of william branham started and here you see the ticklish thing many people thought they can do the same in fact i think it was t.l osborne who heard the voice and he said you can do the same do the thing i mean i wonder from where that voice comes because brother ram said not to do it amen think about it the prophet said no no you are an evangelist don't try to imitate this but here comes great men and everybody was a facility more even successful than william branham but they had no message that they had no message they could bring people from one gathering to the next gathering they could bring healing because healing is a gift but they cannot bring you from a certain point into the next point because the only the messenger can do this this third exodus is not just going back to somewhere yes in some sort definitely so but the third exodus it is from the spiritual baptism of the holy ghost to the millennium and the great things hereafter the third actress is not let's just going back no let's go back and get what they have plus what is revealed what brings us home let's have that what they had in the beginning yes sir definitely plus the opening of the word that's what they didn't have in the beginning amen can you say amen so we find out that brother blame said this here is now these people and we have the great evangelists and a person like aura roberts he had 50 channels television channels okay and he need the money to keep that thing alive and brother blame said this when these evangelists are begging for money they are still under the same anointing of the of the catholic church he says in the fifth seal they still have and you watch for example jimmy swaggart and i mean we have to make a difference between true working of the holy spirit and just emotionalism both is able i will not say who is but jimmy you know he knows how to make people cry brother brandon tried at one time he was a young man and here comes his older person he said it was the worst preaching that i ever got that i ever heard and then brother said oh but all the sisters and other but they were crying and and and that doctor i forgot the name from the baptist churches your ministry is not to make people cry but to preach the gospel i mean uh whitney houston can make you cry if crying is the evidence for anything now we germans we don't cry but when it comes to football there's something in no not again see me finally if emotionalism is a sign for anything it will not work brother therefore brother ram said instead of searching he speaks of denomination instead of really searching the holy ghost something that changes them they are searching for speaking in tongues so that the young people can come to church i have the holy ghost too nothing changed in their life but they can say so i'm one of you but the baptism brings us into the fellowship of the saints but only the baptism of the holy spirit brings us into the body that's the difference can you say amen so here's jimmy swagger and all these people cry and what he does the camera comes because i mean a lot of tears is a lot of money at the end right because people love to give to something i mean support this work you see how and then people are crying at you all in the camp [Music] i think two or three are really hired that is marcus okay but i was one time in a charismatic movement it was a big uh uh it was it it was a big uh fella it was a big car was a big convention and and and uh it came from that pensacola thing you know pure denomination i just wanted to see it you see and then was the altar card and you could see how the own staff you know when it came to the altar they were already so because they knew one thing if the first 20 are running the rest things oh i don't want to miss something so they just go with the flow but it was not really god calling them into nothing definitely so so what happens is that they're filming those people and it comes up and and it is on the screen and by the way by the way by accident the bank account of jimmy swaggart appears i mean pure catholic approach of getting people's money always the same so so here what happens is this he said brother sister i've been back in the cave long enough and you have to that to know that there has been a lot of earthquakes and brother branham speaks about the revivals in the 50s shaking around a lot of noise and fusses nothing against don't misunderstand me it's dues and things like that big meetings but where has been got out of it that's the reason i said what i said this morning there has to come something deeper than a healing service brother baby didn't say it is wrong but something deeper has to follow that there has to come something deeper than a gift to speak with tongues there has to be something deeper than a rushing mighty wind so if brother branham brought the church into a higher level why should i bring the bring bring the people back to some kind of an emotional pentecostalism amen amen can you say amen so it's so important and then you have to see this that uh when aaron roberts had his had his television program um it was not only the preaching the preaching was not enough for the people so they hired the singers that was the time when red foley and these people came in and they were singing as in form of a concert before the people okay so say it in my words church has become entertainment for the people pure spiritual entertainment amen we love these things seeing in all this but it will not change you that you have to understand this the word will change you one of the mistakes that brother branham showed is never major on a minor and never minor on a major let minor things be minor you see amen and with the major thing would change our heart this would be the center of all things so it became a question of a pure entertainment it took the sincerity away from the people so here in that time brother branham got a vision what we called the tent vision okay we're still in the subject of our father coming down okay if we just show it okay next one please here he says this he says and he picked me up and he took me up and sent me way up high to where a meeting was going on looked like a tent or a cathedral of some sort and i looked and there was a little box a little place over on the side and i seen that light was talking to somebody above me that light that you see there on the picture it rolled away from me like that and went over to that tent and said i will meet you there and said this will be the third pull and you won't tell nobody and in sabino kenya he said this is the third pool so so so god sees that he sends william branham as a gift and as paul was not in the upper room william branham was not in azusa street both came later the problem of the first church in jerusalem was that they did not recognize their messenger and you can see very clear on the jerusalem council because peter was the spokesman john uh james was the pastor and they were just talking to one for them paul was just a nice missionary going to the hiddens but brother brahma said only the messenger of the age catches the mystery of the age brings it but as they couldn't see their messenger brother bram said when the first messenger came the church was already a fallen woman in the resume of the church age was already a form in short time so here's brother branham and he comes later and he sees and god sees that people are relying now on the gifts on the healing on the big meetings on the person and he has to do something deeper because god's vision was always to live with man as he did in the garden of eden we're thankful to god that he sent william brandon we are thankful to god that he sent him did he take him away because nobody would preach today we would all stream jeffersonville amen and billy paul gives that little example he said his father said to him billy god will take me home because i'm here and you are here kenny capps told us brother marcus at the end he became a catholic thing because we didn't even pray anymore if somebody was sick we were just phoning brother ben brother branham somebody said can you pray think about that he became a catholic that's what he said himself nobody prayed anymore because brother branham was around he would pray for us like a catholic priest amen but god wants his children to come into immaturity and and brother and brother bran said with billy paul i'm here and you are here but god wants to have you here but as long as i'm here you're looking too much to me so god would take me away he said you get a hold of this message this is what the young generation understand he is jehovah he is jehovah jairo you have to you have to nurse from him you have to drink it you have to eat it and you say man i'm in order to grow in christian things when i was a boy that's what that's what i lost my thought we were not believers at that time and i know i made it already when i was wednesday here but i was a fan of arnold schwarzenegger and sylvester stallone so one time arnold schwarzenegger he just made a little movement with his breasts breath and i was just a little skinny boy so i started bodybuilding so i tell you boys everything that you see here was here it's just a changing of dispensation but everything that you see here was here honestly it's not a problem you see but therefore i said this you can make bodybuilding you can't make sport but don't invest too much time don't forget your soul amen you can do whatever you want you don't have to make any kind of sport this is just human life okay uh but but don't invest too much into it okay so what happens is i was making bodybuilding and i went before the mirror and nothing happened try to go back but i learned one thing if you want to have muscles you cannot eat mcdonald's salmon it's the quietest audience that i ever heard [Laughter] if you want to have mussels you need a real steak you need something to feed upon and brother ben shows us the natural types the spiritual if you want to have muscles on your chest i said improv on penises on your breast better say chest okay if you have one my if you only have muscles on your breast if you want to have muscles amen he said you can i said you cannot eat harry potter you cannot eat facebook you can use it for some social network but don't think that you are now feeding spiritually because you are in some kind of a whatsapp group you must eat off the body word of the son of man which is the message of the hour and say amen you can do diet you don't have to do diet amen this is this is pure human life but never make a diet on the word you must take your time to eat the book to become the book amen that's it be the name of the lord so god stops to reform us on the inside but he is doing something on the outside but god does something on the inside for us the true purpose of christianity is not having people with long hair and long dresses because all the muslims have longer dresses than us the muslims are even you see god wants to have fellowship with us god wants to be a father to us not oh we go to church and we are better than the baptist oh thank you god and these pentecostal chicken i cannot see them anymore heavenly father i'm the only eagle here i'm so sorry i'm so sorry for the retina now this message did not leave us a doctrine it left us an attitude that you can feel sympathy with with anybody say brother because we thought when we were legalizing this message we can over every unbeliever because he saw us anyhow and then we can over every denomination because they don't have a message and then we had only feelings for those in the message who believed like us and all the time the circle became bigger smaller and smaller it's only us the chosen frozen but this messenger showed us how you can love people you can respect people and brother if somebody is not bright we will not make them bright but if somebody is not bright it doesn't mean he's not nothing he is something in the economy of god brother blame said a lot was just a penny and abraham was the silver dollar he said but god uses pennies and then brother brady said yes he uses pen and then second quote and that helps us so much brother raymond said everyone who served god's purpose will have a resurrection god remembers these things blessed be the name of the lord can you say amen so what happens is this here comes that tent vision now if god says to brother brainer i want to meet him there it would be good to know where the meeting place is huh because my question brother brother marcus where is the rapture in jeffersonville or tucson and brother ramsay in christ amen okay so where is the meeting place make the next one please please see one thing i mean a vision of brother branham or a vision in the bible can be naturally and can be symbolically the vision of marijuana was naturally the vision of pharaoh with the seven cows was completely symbolically some visions are natural visions some visions are spiritual visions with a spiritual application so if you make a spiritual vision to be natural you are searching the tent and they are building up up right now in south america a big a big tent to fulfill brother branham's vision but and here comes the point how i see it and i know i'm right but i don't have to say okay i don't have authority to say okay bring everything that the prophet said bring it back to the word that is one if you see a false doctrine in this message it's always built upon quotes and he has now anchor in the word in the in the whole picture it's just quote upon quote and misquoting something and then you come into a direction which doesn't make who was the first one who had a 10th vision in the bible that was moses definitely so moses was the first one he was taken up into the presence of god he saw the out of god and when he came down he should build a tabernacle in the wilderness according to the vision that he saw in heaven solomon takes that same concept and builds the temple in jerusalem and brother it has three compartments body soul and spirit this messenger revealed to us the temple in jerusalem was just a shadow on a human being amen this gives you respect for people for god to create a planet is nothing nothing god is god he just makes and another planet comes but the human being is the only species in in space who is made in the image of god it's nobody higher so if even if you see a dump on this a bump on the street for us he means nothing but brother brain said but for a mother it's his boy it's her boy and baby for a little girl it's her daddy every person on his earth deserves a certain form of a respect how do you how do you do yes i said this brother we are not a sect do you know how a sect is is is is identified in a sect you only have a value when you're a member of that of that lodge you see and sometimes let me see in christian churches here is a person goes to church everything is fine here she comes and we say oh brother marcus he from the foundation of the world i knew you already you are just an eagle you are just okay here something happens to brother marcus it doesn't have to be a doctrinal thing but maybe he's has heartache because of he fell in love to a girl so brother marcus doesn't come anymore he's away the same people will say yes he went from us because he never was part of us so brother marcus comes back to his right mind he said okay next week i'm coming back to church the same people would say he was always an eagle always it was an eagle that is a sect there is a sect if your value if you only have a value because you fit into their system you better flee away from that thing if you're a family of god god remembers you amen sometimes you forgot who you are but god did not forget you can you sometimes we we dress like heathens and we we we each like hidden and we we we we behave like edems and we live like heathens whatever but god knows there's still a soul there is still a part of me in it let my boy comes to himself [Applause] when i was a young boy i could dance like michael jackson i could take mike the moon works shall i make it [Laughter] but all the time my father was not nervous about me because i did not know who i was but when when that voice called me i r i did not understand but it was there was some call that somewhere hurt somewhere when i was in him i heard that voice already do you know one thing if a person dies the last sense that he's losing is his earring hearing therefore if somebody falls into a coma and he's for example a fan of michael jackson or whatever you put michael jackson on his ear many times they come back because they remember that voice that's so so i told the church if i fall into a coma you know what you put on my head okay and if i hear good evening in france i know i'm back here because it is the voice behind the voice that we recognize can you say amen so sometimes we don't know who we are and here is god he is not dealing with a group i said to brother chad on on on wednesday it's a bit bigger the building than this one i said the time will come where our churches will be closed that's what the prophet says but then we will be the church i'm the church therefore if you can come don't sleep in the church we will see it this afternoon if you come get benefit of it don't drive for two hours then to sleep in the church amen sleep in bed and pray in church don't pray in bed and stephen church then something is misrepresented in our life if you come say lord speak to me okay but our churches will one day be closed i said to brother chad brother chad maybe he was shocked i couldn't say i said your church will be a nice rent of a cars you know it's big enough here will be the used vehicles and here are the new now this church will be a nice pizzeria one day but we will not cry we would say okay then it's time to go home they say amen we are not worshiping a building not a doctrine not a group it's a family of god that you will take home the rapture is not that god will be standing there and said okay literal life tabernacle okay maybe the maybe is god will take all his children home the rapture is him coming down and picking us up home i love that i made this illustration different time and it shows when we have father's day today think about our heavenly father who he is and who we are i mean there was one time a boy and he wanted to buy some dogs okay and when he was buying these dogs the owner of the dogs he came down this staircase and the boy said i want to have this dog and the owner said i mean what what do you want with this dog he cannot run he's handicapped and he doesn't have a value anyhow and the boys he picked up his throws and from his knee down he had an artificial leg and the boy said i want to have this dog because when we go out he understands me and i understand yeah and brother blame said this god became man to understand quote brother branham god became teenager to understand the teenagers that's the father that we serve and even brother brahem said god became man as man you understand what i want to say in a mixed audience to understand man whatever you pray god says i understand what you talk about that's our father whenever it's important brother ramsey god doesn't send an angel he comes it down himself think about that time can you say amen amen so here we have amen the first tent you continue and then we see this the tent where is the tent amen let me say in my own words let the bride be the tent amen let you be the tent amen because we live in a tent amen amen look i'm a very sympathetic type of a person you wouldn't believe but honestly my problem is i live in a german tent for 70 years i mean but if i will step from my german tent in my true body that god ordained for me amen you will find out marcus back as a fine boy he's a good body he's a good brother every funeral we say this for we know that our earthly house of this tabernacle you could call it tent we're dissolved we have a building of god a house not made with hands eternal in the heaven and paul continues in verse 5 we are now living temporarily in a tent but we will enter into it was brother brandon who said that heavenly body is our theophany brother brahm did not invent theophanies but he was the messenger the first messenger who could show us the unvisible world yes two questions to brother and brother brandon who are the angels beholding the faith of the father all the time but the brain said that's the body that you're going into it's your theophany brother brandon please explain the angel which abides with every accolade every believer brother brahman said only the redeemed half angels it's your own theophany that was his questions one before the seals one after the seals brother brahm did not invent theophanies but he was the one showing us our link to it because he said my glorified body is standing right here on the platform i'm charging me like a bet he calls a glorified body but by this therefore you say brother mark is it can that be look at what the bible says if if you have a certain kind of a hospitality you invite the good brother it's not only the brother coming it's his angel going with him amen and if you invite some kind of a critics is a wrong spirit going with that person the same way can you say amen i mean therefore it's a supernatural gathering when you come to the church it's not only become for a sermon amen it's you are here and i believe this wherever this message is preached the pillar of fire is there that's what i believe amen and the angels of the lord i encamp those who fear him so we live according to the bible we live in a tent amen but we are not that tense brother sister you are not a person with a soul you are the soul living in a body when you came to earth nobody asked you do you want to be black or white nobody asked you you want to be german or or or or american as i always said you america you americans are baxter europeans anyhow nobody asks you do you want to be male or do you want to be female nobody asks you nobody asks you which kind of name do you want to have you couldn't even choose your own name your parents choose that crooked name that you have all your life if you like it or not i'm in nobody nobody asked do you want to what kind of family you want to become i would have said um is is rockefeller is that okay that's brother i was born in a broken home nobody asked me right and i was so hating my own life you know having that kind of i saw how my father was beating up my mother even with the holy spirit you'll never forget these pictures you never forget it's deep in your soul but i have enough holy spirit to go over it right but we didn't choose our own background and and sometimes we hate ourselves we hate the background from where we are but one thing is true and we thought we came wrong on this earth but quote brother branham in the message thinks it ought to be god planned your birth for many many generations it is not that god knew that would you would be there but god planned your your birth for many generations it helps you to accept you the way how you are can you say amen your grandfather i was when i was last year here it was veterans day veterans day in the us i was over there in in north carolina so somebody we went into a restaurant and somebody wants to give me an arden or something like a like a like a special a special present it's veterans day and i received it i got it veteran's day thank you very much i wanted to say yes but i was on the wrong side but i didn't do it i was afraid they were spitting in my food or something like this i said better say nothing that do do do but we never choose and we think we came back wrong on this earth but one thing is sure god makes sure that you go the right way you will leave this earth in the right way but we're living with our life complexes that we didn't choose for ourselves can you say amen god god god wanted to bring us directly into our theophany and we landed in ohio we wanted to come by the spoken word and we had to go to the birth channel with all the blood and all the crying i was there when my daughter was when my daughter was born present in german you can do it so i always said this my my wife needed one midwife i needed two honestly that was too much a burst is too much honestly i promise my wife will never get another child no no that was not so but but i was thinking twice about certain things you know that was for me too much so we came on this earth you see the first thing that we got was a spanky and the big website you get more in life you will see that was our welcoming part um the first thing okay you're here marcus first is thank you and the midwife said okay during your 70 80 years on this earth you get some more but i'm happy life is more than 70 years in in ohio god thinks about eternity this is just a passage we just live in a tent for some time brother and full redemption is when we leave that tent and go into our real body who we are really can you say amen blessed be the name of the lord just just finish make the next make the next one so here we go we understand the tenth vision and god as as eve was taken at the cross out of adam brother bram calls her the second wife as adam was giving her second wife okay on the uh i'm in that time we don't go into it you know there was a time of the separation but after 2 000 years now god takes his wife back into his bosom this message is connecting the heavenly bridegroom with the earthly bride and it's not some kind of a reformation here it's connecting hearts our hearts with our heavenly father amen i mean there was a there was there was a there was a thing when brother branham uh heard that kind of of a prophecy and look what he said danny henry he said he said because thou have chosen thy way and brother ben said it was my choosing and god says it was my way do you see one thing it was his choosing but it was god's way in other words god says to his messenger you arrived your ambitions are not my ambitions when you speak it's me that i speak your heart is my heart you think like i think yes can you say amen i mean you have to see one thing is it fine for you can you say amen this message is transforming us into the image of our father but you must know who you are then you know one thing i will arrive there because it's somebody or a representation already is waiting for me i make it amen here you have to see one thing here comes elohim and he's and he's just pronouncing judgment i mean and and abraham says oh if there is 50 in in in toledo if there is 40 if there is 30 if there's 20 and god just don't waste my time but god in his heart said that's my boy because god wants to the salvation of each and every one god does if okay if there's one but he was so proud abraham that's my boy he thinks like me he's a savior like i'm a savior he's trying to to even make a deal with me abraham the first deal maker i mean before there was anything he was not a loser he was a deal maker amen the same with moses god says i will disrupt them and moses said don't just take me and god says that's my boy that is christ in moses i can see myself in the reflection can you say amen legalism will never produce it you must understand god have you ever seen one thing and as i said i mean just being from from inspiration brother branham was together with uh these kind of bible scholars great men around his time then the new greek hebrew latin and so forth great man and they came to brother brandon and they said brother brahman you don't know your bible very well very well and you understand what brother braham said he said i don't know my bible maybe very well like you but i know the author and we always thought in the pentecostal way because our background is pure pentecost we came out of it you know in that sense of okay seeing in the power and the grace and we always thought blessing is volume that's what we always thought we nev we could not accept god can do in silence great things we did we did what it was not in our in our vision when the holy spirit comes from and then we saw the film the deep corners to the deep and everybody was just sitting and brother blame said he's here nobody jumping around and the sisters he's here so god can do do great things in volume but god can do great things in silence the same way don't limit god in our tradition our culture don't do this blessed be the name of the lord but but but then i understood look what did brother branham say he said you will first understand the book if you know the writer of the book if you understand how he thinks then you can see the book you say amen so you must know the nature and we never knew who god was in 2000 years therefore we tried it with pentecostalism with reformation with legalism we tried everything we tried even to to make some kind like a uh like an entertainment so that they keep young people stay in church i'm a let's have some barbecue let's have some volleyball but nothing against it it's part of it but it will not keep the people in christ it's not the solution you just keep them until god is touching there's no problem about that but now we understand how god thinks how he is his care his love amen here it is psalm 27 now where is where is now the tenth absence of david the lord is my light and my salvation whom shall i fear the lord is my stranger of my life not the church amen amen that's fine not uh brother if you only would know brother marcus the lord is so to be a part of it when the wicked man ends the force for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion in the secret of his tabernacle you say that's brandon tabernacle no no no that is here that is the tent that is the that is that that is that body that is prepared for you ah he shall hide in his tabernacle he shall set me upon a rock which is revelation back into your tenth vision therefore when eliezer came he was not he he he was not marrying rebecca and do you remember that that in that calling there was something supernatural i mean because eliezer said look if i will say give my camels to drink and she will say i give my camels to drink and you to drink right okay then it will be the right so he was expressing only half of it the second half was in his heart so when rebecca came down i mean eliza said hey girl how are you doing fine do you give my camel something to drink sure that was the social part every denomination can do this i'ma do something and then eliezer was waiting does she get the thing which is hidden in my heart does she get does she get in the supernatural channel that god input and then rebecca says yes and do you want to drink something too that was not outspoken she got in the channel of what eliezer had in his heart and he's on one thing that's the same holy spirit gave in to my heart that is now working on her heart amen it's a secret in her can you say amen the bride knows aman the secret of god can you see amen and what happened when they were on the way amen they were just riding and eliza rebecca said can you say something about my bridegroom yes i mean who is this merchandise he was preaching for two hours i mean united signed and signed the united states is that so yeah sick the seventh seed is revealed so definitely so i mean i mean yes exactly so the token i will explain you the token and in the evening time when she met ellie is in the evening time where did they go in the tent of her mother we are the tent of our mother amma we're the fruit of our mother where is the meeting place today is it in toledo or is it in limer better make that dead meeting place right in your hearts do you understand i mean where is the meeting place in the tent am i right in his heart not in some kind of of of emotional part of the holy ghost which is fine but it must be deep in our heart where we meet our father can you say amen blessed be the name of the lord and then this amen i mean there's too much people in this message if we're the brides they want to marry eliza you see amen they say oh eliza you're looking so good and you can preach so nice and what a wonderful thing but but somehow eliezer was not too nice because god wanted to make sure that that rebecca does not fall in love with eliezer so so so eliasa must have had some defects okay because he didn't want to be in competition with with isaac okay and and this messenger that we had had made sure that nobody falls in love with him that he leads us just to christ which is the word and when when she sees christ now this eliezer just turns away and just goes his ministry is over have you ever remarked when the seven seals were open brother bram never preached any more my life story never do never did because that was the story of william branham was over he led us to the person from the messenger to the message i'm from the messenger to christ who came down for ourselves can you say amen therefore when the tenth vision was he could only watch from sight and he says and people came out it was not anymore the men were laying hands nothing against this all kind of jewish tradition nothing against but we have something deeper than this today can you say amen read the last one i know i'm over time but man it's so wonderful to preach here can you say amen i have to preach now for for a whole year because i will not be invited back i have no notes but mind is this an audience that really understands the things of god that is a pleasure from me and and make the last one do you understand what i said in the beginning this message must turn from a doctrine to a relationship and i say this in all respect and you have to have a spiritual insight this bible is the negative it's the shadow and this message is the positive of all things amen amen blessed be the name of the lord amen amen so here it is finishing amen the meeting place the coming of the king did you see the coming of the king in our time christ the word can you say amen or was it just god sent the prophet our message today is not anymore god said the prophet 100 years ago that's 100 years ago that's not our message god sent the prophet that's 400 then you can say god said john wesley is true too amen but our message the king is here i mean i've seen i've seen something people will make a lot of demonstration this afternoon so therefore i said this afternoon is coaching for the young people coaching not preaching coaching i had some time a couple that came to our church and the young people that came in like this in the sunday school it's fine nothing against this and i wonder myself look am i if the presence of god is there it's another approach would be maybe more helpful in that situation so i i thought by myself now who are the parents i found out the paris reality fresh because here they come in the sanctuary the way we come is the way they come the way we treat the message in our homes shows our revelation that we have the way we dress shows a certain revelation you we we don't have to do to to preach about long dress and short rest i tell you if you know who you are amma you will know i'm a son of a king i'm a daughter of a king i'm a princess hey i'm not but okay so what happened is this so we see these three men everything is finished i put the bible away because if not there's always inspiration coming through and then i get a problem okay yeah something because i know every enough is said it's fine here come these three men they were led by a star like us so every time they were led just by the star okay they were just going i mean they didn't understand much they had only seen we have seen the star that was the only thing so when they had evening service they had only one sermon because they didn't understand the doctrine so one of the boys said let's have a son a service this evening wednesday evening and one of the somebody has something on his heart yes i have a sermon what is the title we have seen in star and bo said praise the lord i mean for two years there was the only sermon there but they were happy with it because it was a reality for them amen so when they came to jerusalem brother ram said they were mixing with the wrong kind of people and when they were mixing with the pharisees and so they couldn't see the star anymore therefore they had to ask the question where is the king of the jews brother braham said they were mixing was the wrong people have spirits people have anointings we have a slogan in germany which says if you go in a train and there is five smokers in the train and you are not smoker but if you come out of that train you're smelling like the smokers it's the show me your friends i show you your spiritual revelation even on whatsapp you know i always tell our young people don't give any comments about ministers and ministries and what's going on because it means it can happen that we're mispleasing god by giving our comments about things that we really do not understand leave it like this somebody has to say a new scandal comes up not a problem the bride goes forward but they were mixing with these kind of people and when they were mixing they couldn't see the star anymore and when they left jerusalem they saw the star again here we are so what happens now they come to bethlehem jesus is now two years old and look at this here they come with three gifts amen the first one comes and lays down gold he said because i know you are a king they did not go to toys r us they did not go to toys r us normally for a two-year old boy you go to toys r us okay but they didn't go to toys r us because they knew who was in the boy who told them god told him amen so the second one bring fragrances because your life will be in service the third one brings mirror because you will die the gifts of these three wise men were the expression of their revelation that they had and the way we treat the church and the way we treat the word and the way we treat god and the way we treat one another is an expression of our revelation that we have really do you get it sometimes you go home and there's message books just on the floor like this i i don't believe too much in those things i mean or are never read i was one time in a in a place where we wanted to support the brother and the brother i want to show he's a message believer okay to get message money if i would be a baptist he would be a baptist so he had books of everyone to to pull it out you know so he took the church edge book and said brother marcus i show you that i'm a message believer here's my church april and he opens it he opens it in the way how you open a book for the first time i said thank you this is your this is really your identification do you have a book on the shelf that is just tremendous i mean but but the time that we take for the word shows if we understood can you say amen so everybody we don't have to judge ours others we can judge just ourselves heavenly father maybe i i understand deep things in the doctrine but maybe i didn't understand the doctrine maybe i didn't understand you maybe i i really don't understand the plan for me and from my life can you say amen blessed be the name of the lord so just as an encouragement we have a wonderful father this message will produce what nothing else before produce rapturing face they didn't represent eruption faith in the first church age because you need seven thunders to be revealed we have more than they ever had but you cannot overstep what they had in the beginning just take it out and from that on go on every young people needs the holy spirit it needs a new birth but that's not the end of your journey this is what you have understand this is the beginning of your journey because now you have something to feed on i mean to build on can you say amen i mean if the musicians would come and we have a song together blessed be the name of the lord look amen to please god as a father amen who ever heard about about um richard strauss richard strauss richard what's the world's king [Music] there's a nice story and it shows you can touch the heart of god with the right kind of an of an attitude maybe you have a nice song like i have a father something like this or as the deer you know i like it always in the beginning now richard strauss had a son by the name of now richard strauss father and richard strauss i mean they say father because the son was more famous than the father richard straub's father and richardson richard's frost was much more famous much more gifted and there was some kind like a competition between both some kind like a uh friction that they separated from one another and so he made his career and his father made his career and what happened is one day they made both a concert on the same market it was not planned amen so richard strauss was playing here and richard strauss father was playing here's a true story and i think hey if these people understand what our father is what about us let the holy spirit show what our father is and how god is such a wonderful caring father and the father was just playing here and after some time as they were not talking to one another you could see how more of the people went from the father to the son and at the end the father had hardly anybody listening to him everybody was because the son was much more gifted than the father yeah and at a certain time the when i'm telling you all it always struck me because you see life is reality life is not slow guns life is reality and there's so much real things in this message why should i search a slogan right and the boy was breaking the father's heart by doing this when all the people were there the father had to stop because nobody was listening to him and the boy said this i'm now proud to play a part a piece that my father wrote and when he started to play this and the father heard his own melody [Music] he stopped and he cried and he went to listen to his own son i mean when the peace was over the father came to him hey boy i'm so proud about you amen brother i tell you you've got his place he gives you your place this message brought back respect true love agape love amen can you say amen [Music] this message brought back a true relationship because we are more than just church members we are sons and daughters of god coming from his minds amen and brother brown makes that little example really finishing by that he said here is that musician a man and he makes that concert and he plays it perfectly in the audience everybody is applauding every and the bot and the boy so knows one thing his teacher is way up in the balcony a man and he's not so much interested if everybody's happy but he said if his teacher would be satisfied then he would be satisfied and when the teacher starts to clap amen brother if you are a real christian you are not looking too much that everybody steps on your shoulder but but you are so in what does my father think about it do you understand that god leads us into situation just to see our reaction how matured we became already in all these years not how much we know but how much is this message now became our message we are the message of today can you say amen do you love the lord jesus amen do you want to when we go today into father's day that we say lord let me have a real father's day let me think about you how great and how wonderful you are it matters to serve the lord [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] i i made [Music] a farm my [Music] before even time began my life was in he knows my name [Music] thank you jesus [Music] i have a father [Music] [Music] huh [Music] i go
