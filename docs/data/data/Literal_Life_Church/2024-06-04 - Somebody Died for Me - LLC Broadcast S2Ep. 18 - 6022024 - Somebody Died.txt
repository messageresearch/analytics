encourage you today let's Worship the Lord as he sings Now sing with him Hallelujah you was a troubled kid in and out of [Music] jail when his daddy said this is the last time I'll P so he ened in the Army and they sent him to Iraq he was a different man when he came back some people said the Army must have whipped you into shame but he said that's not the reason that i' changed somebody died for me before I I even asked for help gave his life for me when I couldn't save myself I cannot live the way I live or be the way I was every day a gift to me because somebody died for me amen amen amen hallelujah now they fold the flag and attach a silver star oh Jesus Jesus as The Grieving mother leans against his arm and then he stands before the family and does his best to tell how he survived the night his best friend fell no one whoever knew him was surprised he died that way he always lived for Jesus oh he used to always say somebody died for me before I even asked for help gave his life for me when I couldn't save myself I cannot live the way I live or be the way I was every day is a gift to me because somebody died for me now I don't want to waste the moment of the time that I have left with every breath I'm giv God help me not forget God help me not forget somebody die for me before I even asked for help gave his life for me when I couldn't save myself cannot live the way I live or be the way I was every day a gift to me because somebody died for [Music] me 1 Corinthians 15 and verse 1 moreover Brethren I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you which also ye have received and wherein ye stand by which also ye are saved so the gospel that he preached brings salvation that's how they were saved at the gospel is not preached people can't be saved but when the gospel is preached the good news then people are saved by which also you are saved if you keep in memory what I preached unto you unless you have believed in vain and what that means is that if you really believed it not superficially not just in your head but from your heart if you really believe this then you are saved and also you are uh you you should keep it in your memory the things that I've preached to you how many know it's important to keep the word of God in your memory and keep that's why we come to church to bring things into remembrance uh tomorrow is Memorial Day and there's a certain time we give to remember what's been done I want to talk a little bit about that this morning what Memorial Day means not just for this country but also for Christians God has memorials for us and God wants us to remember what he's done for us amen and keep the word of God in our memory keep reminding us of the word of God but verse three says for I delivered for I delivered unto you the first first of all that which I also received and what he means there is that this is the most important thing this is top priority I for I delivered unto you first of all before anything before anything I preached first of all that which also I receive in other words what God gave me I gave you how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures the first thing that Paul said I brought to you and the most important thing is somebody died for you right and if we skip to the other parts and miss this part we're missing something essential to the Christian walk can you say Amen my title this morning is somebody died for you somebody died for you I'm going to read that verse again I delivered unto you the priority first of all before all things that which I received how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures as as I just like to speak a little bit this morning on someone died for me and I want to we realized that tomorrow is a holiday uh Memorial Day and that was set up since 1971 our country set it up as a national holiday and I would say that I guess like with most holidays uh over time the new generation especially begins to lose the purpose and the meaning of the holidays it happens almost with every good holiday holiday that we're really not celebrating the TR thing of what it meant years ago uh the new generation tends to lose the uh being connected with the meaning of it so some of my sermon this morning will be just letting uh everyone know what Memorial Day means and what it uh what it what it was started for and there was another holiday that went on from uh years before that but then they changed it and so since 1971 uh there's a there's a meaning behind this holiday tomorrow and quite often we get together for our hot dogs and hamburgers and if that's happening of course I'm there I'm not going to miss it but through all of our you know any holiday can lose its purpose Christmas has certainly lost its purpose and its meaning can you say Amen July 4th and and you could just say all of the all most of the holidays and and I I hate that Thanksgiving kind of gets lost in the shuffle of turkey and different things because we missed the meaning of it and what its purpose was and why it was set for a memorial can you say Amen we we we tend to We tend to uh lose the meaning of something and and there's when we take something and turn it into something else it loses its mean meaning and it loses loses a feeling to it uh uh there's a natural disconnect in the new generation from the meaning and even the power of something because sometimes something can have a meaning to it and an origin to it but sometimes when we are connected to the meaning of it it has a power with it to affect our lives today when we're connected with something the way it started especially God's word and when he did something in the past when we connect let me just bring this when you connect with the Lord Jesus Christ and his word truly connect in your heart and with what he did at Calvary when you connect with that it has an effect on your life today it has a power power that goes with it and so uh we we tend to become disconnected and there's a saying that I use that comes from Rush limbal he applied it to the the Democrats but I will not do that this morning because I think it's a great statement he attached to the de Democrats but I attach it to Christianity Today and to many other things he said that becomes symbolism over substance and he was saying that some people it becomes something becomes a symbol something in history just becomes a symbol and we celebrate the symbol and we celebrate some distant thing that took place but we miss the substance of what It produced we miss the substance of what it really means to us how many can safely say in Christianity that the that the church as a whole loses the power of the Cross can you say Amen but they're celebrating the cross they're singing about the cross but you can lose the power of the Cross and what it does in our lives people talk about Jesus Christ at Christmas they talk about his birth oh yes he was born God came came to Earth but there ought to be a revelation behind that affects our lives that today I'm living because of what happened in the past I'm living in the power of what took place in the past I'm living in the meaning of it can you say it means something to me because he's done something through the work of the Cross 2,000 years ago I'm feeling the effects of that can you say amen and if that doesn't happen then we become symbolism over substance we don't have the substance of what it means we don't have the reality of the Holy Ghost and what this Bible is to produce as the Holy Ghost and that's a tragedy because then it becomes religion and religion isn't working anymore it has to be a personal relationship symbolism over substance some things have a a powerful impression and affect our lives and when we really understand the meaning of it we become connected with the results of it and it's like Christ dying to take our sin away that statement as is read in the scripture he said how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures there was an effect Christ died for us somebody died for us but what's the effect to take our sin to take our sin if we lose the meaning of that then we're caught with our sin and the soul that sinth it shall die that's right that's what the Bible says yeah if you're not delivered from your sin the soul that sinneth it will die there's no future to that it ends someday but the effect of Christ someone dying for us has a a residual effect we're still seeing the effects of the blood of Jesus Christ somebody died for us but what good is it to talk about it if we don't have our sins released from [Music] [Applause] us what good is the message of the hour unless we see the powerful effect of Jesus Christ coming from the message of the hour and that's not just a feeling that's not just an emotion that's not just dancing in the spirit it's the power to live a life it's the power to overcome demons it's the power to overcome habits it's the power to overcome pornography it's the power I'm talking about Calvary somebody died for us and in that is the power to overcome can you say Amen the power to overcome fornication the power to overcome adultery the power to overcome any demon Spirit Satan bring the best of your spirits to us and the power of Calvary can deliver that person from it Memorial Day is a day I didn't know if you the young people knew it they probably do but I'm reminding us of that day Memorial Day is is to remember ones who have died in military service throughout history and they died for a reason thank God they died for a reason and that is they died to preserve our Liber Liberty they died to preserve our unity in our country to preserve the Liberties that we enjoy you see the new generations we tend to let our liberties become common someone will get 16 17 years old and they'll be given a a car and and they can go and come drive places and so but see there are some countries or some places we can come to church today still in Liberty I don't know how much longer those Liberties will be left but I can tell you as long as I've got it before they shut these doors I want to be here every time time the doors are open because that's a liberty that I'm enjoying and there's many countries that don't have that Liberty they can't worship the way they want to worship but in our country there's been millions of lives that have been given somebody died that you could come in your car this morning and nobody told you what to do nobody told you to come to church or not go to church nobody dictated you pretty much live in those Liberties I can go to the store I can go here I can go do what what I'll say something about Co though I I will say something was a the the first step towards moving towards a communistic control that comes over our lives that you're going to do this you're not going to do that and all in the name of Co for the safety of all mankind you better have the discernment to know where that was going that's right because it was the first set to me to engage in in the minds of the people that for the safety of all we all need to join in with this and you need to do this matter of fact you have to do this on it oh well that's not popular there's not many amens to that and I can't even hear them on the streaming I can't even hear the amens that's not very popular but I'm going to tell you something there is scripture that shows that there's a control that you can't buy or sell unless you brought into that image into the beast that's coming and it's closer than you think but the people's minds have to be prepared for it so controlling but listen today you didn't have anybody tell you not to come to church young people people you didn't have tell about you couldn't drive your car to church you have Liberties here and I want to tell you you have them because there's been hundreds of thousands of lives that have died so you could have Liberty this morning and that's what Memorial Day is about tomorrow it's the memorial not of ones uh not of ones that have served in the military that's Veterans Day but this is one who have died to preserve our Liberty to keep us safe from tyrants to keep us safe from terrorists so we can live in a free country people have died for that and when they many of them signed up for it signed up for the military service to go fighting Wars and they signed up knowing that they may die for it that's bravery to sign up to realize I could lose my life over this but if they did it for the right intentions not to just become some He-Man but they did it for the right intentions they did it because I'm willing when I sign off on this I'm willing to give my life I may not come back home but I'm doing doing it for my country and I'm doing it for the future preservation of Liberty and so that other ones could live I'll die so they can live who's that sound like to you our Lord and savior I'll go to this cross so they can live in Victory I'll go and take this death so that they can live every day in the power God doesn't want us to die for him he wants us to live for him in the power of the Holy Ghost is that okay with everybody so I want us to think about this a minute and how special that is how special it is when because we lose the feeling of this I want you to and this might be very basic to somebody maybe you were looking for something deeper this morning but I want you to think about how special it is when someone dies so that you can enjoy something in the future right good that we are living in certain Liberties still today different than other countries lives were taken lives were uh blood was shed can you say amen and people gave their lives so that you can enjoy your day of hot dogs and hamburgers and volleyball that's right amen with nobody stepping in and taking say you can't do this people gave their lives for that they shed blood for that their lives were ended lives that could have come home and enjoyed their freedoms but they didn't come home they died and you still have your life there's something about that that it should never become common to us amen I said it should never become common to us that somebody died so I could live that part should never become common to us I thought this is an amazing Story related to our subject today years ago a young mother was making her way across the Hills of South Wales carrying her tiny baby in her arms when she was overtaken by a blizzard a blinding blizzard she never reached her destination when the blizzard had subsided her body was found by Searchers beneath a mound of snow but they discovered that before her death she had taken off all of her outer clothing and wrapped it around her baby when they unwrapped the child to their great surprise and joy they found he was alive and well she had mounded her body over his and given her life for her child proving the depths of her mother love years later that child David Lloyd George grown to manhood became Prime Minister of Great Britain and without a doubt one of England's greatest Statesmen the power of the future On A Life That's laid down for someone else that was a case of a mother but then there's hundreds of lives can you say am man that were willing to say I know I'm going to die over this I there's another story that I like I've told it here before I this story always moves me to tears it's it's amazing aming there was a little boy and he was brought into the doctor's office and said his older sister he's only about 7 years old his older sister had a rare blood disease and she's about 11 or 12 something like that and so they they realize if they took some of the boys blood then it and had a transfusion it would help her and so they brought him in the office and they explained to this young boy that he was that and asked him would you they explained his sister's situation and he was already crying a little bit you know he didn't want to lose his sister and so they said but we can do something here if you give your blood for your sister she can live and so he just stopped and he thought and then his eyes swelled up again with tears and he thought about it just about 30 seconds and he was just crying and he says I'll do it I'll do it and so when they got them on the the two uh beds next to each other and they begin this blood transfusion they begin to do it and you you could actually see it and this just restore the life of this girl after a few minutes the little boy said to the doctors and to his parents he said and he said and when do I die because he had understood it to be that for her to live he would have to give his blood and at that moment in the office he thought about it he said I'd rather have my sister live I'd rather give my life as a seven-year-old boy so she can go on being happy so she can go on and live she doesn't have to die but I will he made that decision right and he said when do I die die said said honey no we didn't mean for you to die you're you're helping her with your blood but see my I moved in my heart because a young boy was willing to do that for his sister there's something about that in the love of God and Beyond a little boy the love of God is here this morning can you say Amen there's nobody could go to a cross like that unless he had you in mind that you could live in Victory that you can live over habits could you live in the Holy Ghost yes you can can you say Amen there isn't anything that you can't overcome I was looking at last night how many lives total were lost just for our country so that can preserve our freedoms and I have a little visual of it we know that the Civil War was the most lives lost but they counted up and this one lady in this article just this weekend put this together and she was pulling up the lives of over the years of all the wars that our country has fought it's amazing how many lives it looks like close to a million the different Wars of revolution War 4400 War of 1812 Indian Wars mexic now friends let's not lose the feeling listen this is almost a Million Lives that have been lost over history to preserve the unity and to preserve our country so that you can live all these years in Liberty let's not lose the feeling of it I thank God for these Million Lives real interesting thing that the she the lady Megan crigger said in this article talking about the the lives that were lost she said not long ago most Americans were likely to know an active military service men service member many of our young people many Americans knew somebody but today because of the factors like political cost of launching a military draft and the increasing Automation and Outsourcing of military related task fewer Americans have a personal connection to someone in the armed forces that's right during World War II about 12% of the total US population were part of the Armed Forces according to the S Census Bureau and Department of Defense and while fewer service ministers uh while fewer service members enlisted during the Vietnam era the conflict's draft cut across American society explains Gala true a medical uh a medical person uh over the uh Department of Veterans Affairs uh she talk she talks with veterans primarily those who fought most recently in Afghanistan and Iraq and explores ways to use narrative as a tool for mental health care even though there's so much talk about the opposition and difficult experiences that Vietnam veterans had come coming home with protest there was still a sense that people were very close to someone who had served or knew somebody who had served she said today out of a nation of nearly 329 million people 1.3 million Americans are in active duty military and another 800,000 serve in the reserves according to the Department of Defense that that small figure influences the way the general public thinks about the cost of the conflict see disconnected from the cost disconnected that somebody gave their life for me more and more the new generation when they become disconnected from that they don't have an appreciation and a gratefulness for the Liberties they have they're disconnected that small figure influences the way the general public thinks about the cost of the conflict in our society we seen the real shift she said now now less than 1% of our population has served the experience of going to war and coming home we don't have we don't have as much awareness of it we have a disconnect in our society about what's going on who has served and what they experienced I thought that was very interesting to show the lack of connect to some somebody died for me so that I can enjoy this there's a Detachment there was a there's many moms who had their kid go away to war and never come back home their their their son dies their son never come home and she's that mom being related to that son that's her son and he never came back home from war she's going to feel that she's going to feel that personally she's going to do a lot of crying she's going to do a lot of weeping if she's like most of them they are proud of their country and they're proud that their son has served but you don't get around the fact of the feeling of being hurt being completely oh my son is gone my son gave his life and you don't think they think sometimes all these boys and young men walking around enjoying their cars and enjoying their Liberties and her son died so they could enjoy them she feels it can you say Amen and and so but they're saying in this start that they people feel it less and less because they don't have a family member who went and didn't come back and they don't have a they don't know anybody a very small person knows somebody that served and died when they know somebody it's kind of like well my friend he he died over there they forget somebody died for them they don't know someone who died for them if you have someone step in front of you and take a bullet and what if you were standing there somebody steps out with a gun and they point it right at you and your your buddy that's sitting next to you today your buddy seen what was going to happen and jumped out and took the bullet for you and died and you had to go to the funeral of that friend I would say that you were feeling what your friend did for you and I would say that it would affect you so much emotionally you would cry even as a man you would cry and realize my buddy took the bullet for me and now I'm going to live my life in appreciation I'd say at that funeral you're going to be telling the story of your friend and you're going to be living your life in honor in honor and appreciation for what he did for you because you wouldn't be breathing unless he took that bullet for you I want to tell you young people this morning and every person under the sound of my voice there's a man Jesus Christ who took the bullet for you 2,000 years ago he took the bullet for you you deserve to die in your sin you deserve to pay for your sins those little sins or big sins that you do that should come on you and you should die for that but I'm here to tell you somebody took the bullet for you and the very least that you could do you should give them all the least you could do is come to an altar and say I give my life back I'll be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ I'll be filled with the Holy Spirit and the rest of my life belongs to Jesus Christ cuz he took the bullet from me he took my sins thank you for watching our message today if you would like more information please contact us by visiting our website literall life. church and if you would like to
