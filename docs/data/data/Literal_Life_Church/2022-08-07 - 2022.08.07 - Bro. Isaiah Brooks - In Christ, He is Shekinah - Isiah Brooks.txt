========================================

of chapter 32 through the 34th verse it's not to say that my wife and i didn't has never had in this disagreement but for certain we didn't handle them like we were children god was able to keep us in that way and we thank god for it beginning at the 32nd verse fear not little flock for it it's your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom we love that part don't we cell that you have and give arms provide yourself bags with wax which wax not old a treasure in the heavens that faileth not where no thief approaches neither moth corrupt where your treasure is there will your heart be also one more scripture saint john 15. i love the books of john chapters however you want to say it but john really goes straight to the heart john 15 5-6 it says i am the vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and i in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me ye can do nothing y'all remember that if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned let us pray heavenly father we thank you lord we thank you for your amazing grace we thank you god because we're serving a god that is not a million miles away but you promised us in this day that you would not only be in us with us but in us you have made this body your temple and we thank you god we pray father that you would bless this service in a special way i pray father god that you would bring change to the people the kind of change that we need to produce a rapture bless us now in your lovely name jesus christ we pray amen you may be seated i've got a lot to say in a short period of time but by the grace of god i like to entitle this message in christ he is shekinah say it again in christ he is shekinah because we often think a thought that the shekinah glory was something separate but there is only one true glory and that's the glory of god and it's only in his presence there is fullness of joy the one thing i loved this morning and understand is that we don't have to fear and the reasons why we don't have to fear is because we did not choose ourselves he chose us i always go back to election when the devil tries to tell me who i am and what i am not i go back to election [Applause] i go back to where i came from [Applause] i didn't come from the pits of hell but i came from god and i go back to god [Applause] one of the things i wanted to bring out is there's something that we can do that god himself cannot i heard this and i thought it was really good here in the scripture where he says i am the vine and ye are the branches it is the branches that produces the fruit [Applause] but it's the vine that gives life to the branches you see what i'm saying so i wanted to say it like this people of god those who call and claim yourself to be bride there's work to be done and that is to produce jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever god did not come to establish a church another organization or denomination he came a man to produce a bride someone or somebody that was with him from the beginning when the bible tells us about jesus coming and he being the body of god and the bible said he thought it not robbery to be equal with god see the problem with us is our mindset and i'm just going to work on that just a bit because right now the prince of the air is now working on the minds of the people is that right everything your youtube your facebook your facetime your whatever i don't know [Music] but the point is satan put those things out to change you oh come on somebody to desensitize you to make you believe that there must be another avenue for you outside of the world but there's only one way he changes your mind but he's not changing your mind in the sense of biology anymore you know of course we don't believe in that kind of evolution i trust when we don't but the truth of the matter is there is something evolving but it's not according to science it's according to the spoken word [Applause] one of the things that caught my attention and i wanted to throw this in because we're in a place we're going to be challenged challenged by psychology there was a time where when biology stood on our side is that right but now biology has to bow down to psychology come on somebody and i don't mean to step on nobody's toes but i was in walmart at a cash register i was having problems and this lady comes to me and she says my manager she can come and help you did you hear what i just said but when she came my eyes yes hello my eyes didn't declare or she my eyes declared are he y'all understand me and she's and listen social media it's using psychology slowly like a serpent huh to change your mind and your thoughts about the word of god hallelujah i don't care what you do to change yourself if you were born a man you're going to die a man if you were born a woman you're going to die a woman hallelujah [Applause] the part that they're not telling you is that science is lying to you hallelujah science is lying to you i don't know who showed it to me but somebody showed me this transit who was once a woman and wanted to be a man and and you know what listen i want you to understand this my soul cry out [Applause] i'm not condemning these people my soul cries out i always tell people i said i don't care if they come a man come in my church wearing a dress if he's searching for salvation [Applause] or if a woman come in my you know you understand repent whatever i i am a soul-saving station you are a soul-saving station hallelujah we're not here to criticize we're here to save hallelujah oh my it gets on my nerve when i see these self-righteous christians looking at people as though they're nasty and they're dirty that's the way the pharisees did it hallelujah but when jesus saw a sinner he saw a soul that was possibly that could possibly be saved hallelujah i don't care if they got tattoos from left to right they're searching for something they're trying to find an identity and the bride of jesus christ we have the answer [Applause] hallelujah jesus did not come to save those or to heal those that did not need physician he came to heal the sick hallelujah and this is the most sickest this is the sickest generation i have ever seen but jesus put us here because he knew the great physician hallelujah would be in this age to save whosoever will [Applause] he bypassed all those organizations is that right did you know brother banner ministry came in in at a time when he says go to the hedges go to the highways go to the scum of the earth that's where the seed of god is laying you want a rapture let's look for the last one [Applause] but not by your choice huh if some of y'all would meet jesus in the flesh y'all would probably score on him he didn't wear the fancy attire the bible doesn't even tell us how often he bathed because sometimes water was not convenient somebody helped me here but let me get back to our mind thing so you understand what the devil is slowly doing he's changing your mind my grandbaby who's 17 years old was in school and she made herself known to be a christian and then she had a circle of the the lgbt i don't even know abbreviation but anyway they pushed on her and and pressed her and tried to make her recant that she was a christian because they said you hate people like us she said no i don't i don't hate people like you but i do know there's an answer for you hallelujah i don't have no hatred in my heart toward anyone god knows that's the truth have people done me wrong yes do i have a right no hallelujah there's no bitterness but let me go on she stood her test she went to the counseling outing counselor to to tell what happened and you know what they did no thing she's the oddball let me tell you like this she doesn't even have the holy ghost yet she's seeking the holy ghost but she knows the word is right [Applause] hello it's like some of us say oh i can't quit smoking because i don't have the holy ghost you are deceived [Applause] you don't need the holy ghost to overcome cigarettes [Applause] you just need to quit [Applause] there's thousands maybe millions of people who have quit smoking and don't even know nothing about the holy ghost that's just your excuse now i don't know who that was for our minds is the channel that satan is working in or trying to work in he's trying to convince us that we are alone and that the lord is not with us of course he has always been a liar see because you got to understand if you get the holy ghost i mean the real holy ghost the mind of christ is in you oh see i can feel that mind of christ is in you [Applause] christ is not a secondary god he's not the second person in the trinity christ is god [Applause] see we use those words we think the holy ghost in christ is two different things but the anointing of god is god satan has always been a liar the truth is we were made gods see how y'all did that you if you're going to believe the message or you're not going to believe it but when you are when you get the holy ghost when god seals with the holy ghost you're no longer just a man you have become a messiah what you see in your mind you won't let the holy ghost change your mind see the holy ghost comes to strip you from your will and your ways and his mind becomes your mind oh come on somebody we're at a turning point many of us have married ourselves to the message system [Applause] you know the do's and the don'ts [Applause] you know how to be polite when it's convenient [Applause] but that's a system that's all right i was part of it but i'm trying my best to break out of that i don't want a system i need jesus christ and him only hallelujah you say how do you know it's a system because the system will always keep you divided [Applause] hallelujah the system will always make you think that you're better than your brother the sister will always make you jealous of your brother [Applause] but when the real holy ghost is in you hallelujah you will love your brother you'll die for your brother you'll do whatever it takes you've got to fight for this unit what you experienced this weekend that was god that was the anointing of god and if god comes down to consume the sacrifice who is the judge oh you don't tell me i know some of y'all you know that's a little bit too much [Music] i ain't going to go there but that's what you're saying but where the spirit of the lord is there's liberty [Applause] hallelujah you know it's so amazing brother branham said like this he said when when it doesn't matter what nationality you are he said but when you get the holy ghost he said they act the same way [Applause] i get i get i get messed up when i see people with the holy ghost and the holy spirit is falling and they're sitting there [Applause] see that's a systematic message hallelujah [Applause] say it again that's a systematic message hallelujah hallelujah but when the holy ghost get ahold of you it ain't nothing about a system it's something that gets a hold of you and you can't help yourself hallelujah glory to god and you do just like saul's daughter you embarrass me be careful or that's not that's not message be careful [Applause] because brother branham tried to tell us he said listen there's a system he didn't say it like this but he said listen when the music stops the people stop that's a system hallelujah because a true holy ghost feared person they don't care about no music hallelujah when god moves they move hallelujah we don't even care about time somebody help me here when you're in the anointing of god time means nothing [Applause] if you fully understood what your holy ghost is your holy ghost did not come from the third dimension we were born in this dimension flesh hallelujah but when you're born again you're born into another dimension is that right it has to be if the bible said we're now sitting in heavenly places in christ jesus he's in a different dimension and we need to learn how to draw from that dimension somebody help me but we want to stay here to give your flesh excuses but listen when you've been born again that eagle in you can't stay on the ground too long hallelujah there's something that's in you listen people i looked and i've been in this message a long time but i kept saying to myself god what i hear your prophet saying i don't see it [Applause] y'all understand what i mean let me clarify that i don't see it being lived in the people and what they are calling message there's got to be more to it [Applause] [Music] hallelujah we may have not organized it but we definitely have denominated it y'all understand me and as long as we think like that we're not going anywhere [Applause] [Music] lord see i know i'm touching on something that you don't totally agree with but that's okay the eagles hear what i'm saying the eagles hear what i'm saying listen when brother branham came in when god came in 1963 and we talked about the cloud how many of y'all believed that was god can i testify i'm gonna testify just a moment here when i was a boy i don't know what year is it was the 60s because kennedy and then you know uh different ones were doing things and i could remember that but me and some other guys we were in a just a little park and in that park we were playing football yeah real football football to us anyway you know back in the day you played football without pads but the truth of the matter is here was a white man i don't remember what he looked like but i do remember the colors he had black on black and white he had on a black suit with a black tie and a white shirt i remember that i thought he was an insurance man really because in my neighborhood during that time only the milkman the insurance man and the policeman was allowed in the neighborhood otherwise you had to be you're going to be questioned did i say insurance man yeah but the point is this man walked up to us with this magazine and he pulled it out he said come here boys i want to show you something he said the lord is soon to come and we were a little reluctant he says no no come come come so we went up to him he opened the magazine to the picture of the cloud and he asked can y'all see jesus in this cloud i was the only one of the boys i saw it i said i can see it you know what the man did he closed the book walked off and i never seen him again and i never saw this magazine or the picture of the cloud until i came to this message so you cannot tell me there is nobody in the world can make me deny it [Applause] but what was it jesus christ vindicating himself that he's the same yesterday today and forever [Applause] those seven angels they didn't come and form the face of christ in a cloud for you just put up on your wall he brought those clouds those angels brought a message [Applause] that was deeper than the seven church ages hallelujah he brought a secret they brought a secret and the secret is hidden upon the tapes in the books so you can listen to the message and still not get it see that's what happened to all of those who left they listened to it with an intellectualism they were able to preach it glory to god but they missed the very essence of what it came for it came to change you from glory to glory it came to change you what your mind it came to change your mind move your way from all organizations and denominationalism we still got it they crossed over with us just like they cross over with israel into into the wilderness yeah you still got the struggle for powers and you know the great ones you know i ran from that great one stuff they called me one time uh one of the top ten i said top ten i didn't even know we had a top ten i remember one sister when i was pastor in lime ohio they said why do you always have these no-name preachers i told her because the no-name preachers don't have to compete [Music] they get it from god and give it just like they get it from god hallelujah i'm not interested on how deep you are i just want to hear from god [Applause] let's move on eh so you know by the grace of god it's such a secret it's a secret feasting and that's what what gets me because so many people in the message you don't even hear the tapes anymore you go y'all remember when you first came to the message everybody played it you know you could knock on the door and you hear brother brandon's voice before you heard the person you was visiting now you know what happens you get a silence because everybody's running to cut the tv off you hear what i'm saying but what you don't understand in order for the head ship to settle on you you've got to know his mind you got to know how he's thinking [Applause] hallelujah is this okay coming from spiritual food in this season you see some brother adam said amen paragraph 135 he says truly lord his food was was to do the will of god now if his fool talk about jesus was to do the will of god what about the bride listen people aren't you tired of satan defeating us and don't tell me because what this what this devil did whenever it comes to the supernatural he put the stigma on us oh that's pentecostal now what did he do he put us back into bondage and that's what paul said you have not been called unto bondage to fear [Applause] don't tell me you don't fear the holy ghost move on you to shout and say amen and you look around to see if anybody else is doing it [Applause] that's fair hallelujah you're afraid amen to hold god at his word even if look like the person is dying and getting ready to take their last breath you still you just you ought to still say i know god sold me so he arrives again [Applause] satan changes your mind because your your body is right with pain and the devil told you you're going to die what that got to do with anything when did the did the doctors become my lord [Applause] hallelujah i know a woman who had an issue of blood that witnessed positioned at the physician and could not find a cure but there was a cure and the cure was jesus christ himself i don't care how many doctors you go to i'm the bride of jesus christ god said with his stripes i'm healed and when the doctors run out we have a cure we have a place to turn [Applause] that's my food [Applause] that's what the message taught me william branham had to go because had he not gone you would have never come to your position [Applause] [Music] is that right elijah had to go before elisha could ever come to position even though elisha followed elijah all those years he he could never take his position why because elijah was in the position that he was to take oh y'all got quiet on that but that's the truth that's why elijah said if you see me go you got to see him go in order to know where you stand somebody help me here right and when that same mantle would represent the holy ghost fell on eliza he said where is the god of elijah what was it it was a kind of glory it was the christ it was the holy ghost that was anointing him [Applause] listen the devil is trying to make you feel like you're a victim stop that nonsense i'm not a victim oh the age is bad it's so terrible whoa it's me oh no i'm not a victim i'm victorious hallelujah i'm victorious wow because all of this had been set and staged for me for you is that right watercolor told esther say this is the time you come from this is your time hallelujah you are in a time of pressure this is your time because the pressure is going to bring you to the place you ought to be somebody help me here yes sir and desperation struck her you see what i'm saying she is already in you it's already just waiting for the anointing to strike you hallelujah and when that anointing struck her she said listen to this you fast three days and nights don't eat or drink because tomorrow i'm going to see the king you hear what i'm saying and she said if i perish let me perish she was so desperate but one thing about her she knew the king chose her and she also knew the king loved her see you can't make a stand like that until you know the king love you [Applause] huh yes sir you know i love esther so i'm not going to spend too much time here because i'll be spending the whole rest of the message on her i can't hardly wait to meet her but the point is i love esther she came from nowhere didn't have mother father right raised by her uncle hallelujah a no-name like me hallelujah but look what god done he took a no name let's put it in your turn he took somebody who was a prostitute he took somebody who was a drug addict he took somebody a man who was a whoremonger he took somebody he was a liar he took somebody who was a drug hallelujah and said i choose you he chose me [Applause] i was a nobody hallelujah but thanks be to god he took this nobody and made him somebody hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] see many of us haven't even read the seals book because we we figure we just hear it from the pastors or the preachers you you are deceiving yourself you ought to be ashamed of yourself do you understand what that is that's that manner that was hidden behind the holies of holies [Applause] and god allowed that manner to be printed and the voice of it to be heard do you understand what i'm saying and that alone transform you when you hear the word preach it changes you you don't change it it changes you you are hey you are ordained you are chosen and the word finds the bride and changes her from glory to glory somebody help me here [Applause] people say oh he made mistakes but i got exactly what i needed to hear and i don't know who you are to be so grand to say that but i can tell you i can find where he's in the book of revelation [Applause] and i think if he made it i made it too right so if he had some errors and made it then i made it in on his errors [Applause] right [Applause] and most of the time people go that way because they want to be something they're not getting the glory that they want they want to build a kingdom and there's only one kingdom and that is the kingdom of the lord jesus christ listen we don't preach this church age we don't preach what they preach in pentecost i mean we don't cut out the good parts they're good things all of the things that they did and wasn't wrong because you can't cut off you understand that the restoration everything has been restored that's the problem with the message you know people coming to the message they don't even explain to them justification they don't even know sanctify what sanctification no no no i'm bright i can do what i want to do yeah you can and you're going straight to hell yeah you gonna do it go ahead and do it you say i want the holy ghost and you're still living kind of any kind of way and you're fooling yourself you've got to be sanctified holy ghost ain't going to feel your your vessel is full of trash [Applause] hello listen the bride is having her revival right now and that revival is getting the trash out of your life oh my god have mercy on us christ the shekinah think about it we look at this economy like oh i want to get there when oh he's already in there but we failed to tap into him let me tell you something secret about abraham he met elohim and what was the manifestation as they walked the crippled the humped over back however he was beginning to strengthen brother branham said there was a changing in his atoms that gray hair disappeared hallelujah that strong muscle man that he was whatever that was but anyway anyhow the man he was when he was old was young he now transformed did it happen overnight no as they went on went on abraham began to see sarah you're looking pretty good today y'all hear what i'm saying and showers stood back saying honey you don't look so bad jose but there's a transformation there was a changing hallelujah people that was a shadow this is the real thing there is a changing and we're changing right now in the inner man from glory to glory to glory hallelujah and as we change this whole flesh is going to reflect [Applause] i like it when people say brother brooks you're looking younger yes i like that for a 66 year old man i don't do too bad right but it ain't me it's the god in me [Music] hallelujah i give all glory to him whatever i do is because he can do it he does it in me let me read home now coming from uh excuse me still spiritual food and due season brother brahma says amen he says the mystery of it is those seals each one of those churches made an organization and got into it and that's one of the secrets things that has been wrong before god now i read that because if you're not you shouldn't say when israel came out of egypt egypt still was in israel the wilderness came to test them to draw them away from systematic worship and you and i know that's what we've come into this form now we've allowed laws and rules and regulations the holy ghost has fallen and you're looking at the clock and says oh wait wait a minute we gotta we gotta cut it off because we just 30 minutes of worship what what's wrong with the good go people no when god is present he's a ruler he's the time keeper not you not me nobody it's god let me say it like this when moses stood went up on the mountain and stood in the pill of fire right there with the shekinah glory then moses says god you got to hurry up i've been gone about two days now and the people gonna get worried and you know you doing all this stuff no it's like yesterday i was so consumed i didn't know what was gonna happen next i didn't want him to leave hallelujah that's the way it's supposed to be you're not supposed to come to church and say well we're going to sing this many songs and that many songs and we're going to sing and who goes and then some of y'all y'all come to church like y'all at some kind of orchestra or some kind of theatric and ooh didn't she sing that song what's wrong with you you're supposed to enter into the song we don't give just concerts we give worship and you're supposed to get into the worship the world does count us we do worship it look like a concert a formatter concert but it's worship real worship [Applause] ooh brother brooks i really enjoyed the song i didn't even see you move [Applause] hallelujah when did you enjoy it oh in my heart [Applause] what's in your heart comes out hallelujah if you've got joy in your heart the joy come out if you got peace in your heart the peace come down hallelujah [Applause] the lord is in this temple the lord is in this temple the lord is in this temple let all the earth keep quiet when god is here he does what he wants to do you have no thought about this [Applause] hallelujah is that all right it's so amazing what we do sometime because he said well i have never shot it before have you ever tried it [Applause] when they started singing that african song that brother got y'all looking at him like him doing the show i thought okay he getting ready to do a jericho mod but nobody joined in we don't see the move of the spirit oh god [Music] one drop of rain brings a ton of drops [Applause] and we got to learn when we see something it's like this the holy ghost is falling as you all know i hadn't heard of cyrene in a long time one of them sisters they they're emotional so they can get it good and you know what we'll do we'll look around and start like lord follow me i want that [Music] i won't say but i went to a concert one time and me and my wife and i was on my wife and i was the only one out of order they ain't calling no name brother lafontaine but you know what i'm talking about we was at this church and we were the only one clapping and standing up and everybody craning their necklace you know what they say that's brother brooks he's emotional he he's second pool but that's all right i got two of them [Applause] at least i got two where's yours come on somebody where is it listen it's a hidden secret this you understand this what we're feasting on denominations know nothing about it [Applause] and whether you understand it or not this anointing you feeling is really changing you it is the shekinah it is not some other anointing that is why we should always want the anointing because it is anointing that breaks and destroys the yokes when my anointing was falling when it was falling all over me you know what i was doing praising god and claiming everything you didn't see me because i was in here i was worshiping with him you understand me there's a secret place and the message has provided the secret place oh jesus y'all looking at me like is this man crazy i probably am it's okay it feels pretty good here brother brown said like this and and uh in a spiritual food and due season go listen to that message that whole message is wonderful 65. listen he says listen we we notice here again if the word is in us and has come to us as it did elijah in that day it'd do the same thing that he did he would feed us on the secret things of god which is hid in hid from the world oh again it makes the message in the messenger as one now i hear people quote that all the time but you fail to see we're not talking about brother branham right now because when elijah ministry was over elicious a lot of ministry was on you understand me the problem with the people is you want to constantly talk about brother branham because you want to give an excuse for you not doing anything [Applause] but when brother brandon preached a message he said the move is on for the bride and everybody said all the moves on the bride no he said the move is on for the bride that means the political realm the social realm and economical realm every realm is going to push the bride into her place [Applause] [Music] just like it was in esther she would have laid there right in that place but listen god moved he had the devil to move on haman and it was a decree we're going to kill them all she had to feel the pressure of her day in order to move into her position y'all hear what i'm saying the truthful is we don't see our day but it's later than you think right now god is dealing with individuals that will one day soon take a translation and you'll know nothing about it because you've been dollatory you can't be lazy right now and let me tell you something if you're not praying you are in trouble the devil gonna try his best to keep you from praying but that's your secret closet that's when god can talk to you and you can talk to god you hear what i'm saying that's where god can give you orders that nobody else can hear you've got to pray i'm going to say it again you must pray you say i don't feel it when i talk to people i don't feel it but they get the message don't they now if i'm in anger they'll feel it but the point is you can talk to people all day and you know oh i felt when i said that word i just felt it no you didn't you see what i'm saying i'm almost done i'm almost done i'm trying to come to the end of it but i want you to understand by the grace of god let me finish this quote it'll do the same thing that he did y'all understand that then there's a comma he would feed on the feet on he will feed on the secret things of god which is hid from the world now you talk about the coming of christ and all these things well what is he going to meet when he comes i just know what isaac did when he came he met rebecca he already knew eliza but rebecca was something different hello now you said well wait a minute wait then let me tell you something rebecca saw part of the word ella ethan never did is that right and she went and he went into her mother's tent his mother's tent right but you understand isaac hit nothing from rebecca i can't say too much more with that one but my point is if you're just resting on what you can see from the books and the tapes you missing it is deeper than that and rebecca will see it it's given to her to see it and to understand it oh jesus let me move right because you got to understand the bride and the word must become one if we are the messenger which we are is that right we are see how you're so lazy with that we are [Applause] make your flesh believe it if you don't right the spiritual food is ready and it's in the season now how many y'all ever seen that how the message you could read and study it all the time you just love it then all of a sudden there's a season the same book you read yesterday is now unfolding [Applause] huh because it's ordained to do that you see what i'm saying every time we need something when the devil moves god moves hallelujah he always give us a word to fight back [Applause] right now satan is working with the mind and god is working with your mind that's why he said let this mind be in you that was in christ jesus you've got to be changed your mind must be renewed because what the devil is still telling you bringing back all dirt and trash that you used to be oh my and he uses against you all the time but god told us through the prophets that when god gives a person a birth he don't patch him up he makes him a new creature you got to realize if the devil can change your mind that you've been changed you'll go back to doing the old things but when you know that god has brought a hallelujah i'm not the same man i'm not the same woman i don't go the same places i don't do the same things i have no desire to do it say that you are a liar i know i've been born again hallelujah and god is bringing me up to the full stature of christ little by little she is already in the seed brother said everything i need is all right four raptures already in there hallelujah and y'all don't even know you're hurting yourself when you don't need entry into the anointing you see that's a lot of carry-on you better carry on huh you better carry on well you know people this is what get me and i still don't fully understand it but they say well that's not my nature well you need to get rid of the one you got [Applause] but the one you got ain't worshiping god and you've been made to worship god hallelujah all that screaming and shouting y'all knew what y'all do it at home i remember a sister telling me that when i went back and i say too much i don't do all of that and then her daddy brought her lawnmower and she loves to cut the grass i was there she saw the llama [Music] i walked up and like i caught her in the ass you're gonna get sighted of a lot more you can't get excited about the word of god there's something wrong with that hallelujah you don't have to act like me but you least need to let me know that you're alive [Applause] hallelujah i'm talking about the shekinah that's what you're feeling that ain't brother brooks emotionally stirring you up that's it that's the shekinah hallelujah is that right the bible said god makes his ministers ministers of fire that's fire you really that is the fire of god [Applause] you don't see it but it's there it's coming from here remember he said each one of you have this food if you wish it if you are willing to steal away from all the unbelief of this hour if you are ready to come into christ come into his promise he said and remember his promises in malachi 4 luke 17 30 also in saint john 14 12 how many more scriptures of telling you joel 2 38 oh that he would do or in 2 28 rather what he would do in these last days and how the prophet said that it'll be light in these last days how it will work that's why i don't care how great a preacher is in this message none of them moved me [Applause] if you don't belong to this you ain't gonna make it who gave him that authority y'all don't even know what i'm talking about but i know what i'm talking about preachers raise up and they think because they can teach it god never said teach it preach it demonstrate it let's see that oh y'all don't got quiet on me now but it's true anyhow we need to see power behind this message we've had a teaching revival we need to see what was taught live i ain't against teaching i love teaching but i want to see it live brother brown said putting that dynamic and the mechanics together hallelujah and i can't hardly stand it when the teachers be trying to tell us how the holy ghost is supposed to act right right and i'll just tell them you know what you need to get the holy ghost and then you can tell me how it acts now i don't mean no harm but i've learned that because people can teach you real good don't mean they got it [Applause] there's a lot of great teachers who once was in the messages no longer in the message see that's i learned that i learned that this brain is so smart that you can catch the uh at least the intellectual part of it and you can bring it like you know it but let me tell you what listen i don't brag on myself it doesn't happen all the time but i've seen cancer healed i've seen the dead raised twice hallelujah i've seen all manner of diseases blood pressure you name it one sister came to me and said the doctor said if i don't have an abortion i'm gonna have the spine my baby gonna have spina bifida i say tell that devil he's a liar hallelujah that old same devil came to me a few years ago saying you got cancer to prostrate it's aggressive it's more than likely in your bones hallelujah i started crying i started weeping and then i thought why am i crying i'm not afraid of the devil [Applause] then the lord spoke to my wife and said you don't have no cancer i said that's right i said i'm going to take your report over that report guess what guess what i went from there cause you know me and my wife who's eating all that green stuff all that healthy food y'all know healthy food tastes nasty i'm sorry i just got one life to live give me some of that grease out [Applause] hallelujah y'all hear what i'm saying you get to a bad place and you want to eat a baby roof or something like you know you can't eat yeah watch me hallelujah my life is not in the doctor's hands my life is in god's hand [Applause] hallelujah no it's true it's true it's true it's true and you know we look at this thing we say well all i'm trying to say is like it's time to produce what we've been preaching and you just can't live any kind of life to produce that if god told the prophet he had to be more consecrated that means you got to be more consecrated hallelujah it's true when jesus come he'll find the same material the bride doing wonders doing explorers these signs should follow them that believe all of those things the early church did when christ come or when he comes to rapture us it'll be that way i'm not trying to brag on myself i'm trying to lift up jesus so much we need to know that jesus still lives [Applause] hallelujah living in iowa we've had storms after storms and there was a real terrible storm coming our way and everybody everybody one all of us wanted to go to church so we got together and we prayed did you know the storm did this and even the news people say we don't know what happened hey but we know what happened it's a secret it's the bride's food it's what we do it's not an open show [Applause] i gotta quit uh hallelujah god is so good to us [Applause] let me read this one more quote and then i'm going to stop i've got to stop cause y'all have me here the next day and next day i feel the pulling i really appreciate it [Applause] [Music] [Applause] i had two strokes and they weren't really really bad but one left me with a little limp and everything and i think y'all told y'all that and i would run out i would run and that left foot would be slapping the flow like that i didn't tell my wife because you know my wife you know anybody's fighting you know so i didn't tell her what was going on and as i ran i was like with the stripes i'm here right now i could run y'all hear what i'm saying see your words creates your words creates if you really believe that you got to believe what you're speaking if you're going to speak it believe it hallelujah it will create for you god will prove to you that he's alive and well he's the same god that william branham served [Music] it's true and i really don't know where the quiet people gonna be they might have a section up there i don't know i know god asked job where were you when the sons of god shouted and jumped for joy i don't know let me hurry up i don't mean to rush but i need to i don't want to you know sometimes you can preach too long and then everybody forget everything you said so i don't want you to do that amen so this is going to be the last quote okay now when we found out that elijah could say that because the message of the hour in the word of god or the messenger the messenger and the word was exactly the same thing see you see what i'm saying you and i can't be duel we can't say what what brother brandon said or what the message said and then do something opposite it has to be what he said because what people do the revelation of of these son of man is what people fail to see they think that brother branham is like one of those denominational prophets no that was god hello that was god hiding behind human flesh [Applause] i'm not talking about the part that went hunting i'm talking about the one that was preaching and when he ever said thus saith the lord that was god you understand me hallelujah when he pointed and said squirrels and so many that was god holy see you understand what i'm saying now that same god wants to occupy your body and let me say it like this people i want to be careful because i want to keep a balance you know you can get legalistic in the sense okay i shout everybody got a child no that's not true and that's what people do when they sit still because i sit still everybody should no you're legalistic too there is a balance some shout and some don't but i always try to get those that don't do to do you know because i think you don't know what you're missing and god will give you whatever you ask for [Applause] if you want to dance for the lord ask him he'll give it that's the truth i remember the first time i danced man i was all in the flow like a top two don't you spin but the truth of the matter is you can't god do what does whatever he wants to do oh jesus have mercy is that right brother branham thought the same thing in the seat of the skull for they would and how i hadn't seen that in a long time with no shoes to be dancing in their hair just be flunk y'all got it so pinned tight but one time that was a glorious thing to see it's true i remember going to a message church and she had her hair braided up or something like that and had a ball on the side and she was just wow that's all i'm saying people of god god is good let me finish this get out the way the prophet the word of the message messenger messenger message and message was the same jesus said if i do the works that which that's written of me then don't believe me that's good any man in his message is one you see what i'm saying so how can you be a believer if you don't do what you believe jesus said it you don't believe me believe the works my works prove who i am not my preaching not my teaching my words that's why today that that they do not believe in doing the works of god because they do not accept the message of god they don't believe the message i didn't say that he said it but those who believe god's hour that we're living in these things are hidden food just think god has so hid it that they look right at it and don't see it the same way that elijah blinded the syrian army the same way that god blinded the unbeliever from the true genuine food of god the believer what they call noah a fanatic building an ark his eyes were open to the word of god and the promise they were they the very thing that their they called fanaticism saved noah and his family see the very thing the thing that people laugh at is the thing that we pray for feel me oh god hallelujah it's gotten so bad about around the message people are just afraid to get the holy ghost enough to speak in time yes i remember having you know communion one time and a brother just kind of let it slip one time he he was so full of the holy ghost he slipped speaking in tongues i had some brother come to me says nah that ain't right he needed interpreter come on it just made me know you haven't prayed cause sometimes you can pray and there ain't no interpreter but the tongues come it's sad bondage that's what i call it that's true true people are around the message don't even get it speaking in tongues no more do they do that what's wrong with that something's wrong with that if the original church received the birth now tell me when did the women change their way of having babies when they changed their way of having babies then god would change his way of having some but those acts 2 38 screaming harlem kids that's where it was in the beginning that's the way it'll be in the ending say what you want to say a lot of people are still born you mean to tell me you lived this life all these years and haven't had some kind of sensation come upon you something ought to strike you man brother am i wrong you can correct me but my point is wouldn't it be wonderful if you get this just get struck they say well we don't get the holy ghost like that and when we get it without sensation it always been that way every person from the new testament all the way up all of them got the holy ghost without sensation because in the soul there is no sensation there is no feeling and when the holy ghost down goes down to your soul and your soul right could recognize it it comes up through your spirit then your spirit catches it that's when you cry hallelujah [Applause] always been that wasn't you know brother branham just tried to tell us where the holy ghost needed to strike and in there there's no social no no but it's faith or unbelief but when that soul catches it and that thing is quicker come on he can't be a he can't be double-minded you know what i'm saying there's got to be an understanding of what he said he said because if you make him some uh emotional look what you make god do well then what did he do on the day of pentecost it always went back down to the place where the shekinah glory can dwell god help us jesus because some of y'all don't believe what i just said but nevertheless it's true look what that doctrine did to the message that's all i'm saying that's all i'm saying look what it did and look who the people who started that thing where are they they don't even believe the message that's all i'm saying i'm almost done he said if i do the works that's written to me then don't believe me that do good any man this message is one that's why today that they do not believe is in doing the works of god because they do not accept the message of god they don't believe the message to pentecostal and listen the way you say that you better be careful unless you blaspheme the holy ghost but those who believe in god hour i'm done that we live in these listen but those who believe god's hour that we're living in the the hidden food just think god has so hid in that they look right at it and don't see it see why god called noah for nazism building an ark his eyes were open to the word of god the promise the very thing that they call fanaticism save noah and his family see the very thing the thing that people is that right oh oh a boss if you want the holy ghost he said no i'll have it over here oh no no no the boss you can't get it over there you got to come get it over here now was the instructions wrong yeah was the instructions wrong oh we're living in another another age we don't get it like that that's why you ain't got it i know what i'm talking about and i know god told me to preach this message but i'm gonna tell you something we got to get down to business together some of y'all come to the altar oh lord i just hope i get it this time stay in your seat you got to come with a made up mind and you got to come with a mind that i don't care if i snot i don't care if i cry if he makes me roll all over the floor i don't care it's just after i do all that i want to make sure i got it and how you know when you do all that and got it because it's going to bring a change it's going to bring a change you love the lord lord let that shekinah glory abide in me let's stand i promise the sister i'll sing this song when we get out the way there ain't no bird gonna pop my place as long as i'm alive to glorify i praise his name there praise the lord [Music] somebody help me [Music] there ain't no tree gonna tap in my place it's all that i'm alive oh there ain't no tree is [Music] [Music] [Music] there ain't no rock foreign [Applause] somebody help me [Music] [Music] my oh yes [Music] hallelujah [Music] is [Music] i pray the lord oh baby pray this praises help me lift him up praise the lord [Music] glorified [Music] we gotta pray for that [Music]
