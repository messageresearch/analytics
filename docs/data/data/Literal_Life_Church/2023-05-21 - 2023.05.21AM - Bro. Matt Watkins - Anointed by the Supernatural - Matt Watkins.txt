just the earnest my goodness if that's just the down payment brother Paul what's it going to be like when I receive the fullness amen of my inheritance I'm looking forward to it but I want to say I'm glad that I can get a taste this morning amen just for a moment just to fill Heaven amen we'd walk through a world of weariness and dreeriness and suffering and pain my goodness I'm so thankful to

here amen at literal life and love this the the uh the ministry that you have here of music and Ministry and amen and just down through the many many years I was reminiscing with brother Paul last night took me on a little historic drive when we left and I preached at that original I guess it was the original Church uh there years and years ago and then again there in the building you were in last time and what a upgrade amen what a wonderful upgrade this is amen and I believe that with it you know it's one thing to have a nice building but I just believe Lord if you've increased this this way then I can say Lord increase this in your spirit increases in your presence Lord let it if that went up a notch then let our praise go up Lord amen let our worship go up he's worthy of it amen hallelujah well we're again just want to uh be obedient to the Lord this morning and what he have us to speak and so I'm going to minister to you this morning out of Joshua chapter four we got a lengthy reading and so I'll just get right to it also in second Kings chapter two amen I've ministered this thought of actually a few different parts and so when I ministered it maybe a way the lord always has a way to change me I don't honestly I beat straight up with you this morning I don't have any notes uh here before me and so just the Lord is just so impressed this upon my heart just a burden and you know I believe as brother Brandon talks about that the woman with the blood issue in the Bible who who needed to get to Jesus and brother Branham says something so amazing about that little woman with that issue and he says you know the father had shown Jesus Lazarus he had shown him jerice's daughter he had shown him and led him and Jesus was just obedient to the father's Direction and did you know brother Madam said but actually that little woman with that blood issue the father didn't show it that's why he says when she touched him who touched me brother Brandon says see she operated the gift that was in the Son of God and she with her need Drew out from the Lord Jesus what she needed so I believe if you're here Jesus is the same yesterday today and forever and maybe God has prepared me a certain direction but I believe that the pool of your heart if you've got a need this morning can take a Ministry God's put a gift in my life and can just move me out of the way and I could go down a channel that would even be in my mind here at this moment but I believe that's just how real the Lord Jesus is I believe that's just the hour that we're living in today friends you know the Bible the the devil is more evident and more manifest ever than he's ever been he's bold he's right out in the open he's not hiding hey in case you haven't read the news the devil is no longer hiding under a rock somewhere you know working subs and subtility and subliminally that's not what the devil's doing if ever before there was ever a time that you live in the devil is manifesting himself right out in the open as bold as he could ever be right in your face well I just happen to believe that if hell wants to manifest himself right out in the open I got to believe that heaven wants to manifest himself right out in the open brother Brennan says when all hell turns loose all Heaven lets loose and I say heaven let go this morning how many would say that and say Lord I Give You full Reign for preeminence amen this morning to do whatever whatever we have planned we'll put that aside and let the Holy Spirit move I believe when we really have that in our heart God can do something special amen Joshua chapter 4 we're going to speak to you this morning on anointed by the supernatural anointed by the Supernatural and we talked a lot last night about an anointing and so we just want to carry that over from last night and it came to pass when all the people were clean passed over Jordan that the Lord spake unto Joshua saying take you 12 men out of the people out of every tribe of man and command you them saying take you hence out of the midst of Jordan out of the place where the priest feet stood firm now notice what your Bible's saying here this is important it's where the priest feat stood not jellyfish not cowards not backing down under pressure but the Bible says we're the priest feat stood firm 12 Stones and you shall carry them over with you and leave them in the lodging place where you shall Lodge this night then Joshua called the 12 men whom he had prepared of the children of Israel out of every tribe of man Joshua said unto them pass over before the Ark of the Lord your God into the midst of Jordan now remember Jordan's going to represent two things the prophet of God said it represents sin and it represents death Jordan is going to represent death and so these these priests under that levitical priesthood would go into the water and they would Place their feet in the water and this is what Joshua says and take you up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder verse 5 according to the unto the number of the tribes of the children of Israel so 12 Stones they're going to take these stones and the Bible says that this may be a sign among you that when your children ask their fathers now anytime is a message believer you see children and fathers your mind ought to go to one place that behold I'll send you Elijah the prophet he didn't send him to everybody listen friends you can't convince a person who's not meant to see this message the message you can try you can persuade but Elijah was only sent to a certain specific group of people and so the Bible says he shall turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers and so Joshua's saying I want you to take these stones and I'm going to have you set this up as a memorial isn't it powerful that God would provision something now for something a need that would come up way down the road later on when children are born and children begin to ask their parents and say what do these Stones even mean Hallelujah and he says when your children shall ask their fathers in time to come saying what mean ye by these stones then you shall answer them that the Waters of Jordan were cut off before the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord when it passed over Jordan the Waters of Jordan were cut off and these Stones shall be for a memorial under the children of Israel forever Joshua verse 9 set up 12 Stones in the midst of Jordan in the place where the feet of the priests which bore the Ark of the Covenant stood and they are there unto this day meaning the day that it was written for the priest shall bear the ark for the priest which bore the ark stood I love that they stood they didn't waver the priests which bore the Ark of the Covenant listen these men were holding back death from the people's lives and when you're standing in a position to hold back or to protect or defend you've got to keep your feet firmly planted as God to Moses told Joshua don't waver Joshua don't look to the left or to the right until notice until everything was finished that the Lord commanded to Joshua to speak unto the people according to all that Moses commanded Joshua and the people passed over one more scripture and I'll have you be seated second Kings chapter 2 verse 1 and it came to pass when the Lord would take up Elijah into Heaven by a whirlwind that Elijah went with Elisha from gilgall and Elijah said unto Elisha Terry here I pray thee for the Lord hath sent me to Bethel and Elisha said unto him as the Lord liveth and as thy soul liveth I will not leave thee so they went down to Bethel verse 4 and Elijah said unto him Terry here I pray thee for the Lord hath sent me to Jericho and he said as the Lord liveth and is thy soul liveth I will not leave thee so they came to Jericho verse 6 and Elijah said unto him Terry I pray thee here for the Lord hath sent me to Jordan and he said as the Lord liveth and is thy soul liveth I will not leave thee and they too went on verse 8 and Elijah took his mantle and wrapped it together and smote the waters and they were divided hither and thither so that they too went over own dry ground and it came to pass when they were going over that Elijah said unto Elisha ask what I shall do for thee it's a powerful thing when the Lord Jesus asks his children ask what I shall do for thee in other words sister Hattie whatever you say right now whatever your whatever you speak sister Hattie whatever you say right now will be done unto you notice do you realize how powerful words are not just thoughts but words are thoughts expressed because when you speak words you're creating or disturbing the atmosphere that's around you that's why worship is so powerful that's why the preaching of the word comes by vocal cords and voice because you speak the word of God and that changes the atmosphere around you and brother Brandon said that when sister Hattie Wright spoke those words it felt like the room was about to come apart and he said whatever you say right now at this moment Elijah says to Elisha ask what I shall do for thee ask whatever you ask right now it'll be done before I be taken away from thee and Elisha said I pray thee let a double portion of thy Spirit be upon me and he said thou has asked a hard thing now it wasn't going to be hard for God as nothing is too hard for the Lord it wasn't going to be hard for Elijah he was leaving but the harder way would be for Elisha you've asked a hard thing nevertheless now notice this is powerful if thou see me when I am taken from thee it shall be so unto thee but if not it shall not be so do you realize that when you transliterate this verse this is literally what Elijah's saying to Elisha Elisha I'm about to leave the scene I'm about to go home and if when I leave if you see me gone in other words if you see me taken if you see me as taken from you in other words you can't see me and still want me to be here and still only see Elijah but if you see Elijah that Elijah is gone he's went on to his reward if you see me that I'm taken from you but yet Elisha there's still a work for you to do there's still a commission for the bride to do there's still a position you've got to come to you can't see Elijah anymore you got to stop looking at Elijah because the focus has now changed to not the prophet but his prophecy I believe there's Believers here amen and he says he says if you see me when I go notice this here if you see me uh verse 10. and it shall be so but if not it shall not be so and it came to passes they still went on and talked that behold they're repaired a chariot of fire and Horses of fire and parted them both asunder and Elijah went up by a whirlwind unto heaven and Elisha saw it and cried my father Elijah saw it and said my father my father The Chariot and of Israel and the horsemen thereof and he saw him no more and he took hold of his own clothes and he rent them into two pieces and he took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and went back and stood by the bank of Jordan and he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and smote the waters and said notice not where's Elijah but where's the god of Elijah Heavenly Father Lord we just right now we bow Lord before you all one one and all Lord we're all equal all Lord at the foot of the cross Lord right now God In This Moment I just so need you to come Lord Jesus father I've watched you time and time and time again Lord when I've preached this message Lord I've watched a special thing take place Lord and I believe that same God who's shown up time and time again when we begin to speak about you your Prophet said then you come near Lord and I believe Lord that the healing angels in this building right now Lord I pray that you would break the spirit of resistance Lord at this moment god father may you break the callous may you break the heart and Heart Lord so that fertile ground would be able to receive your word we ask Lord I pray God you know that I'm nothing and within me Lord is no good thing Lord and I need your grace right now to come and take preeminence Lord we Just Surrender ourselves our vessel Lord to you Grant it now Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen amen you can be seated foreign God is going to be take Elijah home and his ministry has came to an end Elijah knows this he knows that his days were coming that you take some on this journey and even before he goes on this journey with Elijah with Elisha Elijah already knew that the Lord was going to take him home and it's going to be a very difficult thing for Elisha it's going to be a very hard thing for Elisha because no doubt through the times of his life and through watching the ministry of Elijah he was no doubt just in awe and enamored by the ministry of this man and the Miracles and the the signs and the Wonders and just the way that God had chosen to use this man in such a powerful way and you can survey his entire life and throughout his the course of his life God had shown up in such Supernatural ways but now his life was ending and the dispensation you could say was changing and there was a changing of the Garb or the passing of on and so this moment was a very important moment in the life of Elisha it was the beginning of something new and the ending of something previous you know the Bible speaks about the death of the testator and you could read that in the book of Hebrews that how that a will or a covenant can't go into effect until the death of one and then something else begins I think it's a powerful principle in our life that many times God has something that he's wanting to release or something that he's wanting to give or pour out upon a person but until there comes a separation or a death of one thing the new thing can never come into effect no matter how much God wills it or God wants it you can even take it down to relationships that and it would be a could you could type it down to any place or any spot in your life that many times some of the things God's wanting to give us he is bound by a covenant or a will that there must be the death of one thing an order for something else to begin and you know no one likes change nobody here around us all of us are creatures we love the same thing we love our children to say the same size and the same age and the same face and the same smile and we hate things that change I'm not the only one am I here today but we hate change but you know God's always a god of change he's always a God on the Move growth is natural it's the way that God matures anything is through seasons and of change but there must be the death of one and nothing can be held on to the previous an order for the new to take effect and so Elijah knows this this is the last few moments of his life this is your reading some of the last things that he will say you're reading some of the last moments that Elijah has you say brother Matt do you believe that Elijah knew he was going I believe that he did I believe even our Prophet God's Prophet knew that his days were numbered and and you can read some of the last things that he's saying here and some of the last moments this is some of the the last experiences he takes him through these three cities of gilgallon and Jericho and Bethel and these are three powerful cities if you study your Bible for Israel this was always significance these cities drew some type of significance they were significant in Elijah's Ministry they were going to be significant and Elisha's and so you're reading some of the last few things some of the last words some of the last things he wants to convey and it's it's so important it's it's so it's so Paramount to Elijah that he passes off the right Reflections the right the right thoughts the right perspective the the to set his course in the right direction it's going to be important some of the last words that he he's going to speak you could read some of the last words of Mighty Men of God in the Bible you can read the last words of Jacob as he begins to tell his children don't leave my bones in in Egypt but take them to Canaan to the promised land you could read some of the last words of Joseph you go on your Bible and read some of the last words of David that David's on his deathbed and he's mentioning some of the last things to his son I've been scouring just over months now just what were some of the last words over some of the last thoughts upon God's Prophet before he left the scene what was some of the last things that he wanted to convey what was some of the last burdens that was upon his heart you see the last some of the last moments or the last reflections of that individual's life can have a great imprint upon the generation that's raising up they can have a great impact on the expectation that is set upon the new generation and depending on the depending on the the the the moments of that man's life well have a great impact at what the next generation is looking for what they're reaching for what they're striving for what they're running for it sets their course and so Elijah takes Elisha through these cities now these cities were amazing because in Elijah's life Jericho was a city that you could say was in Revival it was under great expectation even Bethel we read about it last night you can read about it at first when Jacob dreams a dream and sees Angels coming from heaven and ascending and descending and bethel's a powerful City even under the ministry of of Elijah it's a city you could say that was on Revival it was it was under expectation and God did many mighty Works in this city even gilgall but this is going to be a very specific Journey that Elijah takes Elisha through and he's passing through as he's this old Prophet is coming to the end of his days and he's pondering maybe his life it's pondering all of the journey pondering all of the as we spoke on last night all of the highs and all of the lows and all of the journey that God had led him through and he's coming to ponder this last few moments imagine the burden that was upon Elijah knowing that the work was far from over knowing that the Battlegrounds and territories that have been gained yet even after he leaves he knows that the course and effect of life that there's still more ground to gain there's still more battles to win that we haven't fully taken our inheritance and we haven't fully came to the position that that was in the back part of God's mind he even knows this that there's there's still so much work left to do and so he begins to take him as we said on this journey through these towns of Jericho and Bethel and he brings Elisha with him and they set out on this journey and and at each stop after they visit the town they arrive at the bank of Jordan Elijah takes off his mantle this is just a robe it's a wide loose cloth it's a it's a a garment that he's wearing now I want to say to you today that there was nothing in particular about the mantle that was special it wasn't the stitching wasn't the type of clothing it wasn't even the material that it was made out of but within that mantle it was drenched with an anointing from Jehovah and within that mantle though there was nothing peculiar about the outside of it nothing special in fact most likely it was something very simple and maybe unremarkable to anybody else but Elisha knew that within that mantle was The Inheritance or the promise of blessing of Jehovah and so he takes off this mantle and the Bible says that he smites the waters and supernaturally Jordan parts and they walk over on dry ground now this was a special experience for Elisha to experience something also years before that we read about in Joshua that Joshua was at the Jordan River and they're going to part the Jordan River and now that powerful moment of The God Who Parks Waters has been passed from one generation to the Next Generation to the Next Generation notice not everything was passed down but some of the most important things for the people to understand that God is a God who Parts your Jordan God is a God who moves back death who can remove Sin from your life and David said we will not hide these things from our children but we will tell them another generation and another generation about the powerful works of God you can't tell them everything you can't pass it all down you can't give them all of your wisdom and all of your understanding but you can pass down a supernatural God who's never the never changing he's always the same and you can say to your children the same God that has been faithful to me all the days of my life will be remain faithful to you in your life if you'll serve him all the days of your life and so he passes this down as they walk through Jordan and all the prophets the school of the of the prophets the prophet killed there the Bible calls it the school of the prophets watch this great event take place and he smites the waters and Jordan Parks and it's a powerful thing as he comes through these this place and he comes and he says ask what I shall do for thee before I be taken from thee there's no hesitation at all there's no contemplating there's no measuring there's no trying to figure it out that Elisha just gives a very simple answer and he says I pray thee let a double portion of thy Spirit be upon me all right now what's so powerful about Bethel and Jericho as we said is in the Days of Elijah when he's starting out his ministry and he's he's going through and there's Mighty Miracles Bethel was a town that was rejoicing was in Revival and Jericho was very much the same they were on fire you could say with God and great Revival fires burning him and Elijah's Ministries there and everyone wants to see the power of God and and they're in his meetings and there's great crowds and Great Gatherings of people and and great expectation and and everyone's there under the ministry and is just accepting him and invited him to his churches and invited him to his meetings and wanting to be part of the revivals and wanted to get a picture with him and wanting to put him in the newspaper and make their announcements and but oh how so different these same exact cities were at the end of Elijah's Ministry in contrast to the beginning of his ministry now these cities are in fact so backslidden that they're mocking God's prophet that they're mocking and mockering an entire generation has risen up that is literally mocking The Works of God in this man's life and so much that Bethel is so backslidden and Jericho's such a sinful City and Jericho is so bad that Elijah says come on Elijah stay here why don't you plant a garden and build a home and put your children here and raise a family come on Elisha you'd make a good pastor to these people you'd make a good man and Elijah says no as the Lord God liveth as my soul liveth I'm staying right here beside Elijah I'm not going to depart from him I'm not going to remove from him I've made my decision I've made my choice I want to stay with the anointed mantle of God I want to stay with the presence of God there's only one Elijah that can turn my heart back and now the city that is so was so accepted of him before oh how very different when Elijah comes to his real Ministry and then suddenly he comes to the desert and he says you know I never wanted to start a church here in Tucson I actually just wanted to be part of your fellowship and I come to those meetings and brother Brandon goes to that men's bible breakfast there and the Full Gospel businessman and the man from the Assemblies of God has put it on and there's a presbyterian man there there's a Catholic priest sitting there and brother Brandon Gets behind that microphone and says you know I never wanted to start up a church here and I never wanted to break up any kind of Fellowship but I sat here in the desert for three years and you never invited me to your pulpits you never invited me to your churches you you never invited my Ministry what was it friends you know when he was coming to his real Ministry there was great rejection of that Ministry everyone can receive the fishes and Loaves and the Miracles oh listen friends let me just preacher for a moment everybody loves the spectacular everybody loves the blessings of God everybody loves a good feeling everybody loves a good Miracle a good circus a good show that you can show oh but when it comes to the word they'll always show their true colors when it comes to the word as the Bible says when Jesus began to speak and he would say unless you eat the Flesh and drink the blood of the son of man you have no part and even the disciples said this is a hard saying who can bear it this is a hard thing who can bear it and you know what the disciples are saying that and suddenly a hundred and some people get up and leave the room and the only people sitting there you imagine a view if everybody in the church leaves the church and it's you and 12 11 other people and then the pastor looks at you and says what are you doing here won't you go also oh Lord do who would we go and so powerful to me that this same Nation who was accepting of the word of God who was pulling on the word of God who wanted Revival in their churches who wanted the power of God to move who wanted the who wanted the ministry of Elijah now when he comes to his real Ministry and now when the word is being preached that the word divides asunder and suddenly they're going you know what I don't know about this guy and I'm just not so sure about this and you know I I I don't know really what that was I can't speak to to what that was yesterday but all I know today is that's just a little bit too hard for me and so even even this man in his life that there's great acceptance there's great there's great uh uh uh attraction but now he comes to this last stage of his life and some of the last Journeys and these are some of the last words that he's going to speak to Elijah before he crosses Jordan and Jordan's going to represent death to the to the to all of Israel it's going to represent sin it's amazing because you even go before this and you imagine here's Joshua standing there ready to cross over Jordan and and and God brings him to this place and and God tells him he says I want you to take uh the priests these are levitical priests you know God had chose these men specifically God didn't have this responsibility neither did Reuben or Manasseh or Simeon but God had chosen the levitical priesthood to Bear a certain responsibility that no one else would have to bear that no one else would ever have to go through listen to me friends your pastor in the ministry goes through things that you may never understand and God will take them through certain Journeys and to go through certain things and certain battles that they have to face that maybe you don't have a clue or could never relate with but their commissioned and anointed of God to stand in that place for your life I want to notice you to notice something so powerful about this Crossing of Jordan as God says I want you to take 12 men and I want these to be priests and he says that out of every tribe a man I want you to take from the children of Israel and so God brings up these Levites and here's a man and here's another man the Bible says it this way that when they put their feet in the water Jordan Will part now notice friends not before not when they thought it not when God told them that was Jordan ready to part but it looked just like the Jordan that was always there and so that but the Bible says when they put their feet in the water oh so you mean sometimes you have to do something naturally and order for there to be a supernatural consequence sometimes God's expecting you to do something in order for him to listen to me friends sometimes what you bind in heaven will also be bound in Earth sometimes what you loose in heaven will also be loosed in Earth sometimes you've got to speak it Hattie sometimes you've got to speak the word because when you speak that changes the atmosphere around you and you might have doubt and destruction and discouragement all around you but just start to whisper the word of God start this speak the name of Jesus and watch what happens to your atmosphere and so God says I want you to take 12 men and so he takes all of these men and he puts their feet in the water command brother Paul I want you to use you and brother Brandon if you could just hear for a moment in the ministry any other ministering Brothers if you just come here just for an illustration here for a moment and I want you to notice that God says as these men take if you could face brother Paul as these men come any other brothers here Ministry brothers would come this come if you could have not we just got two and that's fine Brother Gideon come on maybe one more brother just stand here brother get him beside on this side of your dad and stand there now this is what God instructs Joshua to do he says I want you to take 12 men out of the priests now not just out of everybody but this is the levitical order that God has placed this burden in their heart and notice behind each man out of these 12 men is going to represent a stone you notice when Aaron wore that breastplate and inside that urim and thumbum there were 12 Stones the Sardis and topaz and carbuncle and the Ruben and the Jasper and all of those stones that he wore on his breastplate was actually representing a tribe because behind that Sardis and behind that topaz was an entire tribe of God and the entire tribe of Reuben and so on the day of Yom kompur the day of atonement when that air in the high priest would come into the holiest of holies he was bearing the burdens of all of the people you say why is that powerful brother Matt because within that tribe was a family and within that family was a mother and there was a father and there was sometimes sickness and there was sometimes disease there were sometimes financial problems and issues with children and the issues in homes and real life problems come on somebody we got real life problems sometimes we can be very real and so he would he would represent all of those families and so behind each priest was a stone that represented a certain family oh I'm so glad that when Aaron went behind there listened friends he was carrying all the burdens of the people upon his heart and when Jesus went to the Cross he was representing every one of his children upon his heart that meant all of my needs and all of my troubles and all of my struggles because all of the burdens were upon the heart of the priest and God says I want you to put your feet in death and you're going to stand in a place that no one else has to stand but here's what's important stand here's what's important hold your ground here's what's important cat and Simeon here all of these priests are gonna that they're depending upon you they're depending upon the priest to keep their feet in the water and God says I want you and as they put their foot in the water a little bit of Jordan parts and they put their next foot in the water and a little bit more of Jordan Parks and they put their next foot in the water and it's scary and it's it's Troublesome but as they put their foot in Jordan the water begins to part and before you know it there's a highway from this Bank all the way to the other bank and God says I want the priest to keep their feet and he says and I want you to to stand and keep your feet there so you're standing firm and all of the families with all of their little ones and all of their young ones are to pass through the priests and you say how long are the priests going to stand there until the work is finished I said until the work is finished they're going to keep their feet in the water listen to me friends I hope you catch it here today I ask you what's keeping Jordan out of your life what's keeping sin out of our families what's keeping the devil this lady is seeing lukewarm age with all of its standards changing and trying to redefine everything I asked you what keeps Jordan out of your home out of your young people out of your minds out of your children out of your body's out of your spirits what's holding back the devil out of our churches and our families do you realize what would happen if we took preachers out of the pulpit and stop preaching and stop preaching the word of God do you realize what's holding back the tidal wave of sin do we have a church here today that would say preach the word preach it straight brother Paul preaching shade Brothers give me the unadulterated word of God don't compromise don't die I don't care about my feelings don't listen to me friends you don't want to know the sign of a false prophet is he'll tell you everything you want to hear and everything that makes you feel good you want to know what the sign of a true Prophet is a man who doesn't care about your feelings he's lost his reputation he doesn't care if it hurts you and I say you've got a church here they don't say preach me the word of God tell it to me straight brother Paul preach it to me preach preacher the word of God unadulterated word of God give these brothers a hand clap this morning he says I want you to take 12 Stones now out of the place where the priest feet stood firm not just any stone Joshua his right foot was here and his left foot was here out of the place where they stood and he places one and then he places another and then he places another and before you know it there's a memorial of stones of everywhere the priest feet stood firm you say brother Matt why couldn't it be any stone it couldn't just be any stone because these Stones were going to represent truths that would turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers that's why the prophet of God said it with a messenger of Malachi 4 will do two things he'll reveal the Thunders the the seven Thunders which are the Mysteries contained within the Seven Seals and it will be these Mysteries these mystery Divine mystery truths that will literally turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the of the original Pentecostal fathers and listen to me friends unless your heart has been turned back I don't care what experience you've had I don't care what intellect you've had I don't care how much you've studied how much you've read how much you've spoken tongues how much you've danced in the spirit it will be these mystery truths that will literally turn your heart back I think oftentimes the problem we have is people's hearts have never really been turned back they might have been turned back to a story or to an example or a good uh uh you know a good hunting or fishing story and I'm grateful for them I love all of them but unless your hearts turned back to the original faith your body will eventually follow where your heart is I want you to take notice this here as they walk along and he says you've got to see Elijah as gone Elisha you've got to realize that Elisha's away notice what brother Brandon begins to say here in this message why Christ speak you know so many times I went over this message and I don't normally do this but I listen to this tape probably my goodness over 30 times over and over and over and over and just wrote something different each time I heard it and the Holy Spirit was just dealing with my heart so personally and you know I thought of so many times as brother Brandon begins to say this here notice what he says may the Holy Spirit teach us today the things that we ought to know I got this here thank you May the Holy Spirit teach us today the things that we ought to know and may we then in return listen closely to every word and to weigh it deeply and then made those who are listening by the way of tape may they listen close and may we be able to catch what the holy spirit is trying to reveal to us you know I thought about this how many times I would hear Brother Branham over and over on tape and he would come to a crescendo he'd come to a moment and he would say now don't miss it don't miss it in other words you can miss it in other words you can miss what God's doing you can watch what's taking place and completely miss it may you listen close may you be in tune you know what this tells me the holy spirit is always trying to speak to you listen to me friends he's not just trying to speak to you uh you know here in church but all through the day all through your week all through the morning all through the evening the Holy Ghost has something he wants to say to you and I say God don't let me miss it this morning don't let me be distracted God I want to catch what the Holy Ghost is trying to say for we realize if he should anoint us then the anointing is not in vain that it might work to the good to the Lord we spoke on it last night what is an anointing it's the smearing or rubbing it's this transfer I almost preached this morning entitled this message the transfer of anointing because it was so important that what Elijah had Elisha caught there must of necessity been a passing on now they wasn't going to replace Elijah he wasn't going to replace his ministry it wasn't going to redo everything that Elijah did God had more work and a commission for Elisha to fulfill and he must recognize what the Holy Spirit was trying to do in his life may we be able to catch it Lord for we realize if he should anoint us then the anointing what is that anointing as we spoke last night it's a purpose that God has it must be passed down it's not a funny feeling the charismatics use it as a word like a catchphrase and a catch word of just an anointing an anointing of the Holy Ghost and a great feeling I love great feelings I love I love when the Holy Ghost comes on my flesh I don't hardly know how anybody would ever criticize speaking in tongues it is one of the most powerful real Supernatural experiences I ever experienced in my life and every time I speak in tongues I thank God how could anybody ever criticize that is the closest thing I've ever came to heaven in my body that is but you let me say something friends an anointing is not just a feeling that you feel but it's a transfer of a promise it's a transfer don't you know what David says in the Psalms and he says I how beautiful it is for Brethren to dwell in together and unity it's like the anointing oil that flowed from Aaron's head down to his beard down his garments down onto the ground what was it that oil wasn't just going to stay on the head ship but it had to pass down to the urine which represented all of the families all friends the anointing of this hour isn't just for preachers it isn't just for teachers it's for the whole body to come under the same anointing I say God anoint our young people anoint-time musicians anoint our deacons anoint our laity anoint our mothers and our fathers our teenagers oh God let this anointing flow from the head all the way down through the this message is not a preacher's Revival hello somebody it's not an American Revival either it's a global move of the Holy Ghost and I just say I'm so glad to be a part of the anointing of the hour and what's God doing and I say God let me play My Position let me play my part oh God don't let me look to the left or to the right let me keep my feet firmly planted in Jordan let me catch it Lord and may our hearts and understanding be open Lord and he knows notice this here and he knows I love this how to do these things how to deal with man he knows what's in man you might think you know everything there is to know about you but only God knows everything inside of you you say how because he's the one who put it there and you may think I'm nothing and I'm nobody and I'll never be anything but listen to me friends if God planted something inside of you he takes a nobody and makes him a snow he takes a nobody makes him a somebody in Christ Jesus when you surrender and yield Your Vessel to the Holy Spirit only he knows what's in man you don't he knows him we only know from the intellectual side he knows what's really in the man Moses was born in this world and a gifted boy he was born to be a prophet a deliverer he was born with the equipment Hallelujah he was born with the equipment in him as every man that comes into the world is born with this equipment it's already in you we spend so much time looking for our answers externally when it's already right here inside of the seed that God has placed in you before the foundation of the world quit looking for your answers outside the answer lays in the seed do you realize that friends the answer lays in the seed show us the father it'll suffice us brother Brandon says everything that you have need of in this life's journey is already in the seat of God even the Rapture is down inside of the believer right now all it takes is an atmosphere of the Holy Ghost to anoint what God already placed in you great it's already there you don't need to try to pop it up you don't need to pump it up it's already there brother Benham says it was already inside of him he really knows what's in the boy Moses born and then he was afterwards he was brought to the place where he was anointed and notice the seed laying there with an intellectual conception with all the faith he was born to deliver this people yet it never came to life all of it down inside of him yet it never came to life until that light from the burning bush Ed burned burning bush flashed across it I love this until he's seen with his eyes until he seen not something he read about but something he's seen with his eyes something that spoke to him and he spoke back to it I say God give us that kind of experience in the Holy Spirit to where we have something we speak to and it speaks back to us something we commune with and it communes back to us not just a dead letter not just a story from yesterday but a real reality of the Lord Jesus made personal to you it's already inside of him listen to me friends if you could give the Holy Ghost to your children I promise you would if I had a big red button here and that bread butt when you pushed it was to give your children the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'd like to say we'd have a stampede a literal Life Church and everybody wouldn't want to be mashing and pushing that button if you could give them the baptism of the Holy Spirit you would I promise but God doesn't give you that opportunity God doesn't give you that power you say then what power do I have to do to fight the devil with bring them to church Freedom the word of God play the word of God create the right atmosphere and then put your faith in a seed that God has placed inside of their heart and when the anointed word of God flashes across that seed no devil in hell can stop it from coming forth in Jesus will say Lazarus come forth and they'll come up out of that grave I say it doesn't matter I don't even care if they're not in this service this morning you put your faith in a seed of God that God put before the foundation of the world and say God that's my promise that's my inheritance I'm going to stand on the word of God thank you I think any man or woman or boy or girl with an intellectual conception what they think the word is and so forth can never have a full Foundation stand until they have met that light that light that's in that picture of the pillar of fire it's a wonderful thing to have in your home it's much more wonderful when it actually goes into the hearts of your family and then it becomes their reality then it becomes their word then it becomes their Revival then it becomes their message and he says now hundreds and hundreds of years before God had said that Israel would sojourn and be mistreated in a strange country and would stay there 400 years but God with a mighty hand would bring them out so you see with this Burning Bush just as we know is a man asked me a few moments ago about the coming and the Rapture now listen all he says this and we know we've lived the time out how many would say that's true it's got to be more true today than it ever was in 1963 we've lived the time out and we're notice the time of the Rapture is at hand and we're looking for a rapturing faith who was looking for a Rapture in faith brother Branham was looking for a Rapture and faith that can pull the church together give it some intellectual faith intellectual strength more understanding more more more you know more to do more missions work more to give more to gain no to give it some Supernatural strength I can change these bodies that we live in my body just said hey man that can give my body some Supernatural strength what was God's Prophet looking for rapturing Faith something that would take these bodies and change them back to young bodies again when we see a God that can raise the dead off the floor are out in the yard and bring him back to life again when we see a God who can raise the Dead and bring him back to life again when we see a God and present him before us when we see God who can take a cancer that's ate a man to a shadow and raise him up to a strong healthy man that what brother banham that ought to give us that ought to give Rapture in faith do you realize what he's saying here in other words he takes a man who is dead you tell me what is natural about a man who's dead that comes back to life and starts breathing again tell me what part of that dead man brought him back to life that he did himself hello somebody tell me a man who's eight with cancer tell me a man who's dead and tell me what part what effort what work what labor what works did they do to bring them back to to life again I tell you the same Grace that saves you and it's free and apart from anything that you've ever done is the same Grace that'll change your body one day it has to be something completely apart from me when we see a God who raises a man from the dead who takes a man who had cancer ate his body up to a shadow and can raise him up to a strong healthy man that ought to give rapturing Faith to the people you know we just had that happen I know that Supernatural things are taking place everywhere and if you're not baby if you're not privy to it I just want to tell you some of this testimony here today that even back home we just had something very Supernatural take place just a few months ago and and a very good friend of mine and many of you some of you may know him brother Travis Jackson is just my my closest buddy God gives you good friends in life and I'm thankful for good Godly friends brother Travis years and years before uh we had met him even as a young man he was he was searching for the the truth and he would he would even as a young 14 13 14 year old boy would read his Bible and he would pray at night and even though his parents didn't know that and his mom and dad were raised in the Beaufort Baptist church and they they his dad was a deacon there at the Beaufort Baptist Church and good Godly Parents and good godly people raised in a very good home but his parents had became disillusioned as they would brother Donald would say to go to church and and the preacher would preach on the cross and then preach on repentance and preach on salvation and he says then you know somewhere in the middle of the sermon the deacons would take a breath smoke break outside and smoke a pack of cigarettes and just talk about things and they just messed with Donald's mind so much and he said I didn't I don't understand this is this is this has got to be wrong how can this be normal how could this be the the Church of the Living God go home that night and they would go to restaurants and someone would have a drink here and a drink there social drinking and it just he got so disillusioned and he completely left the church and and went home and just stayed at home and and didn't even know his children his children Travis at that time too young I didn't even know whether you know they even knew anything about the Lord accepted what they had taught them and and you know Travis is just going through his he just begins to get such a hunger and such a thirst for God and he would just read the book of Acts and he'd read through Poe's letters in the New Testament Church and he'd go to church and he'd go to his youth leader and he'd go to the local churches there in Beaufort and even at 17 years old he was sitting down with the youth pastor of a church there we have and he'd say now you know after the youth meeting said I just want to ask you you know I read about the supernatural God in the Bible that he's a God that that healed the sick and raised the dead and I read about Peter a silver you know a Peter and he would say Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have unto you and then he said where's this God that we read about in the Bible and this this God of the Apostles that was moving and acting and there was Miracles and signs and wonders and I read about a real Risen Savior in their life and and the youth pastor said brother Travis He said you know that's wonderful things you you realize you see in the Bible and that's just something God did special for the church that God who had sun dry time spoke to the prophets and through the law is now again spoken in the last days through his son and and everything that Jesus wanted to say that we have it written in the Canon of the Bible and there's nothing else that we need and we all we need is the Bible and we don't need any of those kind all those things God only did and you know Travis those Miracles that you see that they don't happen like they did in the book of Acts and so he left that church he said that just didn't sound right he moved from that church and went to another church and he went to the pastor actually of that church pastor pretty much told him the same exact thing and he moves from there and goes to the mega church we have there are non-denominational Evangelical Church and he goes to the pastor Dallas Thea Theological Seminary train and he asked him the same question pulls out his Bible says where's the God we read about in the Bible that's a supernatural God you're wonderful people and you love the Lord I believe you're real Christians but why don't we see some of these things that God said in the Book of Joel I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and daughters will prophesy on your old mental dream dreams and your own mental dreams visions and we we see the book of Acts and the Bible says Jesus is the same yesterday today and forever you know that Pastor told him is a good man he told him well Travis that you have to understand and this was his exact words the apostolic age is over and the days of Miracles are passed now where have we heard that from isn't that exactly what they tried to tell brother Brandon you see if you if he's never been revealed to you personally you have one or two options you either explain it away or repent of it and say God give it to me I don't know why you haven't revealed you have one or two choices and pride will always take a man away further away from the word of God and he would say the same exact thing so I'd go from that church and go to another church and go to another church he was a church Hopper they finally came to one Church very last church he comes to is a Vineyard Church and it's they call it that it's a cool church and you just dress however you want and it's good people good good godly people there that love the Lord love their Bible and and he would go to that same Pastor there and and he's and he's searching for something he's looking for something he can't he can't find it even as a young man and and just you know maybe a month or two after that he goes to his mom's mom's claws on his phone with books and with some religious books he begins to read them and read them and he's pulling them off the shelf and he pulls a book off the shelf that didn't have a spine uh there and the book was tattered and they didn't have all the pages and was a little bit incomplete and he pulls it off the shelf and he takes it to his room and the book is called the acts of the prophet written by Perry green so he starts reading this book and he says oh my now here's a man this is a man who had the power of God in his life this is what I've been looking for my whole life he goes to his mom he said Mom where'd you get this book she looks at the bug looks at the sponge says I don't have a clue where I told to this day they don't know how in the world the book got there amongst many many other books don't know anything about the book so but she's so intrigued by it she takes that book to her work she's a secretary at a plumbing business at there at the front office and she's reading this book and reading through the acts of the prophet and then a man from our church comes to there and he happens to stop in the office and he looks at the secretary reading this book the acts of the prophet and he says ma'am can I ask you where'd you get that book and she said well uh uh I don't my son found it uh you know it's called the action he says yeah I know I know the book of Eric familiar she said really he said yeah my son found it in open my closet I don't we don't know how it got there but boy he sure does love it he said okay I'm gonna bring you something else back and he brings him he brings with the supernatural oh and jerkerson Supernatural books and he says if he liked that he's really gonna like this book so brother Travis begins to read it now whatever part he had it didn't have all of the books but he begins to read about this life of brother Burnham and you know brother Travis in his testimony if he was here today it's just a just a wonderful testimony that's been this has been maybe 15 years ago today and you say where's brother Travis's Faith at today well if it was a raging fire then now it's a burning flaming nuclear Inferno you won't be around Travis for more than five minutes and you're going to hear about the Lord and you're going to hear about Jesus and you're going to hear about a god who's the same yesterday today and forever he never lost his praise never lost his passion and he and he goes and he and he his mom he starts reading these books so brother Travis starts to ask everybody he sees and that doesn't matter who you are it doesn't matter if you're a customer an employee a worker a bus a church he asks everybody hey have you ever heard of a man named William Branham no I've never you've never heard of okay he's asking everybody have you ever heard of William Branham now to Travis he didn't even know brother Bynum had passed away and he's asking everybody have you ever heard of this man named William Branham have you ever no never heard well just so just so happens you know some of those just so happens moments just so happens he's put in a work van at the company he was working with of a man a backslid and believer who is living living in sin had followed fell away from the Lord many years before had it heard from this man we hadn't heard from him in years his life just went into real some real Troubled Waters and real chaos and went through divorce and just really really really troubled in him and he made a decision and it just led to such Calamity in his life and he's here this backslidden man is in the van with brother Travis and and we didn't even know if this man was still around but here's by the travesties there in the van and he said and he comes to talk to this man he's talking to him they start talking about the Lord and Travis just says hey uh Dave have you ever heard of a man named William Branham hmm talked to Dave Dave said every hair on my head and his body doesn't have many was standing straight up and he said have you ever heard of him and he said yeah Travis said you have he said yeah I actually have he said you're the first person I've talked to what do you mean he says yeah he says actually there's a church in Beaufort that believes he was a you know seventh Church age messenger and and drive seven Church age messenger eye he says well they believe he was a prophet Travis says of course he was a prophet I mean come on he says of course it was yeah he says he says well they actually believed that he was a prophet and that you know he was the Gentile Prophet to the you know the the the the seventh Church Age and and then he had Elijah anointed on him that he would turn the hearts Travis is here and all this and taking the line he says where's this church at he says well it's a beautiful he says beautiful I'm from Beaufort they were 30 minutes away in a sister city there and he said my goodness really that night I get a phone call I hadn't heard from this man in years I get a phone call out of the blue hello and he says Matt brother Matt I said hey brother how are you doing my goodness it's been so long he says well I'm not I'm not doing good he says I just got to be honest I'm not he says I got a man he says I need your help to right now he says I had a man in my to completely worldly guy in my truck today and and he asked me if I ever heard of William Branham and he said I got to be honest with you he said I'm in no condition at all to tell him anything and he says I really need you to come and and you know and speak to him he says there anyway you know you'd get together he's wanting to get together to my house for dinner tonight would you come and meet with him and I said sure and so I went with me and my brother and there's another brother there from Edmonton who happened to be visited in town and so I didn't know what to expect we go to that house for dinner and we knock on the door and brother Travis if he was to tell his testimony today he would he would say that as we knocked on the door and brother Travis says as he sat there and he says and when the doorbell rang and he says and you open they opened the door and he says and you three walked in he said a voice spoke and said behold men of the Lord Men full of the Holy Ghost and brother Travis said I realized at that moment this is what I was looking for my entire life I had to walk through the door and we begin I don't have time to tell this whole testimony you'd have to have him tell it very wonderful beautiful testimony but we went with him to a coffee shop and we start sharing with him and witnessing to him and literally brother Travis know when he finds out where our church was at it was only about 200 yards from the house he had grown up in the house he was then living in his entire life he said you mean what I was looking for from the day I was 16 was only 200 yards down the road oh friends sometimes what you're looking for is not way down the road it's right in front of you Hallelujah years go by and we we come to this years later tend to Joe however many years has been 15 years later and I'm scheduled to minister that Sunday and brother Travis we get a text to all the brothers in the church and said brothers and and he says I've gotta gotta urgent prayer request so I called brother Travis the only brother in town that weekend and I said what's going on he said well he said you remember the man you had met Marcus and this is a man I had met at a game basketball game uh years maybe not years but months before that and it had met him there and he and he'd introduced me to him as a place you know the place where my son was at and and I'm meeting this man as a strong healthy man just full of life you know just strong man and wonderful brother said brother man he said this is Marcus Humphrey he said he's the associate he's a wonderful man he's the associate pastor of The Vineyard Church the last church I went to before I came to the message and he said he's a wonder I said I have always had a burden for him and he said would you you would you meet him I said yeah I'd love to medium so I shake his hand and I greet him and just a real wonderful man wonderful spirit and so I introduced myself to him and we go from there and so here we come and three months later and Travis says you remember that man I said yes I do I said I do remember that man he said well I just got a horrible phone call from his wife Mary and he said Mary told me that Marcus has stage four Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cancer and he's the doctors have completely given up on Hillman and and and he's in an urgent need he said would you could we go and lay hands for him and pray for him that God will miraculously heal him and I said absolutely brother Travis I'll I'll go when do you want to go and this was Saturday he said I want to go today and I said okay you make the arrangement and I'll go just so happens just so happens I was studying the book I think it's 1949 what cancer is you ever read the book it's parentheses it's called healing and I had been studying that my entire message was drawn around that and so I I was able just to take everything that I'd been studying and and I go there already you know they're on the way with Travis and I me and Travis are just talking I said well you know brother Travis God's a god of miraculous we know that he's a supernatural God and we don't really know what we're coming into but let's go in there so we go into this man's house and we knock on the door and his wife comes to the door and we go up the stairs lead it into his home there and just a wonderful uh uh uh man and woman there and there's another family from his church a trustee and she had lost her son to brain cancer when he was 13 that woman did and so she's a real Advocate there and there and you could walk into the room and you could immediately just feel there's Marcus sitting there and here's this man that I had seen that was so healthy and so strong and and now he's just so weak and he's and he's and he's just it you can tell his entire life had been sapped away from him and and he and he and he was you know just his entire just didn't even look the same and he had a tumor about the size of a grapefruit on his neck and uh maybe you could advance to that slide 15 if you can do that and just click to it if you could and Marcus is sitting there and he's and he's just got a tumor about the size of a grapefruit on his neck and there he is just sitting there and and it just was so terrible and and he's there he is on his living room chair and the next picture there if you go to the next slide you can tell just the cancer in his body and you can feel the atmosphere when we've walked in that room it was just an atmosphere of death you know he had completely given up on himself and couldn't have any faith for himself at all we started testifying you know later on in that testimony start testifying and I started testifying about a little woman who was diagnosed slide 10 with the same exact disease and I testified to his wife about little sister Elena butts and I began to tell them I said you know I have a friend also who was diagnosed with the same exact thing stage four Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and the doctors had completely given up on the sister and and she was dying they said diagnosed with the same exact disease I said yes and she was diagnosed with the same exact trouble had been given up on him you know I thought it was so powerful I begin just to read the testimony even myself not fully knowing it and I went back to the sisters of post that she made on Facebook and I began to read her testimony and I just want to share it with you if that'd be okay this morning she says a week before Christmas I was diagnosed with stage four Hodgkin's lymphoma and two days after Christmas I started the first of 12 chemo treatments they told me that they told me that after four treatments they would do a pet scan to see how my body is responding I believe God Is A Healer and I've told anyone who asks how I'm doing I told them I was looking to him and believed he would kill me on Sunday I leaped and danced before the Lord with joy and victory because I knew it was already a finished work even though I didn't have edit and know or have any proof of it yet you say what was her proof a pet scan that showed she was full of cancer she says I leaped and danced before the Lord and she says I knew it was already a finished work you mean sometimes brother man you have to do something naturally in order for there to be a supernatural consequence hello somebody they were singing what have I to dread what have I to fear leaning on the Everlasting Arms I have blessedness with my Lord so near leaning on the Everlasting Arms that might sound strange to many but in the Bible Mariam Dance for Joy when she crossed the Red Sea and the Egyptians who had plagued and enslaved her were drowned David danced before the Lord when the Ark of the Covenant was brought back to Jerusalem it's an expression of extreme joy and victory I knew my healing would come sooner or later I want to tell you what the sister writes and you've got the card there before you she writes this down declare war own the devil no retreat lay hold on eternal life oh I hope they would anoint somebody's Faith here tonight maybe you have a child that's not even in this service let me tell you what you ought to do you want to declare war on the devil you might have just came into a battle and you say how did this ever happen to me I say declare war on your enemy no retreat no return no no turning back oh this little sister began to dance before the Lord I got a slide there and the next one there she says I begin to dance before the Lord David danced for Joy it's an expression straight expression of extreme joy I knew my healing would come sooner or later because the Jesus of the Bible is the same Jesus I have served for 27 years you say brother map what does it mean it means sometimes you do something naturally I know no one likes to get in the flesh but sometimes you gotta get into the flesh before it drops down into your soul and everything real move of God always starts in your flesh whether it's in your mind or in your heart or in your body you know why did Brother Branham when he's with banks Woods throw a rock up into the air and that rock when it went into the air the prophet said Disturbed the atmosphere and it started a little Whirlwind and when it landed it nearly sank Alaska why did Hattie Ray have to speak okay you say why did Jesus have to spit into the dirt ball up some mud and rub it upon why couldn't he just speak because the natural types spiritual why did name it have to dip not one time now why can't he just speak the word but sometimes God's looking he's a supernatural God and sometimes God's looking for it whether it's a decision that you make in your life firm decision you don't realize sometimes how powerful it is just standing up for the truth this is her pet scan one on your left full of cancer one on your right completely cancer free yesterday I had my pet scan in the day I met with a doctor before my fifth treatment he informed me that my cancer has already gone I had a seven centimeter tuber in my lung and multiple lymph nodes that were affected in the picture you'll see the before and the after the second is totally clear you think God's dead you think that the anointing that was on God's Prophet you think that that same Jesus who stood before the pulpit and the angel of the Lord would come to the platform and begin to discern the hearts of of people and and miracles would take place do you think that's yesterday and that's only yesterday I say today friends if all hell is cut loose and I say Oh Heaven is ready to pour itself out upon the living bride of Jesus Christ there's more for you than what you've received I say today if you've got a Hunger for More there's more of God for you to receive if you've got something inside of your soul it says Lord I'm thirsty for a living God and I say today God can feel you and refill you with the baptism of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah giving praise this morning he's worthy of all of our praise Hallelujah begin to testify to that that little woman there that wife of Mary and here was Marcus go two slides I can advance it now that's fine here's Marcus you know he had completely given up on himself starts to tell us the story and it was just so terrible you know sometimes it's so easy to have faith for others but it's so hard to have faith for yourself sometimes it's so hard to have faith for other people's kids but it's so hard to have faith for your own sometimes it's so hard to have faith that's so easy to believe for another person but when it comes to yourself and your layers of layers of Oppression and that demon Spirit has got you down and got you smothered under and you're trying so hard to be positive and you're trying so hard and you're just trying to come up like that little muddly brother random tails and she was buried underneath all of the mud sometimes it's so hard but I just want to preach to you here today and say just even a little voice I don't care how small it is I don't care if it's just a hand that would raise up to God and say God I don't care what I'm going through or what's facing me today I'm a believer I'm going to believe your word I'm going to confess your promises oh God [Applause] I say speak to that doubt that's around you and it was so hard for him to have faith he had completely given up on himself brother Travis begins to testify to him he says what's the pro what what's the prognosis Marcus says well it's a it's completely hopeless and he says it's just completely hopeless he says Travis I didn't want to die this way but they've tried chemo eight times failed all eight times they sent me home and said it's make your make your you know your life ready you maybe maybe I think they gave him I think it was two to four months if I'm not mistaken two to four months to live cancer had completely ate in this man's body from his head it started uh it started in his neck and moved all the way down to his body into his eyes on a normal pet scan you can actually see a black spot there for your heart for your lungs for your kidneys you can't see any organs there the cancer is completely ate up his body went from his neck to his eyeballs down his shoulders he said I have apple sized tumors on my calves right now completely ate a man to a shadow and he said I didn't want to die this way but you know it's important unto man wants to and he says I just I you know he said I I we've tried everything and it was a real Spirit of just an atmosphere and so Travis just says he says well Marcus he says you know he says I figure it's so do such such a bleak report and he said and there's no hope he said I just he said I get I think because of you know the circumstance he said ah I just got to be really really honest with you and he said what I'm going to say he said I'm just going to cut straight to the Chase and he said I'm going to cut straight to the point he said I don't believe it's any time to mince words he said it's now or never so I'm just going to tell you when I came to your church I was looking for the truth and he says and I want to tell you Marcus that Living God is not in your church not in your denomination he's not in your dead Creed of Trinity of gods he's not three coexistent co-eternal persons revealed in one he's one god Jehovah is his name and you're the doctrine of the Trinity is a doctrine of devils and denominations or of the devil they're spoke of in the Book of Revelations but I want to tell you Marcus that God is a real living God he's a God who can still heal he's a God who can still speak he's a god who's still speaking who still reveals himself and and the full word of the of the Apostles has been restored back to a church it's been restored back to a people and God has revealed himself through a messenger of the end time and God once again has appeared in the flesh and the son of man has once again appeared and he's made himself known and that same Apostolic blessing and promises that was promised to that first church I was searching for that God when I came to your church and I want to tell you Marcus I have found the truth of the Bible I have found the pearl of great price and you're wonderful people and I love you but I just want to tell you there's more of God for you to receive than what you've received and he's not in your doctrines he's not in the the Trinity he's telling him all this and I'm just thinking oh my God I mean talking about double barrel shotgun full choke I mean he just and I'm thinking my goodness Travis didn't know you say that it's not in your he's not in your systems and Marcus the god the the your denominational system is dead and here's my friend Matt Now Matt go ahead if you knew brother Travis you'd know brother Travis has got one of the most sweetest Tender Hearts I've never heard a fly any minute such out of the sincerity the depth of his heart and he's bowed his head he said now Marcus he said I I sure hope I didn't offend you and he said I hope nothing I said hurt hurt your feelings he said I just want to be real with you that God's the god of the Bible and he still performs miracles and he's still the god of the supernatural he can heal you of that cancer and he said I hope I didn't offend you and I was sitting there and Marcus just bowed his head he said no Travis he said in fact nothing that you said offended me and he said and I'll tell you why he said when you and your friend her knocked on the door he said an audible voice spoke and said these are men sent from God hear what they have to say Jesus said take no thought for what you'll say God works on both ends now either that was a devil that spoke to him or that was the angel of the Lord that spoke to his heart I asked you which one was it either that was a devil from the pits of hell and we had nothing but deception and evil to give him or God had sent us as barrier as bearers and carriers of the light of the End Time Gospel you think God would back up a lie you think God would stand behind and speak to a man like that who was dead with cancer and he's going to get behind a lie or some deception listen to me friends this thing is real this thing is their living reality listen to me friends this is not a dead book and a dead letter it's a living organism it's a living life it hasn't lost its power I begin to testify to that little that's sister and you know all I did through that is I began to speak I just took everything brother Barnum had said out of that book and I began to tell him I said now Marcus that cancer that's in your body that's a life that's a real living life of a demon Spirit that's trying to rob and suck the life out of you and if it can it'll suck the very life of you and kill you now I said Marcus now God heals through doctors and heals through medicine and if he could take or chemotherapy or some treatment that you've taken and if they could scrape out every last licking every last part of that cancer then wonderful that's how God God can use that for healing but they've given up on you you've tried it eight times and they haven't you say brother Matt do you believe in doctors I do brother Brandon said that the supernatural was when doctors couldn't help anymore that's when Divine Healing Supernatural healing steps in and so you go as far as you can and so so I said now that life that's living on you I said I got to tell you that tumor that I see that's just the body just like I've got a body and I've got a spirit but inside me is the soul the real life that's the real me and I said down on the inside of you inside of that tumor I said now the doctors with their tool bag they'll work on you with all of their tools I said I got to tell you I have no tools here in my bag uh to work on that tumor but I do got a bag full of promises out of the word of God and I said I'm going to pray over you and I'm going to curse the life of that demon spirit and I said that's a that's a spirit you've got to recognize that's a spirit call it what it is Jesus in Mark chapter nine when he speaks to that man who was deaf and he was dead he was lame and Jesus when he speaks to him in Mark 9 he says Thou foul spirit thou death spirit come out of the man and don't enter him again and I said I'm going to speak to Mary says that's the truth she began to weep she said I've been in church my whole life she says I've never heard it said that way but now that you say it that's exactly what the Bible teaches and I said I want to share with you about a little woman I began to show her marriage sister Elena's pet scans and you can just feel the atmosphere change you know it takes an atmosphere the right atmosphere it takes an atmosphere of faith and you could feel that atmosphere come into that little living room and Marcus begin to just weep and Mary begin to weep and I said I'm going to pray over you and I'll never forget laying my hands on him as we gathered there with that family from his church and we just begin to call upon God and I said Lord Jesus is Hezekiah was given to death sentence over his life and told he was going to die but he came and approached you and and he pleaded with you God and you added more years to his life so remember your servant here this man God who stood for you and preached your gospel from uh in this country and other countries would you remember Marcus oh God and give him more years to his life we curse that demon spirit that was upon him and you know what we did we left it there sometimes that's all you've got to do we left that living room told them goodbye walked out walked out the door and I said Travis we've taken our burdens to the Lord now our job is over what the Lord wanted us to do is finish there's nothing else to do we've left it with the Lord we waited didn't really hear from them for months went by and maybe I think it was I forget how many maybe three months if I'm not mistaken just so happens brother Travis is in my home and my living room and he's there on the couch and we're just talking about work we're talking about different things and and he's just going through something and I'm talking he gets a text on his phone and he pulls out his phone and I watch his eyes as I get about this big and he says Matt it's a text from Mary and he reads the text praised the supernatural Living God Marcus has been supernaturally healed of stage four Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma there's no cancer left in his body all you want to praise the Living God this morning I say Jesus is the same yesterday today and forever and your faith might be weak today God can energize your faith and say I believe in God I'm a Believer in your word nothing's impossible for a risen savior he's the same yesterday today and forever what God did to a little woman in Louisiana gone upon the faith of a believer in South Carolina musicians can you come I say the same God today he's the same yesterday today and forever you say brother Matt I have a need this morning and I have something in my life maybe a loved one that's not even here this morning maybe they're here right at your seat and right beside you and inside your heart you're worried and you're wondering and you're praying and you're distressed over that situation I say take the same faith that saved you and apply it to that unsaved loved one and say God the same a light that's shining in my soul may it shine and break past the barriers of doubt and unbelief may it break past Every Chain you know there is a man in the Bible who couldn't get to Jesus he couldn't get to the Lord he was dead he was laying there laying on his bed but the Bible says that his friends picked up his bed and carried him to Jesus and you know the Bible says that when they got to Jesus he was surrounded by people and crowds of people and little HUD there but you know what the faith of those friends wasn't going to stop at the crowds they actually climbed up on the roof and they ripped the roof off and they lowered the man down to Jesus and Jesus Says by your faith this man's made whole you see him in the map what does that mean I say today say God I am tearing the roof off I am lowering them down to you Lord Jesus I can't help them men can't help them they can't help themselves but I believe in a Jesus who's the same God who spoke the world into existence oh how many believers do we have here today that'll say God I'm taking my faith and I'm lowering that person Satan you might have tried to snatch them and snare them away but Jesus said all the father has given me will come to me they're in my hands I won't lose one of them I say oh hell can't stop a seed of God when the light of the Gospel shines upon your heart so I say Lord let it shine how many will join me and say Let It Shine oh God [Applause] that's your word shine upon my heart every head bowed ever I close if you have a need I'd invite you to come here today you have something maybe special upon your heart you'd like to be Anointed with oil and prayed over don't let nothing don't stop at anything don't let any barrier of unbelief or doubt stop you sometimes you got to do something naturally in order for God to move supernaturally you need something from God say I've been to the altar a hundred times what difference does that make if you get to Jesus this time what difference does it make don't don't look at your doubt don't let that dissuade you say God I'm doing something right now to show you I've got faith in your word oh God you said nothing's too hard for the Lord you want your faith to be anointed by the supernatural God raise up those hands and say God re-energize my faith this morning reignite give me that fresh surge of the Holy Ghost and my soul oh God if I've lost it Lord then restore unto me the joy of my salvation oh how many are hungry here today do we have a church that can say God I'm so hungry I'm so thirsty to see the power of a living God in my life I believe in a risen savior I believe that he's the same yesterday do you sing that song by the Kenny healing is here I lift my hands to the heavens Jesus is here you sing that brother Gideon could you sing that could you sing
