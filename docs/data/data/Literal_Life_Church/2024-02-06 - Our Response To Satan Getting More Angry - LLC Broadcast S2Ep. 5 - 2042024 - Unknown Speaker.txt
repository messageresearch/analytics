the we should never be when we take it to the Lord in PR because [Music] we when we have a friend who oh of Peace beond [Music] for [Music] all oh what PE we all for all what need is made we we should never be take it to the Lord in PR [Music] take it to Nehemiah chapter 4 and verse 1 we're going to read through verse 17 I'll try to read rapidly but I just want you to catch the theme here in the time when they were rebuilding they had finished the temple and now they were rebuilding the walls of protection around the temple which ended up being the the finish building the walls was the finishing part and I'm always attracted to these scriptures that they were finishing the work because we live in a day that we're in the finish of the work of God how many know that God's building a building a spiritual building and you're you're that habitation it's not about this building it's about your building being a temple for the Lord and he's finishing that now we're in the finished work of God building his temples and his Temple and now this final stage was building the wall but we find here that when they were in that final stage they got some opposition from the enemy and that's what I want to read about here this morning Nehemiah chapter 4 but it came to pass that when s amet heard that we build the wall he was wroth he was angry and took great indignation and mocked the Jews and he spake before his Brethren and the army of Samaria and said what do these feeble Jews will they fortify themselves will they sacrifice will they make an end in a day will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned well spiritually speaking yes they will revive and take all the stones that the temple was destroyed and they will be used to revive and bring a Revival and put all that back together yet the answer is yes that's what we're doing now tobiah and the the ammonite was by him and he said even that which they build if a fox go up he shall even break down their stone wall here oh Our God this Nehemiah asking God now for we are despised and turn their reproach upon their own head and give them for a prey in the land of captivity and cover not not their iniquity and let not their sin be blotted out from before thee for they have provoked thee to anger before the Builder so built we the wall and all the wall was joined together unto the half thereof for the people had a mind to work so now the people would not be and Nehemiah had to encourage them don't be distracted by the anger of the enemy right keep your mind on what we're doing we're in a building project and we're finished in this building but Satan would like in his anger to stop that to discourage us and Nehemiah says we're going to pray we're going to continue and we're going to the people were of a mind to get back to the work that we're doing but it came to pass that when samulet and toaya and the Arabians and the amorites and the ashad heard that the walls of Jerusalem were made up and that the breaches began to be stopped then they were very raw so before before they're wroth and now they're very wroth Wednesday night I said why is the devil becoming even more angry now they're very wroth at this this work is continuing uh they're getting a revelation of what to do and they're doing it can you say amen and conspired all of them together to come and to fight against Jerusalem and to hinder it so now they're going to gather and they're going to fight against this here's nehemiah's response nevertheless we made our prayer unto God and set a watch against them day and night because of them listen there are some incidences today that we don't have the answers for many times and so we have to go to prayer fervent prayer amen his response is that you know what we're going to pray and we're not going to stop praying because the devil would like us to stop praying but we're not going to stop praying and sometimes that's the only thing we have left to do but we're going to bring a fervent prayer in faith for every need and Judas said the strength of the Bears of the burdens is decayed and there is much rubbish so that we are not able to build the wall verse 13 therefore set I in the lower places behind the wall and on the higher places I even set the people after their families with their swords their Spears and their bows and I looked and Rose up and S to the Nobles and to the rulers and to the rest of the people be not ye afraid of them remember the Lord which is great and terrible and fight for your brethren your sons your daughters your wives your houses blessed be the name of the Lord don't be intimidated by the anger of the enemy can you say Amen we're going to pray and we're going to continue to fight not just for us but for our sons and daughters as well and it came to pass when our enemies heard that it was known unto us and God had brought their counsel to not God Ste stepped in and brought their counsel to not that they couldn't even fight when that happened then they that we returned all of us to the wall even one unto his work back to the job back to our Focus back to God's achievement can you say Amen because why vengeance is mine sayeth the Lord let God take care of your problems we pray and we get back to the work of the Lord and came to pass from that time forth that half of the my servants wrought in the work and the other half of them held both their Spears the Shields and the bows and uh habans and the rulers behind all the house of Judah they which build it on the hall and they that bear burdens with those that laided everyone with one of his hands everyone with one of his hands wrought in the work and with the other hand held a weapon every Everybody anybody ever see a picture like that with one hand they're building the wall the other hand they got a weapon for protection how many know that Satan is getting angry and getting even more Angry all the time we are seeing Satan's Fury Unleashed like never before we've been in conversations with Believers saying it just seems like there's an increase of the devil doing his work and he's very angry and his anger is increasing towards Believers and so now the head Christ is here we have the mind of Christ but even greater than that there's a body coming one with it and they're manifesting Christ through her Christ is manifesting that he's here through the body in the last days and this is what Satan is howling about I'll read some quotes in a few minute minutes where he says in Christ the mystery the prophet says he says that that this is what Satan is howling about this is what Satan is so angry about Christ is here the hedum is here the body's becoming one with it there's a vindication he is here and so he keeps saying this is what Satan is angry about as I said Wednesday night it's not your personality that Satan doesn't like it's not that you God would bless you or you don't have a lot of things that has nothing to do with Satan's anger it's when a Believer is becoming one in a marriage with Christ the word that's what he howls about that's what he gets angry when he begins to see the life flowing through body members and it's manifesting the same way it did 2,000 years ago go Satan begins to get angry now the climax comes and he gets even more Angry the bride has been laying in the presence of the son for many years now and she's maturing into manifested sons of God and you that know your Bible know that this last days is when it says all creation is waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God well we can't manifest anything until he's here I know we meet him in the air there's the physical return of Jesus Christ there's a coming of the Lord that we're still looking forward to but he comes because we have to become one with his headship he has to have the preeminence in the bride's life and there's no other group of people on the face of there except those elected ones those that are Holy Ghost people that are coming one with this word and she's doing it and Satan is howling at it he doesn't like it because they're maturing into these manifested sons of God and that is happening now now by the power of God not by intellect not by Mysteries not just knowing the Mysteries not by head knowledge not by understanding it up here but there's a power in it that's manifesting through his people example from the very beginning in the garden Satan's trouble and his anger was rooted in the Revelation that Believers had he become jealous and resentful towards it so I went through this thing and how Cain brought this and said this is what God wants this is where I'm going to worship Abel brought a a bloody Sacrifice by Revelation but I forgot to end it that that's where Cain got so angry at Abel that he actually killed him he murdered him that's how angry people be can become under the spirit of Satan at another believer don't take it personal if you got a revelation from God and you're acting that out by Revelation not intellect you you should expect expect that some are going to get upset about it you could expect to be persecuted can you say Amen so here that that began in the garden all the way through there was tension all the way through there was tension and the tension between the camp of Satan and the camp of God was usually this God God's people were living out of Revelation by a mystery they caught by Revelation they're living it out and so now here we come Satan getting angry more angry and uh did you ever have have somebody get M mad at you and more mad and more at and just more more mad and it just keeps festering against you and you weren't doing anything intentional to make them mad now if you're doing something intentional talking about a person now because the devil I like to make you mad intentionally but not a not a not a motive of Just In My Own Strength but if this word if it bothers him to keep preaching all the message and all the counsel of his word if that bothers Satan then I'm going to keep preaching it amen if that makes him more Angry then I'm going to keep doing and I'm going to keep building this wall I'm going to keep doing I'm going to keep believing it but did you ever anybody ever have somebody just they're just angry with you and getting more and more angry but you didn't do anything intentional to to to receive that type of anger towards yourself and uh this this is how it is sometimes is that you're not really doing anything necessarily uh out of the ordinary but just living the life and believing and uh uh you know when someone is mad at you and becomes more angry at you and you haven't done anything intentionally to bring it then you got to look and say I don't have the problem here that person has a problem they come to you with builtup anger I just I can't believe you didn't just then they go off on you you're going my goodness chill out a little bit what did I do and if I did something I want to apologize for it a lot of people don't come and tell you what you did wrong I think we should be adults in Christ and brothers and if you got something to get somebody Bible says to go tell them but they fester in their anger then they're so angry at you they lash out at you and they've never even talking about you don't even know what you've done and so the problem is not with you then you have to release that because they've got the problem they've got the problem with their anger this is the devil is that I can safely say that he's the one with the problem brother Wallace I'm not the one with the problem I have the Lord the devil's the one that's got the problem with the word of God and a problem with my Revelation and so I'm not going to live under his guilt I'm not going to live under his threatening can you say Amen I'm not going to live under this devil is becoming more in these last days before this Rapture I'm not going to be affected by that I want want to lose sleep over that can you I'm not going to be intimidated by the report of the enemy can you say Amen his anger is not going to bother me because he's the one with the problem I'll say to all of you and those those that are listening in the Toledo area and the broadcast what Toledo needs in all this area in this Michigan area what what this area needs is thousands of lived voices the Thunder of God th ing out in sweetness and Holiness and Purity and undefiled lives walking around in the Earth today without a blemish real Christians that's thundering out against the enemy the devil don't care how loud you can holler the devil don't care how you can jump and how much you can do this or shout but What Hurts The Devil is to see that Sanctified holy life consecrated to God if you say anything to them call them anything you want they're just as sweet as they can be and they move right on oh my that throws him away that's the Thunder that shakes the devil Hallelujah that's what the kingdom of God needs that's what this area needs that's what the world needs it's not your personality it's when someone gets a revelation and they're living a Sanctified life with that Revelation that's what makes the enemy mad Thunders out against the enemy he hates a confession of Faith Satan hates a confession of faith when it's dark and the there's no hope he can't stand a confession of Faith Satan hates that but the Believers are going to do it Believers are going to say Lord anoint my faith I have faith given to me by God but anoint it make it Revelation Faith because this is the thunder that comes out against the enemy so now I want to move along and say another reason that Satan is mad and I know this is simple but another reason that Satan is getting more angry now is because I believe his days are numbered I believe his days are numbered and I'm I'm wondering if lately Satan is trying to take his final swing right now the final punch the the the final CU he's so weak he hardly has anything left after fighting the bride for 6,000 years he hardly has anything so he's going to take the final swing that he has the final punch that he has because he has nothing left and he knows that his days are numbered and it's in these final days that he gets angry it's when the time came listen now it's when the time came for the Deliverance that that is when Pharaoh got more angry with God's people it was when it was time for their Deliverance Pharaoh got more Angry shouldn't that say something to us we're close to Deliverance so what's going to happen the devil's going to get more angry at you now you could look at it say I'm scared of him no don't be a scared of him just say my my homecoming is very very soon here let him get angry because it's probably all through the scripture every time he got more Angry it was time for the people of God's Deliverance to get out of here Pharaoh increases the pressure Pharaoh increases then when they he said he let him go then he got more mad and he turned on them and he came within all Pharaoh's Army he kept his anger increased more and more all the time it's because the time of deler Deliverance was at hand Speed Ahead 2,000 years it's when Christ was about to be born that the Bible says that Herod got wroth he began to kill the children he began to take extra measures to kill the children because the Bible says he got more wroth about this thing why the time of Christ being delivered was at hand what's our response to this anger today just stay focused on the word of God stay in it every day become a prayer Warrior I don't have a position in in the church let me give you a position become a prayer Warrior that's what we need in the church Hallelujah they stayed focused they they they just dealt there with that contrary spirit always laying there it's always there always will be there that contrary Spirit but stay focused on the work of the Lord samulet means sin and tobiah means Jehovah is good which is really strange sablet means sin and toaya means Jehovah is good the these two influences are contrary to the deeper walk of the Lord in you sin is your is contrary and someone who just wants to see Jehovah as a good God not a God of War not a god of overcoming but just a good god brother Paul why can't you just I bring visitors here why can't you just be nice he's a good God just preach the good things he is a good god I believe that but he's a man of war he's a man of Justice he's a man that tells the truth Christ is one who tells the Christ is the very essence of Truth so if you get around Christ you're going to hear truth might take the very height off you but you're going to hear truth not just that he's a good God you're a good boy you're a good little boy you're okay everybody's doing you wrong you're a victim of everybody I'm not going to continue to make you a victim because victims victims that are getting the Holy Ghost are rising above victimhood today is that anybody can do anything they want to that's their problem I'm going to go on serving the lord I will not encourage your victimism on the government will but Christ doesn't I've been done wrong by every church I've been to brother Paul go ahead and I'm thinking this one's going to do me wrong just like all the rest of them victim time to grow up time to become a warrior time to get back on building the kingdom and the walls and this finishing work trying to find the reason why Toba tobah and selet were contrary as selet and Tobias had positions maybe and maybe they were jealous that the king never gave them positions in this I don't know why they were so angry but they were grieved that someone was seeking the welfare of the Jews maybe they could have been jealous could be they were not put in charge of it samlet and tobiah why didn't this King who's our King put us in charge of this work maybe they were jealous of that we were not informed maybe they were mad because I was not informed of this myself we didn't vote on that I don't know but they got the angry of the devil against the wrong people right the people that are trying to do the final work of the Lord the last effort I don't know if you read your Bible I didn't read it this morning but it's in there the last effort they gave to come against the work of the Lord was they called uh Nehemiah samulet Nehemiah and said could we get together in the village and I like to work this way can we just have a coffee and talk you know it's the Devil he's going to try every means I mean this is the same guy who was putting together an army to fight against them this is the same guy that mocked him him toai the same guy who gossiped against them the same one now says can we have coffee and just talk you know what neemi said no we can't people get quiet but I've had to tell some people sometimes it seems in polite say you know I'd love the fellowship around the word but when the motive is there and I can see it Nehemiah said I'll read it to you no I won't be able to go he says you got to hear his response to this he says samulet and Gish sent unto him saying come and let us meet together in some one of these Villages at Starbucks let's meet at Starbucks and just discuss this now that's the same guy that wanted to destroy you let's have a coffee at Starbucks doesn't say that but they thought but they thought to do me Mischief so now he's calling it mischief and I sent Messengers to them saying I am doing a great work so that I cannot come down to [Applause] Starbucks why should the work cease while I leave it and come to Starbucks with you that seems harsh that seems but listen if someone's got a sincere heart and want to Fellowship around the world and sincere questions I'm all there but when there's a track record that shows listen I'm not going to be drawn away from the work of the Lord in people's lives that I need to pour myself into yet they sent unto me four times an invitation to Starbucks and I answered them after the same manner the devil is becoming more and more angry and when he they had the swords and God backed them off and the people of God had the swords they kept working on the Lord they he got more angry and said they're not going to stop they're not going to stop doing what they're doing and he became more festering and more Angry more Angry until he tried other means and everything and as I said at the beginning after a while you have to say this is not a problem with me as much as it is it's a problem with their anger and they need to resolve their anger if you have anger this morning you better resolve your anger you better bring that to the to the Cross because the devil will use that he'll take his anger with your anger and it's not good so we release it we forgive we let it go because I want to be doing the work of the Lord I don't want to spend my whole life in anger I don't want to spend my whole life participating and coming against the word of God I want to be the ones that's in the army of God identifying myself I'm all in I'm part of the army of the Lord I'm part of the solution not the problem I don't know where you feel you are today in the Lord but I'm going to give that most of you are sitting here because something has been deposited in your heart that you know had to come from God you may not feel like you're all where you need to be but if you can say that something is in your heart that's come from God and not yourself and he deposited in there even it was 20 years ago May it was the last week if you can say that then you have enough response to the devil to say you didn't give that to me and Satan you can't take it away thank you for watching our message today if you would
