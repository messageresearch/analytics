mighty conqueror Lord the greatest champion Lord Jesus we just trust that name right now Lord Jesus God take control of this service Lord Jesus take control of my lips tonight take control of the hearers tonight Lord Jesus we give you the service Lord oh God let it edify Lord Jesus the body of Christ in Jesus name amen amen it's so good to be with you tonight amen let's just turn to our Bibles tonight Romans 7 7 17-25 before we do that though I had it's kind of some funny thing that happened but pull up the pull up the advertisement for the like tonight pull up that if you would because there were some that were saying that I looked like I looked exactly like the advertisement I have to say I don't I am the same person but I have a different code on I'm not trying to like make the connection tonight so you don't forget but pull up that just so you guys know pull up that you guys got that maybe not if not oh it's tonight we don't need to advertising for it anymore but I guess it looked exactly like what I'm wearing tonight so I guess they could see the comparison it was kind of funny for me at least so let's just turn in our Bibles this tonight Romans 7. like the title of the sermon tonight what are you eating amen Romans 7. 17 through 25 we'll read I'll read this with you and then you can have the have your seats tonight I want to read it from the Amplified to Romans 17 Romans 7 17. now then it is no more I that do it but sin that dwelleth in me for I know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing for too will is for to will is present with me but how to perform that which is good I find not for the good that I would I do not for the evil which I would not that I do now if I do that I would sin it is no more I that do it but sin that dwelleth in me I find then a law that that that when I would do good evil is present with me for I dwelleth in the law of God after the inward man amen for I see another law in my members warring against the law of my mind and bringing me into the Captivity of the law of sin which is in my members oh Wretched Man that I am who shall deliver me from the body of this death I thank God through Jesus Christ Our Lord so then with the mind I myself serve the law of God but with the Flesh of the law but with the Flesh of the law of sin so you see the difference there right are you catching the difference there you may be seated tonight and then from the Amplified I'm just going to go from 21 to 25 so I find it to be the law of my inner self that evil is present in me the one who wants to do good for I joyfully Delight in the law of God in my inner self with my new creature amen but I see a different law and Rural action in my members of my body in its appetites in its desires see what are you eating and it's appetites and its desires Waging War against the law of my mind and some and subduing me and making me a prisoner of the law of sin which is within my members wretched and miserable man that I am oh will rescue me and set me free from his body of death this corrupt real Mortal existence thanks be to God for my Deliverance are you glad for his Deliverance amen through Jesus Christ Our Lord so then on the one hand I myself with my lime with my mind serve a law of God but on the other with my flesh my human nature my worldliness my sinful capacity I serve the law of sin so you see the difference here you see this battle that's going on right first of all I want to I want to make sure we understand that there's an appetite and every human there's an appetite for something right even in our natural bodies I was even thinking of you know a run runner in the appetite and what you need as a runner to you know to take to take on a race or take on a challenge right you need the right appetite you need the right diet right you need the right diet so I ask you tonight how is your app or how is your appetite has your appetite changed as far as spiritually thinking spiritually minded here check your appetite who gives the change in this appetite because we were all born in sin shaped in iniquity right we had an appetite for something but it wasn't for the things of God right it was for something else and then who gives the ultimate appetite change Christ gives the ultimate appetite change amen you believe that on a soul level when your soul has been quickened when it's come to life there is a change in appetite you believe that whatever a man thinketh so is he amen when someone is lost in unbelief he's hungry for he's hunger he's hungering he's got an appetite for something he he fleshly desires right it's his flesh taking control right when the soul has been quickened so when someone is an unbelief or that Soul hasn't been changed his hunger for self he has a hunger for self he hungers with that without an experience without the person of Jesus Christ man hungers for self selfish desires and it's a my will right to my will amen so you catching the thought tonight are you catching a little bit what I'm trying to say about appetite right the appetite hasn't changed amen so we go to Mark 7 18-22 and he said unto them are ye so without understanding so he's talking to the at first he's talking to the Pharisees but this he's talking to the disciples because the Pharisees are asking your disciples they're they're eating unclean unclean things they're not washing their hands before they eat right they're not eating they're they're eating this so he's he's answering the disciples right see those Pharisees they left they left they don't want they don't want for their understanding but the disciples the chosen ones they want something more amen amen how many want something more amen they don't settle for just like oh I don't know God will reveal it to you amen amen he's faithful to do it every time praise the Lord are you so without understanding also do you not perceive that whatsoever thing from without from without interest into a man it cannot defile him but it enters not into his heart but into a belly and goeth out into the drought purging all Meats so I'm reading from the Amplified here excuse me and he said that which cometh out of a man that defileth a man for from within out of the heart of men perceive evil thoughts right evil thoughts adulteries fornications murders thefts covetousness wickedness deceit lasciviousness in the evil eye blasphemy Pride foolishness all these evil things Cometh From Within and defile a man so he's he's catching the distinction that's what defiles a man so we have this but when a man so you have this distinction here right that's what defiles a man is what what's coming from within from without right he's born with it right but when a man is Born Again a new creation in Christ his appetite changes I'm no longer hungry for the things of the world and what they're what they're offering right just like our songs was what song was saying by by our choir here amen it's from it's from it's from those those those thoughts into the righteous thoughts amen amen so but no longer hunger for the worldly living that's how what's happened your soul has been converted right it has a change from my appetite and what I desire to what God wants in his desire on a soul level that is all you want now as Mary said be it unto me according to Thy Word no selfishness now impregnated with that word amen praise the Lord hallelujah so you know your appetite changes and I encourage this is just an example I heard a long time ago but you kind of challenge yourself as a as a young person right you kind of challenge yourself like Lord have I had the new birth and it was a minister one time that that talked or he was preaching and he said he said Just Close Your Eyes for a second why don't we all do that close your eyes close your eyes and give you a week God gives us a week with no repercussions of our sin right where does your desires lie where where what do you actually want if there's no repercussions during that week and so you can open your eyes now but there's no repercussions during that week what would you do where does your desires like and it's such a challenging thought where would we be right amen because there was because there if there's not an appetite there amen then if there's not been that appetite change then there you know you you're still you're still at Phase One amen so we need that appetite change we need more than anything in this world we need abort we need a new birth amen you must be born again amen so I encourage every young person here tonight who has not experienced God for themselves it's not about anyone next to you but you you as an individual come into contact with that person Jesus Christ there's still that opportunity today do you believe that there's still an opportunity amen don't miss your opportunity tonight it's not too late the hour is late but it's not too late amen praise the Lord I'd like to encourage you with this scripture tonight Ephesians 2 1. one through ten turn with me I love the scripture one of my favorite scriptures here and you have to be Quicken we just had the we just had brother amen he just he just gave it to us so simple tonight amen repent amen be baptized amen trust Jesus we complicate it so much in what the new birth means amen repent and be baptized everyone in you in the name of the name of Jesus Christ amen and you shout and you have he quickened who are dead in trespasses and sin wherein in time past you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in Children of Disobedience among whom also we had all had our conversation in times past and the lust of the flesh filling the desires of the flesh you see this going on the distinction filling the desires of the Flesh and of the mind and where by Nature the children of Wrath even as others but God but God Hallelujah the God who is rich in Mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins before we even thought he quickened us together with Christ by Grace ye are saved Allelujah and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus aren't you glad tonight that in the ages to come you might show the exceeding Riches of his great his grace his kindness towards us through Christ Jesus for by Grace you are safe through faith and that not of ourselves it is the gift of God praise the Lord not of works lest any man should boast for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them without where wherefore remember that ye being in times past Gentiles in the flesh who are called uncircumcised by that which is called the circumcision in the flesh made by hand that added that at that time ye were without Christ being aliens from the Commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the covenants of Promise having no hope and without God in the world but now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were afar off are made nigh Alleluia by the blood of Christ praise the Lord for he is our peace who hath made both one and hath broken down the middle wall partitioned between us definitely man we we passed it so that's where I wanted to get at not it works less any man should boast we are as workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works now we must remember this is God's grace and all his doing this process of of the new birth it's all his doing he's the one that draws amen he does the changing he does the filling amen amen my life was messed up but he came in amen praise the Lord so now we have this new birth amen how many how many I I know you know it's a it's a rhetorical question but you know I want to have the confidence that you know even when ministers say it's like who's been born again I want a confidence to say yes Lord I know that I know that I know that's what I want amen so now the battle starts right we have this new birth experience right this is when the battle starts right this is the true mind battle where the battle starts amen before your seed was quickened you had you had nothing you had nothing in you to fight the battle but a Believer now has what they need to overcome every Temptation amen they've got something within them that's going to hold them amen I'm not saying that we become perfect in ourselves but what God has placed within us is perfect because it is the word amen we have something to fight with now amen the battle has started so now we can really sing that song This Means War oh yes This Means War do you believe that we have now have the battle amen that's where the battle is now we've got something to fight with aren't you glad we have something to fight with amen before we had nothing to fight with her with the Enemy amen his hand was protecting us all along until he until that until that seed was quickened right but now we have something to fight with amen and overcome with amen praise the Lord amen now we can sing Victory with confidence amen and not only that but we are guaranteed a w amen we are guaranteed a w amen praise the Lord we're on The Winning Side questions and answers if we could pull that quote up tonight sometimes I I want to take my time on this quote but he actually answers the question here answers the question of the scripture here we have these two forces fighting all the time right two forces good and evil right well they wrote out the scriptures so he he's got the question here about the scripture Romans 7 there that that Paul speaking to Romans I said let me just kind of Polish it up so you can see he said in me is two persons right one wants me to do wrong the other one wants me to do and every time I start to do right then the wrong hinders me how many of you people on the interviews this afternoon has run into the same thing has anyone run into the same thing and this morning the same thing I spoke on it this morning temporarily and our and out you are an outward man which is controlled by the six senses right you got taste feel smell sound look right you have all those senses right you even have a spirit right conscious imagination all those things you guys know that you guys know that you are an inward man controlled by one sense which is Faith right you have that inward conscious you have that inward man that has is Faith right success the sick in all the six senses if the six senses don't agree with faith look how simple he puts this but one is contrary to the other now as long as the six senses agree with faith wonderful but when the six senses disagree with the faith then leave the six senses alone right now for instance here Jesus made a statement a promise the inside man says that's true right face calling out that's true the outside man reasons that it can't be true to you then ignore the outside man and accept the Inside Man right what a battle amen now that's the same thing that Paul's speaking of he was sold into the law of carnal sin every one of us is the same that's the reason we are having the troubles we do of marriage four or five times than this and that and all the kinds of sin and adulteries and everything else along in our lives it's because those things we are carnal right and that part must perish amen but then inside we are Spirit Man soul inside and that's faith in God's word amen that's what's calling out that's the real you amen then then we bring our outside body under subjection to the Word of Faith by accepting what God Said Amen you hear a word he's an athanir let him hear amen Faith cometh by hearing amen praise the Lord amen what a simple what a simple ex what a simple explanation of that of that word here so I I I was last couple days I've been reading the greatest battle I ever fought and where is that does anyone know it's the mind right right so where's the where's the Battleground amen it is in the mind who wins the one you feed the most what are you feeding what are you feeding on Amen so questions I'm giving you challenging you tonight and man it's okay to be challenging the presence of the Lord amen there's not a one-night experience when when you hit an altar one night yes you've been changed but it's a it's a process you're getting somewhere a man with adoption you're getting to that amen praise the Lord until our glorified bodies we're still in that process every single day amen and I want to live for him all to you Lord I Surrender amen praise the Lord so I show this picture tonight so who wins God's Duty bound to fill the hungry soul say at Thy word Lord blessed are they that hunger and thirst for righteousness for they shall be filled amen so this is uh I actually found the direct um the the direct poem or the direct um phrase of what brother braham's talking about in this this war of the Mind Right the greatest battle ever fought right you have these two good and evil and I'd like to share this with you because it's it's uh it's a it helped me it helped me so much in my Christian walk because you think as soon as you become born again as far as the Flesh and the spirit you you have this High expectation that these you're going to be perfect right and you will be perfect on the other side amen you will be perfect right that soul that Soul's been changed amen that Soul's that soul is restored that Soul's redeemed amen but that but the flesh and the spirit right the Flesh and the spirit they can come under these things they can be they can be fed and they can get they can get um they can get into flesh they can get in the spirit right those things waiver those things waiver but that soul that soul is our anchor amen amen the holy spirit in our soul that is our anchor amen praise the Lord I hope you're seeing it clear tonight amen the tale of two wolves this is the story of the converted Chief I'm sure you've heard it before but if you haven't here you go the tale of two wolves one evening a Cherokee Elder was teaching his grandson about life a fight is going on inside me he said to the boy it's a terrible fight and it's between two wolves this battle that goes on between the two wolves is inside us all the wolf one wolf is evil he is anger Envy jealousy sorrow regret greed arrogance self-pity guilt resentment inferiority lies false Pride superiority ego he continued the other is good he is joy peace love hope Serenity humility kindness Hallelujah benefolence empathy generosity truth compassion and faith wow the grandson thought about it for a minute and then asks his grandfather which wolf will win wisely the grandfather simply smiled and replied the one you feed the most amen are you catching what I'm getting to I'm getting at tonight so we have this constant battle going on between this evil dog and this this uh this uh this good dog this white and black right which one wins it's the one you feed the most it's the one who's on the bulking diet right sometimes as a as a bodybuilder you start to bulk right it's the one on the bulking diet amen so it's the one on the bulking guy if that white dog is starving this is pretty direct here but I want to encourage you amen I want to encourage you if that white dog if that good dog right is starving throughout the week and only gets fed on Sundays and Wednesdays or every other Youth Camp how do you expect to have the confidence to shun the enemy when it attacks because as a Believer you are now the devil's Target right he doesn't worry about the ones in the world he's worried about you now he's he's got his guns towards you amen how are you gonna have the confidence if you're not feeding that white dog are you catching what I'm I'm getting at tonight amen in the enemy when he attacks because as a believer you think I'm getting a little ahead of it myself he wants to destroy what God started on the inside right that's his goal but we have a promise when God starts something he is faithful to complete it you believe that Allelujah it's faithful and just to complete it how did Jesus overcome the enemy what did he say as it is written what does he combat it with the word of God Amen he meets him on his battleground of the mind and he takes God at his word with faith amen he's feeding that white dog amen every day Hallelujah what is he doing I love this even I even looked up the scripture this is in Deuteronomy what the Lord says he says this is when when our lord Jesus he's hungry in the desert right this is when Satan's battling him in his mind right he says this is Deuteronomy 8 3 he says it says man does not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God the Lord doth men live see the scripture this scripture is dead when it's not being used to combat the enemy and it's just letter form amen but when it's used in a believer's heart and that Faith Rises up and says at Thy word Lord amen as it is written amen there's no devil in hell that can come in between you now amen there's no temptation amen you've got his word amen but you got to feed that amen you got to feed that experience yes there yes there is an experience you have with the Lord and there's there's a change sometimes you don't even know when that change happened right sometimes you don't let that change but Lord wherever I'm at I gotta feed the white dog I gotta feed that experience amen Lord wherever I'm at I've got to feed that white dog amen praise the Lord because that's the one that's going to win so now so now when the doctors gives you a diagnosis what Rises up in a Believer by his stripes I am healed amen when you have thoughts that I'm not pretty that word comes up and says I am fearfully and wonderfully made amen when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of God in you raises up a standard against her the spirit when the spirit of God is in you the spirit of God the standards don't get lower the standards always go up at the Spirit of God's in you amen praise the Lord do the distinction the battle the Battleground the Battleground is the mind because it's where decisions happen and then that's the crossroads amen so you have this black dog and I'm going to get real down to earth with you if you don't mind for a minute amen you mind if I get down to earth here rubber meets the road amen I like that I like that I don't mind that at all but you have that Evil Nation nature we still have that a part of us amen of Stills we're on this Earth we still have that evil fleshly nature a part of it I sorry sorry to let you know tonight but we still have it amen so so what are the things some of the things that that black dog feeds on what movies are you feeding on I I just mentioned a few tonight The Bachelor The Bachelor modern day polygamy I call it modern day polygamy I've never seen I've never I've never even heard of anything more filthy in my life but you hear sometimes that Believers so-called Believers are watching these things right Friends the show Friends the office so-called humor right things that make you laugh but that black dog it's feeding on it amen it's that black dog what music are you feeding on Justin Bieber Ariana Grande Tori Kelly just I'm just trying to be real with you tonight what reels are you watching it's funny they call it reels because it's reeling you in amen have you ever heard of thought of that it's reeling you in it's really new in dad mentioned this week my mind's not a garbage can in the youth meeting the other night amen I want to have I want to have the Lord take control of my mind amen praise the Lord you watch some wholesome thing see this is the this is the deception Satan I want I just want you to notice the deception that's happening with these reels that's going on right got to be honest with you tonight it's just what the Lord put on my heart so you have these reels you have the deception and what is what what in this last day is is Satan trying to create a lukewarm Spirit right it's this lukewarm right and what is he doing you see on this reel you'll be encouraged right you can be encouraged by a real you can have a minister on there right you can have some so-called Minister I I don't know who it is but it can be so encouraging but you have no idea what that will what that next reel will be no idea it could be the most filthy thing you've ever seen but you have no control of it and what is it doing it's giving you this this lukewarm try type this lukewarm lukewarm type swear and what is he what is Satan trying to do he's knocking away on that that spirit amen he's knocking away on it what what you had and what you he's just trying to just beat up your confidence but I I know I know a mighty Army that doesn't give in to that amen they stand up and the standard Rises amen and said I'm not going to feed on what I think is right I mean it may feel so good or it may make you feel relaxed but what is it actually doing to your mind what is it doing to you amen we've got we can't be ignorant of his devices people we can't be ignorant of what the devil's trying to do here this is the final hour we've got to be sharp amen amen and how does how do we become sharp the word of God amen amen the word of God God makes us sharp amen and I'm preaching to the choir tonight okay so don't think that I you know I haven't been through some of these things myself okay I I I'm saying it because I I know these things can be a stumbling block amen amen to your to your overcoming amen something wholesome but the very next one that comes up you have no control over and let your guard down spiritual death happens one compromise at a time you let one thing be okay then it's a trickle-down effect the devil is not messing around this is the fire this is the final age we've gotta we've got to come to that this is the final have you looked around you I'm by God's grace he helped me through nursing school um and just recently passed my boards all by his grace but now I'm you know you start to see even in a hospital there was five young children five probably within 12 to 15 all come in with suicide all come in with suicide this is the world we're living in it's becoming completely insane where are we living at amen right now he's out to destroy a lion seeking whom he may devour you know that phrase so that's what I was saying preaching to the choir what did Satan try to do he's subtle just as he was in the beginning he's subtle he's making a lukewarm generation he's you guys know the word complacency right have you you guys know that word the meaning of that word a feeling of contentment or self-satisfaction especially when uh coupled with an awareness of danger so we we find ourselves sometimes in a place of danger even spiritual instability right we find ourselves in that place but what are we feeding on what are we letting what what are we letting in that is destroying us we have to fill the house amen we can't just say Lord clean me every week clean me every week but the the house has to be filled amen it's got to be filled amen amen and he offers that aren't you glad he offers that he offers a filling amen amen whenever we're dry he's constantly there to fill us up amen he's never failed me one time when I when I when I get up when the weakest Christian gets on their knees and said Lord I need you I need you more than anything in my life he's never failed to answer that prayer amen Alleluia thank you Lord Jesus we are being we can't be ignorant of these devices and my YouTube videos books what thoughts are you feeding every day see thought the thought life even I mean for me even in high school a lot of it wasn't visual things I would look to but it was my thought life you can feed certain thoughts the black dog that's still tearing you down amen you may not be acting per se on certain things but it may be it may be hurting you or distorting you the your mind battles amen that you know you may be you may be uh as far as imagination right imagination memory God may be defeating you or God doesn't defeat you the Satan's defeating you sorry about that excuse me um but are you feeding anxious thoughts are you feeding depressive thoughts are you letting the memory of the past bring you down or fear of failing I can say Amen to that suicide whether you're a man or a woman trying to just be straight and direct tonight but the white dog what does the white dog feed on the word of God he feeds on that word of God and there's nothing else that he can feed on Amen it's that word of God I'm trying to tell you that's our answer that's where the person of Jesus Christ coming in that word it's not just in letter form now it's Christ Made Alive amen it's something it's that relationship it's that communion now we have the bread of life amen we have Jesus Christ Our bread of life that we can commune with now do you believe that tonight we have that communion with him amen don't turn the other things young people that's my message tonight amen by his stripe this dog is fed by the word and only the word by his stripes I am healed Faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word of God Amen and we have a perfect scripture to what to think about amen and It All Leads this is the wonderful thing Philippians 4 8 how many no Philippians 4 8 finally brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever
