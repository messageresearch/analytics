who's living in me oh the s God who created all the heavens and all the Earth he he came back living in Jesus and there was power in everywhere but now in these last days I'm beginning to see that it's that same God living in [Music] me the same God who spoke you oh will he is the same God who wonders to many [Music] to the same God who guarded the ring [Applause] re he is the same God who's living sing [Applause] worship sing God you the same God who wonders true many to oh s God who parted the ring [Music] re he's the same God who's living in me oh he the sa God who living in me 2 Corinthians 4:18 in our Holy Bible while we look not at the things which are seen But at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are Eternal so as Christians we uh we cannot look at just temporal things we cannot live uh with our eyes on just seeing things what we see in front of us because the temporal how many know that it's faith that makes us see the Unseen we have to live by faith can you say amen and Faith sees what is unseen Faith sees God's will God's plan we cannot be Christians that look at temporal things or the seen things because they're temporal they'll end they'll fade away but we must look at things that won't fade away we must live on things that won't Fade Away amen I find people live in the past a lot they live in a rearview mirror they live their hearts are all locked up because every day they live in a rearview mirror while they're driving that's very dangerous driving you know very dangerous to drive looking trying to drive looking always looking at something that happened in the past to you but to drive forward we must forget the past ask God to forgive us and forgive others and not look in the river but look ahead another reason that people don't look ahead with a positive attitude and a and a strength and by faith look into the Unseen is because they're looking at temporal things 1 Corinthians 13:8 charity never faileth but whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether they pre tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away for we know in part we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away so what is this speaking of of it's speaking of a transition that Christians make from temporal things even prophecies are temporal things transitioning from temporal things to Eternal things and one of the things that's Eternal is the love of God it'll never fail you so that's why we want to be living more by the love of God than temporal things that we see we we we may we our healing for our bodies we may be completely miraculously healed or a miracle take place but in some cases because of these bodies you'll get sick of something again so that that means that our healing is only for this life it's a temporal thing so in other words we believe in healing and we go to God for healing but we don't have our emphasis always on even those things that are temporal we must have it on the love of God we must have it on something Eternal something that lasts and so he's teaching this and notice the next scripture in verse 11 when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child now he's getting ready to really bring a correction to the baby Corinthian Church spiritual babies and what did they do when I was a child I spake as a child understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things he's talking about maturity he's talking about growing from temporal things to Eternal things and he's saying the Corinthians chose to emphasize and stay as children spiritually that when they CA came to church all they wanted to see is just a prophecy or a tongue or something like that which is not a problem it's that should be that's that's a a wonderful thing but if you only came to church just to see those things that won't last that won't keep you we should come to church to saying I want to connect with the Eternal God through Jesus Christ the word there has to be a connection with something ET etal so Paul says that we are moving we have to live and he's speaking to Christians here in First Corinthians you have to know he's speaking to the Corinthians we must not put our trust or live only on things that will fade and it's surprising to find him say that th we didn't we didn't expect we know about things that fade in our life friendships fade governments fade the world's falling apart we see everything fading away nothing last I'm going to talk about that in a minute minute and that's why we can't put our trust in something that don't last we can't teach our children to make their priority in life something that won't last can I get an amen I'll get to you parents in just a minute I want to give you some encouragement that we can't do that to our children but we are surprised to hear some other things that fade because these are things from the kingdom of God prophecies will fade tongues will fade knowledge will fade away so even things that are in the kingdom of God we take them we enjoy them but we can't put all of our dependence on these things CU they will fade away someday but there's something that will never fade away that's the elective love of God over your life he loved you before the foundation of the world his love never changes for you blessed be his name love never had a beginning so love will never have an end I like serving a God and I like serving him every day knowing that I am unconditionally loved for from before the foundation of the world and nothing that I do will ever change that it is spiritual immaturity for Christians to live every day consumed with temporal things caught up in temporal blessings even blessings from God caught up in temporal even little children when Paul says when I was a child I spake as child he's typing a young child they're CH they're a child they think as a child they act like a child and that's normal for a child but we can't stay children spiritually and he says and that's thing when when he types that even children in the natural choose quick pleasures and what feels good that's in our children they'll choose the the sucker over good food for them they'll choose temporal things they'll choose the the quick pleasure um they'll they'll pull out all the a young baby or child like my granddaughter will pull all the toys out of in the entire room and spread them all over with no thought of the dastardly thing of mom and dad saying go clean it up later they never think about that part they don't think long term they think of the temporal pleasure and they bring it all out and they pull them and they forget they have to clean it up and then you teach them that song clean up clean up clean up and you try to get the joy out of cleaning up in them for because they forget and they don't want to work hard and they don't want discipline teenagers teenagers most mostly don't like the discipline of school they like the fun they like the parties they like to go be with the youth they like to go out to Starbucks and spend all kinds of money there on a drink that should cost 20 cents is $8 but it's fun they never think of about the budget they want the fun but not work or school and and and and and they don't see that the teaching and training we give them for school what they learn in school what they learn at church what they learned in the youth meetings what they learned from the pastor and from the parents that's the stuff that's long lasting for life can you say Amen but they they don't want those things most of the time they kind of most kids buck up against that and and but the fun will be temporal and they haven't learned yet fun will be temporal but there are principles that you get in here that are not just for life but some of them are Eternal principles Eternal principles you know the old saying if you give a man a fish you'll feed him for a day but if you teach them how to fish you'll feed them for a lifetime so but we tend to be people we must not laugh at the children because we tend to be people who look at temporal things and gravitate to temporal things just like the teenagers let's not laugh at the teenagers that's just their age sometimes but we all as adults can stay teenagers spiritually that we live every day on temporal things come on now if you can't say Amen say ouch I want everybody to listen I want my teenage boys teenage girls everyone young and old to listen because these are important things we must say God I I love certain things in life but I must connect with you the Eternal God through Jesus Christ the word and nobody else can connect like that nobody else can bring that to you nobody else can do it's you saying Lord I need Christ in my life I need to find the Eternal God I need eternal life you have to say Lord I need eternal life the Rich Young Ruler has I need eternal life and guess what he had all the blessings coming to him from following the Commandments I did what my mom and dad said I did it I've done all the Commandments Jesus said have you done the Commandments he said I've done all the Commandments from my youth I've done all and guess what his life was blessed his life was blessed prosperous a lot of money because he followed the principles of God and yet the whole time he's hungry for eternal life so now you have the blessings of following the Commandments and still a yearning for the Eternal on the inside and he came to Jesus he said I've done all these things but he said what do I got to BU how can I get eternal life he's still lacking the person well he's standing in front of the right person you you're young people you're in front of the right preachers you're in front of the right people they're Christ in flesh presenting eternal life to you every service the rich was in front of the right person he was the person of eternal life he could give it right there and he turned it down and you know why nobody can make that decision for you young brother young sister nobody can make that decision for you it's you starting to say I've got a hunger for something more than just doing the Commandments God bless you for doing them thank you for being obedient thank you for not being rebellious God will have certain blessings for you if you how many knows there's a great blessing of even longer days on Earth by honoring and obeying your parents it's a principle of Life honor obey your parents and you you have long days upon the Earth can you say Amen but eternal life and the person of eternal life is something different and the person is presented to you all the time through the preachers I'm standing before you not as just a oversized preacher I present eternal life to you every service but you will not go into eternal life or have it until you accept it for yourself and say I and you'll never accept me say I need this if everybody else fails and my friends in the church go the The Way of the world I need God I need the eternal life in me every young man man every young woman every person has to come to that person to say do I have this person of eternal life in my life every person must answer that respond to it so it is spiritual immaturity and so what God does for you temporal is a wonderful thing but what he puts in you is eternal I'm going to say that again what God does for you is temporal what he puts in you is eternal many Christians that put hopes in things that fade away they tend to fade away themselves this life will disappoint you people would disappoint you there's nothing that's trustworthy in this world except the love of God it'll disappoint you all the time this life is full of more disappointments now than I've ever had in my life I can't look to the what I see I have to look at the Unseen that my God will never disappoint me can I get an amen God will never disappoint me this is the past that's the future our past binds us from the blessings and the positiveness of the future is anybody listening this morning we can't live life in a rear view mirror and looking and trying to drive in a rear view mirror and we look in the back and we have accidents back there and how many's ever went by and you're trying to how many know what a Gawker is we're all done it haven't we and so the traffic's moving very slow cuz gawkers because an accident happened we want to see who is it what well first of all is it a family or something had happened to our family my wife you know she always calls when she hears the sirens out front or out there she's calling all the kids where are you but we we drive by an accident we oh Lord that happened to them the car is all messed up and they're looking around and it slows the traffic down so we but sometimes people drive they're not looking where they're going do you know there's been incidents where where they crash cuz they're watching another crash does anybody know what I'm preaching this morning and then there's the rear view meal driving is you're looking oh going going going going going and we laugh but we have many Christians who live their constant Christian Life in the rear view mirror their hearts are locked and stuck in what happened in the past nothing can be viewed right in the future at all because they're they're looking back there at the accidents at the thing oh maybe it's some pretty scery maybe it's a good thing but most of it is something that happened and you're looking back there trying to constantly drive and we know any decent driver can't do that you can't properly be alert for the future of where you're going when you're looking in the past Paul deals with it in Philippians when he says forget those things which are behind press toward the mark of the high calling in Christ and the only way you can press toward the mark of what God has for you in the future is that if you forget all of your past how do I do that brother Paul first of all you ask forgiveness for what you've done wrong and you bring it under the blood of Jesus Christ no matter how dastardly it was some of you have done some pretty dastardly things but you could ask God forgiveness and still not get past it God could forgive it and you haven't forgiven your past and you haven't forgiven yourself now I know how our brain works because Satan has access to our brain and he's going to bring up our past to defeat us but you can quickly dump that out wait a minute that's under the blood wait what what are you doing I don't have to think about that anymore that's under the blood but most of the time we we linger and it comes back then we get angry and then can you imagine somebody's just dwelling on something that something was done dastardly to you you're dwelling on it and dwelling on it and then then you how many's ever got angry at your kids or angry at somebody in the house and you realize later you got to apologize because you weren't really angry at what they're doing you were just irritated at everything they're doing because you're mad at something from the past or something somebody else did to you people are smiling right now and you're taking it out on the kids you're taking it out on your wife you're taking it out on your husband it's nothing worse than living with somebody who a mate that lives constantly in the bitterness of the past because husbands get a lot taken out on them wives get a lot taken out on them there's nothing worse than it's rough it's like sit down this is under the BL blood forgive God forgives us forgive ourselves accept God's pardon accept his forgiveness and then forget it let's forget it and move on and then we forgive ourselves for what we' done wrong and then we forgive others who have done us wrong you can't have faith unless you forgive Jesus said that a Son of God has faith that if you say to this mountain be removed and cast in the say see it'll be done that's the kind of Faith that's in the potential of a son and daughter of God you can move mountains the next verse says and when you pray that you want to pray a prayer of faith when you stand praying forgive how many you want more faith what other scriptures Faith cometh by hearing hearing by the word of God it's good to stay in the word of God that's that builds it as well Faith cometh by testimonies people give testimonies that raises our faith my God can heal cancer God can raise the dead and there's some faith preachers that tell testimonies and that we rise in our faith to believe anything's possible God can use those things but if you had all of that and you had an unforgiving Spirit you cannot come into perfect faith without forgiveness you can't grow you can't go beyond it can you say Amen you lack and if you really say I want faith I want faith I'm a teenager I want more faith that I can move mountains that I can do exploits that I can do better things that I could that I could live a closer life to the Lord without forgiveness you can't move into greater Faith forgiveness is the power that comes in our lives to release the past and release things so that you can be lock locked in the past not blocked and locked here in the past but it releases you from the past and now you can pursue reconciliation and the future and what's next for you you can't go there without true forgiveness and releasing it and washing it away you might not even feel worthy that you can move mountains I'm not on that level at all well God's word says you are God's word says you are you can't get there you can't build faith if you live in the past can't get there with an unforgiving Spirit people limit this forgiveness thing and they they make it mechanical and they make it complicated and we got to figure it all out and God never asked us to do that there's a flood of his blood and his forgiveness flowing from Calvary and it flows right down to his sons and daughters right into their soul and when it floods through us then it spreads and we release it to everyone in our lives don't explain it don't try to complicate it I forgive and I release it in Jesus name because I want to go on with the Lord somebody say praise the Lord this morning from the temporal from the temporal that see that's the past is the temporal but he say we're looking to the Eternal can you you say amen and sons of God need to move from temporal things to Eternal things morning even good things of this life will pass do you know that even good things that we have here they'll pass because this that's a different life we know bad things pass and Fade Away we know that but the let me say it this way and this may surprise you I don't know but the very best things that this life can offer is still temporal is that true the very best that this life could offer is still temporal we must receive the person of eternal life we must live looking beyond what we see why first why why do we look beyond what we see and not be caught up in the temporal things of the world well because number one this world is scheduled for Destruction it's on the schedule judgment and destruction are coming and fire is coming said that God gave a covenant which is the most powerful thing he can give his people but one of the things when he destroyed this Earth with water one of the reasons two things we look at when we look at a rainbow is that we knew we know not by reading the Bible but we know that he destroyed the Earth by water because he gave this rainbow for the first time so we can look at a rainbow how many's ever seen a rainbow we can look at that and see two things when God said it was going to rain to Noah it did and destroyed the Earth by water it happened even science proves that the whole world Earth was covered with water but the other thing we see in the rainbow is the grace of God because he said when you see that rainbow I'll never destroy the Earth again with water that's his promise he made it and he's never done it again and he never will do it because God keeps his promises well we got a lot another little prophecy in there it says I will destroy the Earth with fire now if he did it with water then if he did it that time he's going to do it again this Earth don't get caught up in this earth and the businesses and everything else and that's your whole thing because it's all going to be gone someday this Earth is fitted for Destruction if you get your mind too caught up in what you're doing in business and not an internal perspective then you'll be caught in this thing and worried about this all the time and down by this all the time you have to remember this is all going to fade someday it's all going to be gone someday this Earth is fitted for Destruction 1 Peter 3:10 but the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night in the which the heavens shall pass away with great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent heat it's prophesied this this world is scheduled for destruction of fire why you saying that to us just in case you didn't know your job your house everything you see here even this church will come under that fire and he says this will be burned up and then he comes to verse 11 and says seeing then that all these things shall be dissolve all things will be dissolved that pretty much covers it all if we know that they'll be dissolved what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness how should we be living Bound by the depression of temporal things of people of our past of our trials is that how we should live no we live with our eyes on the Eternal now don't C me wrong you have to use your brain God gave it to you and you pray but you still pray say God lead me in business and lead me to do what I need to do what do I need to do for my career even you young people I'm praying about my career you better bring God in that career and say God what's the career for me that I can serve you the best how can I do eternal things through my career but these days we teach our kids it's all about that the carnal the you know it's life this life this life we can't just have that perspective thank you for watching our message today if you
