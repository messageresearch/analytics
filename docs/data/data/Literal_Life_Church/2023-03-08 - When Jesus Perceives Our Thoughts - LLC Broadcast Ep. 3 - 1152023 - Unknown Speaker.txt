my God [Music] for me more of every Victory Hallelujah [Music] Hallelujah [Music] let's see [Music] this is [Music] if you would Luke chapter 5 verse 17 and it came to pass on a certain day as he was teaching that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by which were come out of every town of Galilee and Judea and Jerusalem and the power of the Lord was present to heal them how many want to believe this morning that the power of the Lord is present to heal them and behold men brought in a bed a man which was taken with palsy and they sought means to bring him in and to lay him before him and when they could not find by what way they might bring him in because of the multitude they went up upon the house top and led him down through the tiling with his couch into the Mist before Jesus and when he saw their faith he said unto them man thy sins are forgiven thee and the scribes and the Pharisees begin to reason of course and so I want to elaborate this morning on our thought life and thoughts and so now I want you to notice the scenario of something happening here that is very strange very out of the ordinary and actually would uh provoke many thoughts from everybody in that room everybody outside of course the Pharisees and Sadducees are going to be critical but I think it would provoke different thoughts from everybody in in that room as they watched the tiles being torn off the roof and somebody with so much Faith wanting to get near Jesus is willing to tear the roof apart and be and be lowered down in front of Jesus I like that kind of faith but that kind of faith provokes a lot of uh critical thoughts especially from Pharisees and so this this is what God gave me to bring in the channel of this thought about our thought life and what we think about the scribes and the Pharisees begin to reason saying who is this which speaketh blasphemies who can forgive sins but God alone but Jesus but when Jesus perceived their thoughts so this is things that was they were thinking it wasn't they weren't saying it they were thinking it but when Jesus was present he knew what they were thinking so I'm letting all of you know whether it's me or you or whoever it is Jesus this morning knows what you're thinking he answering said to them what why what reason ye in your hearts whether it is easier to say thy sins be forgiven thee or to say rise up and walk and that you may know that the son of man has power upon her to forgive sins he said unto the sick of the palsy I say unto thee arise take up thy couch and go into thy house and he immediately he rose up before them took up there and he lay and departed into his own house glorifying God and they were all amazed and they glorified God and were filled with fear saying we have seen strange things today Hallelujah Jesus likes to do strange things to the human mind and when he wants to do strange things we should let him do strange things if it brings Victory if it brings healing if it brings Deliverance then let God do what he wants to do now we want to deal with another Avenue of the subject of our thought life and I trust you all be listening good this morning and listening intently and uh I I believe we have a subject that we've been speaking of of our thought life and I believe with all my heart saints that we can't preach about our thought life enough I could probably take the next year and keep talking about it and preaching about it I believe it's very important the reason I believe it's important to talk about what you're thinking every day and what you're thinking even right now I believe it's important because I believe this is a key to Greater faith and greater Victory and I am convinced that Satan hates it when ministers expose things like how the mind works and things like how Satan comes into our thoughts I'm convinced that Satan is very much upset and Satan does not like ministers to talk about your thought life because this is the area Satan wreaks habits so much it's in your thought life it's the hidden world it's the private world it is the the world nobody sees but God but it is a world Satan can attack you in and so this is the part that's why Satan of course being the the creature or the being that likes to keep everything hidden he doesn't like to be exposed and because your thought life is is hidden and is is private and no one else can see it that's why Satan uses it because you can hold things and we know from the scripture your thoughts certain thoughts can bind you and Satan loves to bind so this is important and so I came to this text of Jesus perceiving their thoughts and uh when you talk about the uh the subject or this part of Jesus that can discern the thoughts and can know what you're thinking I I thought about it yesterday and I was thinking how it's it seems to me and I could be wrong but it seems to me that this part of Jesus that can discern your thinking and discern your thoughts is not preached about a lot in the Christian realm this part of Jesus is actually hardly ever spoke of in Christian Realms we hear so much about Jesus especially in Christianity we talk about all the facets of Jesus we talk about becoming more like Jesus we talk about Jesus and his miracles we teach our children Sunday school stories of what God did in Jesus and when he lived on this Earth for three and a half years and so much as Jesus of Jesus has talked about but when you think about there's not a lot of messages about Jesus knowing our thoughts back then he perceived their thoughts and if he can do that back then he can do it this morning because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and no man no denomination has a right to say he did it back then but he can't do that now Jesus is the same in the service this morning as he ever was and if he knew their thoughts within a moment back then then he knows your thoughts now this is the part of Jesus that's very important to us and very important to the kingdom of God that Jesus knows your thoughts because we know if Jesus can know your thoughts Jesus can correct your thoughts and you can get the right thoughts in your mind the right mental attitude towards any promise of God will bring it to pass you can't say I got the Holy Ghost and ignore your thought life you can't say I got the Holy Ghost and ignore what you're thinking every day you can have the Holy Ghost and ignore what you're thinking right now so our thought life has to be in line with our soul that is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever in all aspects it is wrong to say he is not the same in every aspect if any denomination has taught you that he's not the same in every aspect then that denomination has deceived you because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he's the same in every aspect say well why don't I see things in my particular church because it takes Faith to believe that Jesus can do what he did in the past it takes Believers to say I just simply believe it I don't have to go through all kinds of teaching about it get it he and I just have simple faith I just believe you can do it and I believe it whether I see it or not I believe he can open up a Blind Man's eyes whether I ever see it or not but we have seen it and we do see it I believe he heals cancer whether I ever see it or not but friends we have told too many testimonies that say otherwise blessed be his name so it takes Believers to believe it and so now uh so so I'm just going to move on from that so now this part of Jesus being real and this part of Jesus of course being real to us and knowing the thoughts it's important and it always has been there in other words there's an element that came through Jesus that really has always been there even though you have a unique gift in a prophet that can see by Vision certain things we know that this element is always among us because and if you're listening and you want Bible for it Hebrews quotes and says the word of God the word of God not not just your Bible when you think of the word of God not just your written bible that's just a written bible to help us but the word of God the person of Christ because Jesus is the word the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing to the dividing of Thunder of Soul and Spirit and is a discerner of the thoughts and the intense of the heart so really this is really never left the church if the word is present Jesus the word then he knows the thoughts and all of a sudden when that happens and we when our faith would feel you know what your your faith would be saying this is real Jesus Christ is Among Us it would sober us up it does a lot of things it sobers us up that God's real this isn't just church this isn't just not a beautiful place God has given us and I'm not just filling my time and putting and punching the clock to be here for church no no wait a minute wait a minute this is real he's here so everything changes when he's here so now our faith would build to be able to get out of our thought life and get out of our doubts and get out of our criticalness to say I don't care about all that he's here he knows my life he knows what my burdens are and if he is here he can bring Deliverance for it that's what that kind of Faith builds you say well I wish I could see it that real but didn't he say to Thomas I'll I'll let you touch my side but I want you to know blessed is he who has not seen and yet believes blessed is that brother and sister who just hears that he can do that blessed is them who who in simple Faith believe it they don't try to figure it out they don't let their mind go through a whole process your simple faith I believe he's here I believe he can do anything and that's actually what God's looking for so time after time and you can raise your hand where it's happened to you where they say brother Paul were you at our dinner table last night I know you weren't but were you in the Next Room did you hear what we discussed the whole evening because you preached a lot of that this morning word for word brother Paul were you in our car this morning on the way to church I hear it all the time you know some ministers Maybe that don't have the character would start saying man I must really have something here I don't have nothing brother Barry sent me a quote yesterday it says we preachers we really don't even preach ourselves preachers no no we don't preach God preaches to his people they're saying about me do you think I'll ask honestly know what you talked about in your car on the way to church some of you certainly don't want the preacher in the car on the way to church but God's there God's there here's every conversation and not just conversations the very thoughts the intents of the heart this is the kind of Jesus that we serve and it doesn't scare me it doesn't make me afraid I've come years ago to an open life before him like this and whenever I begin hiding something I know I can't hide it but when I try to hide something it never goes good when I try to hide this little thing let's do this years ago with my families just see if this will work every time I try to hide something God exposes it no that's you can't do that this is where this goes you let your kids watch that this is what they become so this wonderful work of the Lord convicting me and exposing things I'm used to it now and I'm I'm all open all arms to it you don't scare me when you come and you have criticisms and things to say to me if I'm off the word I want to know about it if you have something to say I'm not gonna it's not gonna be the end of the world if you come to me because why I'm hoping if it's the Lord correcting through you I want to hear it if it's just your carnal mind criticizing I'm okay with it as well at the end of the day other decisions might be made I don't know but listen you we've got to grow to maturity to quit being afraid when God exposes what we're thinking God was perceiving their thoughts when Jesus perceived their thoughts so now our story here uh let me just say this first why does this part of Jesus get ignored Satan likes it when things are hidden in our thought life that's keeping you for more faith because men can hold thoughts what kind of thoughts oh I pray the Lord can just help me elaborate through what he wants to say this morning because there's so much to say about what we're thinking about all the time it can be good it can be bad it can be critical it can be hesitance of preachers it can be I'm never going to fully give my heart to that and that strong will hold your thoughts so many things it's so important to talk about because we can hide things in our thought life men can hold thoughts of unbelief how many know you can hold thoughts of unbelief all these other thoughts it's those thoughts that quench the spirit of God from moving in your life thoughts can quench the spirit and so this in this incident where we find that it's a great provoking of critical thoughts let me just deal with this just a minute so we have a a house that's full of people it's packed full they're waiting on the outside nobody can get in and so now this incident where the man with such face gets on top of the house with all of his friends maybe and he couldn't do it very easy they had to help him and they start tearing the rough apart and they open up an opening and they lower this man right in front of Jesus I I just wonder the thoughts that were going on I know what the decide the Pharisees were thinking but everybody this provokes all kinds of thoughts like what in the world don't tell me you people wouldn't be thinking it very strange if if you started to hear noises we're not packed but you started hearing noises and they couldn't get in so they're tearing the roof apart and I keep preaching and they're lowering somebody to be prayed for right in front of the pulpit don't you tell me that all these thoughts would be come up to you they're coming down thoughts thoughts can't they just do it this way can't they do it and yet your thoughts your thought is completely ignoring what's really happening it's fixing to do something your thoughts have ignored the faith of this man your first thought as a Believer should say I'm I'm gonna something's happening here and I'm gonna lay aside my critical thoughts because something's going on I'm not gonna be critical I'm gonna start praying for a man who's willing to tear the roof off of this house and that's why I'm teaching you to correct your thoughts quit being critical quit jumping to the first thought of being critical of other people and every other thing why don't you step back and say now wait a minute I'm bringing my thoughts in line with the word god may be doing something here don't you dare let your thoughts quench the spirit of God for a hungry soul that's starting to search for him don't you dare criticize them don't you dare jump all over them don't you dare meet them in the back door and criticize them you pray that the holy spirit will draw that heart don't your thoughts and here here's this scenario and so that you can think all kinds of things and we know what the Pharisees said Jesus says and I'm not so sure friends that Jesus didn't he had this in his mind before the foundation of the world I'm not so sure that Jesus doesn't allow strange things to happen to provoke and to let you see where your thought life is right I'm not so sure that sometimes I Don't Preach out of the ordinary or some Minister gets out of the order or says something or something's done to provoke and to bring up to let you see how critical your thoughts can be sometimes and that you're not willing to say I'm going to pray I'm not going to be critical I'm not going to let my thoughts go on and on and on and on but I'm gonna pray something different has happened it's out of my it's out of my comfort zone it's out of the norm it's out of the box and I'm I'm gonna just watch and pray what's going on here could it be God wants us to get out of our box get past our thinking quit overthinking things quit trying to figure it out and just step out in simple faith I'm believing this I'm going with it could it be that God wants us to have this kind of Faith as this man that I'm wanting to get there I'm wanting to get in the presence of Jesus I'm I'm wanting to do this can you say Amen if you come finding fault you will find it you're gonna find fault we're not perfect we're broken people somebody's gonna say something that they shouldn't say sometimes somebody's going to say something in the flesh somebody's going to get a little too much anger and even a holy ghost filled person can Step In the Flesh and say something they shouldn't say you know why I know they can do it because you do it yourself it's okay get quiet all you want to but I'm gonna say this a lot of times we bring this to you and then we expect God oh Lord come down praise the Lord and your whole thought life is filled with resentment towards people in the church and I say you need to hit an altar and say God Purge me of this resentment of this brother's sister they are a brother they are a sister I I may not know them very well but it's not right for me to continue having these thoughts towards them we have some mental emotional maybe Financial some soul struggles internally in the thought life going on and I don't teach us just as a teaching I teach it so the Believers can bind together to pray today for one another even if you're listening from our congregation online we're going to bind together and pray and we say Lord we want to see an end to the devil's wreaking havoc on our sisters minds and our brothers Minds thank you for watching our message today if you would like more information please contact us by visiting our
