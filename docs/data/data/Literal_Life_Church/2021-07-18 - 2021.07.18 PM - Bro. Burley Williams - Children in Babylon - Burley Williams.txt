========================================

i would like to invite you to turn you to the book of daniel chapter one daniel chapter one let's start at verse 1. in the third year of the ring of jihad kim the king of judah came nebuchadnezzar king of babylon unto jerusalem and besieged it and the lord gave jihad came king of judah to his hand with part of the vessels of the house of god which he carried into the land of china to the house of his god and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god verse three and the king spake unto aspinas the master of his units that it should bring certain of the children of israel another king seed in other provinces verse 4 children in whom no blemish but well's favored and skillful in all wisdom cunningly knowledge and understanding signs such as the ability in them to stand in the king palace and whom they might teach the learning of the tongue of the chaldeans and the king appointed them a day the provision of the king's meat you know the wine which he drank so nourishing them three years that at the end there are they might stand before the king verse six now among these were the children of judah daniel hananiah michelle and azariah until whom the prince of the unit gave names for he gave her to daniel the name of belter shazer and to hananiah shadrach and to michelle meshach and azariah of bendigo you may be seated i'm gonna go ahead and read verse eight to ten but daniel purpose in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat nor with the wine which he drank therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might define himself might not defile himself now god had brought daniel into favor and tender love with the princess of the eunuchs and the prince of the unit said that to daniel i fear my lord the king who has pointed your meat in your drink for why should he see your faces worse like than the children which are of your sword then shall you make me endanger my head to the kingdom praise the lord god bless you the lord will just help us for a few minutes uh it's a sermon i preached on before and it just kind of come back in my heart and i want to title this children children in babylon children in babylon you know it's amazing sometimes when you read the book of daniel when you're thinking about daniel you think about an old man daniel the wise old daniel your mind kind of goes there but actually we find here in the scripture that daniel was children when they first went there they were not men they were children and we see here uh the prophet of god says in the message gabriel instructions to daniel and i just want y'all to just listen to this he's i want you to notice how daniel yet an alien yet boosted from his people boosted from his church without one church service without any church to go to without any hymns to be sane but what he's saying himself in the midst of all of this still hold on to what the prophet said amen so now you see daniel which he's as you read on down in this quote he began to talk about how daniel was probably around the age i believe 12 and 14. let's think about that how many 12 year olds we got here 12 11 13 14 15 16 17 18. it's good for you anyway but one thing about it for certain we can go back and think about the times when we was that age amen so i want to just try to paint a picture and pray that it will help you and one thing i want you to know you are those special children like it was in daniel times you are now those special children you have to understand the context of the scripture when they brought down them to captivity they wasn't looking for all of the children of children israel it was certain ones that they were looking for certain ones that's the only thing on their mind ones that got got wisdom skill understanding this is the one we want but what was the purpose for to use the gift that god already given them but they wanted to domesticate them to babylonian thinking so that they can teach the babylonians so in other words they want to take what god already let them be born with take it and pervert it for the use of babylon the devil is no different today he want to take the gifts in your lives young people in his mercy he want to take it he want to get you to fall so he can take them gifts and go use them for his purpose and babylon represents the world can we say amen let me tell you something brother and sister you are special children that don't mean you get special treatment you are special children but you get the same treatment as anybody else because the word corrects us all but i'm just trying to help by the help of the holy spirit and show you what you are in god's sight the devil is not interested in denomination it don't matter to him he already got him they belong to him according to the scripture the of the mother of the harlots and she got harlots he owns all of them but it's this message what the devil is attacking amen praise the lord he don't attack the baptist and the methodist no it's the message believers is what he attacks because he wants you amen see well you have to understand uh yeah all children in the world yeah all them got the devil attacks everybody but he got a special taste for you a special taste because he wants to uh use you to build his kingdom for his glory that's what the devil wants but i'm so thankful that god got firefold ministry today that's going to keep standing right on the forefront letting young people know you can live this gospel you can overcome this world and you can't you don't have to walk around being beat down by the devil you can be free this message is about freedom it's not about bondage if you look at the messages do's and don'ts you'll never get nowhere this message is life this can anybody show me one quote one scripture will god want you to be in bondage just one where he wants you to be in bondage you won't find it because god don't want you to be abundant this message comes to set you free now people want to keep you in bondage the devil want to keep you in bondage but god wants you to be free now in this story here we're going to have to go a little background to try to work it up with children in babylon we find out in verse 1 the children of israel is going into captivity because they rejected the prophet jeremiah god kept warning them over and over and over not to do certain things but they wouldn't listen to jeremiah and then eventually why did they ended up down there in bondage can we say amen see rejecting the word was what put you in bondage you see a lot of times we ain't careful we're going to say reject the prophet put you in bondage no that's incorrect rejecting the word put you in bondage because god makes it very plain even with samuel he said samuel they didn't reject you they have rejected me can we say man you see brothers and sisters i love this message with all of my heart i live and die for it i really do because it's the truth but i do want to explain something to you you definitely got to have a balance in your life what a messenger is who god is i'm not here to try to prove to you brother branham was a prophet that's not my ministry to prove to you brother madam is a prophet that something had to be revealed to you by god can we say amen you know i find amongst young people they actually get mad at brother branham and don't even understand why they mad at him that's right he said oh not me all right i'll give you the symptoms of people that don't got mad at the prophet when you ask somebody a question then they give you the answer and then you say did brother brother say that or is that in the bible that's the proof you got an attitude against a prophet see what doesn't happen in your thinking as you grow up in the message you'll hear a brother better say it but abandon shape but abandon shade what about it but about him said you hear it all the time so now you're going to judge everything what did he say i did the bible i'm just going to tell you something friends on my stand as a minister when i say the prophet said oh i say brother madam said only thing i'm saying this is what god said through his prophet that's what i'm saying but you got some ministers is this a lie well they hear they hear don't i stand on what i say but you got some ministers can't preach without saying we're here to lead you to jesus christ not to brother branham brother branham is god's ordained messenger can we say amen but he led us to worship god huh he's a type of eliezer at asia when he got isaac a bride god son of a prophet to go get him a bride now you know what how many of you believe that uh eliezer and rebecca i mean isaac and rebecca appreciated eliezer how many of you believe that i wonder why they didn't name one of their children earlier but yet they appreciated him so much i know people name their children william brown because you name your child william branham that don't mean your child going to heaven but this message is true amen and i'm gonna tell you if you got any questions about the message the best way to get your answer is keep the right spirit because we're in a time now people ask you a question hoping you can't answer them if somebody asks you a question with the wrong spirit you can't give them an answer because they're approaching you the wrong way but if you got the right spirit the answer is there i promise you that can we say praise the lord so what's happening today we see that here in the bible oh i know so i'm going to call me for you against the prophet have i said anything against brother branham no but the way mine's been programmed now see because so many people leaving the message now everybody walking on eggshells don't say that about the prophet that's nonsense because people that are mature in balance in their life they have a balance they know what's being said they know what to say when that not what not to say can we say praise the lord if brother brandon was sitting right there in that chair i'll say the same thing and i believe brother brown would say amen because he led us to jesus christ let me tell you something young people there's three types of people around this message there's a group of people that have made brother branham more than what he was there's a group of people have taken away what he was but there's a bride know exactly where he was the ones that makes him more than what he was that's when all these strange doctrines come from deity doctrines and all these things and then the ones that take away from where he was they always want to find and preach his mistakes his faults and his errors but the brides say elijah a man of light precious passions knowing he was a man just like you and i brother brandon mr is the most humblest man that i know to have such a prophetic ministry but would get up in the pulpit and admit when he said something wrong now how many of you got to do that but he did it he would admit i was wrong to me that's the spirit of christ praise the lord but i encourage every one of you lay in this message dig in it pray just lay in it amen how do you know what a preacher telling you the truth you ain't studying it you have this message designed you have to study it yourself not just when you come to church and hear the pastor preach you yourself got to be at home dedicate yourself i mean discipline yourself to study this message it's exactly right mom and dad can't give it to you you got to get it yourself the bible says seek your own soul salvation with fear and trembling just the way it has to be but i'ma tell you this is the greatest this message is not a move it's a restoration to take us back to what the original is can we say praise the lord to show us that we are sons and daughters of god not bound by any man thoughts or any man creeds of doctrine we're supposed to be set free amen i love it when i can see young people grab a hold of a true revelation get a true experience in their life and take this message and get go with it i love it it goes to prove that you don't have to be old to be in the message you don't have to wait till you get old to receive the baptism of the holy ghost you can be six years old five years old you can receive the baptism of the holy ghost some people say well i've been trying to get the baptism of the holy ghost it just ain't happening just to help i'm gonna tell you why it's not happening because you're not ready to die the more hungry you fall the quicker you'll get it when you're ready to die from your thoughts and your way to god i want you i gotta help you i'm gonna die you ready for it then but you're gonna say well i guess i'll try to get it forget it ain't gonna happen you gotta want it thirsty for it hungry for it if you don't have it you gotta want it amen and if that thirst is there it's simply because it's god pulling you the prophet god said why do you hunger why do you thirst he said it is the holy spirit pulling you but the devil got so many things out there trying to get you to quench your thirst with worlyism things of this world and friends and stuff like that them the things you got to get away from you because i'm going to tell you right now when god calls you the first thing he calls you for is separation total separation from all unbelief because what god does when he first calls you he wants to separate you to himself so he can strengthen you get you where he wants you to be then he'll send you back he'll send you back to go to people that that you didn't care for and that got on your nerve was a bad influence on you when god strengthened you he'll send you back to them because now they can't no longer influence you but now you can influence them that's exactly right but you yourself need to be strengthened i'm sure that we're on different stages in here some born again some may not be born again some are in different transitions in life i'm aware of all of those things i'm speaking in general so whatever category fits you you just take that say thank you lord amen but i'm so interested here with the children of israel they carried them uh from babylon i mean from jerusalem to babylon jeremiah told them year after year this is what's going to happen to them and as far as they know yeah yeah yeah they go that jeremiah again prophesying and yeah yeah yeah but you know finally that day came nebuchadnezzar and his crew coming down to jerusalem just wrecking the place i want you to think about this uh just a little drama daniel him in the house all of a sudden uh they hear it they see a dust storms because you know in the bible when an army moves it's just like a bunch of sand so they know it's an army coming and all of a sudden they hear rumbling and then you're looking around what was going on he goes no he's out just put it like daniel outside playing he see this dust storm coming up what's going on dude he runs in the house mama daddy something is not right and mom and daddy looks out saying oh this is what jeremiah was talking about come on come on in the house dan come on now dave what's going on mama just just come into the house come into the house and now just think of all of that screaming taking place people being taken out of their house taken out of their homes and nothing they can do you go read the book of jeremiah jeremiah god let the children of israel know that when the enemy comes don't even try to fight them because your weapons won't work go back and read jeremiah i think it's jeremiah hey he said god said ain't gonna do you know he said your armory ain't even gonna work because god controls those things he let them know and he's going to work for you because i tried to fight for you i tried to keep you in the right path but you are the one that rejected my word now you got answer for it so don't even try to fight mean you don't read the book of jeremiah i'm going to tell you one one amazing scripture in the book of jeremiah when you get up to i can't remember what chapter it is when jeremiah was in jail he and they was in captivity jeremiah sent a letter to him and that letter that he sent to them there was no doubt there was already a captivity wanting comfort wanting to be comforted but then jeremiah sent a letter i can say the children of israel oh jeremiah sent a letter oh he's going to let us know it won't be long we're going to be getting out of here but god said 70 years he ain't going to change but in the condition that they was in in bondage when he something in the letter when they began to read it the letter says build houses plant vineyards have children what build houses print when we're in babylon but god said no that's what i want you to do and then after all of that then pray for the ones that got you in captivity no encouragement is in debt but that was the letter of encouragement because god said you're so depressed now to where you're going to walk around don't want to do nothing and just don't want to do nothing he said he said if you do that then when 70 years is up i ain't going to have nobody to bring out of them so keep going he said if you want peace get along with them pray for them he said but i'm giving you an expected end that you won't be there him always i'm going to pull you out but you got to keep going on you see when you're going through something in life as a young person getting depressed the first thing you want to do is sleep it away sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep you know what when you got problems and you go to sleep and when you wake up you know who's looking at you when you wake up that same problem you went to sleep with god has not called us to run from things he called us to deal with it overcome it can we say praise the lord you can you can overcome any situation by the help of god you can overcome any situation in your life i don't care what it is you can overcome because we've been ordained to overcome like we were saying earlier you go read the book of revelation to him that overcome each age said to whom they're overcome that is a prophecy let you know it'll be overcomers in every age and as dark as this age here it's going to be overcomers can we say praise the lord but if you notice in verse 2 it said and the lord gave joha came king of judah into his hand with part of the vessels of the house of god see they took the vessels of the house of god and they took the people of the they took everything but look what the devil's intent is is to put him in the house of his god so that's why the devil want to get guard vessels which is you which is me he want to get us and use us for his service and god permitted to be so because they rejected the word are you with me verse 3. and the then the king speaker to aspirin as the master of his units that it should bring certain of the children of israel of the king see and of the princes if you notice how that read it said certain of the children of israel not just any of certain of but which ones did he want of the king seed that comes down from david's bloodline because the devil said this is payback david don't gave me all kind of trouble he don't kill my goliath he don't beat all my philistines he that david is gone but now i got david's seat line now i want to get them that's the one he wanted was david seedling and that's what the devil wanted today he want the bride of jesus christ he wants you but i'm here to let the devil know he can't help you because you belong to god not the devil not this world you belong to god hallelujah and he says fresh for children whom was no blemish why children he want to get children with an innocent vine that he can get them away from their parents get them to himself so he can put in their mind what he wants in this mind in their mind this is the same tactic that they done in the days of egypt trying to kill the male child same thing happened in the new testament trying to find the seed killing the children and the devil is doing the same thing today trying to get the younger generation to influence them and to roll doing that they can influence the next generation come behind them but the devil he doesn't realize is the prophecy made over the bride god gonna have old people young people children they're gonna overcome this age that's right notice children in whom no blemish but well-favored skillful in all wisdom cunning and knowledge and understanding signs some of the smartest people i know in this world is children in this message very smart very intelligent and the devil wants you he want to use you for his glory that's what the devil wants all right let's keep going verse 5 and the king appointed them a daily provision of the king's meat and underwine he drank so nourishing them three years that at the end there they might stand before the king let me backtrack just a little bit before we go farther with this now here is daniel his family family is being moved all the way to babylon they get settled in their houses because you know they gave them houses and all that stuff but think about it when they get settled in their bodies is settled in but the spirit is not because that's not where they belong they belong in jerusalem but now they don't get settled into their homes everybody's sitting in the house wondering what's going to happen what's going to go on now and then all of a sudden daniel's parent hear that there's a decree has been made to go select certain children you see how smart the devil is he want the seed the kings see certain other children of israel and of the king seed special picks let me tell you you are the devil's picks because he wants you bad but you have to see that you had to do the same thing daniel did you're gonna have to purpose something in your heart i'm not gonna defile myself with that purpose comes power i'm gonna show you that in a moment now here's a little daniel them in their homes they don't got settled in i can see damn parents just walking around knock come touch the door y'all i'm dramatizing they opened the door as one of the king's servants so there's a decree being made we're looking for certain children and we come to get them and we'll be back at a certain certain time i can see there dang your parents the door shut they read in the decree and they whispering and talking to each other he's coming for our child that's where they're coming from and uh i could see daniel back in the back how many of you chill you know how that goes when your parents whisper you don't like it they talking about me what are y'all whispering about his parents whispering down you look around mom what's going on just go back go back just go back down and then they reading it you're reading it tell you what what is it go in your room and mom and daddy they start talking amongst these sons they say you know they're coming to get daniel he said honey i i know i know that he said you know there's nothing we can do to stop it because we rejected the prophet we rejected the word that's why we're in this condition so now there's nothing we can do he's now gonna have to be at the mercy of god just like we are a day or two passed by parents walking around sweating crying and they know the guy is on the way and they called daniel they said damn yes mama yes daddy come here son and then you say what why y'all got that look on your face that this son that's something i gotta tell you and ain't nothing i can do about it daddy but something i have to tell you he said daddy what is it daniel it won't be much longer now someone's gonna come and get you and they're gonna take you away from here into that king's palace and they said but i don't want to go it's dang there's nothing i can do it's gonna happen there and then you say but daddy why why daddy daniel we rejected the word we did it now it's gonna fall on you because we as parents rejected the word now it's falling on you we're sorry daniel but there's nothing we can do and then all of a sudden they hear the horses coming open the door and there goes daniel got his backpack and daniel walking out with his head down because there's nothing he can do and then his dad said daniel he whispers and dang his ear he's what his father he's someone to stick something in your pocket and i want you to keep it stick a scroll to jail he stick a scroll of the book of jeremiah in daniel's pocket because you're gonna find out that's what daniel had and that's what kept him all those years in babylon but his daddy gave him the quote book as a child i could see daniel walking out selected by the king seeing the carnal mind being selected by the king is an honor you think about some of them israelites standing there they saying daniel being chosen damn why are you sad bro they told you man you're going into the kingdom palace the day you're just walking with his head hanging down why you sad damn and then the other one that wasn't chosen i sure would like to go into the king palace you see a lot of times when you think the world got something better to offer you you think that's an honor that's not an honor that's death but the devil want to let you see you've been promoted promote it this is good for you that's what the devil wants you to look at and see but in daniel case he said no i don't want to go there but as daniel walking there with that quote book in his pocket heading up to babylon to the king palace i can see those babylonian girls just looking at damn what's your name you're cute you're handsome you know dan you're walking heading to the palace they talking to her and then when then you looked at them he began to smile then that quote book his hand go back hit that quote book and just turn his head no no no they just smiling flashing those eyes in 14 years old the pressure girls coming at them the pressure boys coming out there i'm going to tell you something friends whenever you really want to serve god from the depths of your heart boy that you tried to like all your life that never paid you no attention as soon as you start you want to serve god he starts liking you why do you think that's so that's the devil to get you trapped then this girl didn't pay you no attention the beauty queen or the school now all of a sudden she looks at you and you go like wow let me go home take a shower never paid you no attention but now giving you all that attention that is a distraction satan just start putting things in your life because you see now you're trying to quench that thirst with the word you're trying to heed to the call god call you satan sees that he said now let me throw opportunities out here to kick them distract them and sadly many failed and then daniel as he walks into the babylon going to the king palace look what they begin to do verse 5 and the king appointed them a daily provisions of the king's meet in other words the king won't want daniel to have what he wants daniel to have so he can get down your thinking to get in the line what he wants daniel thinking to be see that's what school is doing huh what do you think all this school stuff doing they're teaching you y'all i hate crying don't say nothing about homosexuality you know only thing they do is trying to program your mind to babylon they're doing it through school they're doing it through music they do it through movies all of it is to get your mind set to be comfortable here in this world and then get you into an anointing say let's just love everybody everything is okay no no i love everybody but i hate sin but the devil want to get your mind set let's just get along together and be one big family you become my family when you're born again then we are family hello that's right so the king had to give them things to get them to where he wants them to be change their thinking change their diet change that give them a different appetite see this is what's going on through facebook now i know i talk about facebook a lot i'm not against it i'm just against some of the things that they do on it but it's too much time to put in that stuff you know what the prophet god says this if i go into your house and see what you got on your wall what pictures you got on your wall he said i have a good idea what's about you how many of you know you post things on facebook that's a wall so you identified by the things you posted on facebook look and see what you post and get a good idea what's inside of your heart that's right so this world is designed to get your mind control your mind to get you away from the things of god but here's the deceiving thing about it the devil want to get you the devil want to get you to think this way but yet be religious go to church worship sing do whatever you want to do just don't get the holy ghost all right you know what go back to the book of exodus and read the story when pharaoh go to the part where pharaoh was making deals how many of you know pharaoh was making deals with moses other words we're telling moses let's make a deal moses wasn't interested in making no deal the only thing moses had in his mind let my people go so we can go worship god so what pharaoh want to do you remember moses said we want to go a three-day journey we want to go a three-day journey in the wilderness so we can worship our god not a one day not a two-day but a three-day journey that's what moses wanted but pharaoh said let's make a deal moses let's make a deal he said you you go on worship god just like you said then he said but don't go too far worship god in the land moses said not so we worship the god and the abomination of the egyptian all around us moses said no no no see that's a trick of the devil he almost go worship but just don't go far what was pharaoh doing he was telling moses i want you to go worship your god but i don't want you to go too far because i might need to need something from you i might need to use you i want you to be available that the same thing with the devil doesn't go too far in god i want you to keep your lust i want you to keep your attitudes i want you to keep these things i might want to anoint you and use you sometimes but you got to let the devil say you got to let the devil know no i'm going farther than that pharaoh come back to him again okay okay okay okay okay he's going ahead that's right believe the cattle no he's leaving the little ones you moses just like you said you always go leave the little ones pre-adventure it's a lot of trouble out there most you don't want to take them down and know that there's a heat y'all just go on he wanted the moses and then to separate from the little one so that he can do it uh what nebuchadnezzar is doing get to their mind but he said i got to get rid of the old ones so i can get to the little ones so i can get them the way i want them that's why he hate ministry satan hate old-time preachers old-time ministers that believe in the original way satan hates them can we say man that's why the devil tried to get you to pull back from your parents man my parents don't understand what i'm going through they oh now this is a new generation let me just pull back let me get some counsel from some of the young people that is around me they don't understand us yes we do understand you i did not come out of my mama wound 54 years old that's right but he want to get you to pull away from elders someone they're going to give you wisdom and the right guidance and moses said not so he said we will go with our little ones that's right the old we're all going defense okay okay okay okay okay just go lead your cattle just leave your counter and you go he's trying to get moses them to go worship god without a sacrifice that's what the devil wants us to try to get us to do be religious but not having a revelation what this true sacrifice jesus christ is all about and moses said no we all going to go our old our young our cattle and moses was so greedy he said we ain't even gonna leave a hoof i can imagine pharaoh come on dude you got to have over four million cattle out there and you're gonna tell me you you won't even leave a hoof that's exactly right because moses wants the devil to know everything that belongs to god goes and you have to have that same attitude my mind belongs to god my thinking belongs to god my soul belongs to god my spirit belonged to god satan ain't leaving nothing for you to use to try to anoint me to go the wrong way i'm not giving it to you i'm giving it all to god because it's a three-day journey not one justification sacrificing the baptism of the holy ghost you got to go all the way it's a three-day journey it's looking right the tactics of the devil that's how he does things notice verse six now among these were other children of judah daniel hananiah michelle and azariah that is their god-given name but the devil don't like that i want to give him another name see the devil want to give you another name huh he want to call you chicks and dudes and players and all those kind of names babylonian words huh you take it to another level you want to give us another name baptist methodist pentecostal then the name the devil want to give up but god said you're christians you are sons and daughters of god that's what you are but the world want to give you names sometimes some young people especially themselves they get caught up in in the master they get caught up into some of these worldly atmospheres they decide to change their name too call them their name schwagero and all that stuff sit in a message church swagger yo that don't even sound right to me to call somebody brother swaggy what are they trying to do they want a name to try to fit in with what the world the trend of the world is doing that's not right try to change their identity changing their changing everything about them they changed it down your location they changed down your name but they could not change daniel's heart verse seven unto whom the prince of the units gave names so he gave it to daniel the name best of shazam and to have an eye shadrach and timothy meshach and azar azariah they think if they did good to see their mom and dad and their mama would say hey daniel he's an arm bell bell chaser what any name i gave you boy where you get that from that's what they call me the devil want to change your complete identity a wife with anything of this message but be tied into this world the worldly names he want to change everything about you verse 8 this is the verse i love but daniel purposed not in his mind see when you prefer something in your mind that can change but when you get something rooted down in your heart amen he purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portions of the king's meet he had to do that because he knew if i accept what the king gave me it's going to change me it's going to change the way i think change the way i look i don't want it you got to be the same way brothers and sisters i don't want nothing that this world has to offer nothing i want the mind of christ not the mind of this world not with the wine which he drank what a what a what a position to be in drinking the same wine that the king drank what an honor i just want to let the world know i do drink wine but not that one i drank the wine of revelation for the stimulation of the word not that one verse nine now how now i want you to catch this brothers and sisters this boy is 14 years old but look at the decisions he's making at the age of 14. he's making decisions adults won't even make that's right 14 years old because there was something down in here he said i'm not going to give this up purpose in his heart not only daniel the other three did it too let me explain something to you in a minute i'm gonna get to this verse let me just skip down let me skip some things here i don't want you but i'm gonna have to for time's sake someone i can be a long-winded preacher i can be a short one my wife my wife gave me a compliment this morning she said that was too quick and she told me she said i knew you had some more fuel in that tank brother i said that was too quick yeah but too quick for a preacher to get that from his wife that's good because usually they be they want to remind you don't belong with it i'm just saying let me just i'm gonna i'm gonna jump down to verse 17 let me i'm gonna have to go with my bible i i mark down what i want but let me read something to you let's go down here to versey uh verse 11. dean sent down to merzar whom the princes of the unit had set over daniel hannah michelle and azariah prove thy servants i beseech the 10 days let them give us pulse to eat and water to drink and let our consciousness be looked upon before thee and the confidence of the children to eat are the portions of the king's meat and as thou seest deal with thy servant that's a bold statement otherwise daniel let him know you let us eat what we want to eat and you do one the other one because the other a lot of them children in israel fail new four didn't but the rest of them failed he said you let them eat that king's meat then when we come together you look at our contents and we'll let you be the judge that's what i'm gonna tell you something young people yo the way you say certain things even the way you dress the way you talk it speaks on what you're eating because you're going to express it out and i'm not talking about in church either i'm telling when you ain't in church [Music] you know i love the holy ghost this is just 20 something years ago even in the school systems when parents they know the parents love the lord and have a testimony when the children do wrong school tell them that's right you know sometimes young girl they get their friend to sneak a pair of pants to school for and they put their pants on at school and all of a sudden you get a phone call and teachers say now i know what you believe i might not agree what you believe but your daughter had pants on you kidding me yes did you come home always hey mom how was your day at school great i didn't know they got a phone call from school to tell you some things happen you know another thing happened you know sometimes young people get out there on the job it's working but on the job they want they want to act like everybody else they don't want to testify i'm a christian i love the lord and then they're ashamed jesus don't be ashamed of me you'll be ashamed of me i'm going to be ashamed of you but to be on the job acting all cool and everything i want to get down with their normal language and stuff and then one day they'd be with their parents they should be walking somewhere and then one of them guys on the job see you they say yo what's up homie what's up y'all you like what are you talking about what are you saying i don't know what they're saying mom they telling on you god permits that to happen do you know why because he loves you cause he loves you to let you know don't be ashamed of me don't get caught up i know it's pressure i know it's a pull on the flesh but i got better things for you than that that's exactly right verse 15 at the end of the ten day their conscience appeared fair and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king's meat that's why we appear different because of what we're eating on we're eating on the word we appear different to the world and i want to say this it ain't just even the appearance of your clothes but when you're eating on the word feasting on the things of god you carry an anointing that the world recognize something different about you it'll be an anointing that they recognize verse 16 the all took away the portion of their meat and the wine that they should drink and gave them posts now i want you to catch verse 17. you know before i read it i know the language as young people you want us to understand what you're going through i understand every bit of that i sympathize with it i do i actually do because it's such a poor but i want to show you something that i help you even when you're down you're like it's just so hard it's so rough it's dog this is going on see it's just it's just so it's i just can't it's just it's just so much going on i'm gonna be honest with you i'm one of the wrong preachers to bring that to because that type of stuff i can't pull my spirit down with you say oh bless your heart god understands just keep pressing on you know what you're going to do you're going to walk away feeling justified and yet be in the same state because i want to take you to something higher to let you know regardless of what you're going through here's someone here to help you it's the lord jesus christ because i want you to watch the scripture because daniel them purposed in their heart no wavering no doubt they was dead set we're not going to defile ourselves whenever you make a decision like that in your life i'm gonna serve god regardless whenever you do that god will send an anointing on your life and strengthen you to help you keep walking see we don't read with daniel and purpose in their heart they they they we're going to defile themselves because them doing that this is what verse 17 says ask for these for not men children god gave them knowledge and skill and all learning and wisdom and daniel had understanding and visions and dreams have purposed their heart god poured an anointing all upon them he would do the exact same thing for you see i'm purpose i'm gonna serve god god just started anointing you giving you strength start overcoming things you're like wow what i just feel like i'm just going up now it's because of what you purpose that's how god does things but now when you walk every day in your life with that strength no but he gives you portions when you're at your lowest stage when you have need because you keep pressing on he still give drop portions like he did ruth handfuls of portion purpose because if god anoint you every day of your life and you're up on the mountain you'll freeze how many y'all heard brother brother say that he said you stay up on the mountain all the time your fruit freezes that's why the mountains have valleys how many y'all ever seen the whole series a mountain just stared at them anybody ever been driving just seeing mountain you know what you do you just stare at the top of them wow look at that now you never pay no attention to the valleys it lets you know to get the one mountain to the next you got to go down to the valley to get there up and down up and down but we sang the song the guard on the mountain he's still in the valley god gave them this anointing because they purposed this in their heart can we say praise the lord i'm just trying to show you but these are children in babylon one quote book see daniel and the other three even though they was in babylon they was in different provinces daniel was by himself the other three had fellowship with each other but daniel was by himself and overcame with one quote book now daniel could come overcome with one quote but from jeremiah how much you can do what god don't gave you in this day over 1200 messages you can overcome this layer to see and age but you got to do the same thing then they just had one book he would read it over 70 years reading one book and he overcame babylon now what about you and me where all god has poured out in this day he gave us the word this message to overcome this age can we say praise the lord turn to daniel 3. see some of you getting sleeping i can give you some resurrection power all i gotta do is say i'm fixing the clothes you know the people resurrect fit in the car a few more minutes go by he ain't closed chapter three you remember the same cry in daniel chapter three to come to worship an image it's the same thing that's happening today i want us to fall down to the image of the beast worship the beast all these things parallels right in the scripture how many you believe it the mark of the beast and all these things you can preach it right here in the scripture but i think something that's overlooked in this age about pulling people to the image and one of the key thing in this day what the devil have really mastered his music according to science music is the only thing can invade your conscience without your permission according to science you say oh no well let me give you an example how do you say you just can be in a department store mine in your business ain't thinking about no music but you just walk in the department store and also and then you catch yourself sorry lord sorry your music can invade your country just like that haven't you ever been sitting in a restaurant waiting on your food to come the music playing then i'm saying you get the knife for the fart you start going that music has invaded your then when you catch it nobody can see that that's the power of music power music and then the prophet of god has a vision of the end time of the worldly bride god's bride in both incident music was involved one of them was dancing to a rock and roll tomb and the other one was marching on with christian soldier music is involved now watch daniel 3 verse 4. then a herald came aloud to you it is commanded o people nations and languages not just babylon because this is the time of the gentile ring they had power over everything verse 5 that at what time you hear the sound of the cornet flute heart sacrifice plastering decimal listen what it said and all kinds of music you fall down and worship the image that nebuchadnezzar the king has set up all kinds of music hitler says this you give me the music of a country i control the youth of the country because you know it works through music that's why you me we have to be careful with music if you're listening to music and it's not ministering to your soul that is not of god if he just make you happy in your flesh this is what it is fleshly music music is ordained to minister to your soul and pull you closer to jesus christ but the devil is so crafty i hate to do this let me all over here kirk franklin don't be ashamed you have just raise your hand hang on or something ain't gonna do that you're probably saying some of his songs and don't know it kurt franklin is one of the greatest tools the devil have in this day and time kurt franklin i used to be a disc jockey professional i can take kirk franklin music and i can show you every worldly song that we danced in the club where he got it from and he don't even change much to it only thing he added is the words of god he said what are you talking about jesus no no no no no where did that music come from where'd the root of that music come from that's right i had to prove that when i prove it i got my son one time let me share something to you pull up a quick song i'll go find the worldly song what's the difference well ain't no different and they give him praise kurt franklin has revolutionized the way that music is he sure did under what anointing the devil what what celebrities today people will listen to them more than a president and then a preacher what's happening now they got celebrities when they make new audio bibles they get the voice of celebrities to read the bible morgan freeman his voice is so distinct they want him to read the bible to you and this man don't even believe in god all of this is a part of babylon feeding you her meat getting your mind directed the way that she wants it all this is happening all around us every day children in babylon i'm a close i'm saying this from the depths of my soul showing you how daniel overcame all of those years and he didn't have the holy ghost now what excuse we have having the holy ghost but yet letting babylon control us it's no excuse i understand your struggles i understand your pressure i understand but i'm here to tell you you need to look a different way because you want to stay in a sad situation where i'm just struggling i'm just struggling i'm just struggling i'm just struggling you'll stay that way and the only thing in your life's gonna be the struggle you'll never get nowhere you'll stay stuck in one spot you'll have to come to a place i'm tired of this struggle i'm going to be free from this struggle see you go through changes in life as a young person you go to the stages you condemn yourself in the mirror you look in the mirror why can't my hair be like hers look at this before you know it you get a young girl in the church that seemed to be popular all you got to do watch your hairstyle if she got any little followers they'll do her hair their hair just like hers they don't form the hair club boys get in the mirror why can't i be like him the only thing you're doing is trying to find an identity in your life but you're looking at the influence when somebody else want to be like them you don't need muscles to serve jesus you need faith muscles beauty is being born again every girl that is born again for the holy ghost you are beautiful you ain't got to try to attract nobody from the outward appearance you can it's the holy if a boy got the holy ghost you got the holy ghost holy ghost tracks holy ghost i am so hurt of you hearing so many divorces happen around this perfect word about young people not even young older something wrong somewhere second right how many you want to be married go ahead raise your hand how many of you want to get married now the ones that didn't raise your hand you were married first it happened to you first see when some of you raised your hand the other one looked around who's available let me explain something to you coming to meetings like this having meetings like this there is nothing wrong when you know you're in the place with god have the holy spirit there's nothing wrong thinking maybe the one is here ain't nothing wrong with that you see down through the years preachers preaching so hard are you coming here because you want a girlfriend what a black friend you are wrong i don't know i ready for you to be in a meeting like this in your heart right looking instead of looking the wrong way out there in that world you might get a call on this paul but i'll stand behind what i said i got no problem with that i like to just keep it real because this gospel is real it's real but you got to make sure 100 you got that relationship with jesus christ children in babylon and i can say children and laodicea but i'm here to tell you you can do the same thing daniel did let me tell you young people too watch where you hang around just because you're in the same church that don't mean they're good for you oh exactly right you need to be around somebody they're going to speak positive go talk about the things of god not secret stuff but things of god that's what you need to hang around i mean back in the days i don't preach so many count meetings it ain't funny i can't tell you how many but i'm i'm an observer back in the days i'll be in the ministerial building you know where to keep the minnesota i'll be looking out the window and you can see certain boys walking around the campground they know they're the man they walk around with so much confidence when you talk to it's uh and i always have little fellas behind them falling right behind him and they're just walking around and then when they get close to where the girl's sitting you always have a girl in a group she's it and it'd be a bunch of girls behind her you'll notice it probably about the second day after the camp because they'll have their hair counted the same way because it's an influence want to fit in with a group and be identified that's what that actually is i preaching at the camp i said you boys i said you walk around you the rooster and all of the hand just i just want y'all to know one thing i am the farmer with the pick for because i hate to see a boy that thinks he's all of that play with a girl's emotions and she gets so caught up he looked at me yeah he looked at you your friend your friend friend he looked at all of you that's right a holy ghost gentleman don't do that don't do that walking around the campground can't even get nothing out of the service cody what the preacher freak ah it was good what did he say it was good but all you did is sat down and then when it's over going to the cafeteria to eat and she'd get close they do a trait i just observe for the paul i do and it hurts my heart when i see young people get so vulnerable to want to fit in until they want to lower themselves lower their conviction just to fit in with a group that hurts one more i had a young boy come to me one time his dad come to me said brother brother could you talk to my son he said he has a lot of respect for you yeah i talked to him once where is he at he showed me where he did i went down there and when i walked up to him i seen him he had his head down he'll look up see me coming i just shook my head that's a lost poke fella i said what's the problem bud brother burleigh i tried to hang around those guys they don't want me to be around really she yeah yeah and the holy spirit comes on the scene i said have you ever had a little kid younger than you come up to you and want to play with you then you'll be with your other friends and you push the kid off his consonant change like where is the man going i see when that happened to you you're playing with a kid younger than you your friends come around you need to tell that young kid hey buddy we're buddies but let me get back with you later i'm gonna hang with them a little bit i'll get back with you i said little kid to go okay okay you didn't offend him i said but if you push him off and jump with your friends instead of gonna hurt him and it's gonna offend him i said now you're reaping what you sow i said your other problem is i says over 500 kids out here on this campground i said but you want to fit with a certain group that's what you want i said when you want to go make friends with everybody i said you make friends with everybody you'll never be by yourself i said that's what you need to do i didn't go up there i'm so sorry for you young man oh god no that ain't going to help him so he walks off a couple hours later i seen him he made him a new group of friends they were all laughing i walked by i looked at him he looked at me see when you want to get in certain groups you all got a denomination spirit on you that's what you got on you right when we supposed to be the family of god exactly right the most wonderful thing when you see young people get converted through experience in their life you're able to reach younger people then more than me and all of them can it just circles right around when you see somebody struggling go help them because they don't fit in your group no no we are supposed to be the body of christ sometimes a young boy might not be noticeable because you might get some big glasses on girls look down then later on in his life he might become the ceo of a company and then you find out hey what about when he was a little bitty nerdy little fella you pay no attention to it now hey and he said how are you doing let me let you meet my wife that's that's right let me tell you something get married to jesus christ before you try to marry somebody else have a relationship with him first he will bring the one that he ordained for you somehow some way he'll bring it together but you have to be patient first be right with him that's how god does things and i'm going to say this and i promise i just said i promise i ain't saying i was gonna do i just said i promise let me say something to you out of all your faults failures errors upset disappointments i want to let you know from the depths of my heart just for you to even be here i'm proud of you may god bless you just for you to even be here may god bless you and don't take nothing like me what i said to you this evening because i'm giving you exactly what god put on my heart many things i could preach but this is what he put on my heart i want to let you know okay how young you are you can overcome anything talk to your parents if you don't have parents you have a pastor you have deacons someone you can talk to because it's a shame sometimes parents are not in the position where they need to be that's bad but i want to let you know you always want to have somebody that can you can have confidence in and talk to about situations in life i pray to god it's your parents because that's the way it's supposed to be but you do have pastors to lead you and guide you let me tell you something young people i believe the question to be asked sometimes what is a successful pastor i thought about that thing over and over and over to me a pastor of success is when he teach the word of god as god give it to him so anoint it and just lay it out to you and you receive it a pastor's success is when you don't have to keep coming to him with your problems but you can take the word of god and fix your problems he's done his job i'm not a dr phil got a problem dr phil dr phil get the pill no no no that's psychology but when your pastor counsel you when you hear the word of god preach take it to your heart because something could come up in your life and then the holy spirit takes you back hey pastors preach another minute to preach the same thing you'll be able to deal with your problem i love it when my congregation don't hardly ever come to me about their problems that lets me know they caught a hope to the word they can deal with it themselves i don't know married couple coming to me with a problem and we don't talk about it before that makes me upset because it lets me know they didn't listen to me the first time and what make you thinking of looking the second time brother take the word you young man i challenge you because you're gonna be the leader of a family one day you're gonna be the priest of your home one day but i'm challenging you to get into maturity mature in the word because you'll be a leader of a home one day and it's pressure some just want to get married i just want to get back okay you think what you think it is love is blind is eye-opening you learn a lot of things but if you can take things now while you're young and apply it to your life it's gonna help you in there and you get married all these things gonna help you you'll be able to glean and pull back on them think about it and it is gonna help you but it's still gonna be mistakes because you gotta grow people don't even believe in courtship no more they believe it let's do it nope don't work like that and i'm gonna tell you young boy if you ever talking to a young girl without the consent of a father i'm ashamed of you i'm ashamed of you that's wrong that's what worldly that's what babylonians do not believers you see another thing mess up the young people is just texting i don't believe you got no right to be texting a girl it's the parents the father don't know because when you're texting you you're creating a bond in a relationship she's taking your words you're creating something when you got your life right with god you won't be ashamed to approach a man amen you said sir i'd like to talk to you i've been praying for a wife i'm kind of interested in your daughter can i talk to you sir if he's a mature man sorry son let's get good and talk but if he knows his daughter says young man i appreciate you coming to me but she ain't ready for this kind of stuff you need to be a gentleman walk away that's right it alone don't be but sir god showed me she's nigh you might tell your son god showing me something right now and i think you might need to leave and some girls get so offended cause sometimes their dad might be a little rough i never get nobody with a daddy like this you ought to be thankful to your daddy like that but there are some incident parents are too rough and they run off a good man run off a good girl that's what the balance have to be by the holy spirit can we say man one young girl i'm just talking now musicians could come one young girl had a boy come up to her he said god showed me you as my wife she said well only thing missing god just need to show you me you're my husband and he ain't showing me that she just walked away that's because the person put god in it many people oh it's a spiritual person i better listen to it no god i gotta show you something too god can speak to you too but young man if you know you ain't even right yourself struggling ain't overcoming things don't try to get in no relationship don't do it cause if you do then you still got them problems ain't been overcame you're loosely useful lust no overclocking you ain't no calling anything you keep going and going oh we gonna get married then you do get married you know what happened you carry out all of that right into that marriage now you're in a marriage not only is struggling with things that happen in the marriage now you're struggling with yourself trying to overcome things you should have overcame before you got into marriage it's true be a gentleman be a gentleman hey man you can have a healthy marriage healthy relationship if you just listen to the teachings of the word and don't get impatient so you got a lot of voters out here you let me tell you young girls something that might offend you a little bit but it's going to be the truth just because you're in the atmosphere around the message of the hour it gives you a certain reflection because you're under that anointing these worldly boys know that when they see you to you they look at you as an innocent little church girl that i can easily get to just the way they view you just because of the anointing so when they come upon you and talk these words that tingling to your ear if they can't go the right way like i taught you about your pastor your dad and so forth you better stay away from that boy and let me tell you something he gonna keep talking so he can break him he can break your armor with words and you'll be like oh he's joking he's he's just fine no he working on something he just threw a little word at a time they slipped man you look so cute today ah that's all he got to say he ain't gotta say that now wait a couple days now that's stuck in your head he said i was cute he'll just take his time come out and say hi you see because now you're working with your emotions you're getting attention now you're letting down your armor so he come to say you look cute today my dad think i am too i was just kidding no you wasn't you gotta know how to put up a block when your ears you you wanting your ears you say that don't happen in this mess yes it does and it's wrong remember this young girl if he can bypass your parent's authority to talk to you he is no good he's no good he has no respect for ministry no respect for order he is no good i don't care how cute he is he's no good even if a girl do the same thing girls do it too they're just aggressive as boys are brother she's no good how many you know is contrary to scripture for a girl to go run off a man who brought adam his wife god did brought him brought her right to him there's two women in the bible look that for a man and their character wasn't right it was jezebel james it was potiphar's wife joseph neither one i'm right sister you'll find your husband on your knees god to bring it together can we say praise the lord these things are serious don't take it lightly don't ruin your life prophet god said you make the wrong decision you can ruin your life forever don't make the wrong decision pray seek god talk to your parents talk to your pastor can you say amen one more word this is true i had a young girl in my church she went through some hard things in life and got to a place who would ever want me made a lot of mistakes then all of a sudden the guy pops up interested in her you know somebody interested in me okay then they come to me parents come to me i said yeah say what is brother he's interested in our daughter we want to let you know uh what's going on it's okay i said where you from you told me where you're from who your pastor told me okay i know the pastor he's a good guy it's okay i'll get back with you so i called the pastor i'm an investigator that ain't just good enough because i know your pastor your pastor don't know who you is so i called the pastor hey hey some brother go to your church and say yeah brother brother he's a good guy he's always in service and good guy like us okay okay okay okay went back to the parents i said ah pastor say he's a pretty good old guy and uh she's a good brother good in the words then my deacon began to talk to the one come down and visit the deacon would talk to he said are you a citizen here are you on a work visa student visa he said student visa red flag went up red flag so a few days pass i get a phone call from the pastor he said brother berlin i did a little more checking his that boy has a wife in london in the message i said thank you i'll take care of it so we had a little fellowship at the house and i seen the system my heart is killing me because knowing what she's been through and now somebody interested it's just killing me so i just walked out how are you doing i'm fine let's make you think about this guy she's okay so okay can i ask you a question yeah i said what if he just cuts it off with you just tell you it ain't going to work should the brother birth be honest with you it won't bother me just because he told me he loved me the other day and he wanted me to say it back she said i can't say that man i don't know him that good yet but i got muscles he's mine i said is he coming to church tomorrow she said yeah he he he gonna go back he can't stay for service no no no you just telling him come sunday morning he even got to stay to the service i just need to talk something i need to do she said okay so he comes in my own how you doing buddy i'm good good it's all right that's what you what you think about this sister he's a lovely sister very lovely she knows she's been through a lot of things in life he said yeah he said the parents told me things that happened what went on with her i said did you appreciate them telling you that it's oh yeah most different i said why you couldn't return the same favor he said what do you mean that's about that wife you got there in london oh i said don't speak in tongues now you've been exposed buddy no don't give me none of your reasoning but the diary that we has no we talk about message brother we ain't talking about no traditions message she's brother you're wrong listen you hold on right here go get your daughter daughter coming out and kiss you i said this man got something to tell you just tell him what you've done and she just said hit the road jack now there's an old worldly song called hit the road jack don't you come back here no more and he hit the road that's protecting her now she's married got a lovely family because she waited on god we as ministers true pastors will do things like that because they're looking out for your soul that's why you work together pastor work together with your parents we work together to make sure my daughter my son gonna be safe ain't nothing get that stuff you ought to thank god for that instead of having one of these pastors oh look like a good guy to me marry him get her you when you want to set the date that's not a good pastor he just want membership huh but you ought to be thankful for that am i boring are you sleeping you get sleepy just stand up shake it off but i'm done let's give the lord i forgot to ask is anybody need prayer let me certainly pray with you let me explain something to you some meetings every meeting is not the same sometimes you have youth meetings people need deliverance power guard come down it'd be an altar call there's nothing wrong with that but there are some meetings you gotta let stuff sink get you to think about things contacts down in that soul but i do we like to offer prayer if someone need prayer if you've got something that's bound in you need deliverance i actually don't talk to you how to be delivered it's all christ you could overcome anything it's all right for a preacher to lay hands on you pray with you but we all got to come to a place in life where you can grab hold to things yourself and handle it by the word of god you understand what i'm saying that's what i'm presenting to you that you can overcome anything with him god bless you thank you let's stand again praise the lord young people god has so many protections in place in the word of god for your life he loves you and he not only has them in the word but he has a minister who'll be honest and say those things to you we believe the same way brother berlin and i and these principles and boundaries and just things that build respect and we got a couple here they got two children that's the two kids that sang the night lane and kylie but lindsay was i so told this story a few weeks ago but talking about a girl watching out for herself she was at high school and kyle got his eye on lindsay and he's just in the world a worldly guy you know but he's like brother bernie says one of his got his eyes on that girl you know and so she he came and said he wanted he asked her out and she said no no no we don't do that we don't do that but you can come to church with me if you want i love that i love that story because there's a girl who's got some strength about her not just to give in to the wooing of a man because he says you're pretty or says these things and these things are text back and forth all the time be careful your words you can't back them up with a commitment you don't shouldn't loosely say things like i love you and things like that that bond save it save it for when you know it's the right one she said you come to church and so he said all right came to church saved repented saved baptized filled with the holy ghost and his family serving the lord praise god god will honor you amen you know every situation is different every love story is different there's no cookie cutter thing that takes place we know everything every relationship will be different but god's boundaries don't change and the reason he talks about a boy going to the father is because it builds respect if you're going around the other way if at all possible you should talk to that man because that man's the protection over that daughter's life you can find it in the old testament he has power to even break a vow of a girl the daddy does because god gave him that authority to watch over that girl you say well what do i have to do that for all i'm telling you and brother burley is saying to you tonight so capably don't buy into the babylonian ways of how to do things do it according to the word of god and god will bless your future family and you're one that you fall in love with he bless it more if you abide by god's principles in his way you know i'd love to i can't wait someday to talk to daniel and shadrach and meshach and mendigo someday soon i'm going to be sitting down with them and they can tell me the whole story i said praise the lord brother my how did you do it live in smack dab in the middle of babylon by yourself in the kings i said i say god bless you ro god bless you let me give you a hug for not eating the purposing in your heart not to eat the king's meat but you know some of you with me and give a hug to daniel some of you young brothers and sisters give a handshake god bless you daniel we heard about you just a few months ago or last year we heard about you brother burley spoke about you again in daniel god bless you for your stand that you made and he might ask you young girl your young guy what age did you come out of what time did you come out of you say well we lived in the last stage in laodicea we lived in satan's eden it was called by the prophet your jeremiah called it babylon our prophet called the satan's eden and we lived right in the middle of it and daniel's eyes perk up and he wants to give your hand a handshake and say god bless you we did everything we could the purpose in our heart to overcome babylon but you lived in satan's eden and you overcome you didn't keep struggling with things there's a difference in struggling and overcoming people say i'm struggling you know it's a different you want to start saying i'm overcoming i'm not struggling anymore we are overcomers can you say man and my sister has that song are you she because one day they'll look at you and say are you she the bride the lead of the last days who stood the worst of times i'm looking at young people tonight are going to not just survive but they're going to overcome laodicea in this hour i'm looking at you tonight i'm looking at that bride [Music] amen brother burly spoke to those people that'll be on the other side those young people say by the grace of god we made it through and i'm just a privilege to know you tonight and just be able to be here with you [Music] one thought that i had is when daniel purposed in his heart that day he made a decision and now his friends brother said him and his friends would get together and have bible studies and encourage one another you should do that we got together encouraged one of one another in babylon that i was thinking tonight when he made that decision just a little decision i'm not going to eat the king's meat do you know that that was the beginnings of jeremiah's prophecy of redemption being fulfilled the spoken word book said jeremiah said in 70 years i'm going to bring you out of captivity i'm going to redeem you back you know what the start of it was somebody who made a decision i am not going to defile myself with this world why do you make that because there's a revelation saying that's how we got in this mess that's how we got in babylon that's how we're that's why we're in captivity now and we're away from our parents and this is how all this happened because people got away from the word of god so what i need to do is make a little decision right now no no wait a minute wait a minute i don't want your wine i don't want your meat i don't want your pornography [Music] i don't want to be i don't want my name changed to a gamer i don't want that identity i'm purpose in my heart and that little decision began the process of redemption being fulfilled you don't realize how powerful your decisions are make a little decision towards god and all of heaven is backing you up that's reason i have decided to follow jesus yes i
