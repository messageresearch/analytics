========================================

excuse me verse yeah verse 10. First Corinthians 13 and verse 10 but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things for now we see through a glass Darkly but then face to face now I know in part but then shall I know even as also I am known and now abideth faith hope charity these three but the greatest of these is Charity heavenly father bless your word today may you anoint us Lord with your true anointing Lord may your word go forth in Clarity and power and may we get a hold of it father in our hearts and draw near to you the Bible says if we draw near to you you'll draw near to us we thank you Lord for this opportunity to be in your house today bless each one that's hearing our Voice May the anointing catch their hearts Lord may they respond because your love is being expressed to them through the word we ask it Jesus name amen God bless you God bless you brother and sister Bauer good to have you with us this morning in the service you may be seated you know I never dreamed that we would enjoy sets Revelations just out of one chapter of the Bible First Corinthians 13 and I'm trying to take this service maybe this service and one other service to bring this series to a close and that is the series on the more excellent way that Paul has preached to us in the Bible here and uh I've just been amazed at all the things that's come out of the chapter ministering an entrance for the last days bride of Christ I believe Paul was ministering an intro an entrance for the Corinthians but especially for the Bride of the last days and entrance for us to come and move from partial Revelation to perfect Revelation how many would want to move from partial revelation of Jesus to perfect revelation of Jesus that's what he's speaking of and if none of the other ages came to that I believe that it'll be this age that there will be a people that comes to perfect revelation of Jesus Christ and that the gifts and the Mysteries just some opening comments for you the gifts and the Mysteries are glorious and they're appreciated but they're never to be the main thing I'm reminding us of things that we learned in First Corinthians 13 and that is the gifts working and prophecy working and even the Glorious knowledge and Mysteries that we receive from God they're wonderful they're glorious they're to be appreciated but they're never to be the main thing they're never to be the main thing the Mysteries are never to be because Paul said I could understand all Mysteries and not have Divine love I could give my body to be burned all the sacrifices out there and not have Divine love so Paul's bringing us an entrance into the main thing that we should be emphasizing over prophecy over the Mysteries being shown us then that is divine love there is one crucial mystery singular there is one crucial mystery under the seventh seal that is Paramount for each individual bride member to catch there's a there's a mystery of Christ in you the hope of glory and that's the Paramount mystery that all of us must receive so when I say Mysteries plural you could understand all those things and not have Divine love but there is one mystery under the seventh seal that all of us in this hour should catch which will bring forth the Life of Christ in a bride and bring forth a victory in Divine love this is the more excellent way of a Christian Sons will come to perfect love in this hour how many believe that they will live in this way in this excellent way they will live there more and more this will be their final Victory before the body change I know we think the final Victory is a body change and I'll tell you when you start getting older then you start to think of the final Victor to me is a new body how many is the old people can raise their hands if you're going to admit you're old today that's the final Victory to me is get a new body but actually it's not the final victory of the Bride it is final final but before that there'll be a victory in Divine love for the bride of Christ we won't be taken to that the emphasis on prophecies or the emphasis on and all the things from Pentecost will have those things but the victory will be the Revival will be a victory and Revival in Divine love we learned all the riches of this Divine love and all the characteristics of it in the first three verses of first uh First Corinthians 13 we learn the characteristics we learned the nature of how he he uh love responds to thing how he acts and that will be manifested so go back and listen if you want I think we've been blessed to be able to break down to you all the characteristics and all the nature of divine love and how it acts and responds to things in life and to people in life and then we moved on and we learned that love never fails everything will fail governments will fail people's human love will fail us people will fail us can you say Amen Even Heaven and Earth shall pass away but love never fails because it is him Hallelujah was so inspiring to me to realize that we can get a hold of something and have something that will never fail in our lives then we learned that we transition from depending on temporal blessings of the Lord too much to living in his eternal love and that's when we get into verse 8 charity never faileth prophecies they'll fail knowledge will vanish away for we know in part we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect has come that which is in part shall be done away so there's this transition for the bride in the last days of going from living on temporal blessings of the Lord last Sunday I was more on temporal things than material things of Life are businesses of life our cars our trucks our our our entertainments whatever we do fishing hunting whatever it is and so now we enjoy those things but they're temporal things can you say Amen then we find there are temporal things that are in the kingdom of God and we can't depend on or live on Temple blessings of the Lord too much we must live every day on his eternal love for us and express his eternal love be being loved by him unconditionally and giving unconditional love to others a love that never gives up 11 a love that never stops giving that's the way he loves you can you say Amen think of a Christian only talking to God when they need something think of a Christian only coming to God when there's an emergency that's a childishness that's that's an emotional walk with God running to the Lord when there's an emergency in life running to God but see God wants fellowship and love from us even when there's not an emergency going on he wants relationship with you he wants Fellowship something that's an everyday love relationship with him not something that's I'm running back to you God I'm sorry I've been away from you so long I'm sorry but you see now now I need to get back with you because I got an emergency in my life somewhere the church has got to grow out of those immaturities that there's a consistent love for God no matter what's happening in our lives consider a Christian that says Lord I need you now it's emergency bail me out of this God bail me out living off of temporal blessings of God think about always living in the rush of a prophecy over your life that was from God how many is that a prophecy over your life and it come from God you knew it come from God I've had that and I appreciate those things but I can't live expecting just on a prophecy to live by I have to have a consistent love of God and passion for him if I never get another prophecy over my life if God never does another miracle for me if God never heals the sick again I am here for the duration I stand and I want to let God know and I want to let the devil know this fellow is not moving from his stance in the word of God that's immaturity that's this love working no matter ups and downs blessing God blesses me God doesn't bless me doesn't matter that doesn't change it I'm right here ready to serve him and love him think about a Christian Living off the rush of Prophecy over your life or the prayer or a healing that's come as I said you can receive healing a miracle from God you can receive but you might get sick again and need another healing see it's temporal my heart is on brother Donnie this morning and his daughter Erica who last night he sent out a thing she's feeling weak she needs the prayers of the body of Christ around the world or unless the cancer taker I'm just while I'm preaching I'm thinking of listen we need that atonement that healing we will always need that and it's so powerful how many remember and remember brother Donny's daughter Erica in in the next few days in prayer we appreciate those things or we love it when the presence of the Lord sweets down and baptizes Us in his presence it's glorious isn't it but it's temporal here it's temporal and we can't just live on temporal things with our walk with God and that his love does not change when he doesn't we need to live that his love does not change when he doesn't answer like we thought he should answer it don't change if our healing doesn't come in a miracle form his love doesn't change that if I ever was able to be in another feeling the strong love of God keeps me no matter what I love Laura's Story song She Wrote a few years ago I can't remember what year it was and I was asking Ashley to sing it again it's been a while she's saying it the lyric says and this is the one that says says we pray for blessings we pray for peace and comfort for our family we pray for protection while we sleep we pray for healing for Prosperity we pray for your Mighty hand to ease our suffering and all the while you hear each spoken need yet love is way too much to give us lesser things because if you're in the then the court says what if your blessings comes through raindrops what if your healing comes through tears what if a thousand sleepless nights are what it takes to know you're near and what if the trials of this life are your Mercies in Disguise Joseph even before Calvary Joseph was able to look at life this way at the end when he was completely mistreated by his brothers he had every right to be bitter and write them often at the end of it he he connected to the predestinated plan of God somehow and bitterness was gone and the past was gone and he was able to look at his brothers and say listen what you did God intended you intended it for evil but God has done that for my good what an eternal perspective what a theophany perspective what a what a a deeper perspective that most of us live temporarily affected by temporary things but he tapped into something else there to say listen what you meant and evil God's turning around it's met for good that was supposed to happen in my life that was I've been fighting it saying God why did you let that happen in my life but now that was supposed to happen because I wouldn't be here today somebody listening to me this morning my story is my story I can't change my story but I know some things I wouldn't be here today loving God this way unless my story would have been written the way that it was somebody ought to praise the Lord somebody ought to shouted here this morning it's a great song what if a thousand sleepless nights the second verse says we pray for wisdom your voice to hear we cry in Anger when we cannot feel you near we doubt your goodness we doubt your love as if every promise from your word is not enough and all the while you hear each desperate plea and long that we'd have faith to believe when friends be the the sub says the bridge says when friends betray us and when darkness seems to win we know that pain reminds this heart that this is not this is not our home this is not our home Hallelujah what if your blessings come through raindrops what if your healing comes through tears what if a thousand sleepless nights are what it takes to know you're near what if trials in this life are your Mercies in disguise Ashley please sing that song because I just murdered it his Covenant is love and his Covenant is stronger than anything that can happen in our lives his Covenant of Love is stronger than our mistakes we have something stronger over our lives suffering over our lives than anything life presents to us if his Covenant in isn't stronger then I'm finished but I can say to the devil God's covenant he made with me is an unconditional Covenant and it's stronger than my mistakes it's stronger than what life dishes out to me I'll remind you of this quote if you guys want to put it up read this a few weeks ago it's amazing I read it and a mom was talking to her family and daughter about this very quote that evening before the service and I read this very quote out of a whole message I'm going to read it again and go though in the exposition I the cloudy skies and storms of life are no signs of God's disapproval neither are bright skies and Still Waters signs of his love and approval his approval of any of us is only in the Beloved his love is elective which he had for us before the foundation of the world does he love us ah yes but how shall we know we shall know because he said so and manifested that he did love us for he brought us to himself and gave us of his Spirit placing us as Sons amen I like the rest of the quote and how so I prove my love to him by believing what he said and by conducting myself with joy amidst the trials that he in his wisdom allows to come to pass it's not just about the revelation of how much God loves us it's the revelation of now how do I love him back and it's faithfulness it's consistency it's something that doesn't change day by day can you see it now we're transitioning from Tempo life to eternal life that means I won't withdraw myself a little when he doesn't answer my prayer I won't get angry in the midst of my trials I don't conduct myself like a little child in hard times that doesn't get what he wants and stops his feet how many ever seen Little Johnny in the store stomp his feet because he's not getting what he wants maybe you got a little Johnny Stomps his feet because he don't get what he wants we can see that in children but spiritual children spiritual children can live that way I don't come to conduct myself like a child in hard times I don't get temporal temple with my love for him I don't live on highs and then show a lack of passion for him when I'm in a low his love does not change and does not fail I want to give some faithfulness back to him I don't fade in and fade out with my love back towards the towards him can you say Amen Lord when I was a child and this is why Paul brings it up when I was a child I speak like a child I acted like a child I thought like a child but when I became a man I put away childish things he's typing the childhood naturally with our spiritual walk and he's telling the Corinthians you're childish and how you're doing things you're depending on a prophecy but listen your love has to be tapped into the love of God to love me back and it's consistent it doesn't fade in and fade out with trials can you say Amen Lord when I I was a child I acted that way in my attitude but now I'm becoming a man put away this dependence on feeling temporal things put away child honest things this is what Paul said here when I was a child I spake as a child you know the Corinthians were Christians with the Holy Ghost how many believe that the church that Paul wrote to in the book of Corinthians were a people that have the Holy Ghost yes they were but they were babies spiritually why why were they babies because they spoke and they understood and they thought in spiritually childish ways what were they I had this uh typed in years ago when I went through the whole book of Corinthians and I listed all the carnal babyhood of the Corinthian Church I couldn't find it so I went through and found them again last night here's the Corinthian Church outside of their services don't look at me funny like that if you'd attended a Corinthian Church service my goodness you think this is the most spiritual people on the face of the Earth and remember when I read these what's happening in the Corinthian Church when I read it's all from my King James Version Bible said there's division among you there's contentions among you there's playing favorite preachers you say Amen if you've read this in the book of Corinthians he called them carnal babes I have to feed you with milk among you is envying Strife carnality you walk as men he said you are puffed up fornication is reported among you a man sleeping with his stepmom even worse a man sleeping with his stepmom coming to church taking communion even worse the church the Corinthian Church was covering it up not talking about it not dealing with it too scared to call out the sin I wonder if it was pressure from the family don't talk about the problems in my family they were going to court with one another because when the church should have handled it themselves because the church didn't deal with things maybe they had to go to court and that's what I feel sometimes is that the church should be able to deal with issues outside of worldly courts but sometimes when the church doesn't deal with it properly then sometimes you have to go to court but you see now the church should be dealing they were going to court with one another and Paul said you shouldn't have to do that you should be mature enough to handle matters amongst yourself but you're not mature enough praise the Lord he had to remind and teach the women that they shouldn't cut their hair and he had to remind the men that it's a shame for a man to have long hair it's a shame for a man to have long hair I don't know why he had to remind that generation of it I don't know I could go back into the history I've studied it have you I'd go back to the history and say because the church world has written off that scripture and says that does not that's not relevant today let me say publicly you don't have a right to pick and choose what you want out of this Bible and say that belonged in this era that belonged to that if there's scriptural truth that's generational that's Timeless generation nobody no denomination no man no great preacher has a right to interpret those scriptures leave it alone leave it the way it is and for some reason Paul had to talk about hair that a woman's long hair is her glory it's in the Bible and that it's a shame for a man to have long hair women leave their hair long and uncut men cut their hair amen it's in the Bible men should cut it or it's a shame should it should and then he says there's heresies among you you're getting they're get they were getting drunk at the communion table hmm his Bible letting an unknown tongue manifest without anyone to interpret it Paul had to correct that you know what unbelievers coming in and think that you're mad and it was all a bunch of unknown tongues no interpretation Paul said you can't do that when you speak when you sing a song when there's a prophecy let there be an interpretation because we must be a people of understanding the unbelievers should understand what's going on sing with understanding speak with understanding it's not just about a bunch of unknown stuff and everybody says oh it's such a spiritual thing going on but nobody understands what's being said from God God is not the author of confusion he wants everybody to understand what he said praise the Lord everyone has a song everyone has a tongue when they come together and then he says you're being unequally yoked together some must have been unequally yoked with unbelievers unequally yoked but it doesn't mean marriage you're forming a too close of a union with an unbeliever how can you fellowship with that how can you afford such a close Union with an unbeliever he said that we we shouldn't do that you're unequally yoked when you give your offering he says when you give your offering don't give grudgingly they must have been doing that there's my tithes no don't give begrudgingly give with a cheerful heart this is the Corinthian Church I'm not preaching at you this morning I'm preaching the Corinthian Church not you it's Corinthian Church none of you ever do things like this so he says at the end of Corinthians examine yourself whether you're even in the faith he says I'm using sharpness with you that's the word I'm being sharp with you but I love you and I'm going to tell you the truth if you would have been in a service in the Corinthians you might not have seen all this carnality a lot of good things were going on in the services but there's some childishness going on behind the scenes it's very quiet now and understand that people say we're a book of Acts Church we're a book of Acts Church there's some environments but it looks like the book of Acts Church on the outward but where's the discernment to expose sin in the camp that's a book of Acts church too where's the discernment to start to expose Brothers Bound by pornography and incest going on and rape going on and ananias and Survivor were corrected for for lying to the Holy Ghost if you're a book of Acts Church where's all the other attributes of the book of Acts Church can I ask that he said that the apostolic way the apostolic way was not to have an altar call that came from a Methodist background now do we have them yes please if God's leading you come to the altar because it's about the heart and if he's breaking your heart come to the altar but he was reminding the Pentecostals that was a tradition that didn't come we don't know we have no record in the scripture that they had an altar call in the book of Acts Church you have no scripture for it it came from a Methodist Dogma a Methodist manner of doing it which is fine but don't but but let's say if we're going to be a book of Acts Church in an Apostolic Church from the original Pentecost then let's pray and say we want all of that restored to us can I get an amen this morning so grow up and act like men and women of God where God knows where you stand not up and down doubting all the time and Satan and and live so God knows where you stand every day there's no question about it how many would raise your hand and say I want to know and God wants to go I want God to sense my spirit my soul my attitude I want God to sense he knows exactly where I stand 24 7. there's no question about it my mind is disciplined God knows where I stand but even better Satan knows where I stand I want the devil to know 24 7 where I stand and if I have to vocalize it I'm going to say it so he knows does the devil know where you stand today young Christian men does the devil know where you stand are you in between on the fence or you want to send a message message to the enemy I may not be perfect but I'm going to make a stand today my parents can't make it for me my church I'm not going to go to heaven because I'm in this church and in this youth group I'm going to make a stand for the Lord today I'm going to stand for righteousness I want him to fill me with this spirit because if every all my friends in this church go to hell I'm not going to hell because I accepted the blood of Jesus Christ I want Satan to know where I stand I want my attitude to be right can you say Amen Charles when Chuck Swindoll has a wonderful little paragraph on attitude and it's in harmony with the more powerful statement from our Prophet that said the right mental attitude towards any promise of God will bring it to pass so attitude is extremely important this is this is what Charles Swindoll said about it the longer I live the more I realize the impact of attitude on life attitude to me is more important than facts it's more important than the past than education than money than circumstances then failures then successes then what other people think say or do it is more important than appearance giftedness or skill it will make or break a company a church a home the remarkable thing is we have a choice every day regarding the attitude we Embrace for that day can you say Amen we cannot change our past we cannot change the fact that people will act in a certain way we cannot change the inevitable the only thing we can do is play the one string we have and that is our attitude I am convinced that life is ten percent of what happens to me and 90 of how I react to it and so it is with you we are in charge of our attitudes and if you get the right one towards the promise of God and God senses this boy's got a right attitude he's got a positive attitude he's going through a trial but he's got a positive attitude when God senses that the Devils have to back off and God has to step in when Divine love is projected Sovereign Grace will take over it's about attitude I love to preach about and now preach on Hannah here and I'll close I love to preach about Hannah because Hannah her husband had two wives and the one wife started to have a bunch of babies and Hannah couldn't have a child and the worst thing is it's bad for a woman not to be able to have one and God she loves that but she couldn't have it and so now you look at Laura you know all through the years she becomes bitter she had an adversary she had a tormental Tormentor so Hannah started to get bitter about God not answering her prayer uh to have a child and then she looks over and and she sees the other wife I can't remember her name and she's having babies and then she gets complexes you know the other wife is having and she's prospering and God you're hearing her prayer and not my prayer these all this mental stuff going on they must be favored of you I'm not I'm I'm unworthy and and as this this grows it grows in a bad attitude towards God now it's one thing to not understand what God's doing it's another thing to have a bad attitude about it come on say amen and bitterness develops and and and things develop it one what was just a simple hurt by somebody years ago people can hold that Grudge for countless years ask God to help you get over it don't let it taint your whole life let the forgiveness and blood of Jesus wash it away from you but you see now she had this she developed that and then then the Tormentor come it says the torment she had a Tormentor that torment she was in depression she was low but every year her and Alcona her husband that was her husband's name brother Alcona every year they went to the temple to worship God every year they went and they wanted to worship and so every year she went with the same prayer Lord I I don't understand why you're not giving me a child but she started to go towards her towards more bitterness towards it and her attitude and torment her she was depressed all the time and so now when you look at the promise and predestinated plan with God there was a predestinated plan of God for Hannah to have a baby she just didn't know it but her baby would be a special baby she was not to produce just what the other wife was just a baby she was to produce a prophet this bride is not to produce another denominational thing we are meant to produce Christ coming out of us Mary didn't just have another baby she brought forth Christ don't look at the denomination don't look at her don't even compare yourself with other message churches and say well my seems like they're proud there's so many things going on don't look at everybody else don't even look at everybody else in the congregation what is God wanting to do in your life and I can tell you Hannah didn't know that she was not supposed to bring just another baby she was praying for a baby but it wasn't just there was a predestinated plan of God for a life and that's why God was just holding up everything but who was really holding up the promise I can tell you with from my study it wasn't just God holding up it was Hannah's attitude holding it up somebody heard me preach on this before and I'm going to keep preaching because I love this little story it's the type of the bride of Christ you're not called to be a denomination you're not called to be other churches you're not called you don't compare yourself with the other wife there's a foolish virgin don't compare yourself don't borrow can you say Amen don't look at what they're doing the vision said they're following what they're doing don't do that young people don't follow what they're doing we're going to duplicate the same thing here don't do that go directly to the Holy Ghost and get your inspiration songwriters go directly to God and get your inspiration praise the Lord so every year she came and I always say the Hannah probably saying the same special every year can sister Hannah sing is special and after so many years the people just under their breath saying does she have to sing another special because she sings the same one every year and she's she's depressed she pours a wet blanket over that whole service every time she gives up for her special but every year it's the same one and she gets a man that comes up and everybody says do we have to hear him sing again okay just let her sing and and the the priest Eli said can we have sister Hannah come up and sing her special advice please don't please don't ever sing there's other singers please don't get hand she gets up every year and she's got the same song woe is me whoa is me woe is me whoa is me I am sad because the Lord won't give me a baby woe is me whoa is me every year it's the same thing every year she takes her depression home with her she takes everything and what was needed is for Hannah to tap into the mind of God because in the mind of God she was going to have a baby but it was her attitude about it and her depression about it and her prayer was tainted with her now her anger towards God why can't I have a baby I ask you and look at this woman prospering over here she even said to her husband I just you know living with a wife like this every day must have been hard on brother elkana she's in constant depression and it's like honey please pull yourself out of this please this is terrible and she says you favor her more than me God favors her she's having okay I can't have a baby for you and they're just going on he said he said honey listen I love you with a double blessing I love you double more than her I love you anyway and you're you're better than a thousand Sons so just just love me you know what am I chopped liver read the Bible it's what it says I'm ain't I I'm only laughing because this is the kind of things we say to our wives what am I chopped liver ain't I better than 10 Sons you're good but I want a son and then one year she comes and I'm closing she comes to church with a different prayer she Taps into the predestinated plan of God and her prayer now was aligned with the predestinated plan of God and she comes in that year different and she comes in and she raises her hand almighty God and she said Lord I have prayed for years for a baby but I want to bring this prayer to you if you will bless me with a baby I will have that baby I will wean that baby and I'll give that baby completely back to you to the service of the Lord for the rest of its life that was a different prayer that was a humble prayer that was a sacrificial prayer prayer see her prayer before was really selfish I want it for myself but when unselfish just came in her prayer that she was thinking of others instead of herself her attitude changed that year and she said God if you give it to me and and the thing is the Bible says you begin to just get into the flow and the spirit of God so much that she looked drunken from the whole congregation and Eli the priest said what have you done have you been drinking what is going on what's the matter with you and she got a little tiffed at him says I'm not a child of Belial I'm not an empty I don't drink and get myself drunk I'm drunk in the spirit of God I have released this thing read your Bible she got on the priest for saying that to her I'm not drunk with wine I'm not Dr I'm drunk in the spirit because I've released something to God I've released a bad attitude towards God I got rid of my anger right now I got rid of my bitterness and I'm releasing this to God and she's running around shouting and Eli said well why don't you sing a special and everybody goes no no please don't let her sing again but this year she got up and she had a different song she had a new song she had a different special everybody's just expecting the woe is me hit she gets up she said I just want to testify and praise the Lord I've released something to the Lord this morning uh God bless you for praying for me God bless you for an endure enduring my special over here but I got a new song today I just want to say I thank God for saving me filling me with the Holy Ghost God for changing my attitude I just want to give glory to God today in the service praise the Lord and now I'm going to sing every praise is to our God every word of worship in one Accord every praise and everybody's going Something's Happened to Hannah 's changed she didn't have a baby yet though so what's changed her attitude changed because her attitudes change her prayers changed every praise is to our God every word of worship in one Accord everybody's just rejoicing Place comes unglued they get ready they pack up head back home she has no baby yet but it doesn't matter she's anchored into the love of God you remember in the prayer lines where brother Brandon would bring him up this way and the hundreds of prayer lines where he prayed sometimes you could see a miracle happen right there sometimes healing would take place over time and he said healing is better than a miracle healing is better because you have to trust God and believe and confess that he's healed you if we get too many miracles we get too dependent we're expecting miracles but he said that wouldn't be as great as if you just believe with your other heart and he'd tell these people I'm looking he'd look them in the face and listen now go on your way happy rejoicing over and over again look it up on your table app go on your way happy rejoicing confess the word of God go on your way happy it's about attitude come on people say amen it's about attitude go on your way have they weren't healed yet they had cancer they had all these other but just change your attitude go on your way happy rejoicing because brother round knew that there had to be an atmosphere created for the healing to come and you create your atmosphere you create an atmosphere of healing can you say Amen of Deliverance of power you do that by the word you speak in your home by the words just speak to one another if it's positive is right if it's respectful God's going to bless that more than a bunch of just agitation and fighting and anger yeah go on your way happy rejoicing and many of you didn't have their healing yet but they went on to receive it and brother Bradham was teaching us through the prayer lines because we learn from the mind of God even in the prayer lines how God works and he's teaching us that we should be a people that rejoices not when we get the answer to our prayer but we're rejoicing before we get it as if we got it I got a feeling maybe Brother Ray has prayed for two or three weeks ago I got a feeling that he held that attitude and you hold that right attitude I believe God's going to heal me
