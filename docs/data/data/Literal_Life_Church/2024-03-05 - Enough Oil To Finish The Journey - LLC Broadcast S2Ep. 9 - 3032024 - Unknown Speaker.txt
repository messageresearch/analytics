the kingdom of heaven be likened unto 10 virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom and five of them were wise and five were foolish they that were foolish foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps while the bridegroom carried they all slumbered and slept so you notice that the bridegroom coming there was a delay in his coming or there was a a a temporary tearing that took place I believe we live during that time while the bridegroom tarried they all slumbered and slept and at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him then all those virgins arose and trim their lamps so all the virgins arose by the Midnight Cry that we're getting close and the bridegroom is coming all of them arose and we're were're stirred by that and the foolish said unto the wise give us of your oil for our lamps have gone out but the wise answered saying not so lest there be not enough for us and you but go rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut afterward came also the other virgin saying Lord Lord open to us but he answered instead verily I say unto you I know you not watch therefore for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the son of man cometh Matthew 24 and 25 in the Bible we have Jesus giving the prophecy of the 2,000 years after he is gone and particularly their prophecies and specifics about the end time and this is why these scriptures should be very important to us and any Christian really should be uh interested in Matthew 24 and 25 as Jesus begins to break really the Seven Seals uh in his own way in the way he did it John has the Seven Seals and by Vision at the Book of Revelations but Jesus actually Expresses in Matthew 24-25 uh all Seven Seals and you can take what he says and and put it place it right on the seals in the Book of Revelations and so he's he's elaborating and speaking Prophecy of the specifics of will what will happen in the end time and when you get to the very end though which is what we live in when you get get to the very end because he had just said a few scriptures earlier he said no man knows the day or the hour no man knows the day or the hour this is a secret that God the final end the final hour the final time of his coming he keeps it a secret only the father knows and so it's not something that he would reveal and make it plain here because that's something that's only going to be revealed in Rapture time it's only going to be revealed to the to the to the bride in other words this isn't something something that everybody will know and because they know what they can be a part of this will be the secret part and so the seventh seal will be a secret which is the coming of the Lord don't get lost in the terminology here I want to explain it so even a 13-year-old can understand this morning Jesus is speaking of all the end time events but when we get to the very end then he breaks in Matthew 25 he breaks into Parables for the seventh seal so and he had to do that because that's the one that's Secret that's the one that's hidden and so all the others he's being specific about but when he breaks into the seventh that's when you find Matthew 25 and that's when you find the seventh seal hidden in Parables but how many knows that Jesus said about Parables when he was asked by the disciples why do you speak in Parables he said because it's given unto you to know the mysteries of God it's not given to everybody but it's given to you so if he breaks into Parables for the seven seal I'll tell you our curiosity ought to our we ought to be sitting at the the edge of our seat saying what does this mean cuz this is where I live right now I'm at the end time God's not called me to Luther's day or Wesley's day he's called me to write at the closing seconds of time and I want to catch this mystery of what God's doing so now the first Parable in Matthew 25 is very revealing as it covers virgins starting a journey toward meeting the bridegroom well that's perfect because we know at the end of the book there's a marriage we know enough scriptures to know that there's a marriage between Christ and his bride so now in the parable it's perfect because you have virgins starting a journey toward meeting the bridegroom they start not the rest of the world but these virgins these sanctified people these Christians they say my it's time for the bridegroom to come and so there's a call go ye out to meet him and I'm going to begin this journey and this of course uh so the children understand the bridegroom is a type of Christ that's Christ and then there's not one virgin but there's 10 virgins and why why wouldn't you say well there's just one because usually a man marries just one woman in this Parable there's 10 virgins because we are a many membered bride it's not just one person but we're a many membered bride so that's why it says 10 has many can you say Amen so showing it will be a many membered bride not one person it's perfect because at the end there is a marriage spoken of throughout the Bible and I'll just say these things Paul said I have espoused you to one husband he starting to use the term he said I've come and brought the message Paul said and I've espoused you there's an engagement and I've espouse you not to many husbands but to one husband so there's a marriage going to take place there's a courtship there's an engagement and there's a marriage in the end time supposed to take place and so then we uh then we find that Paul uh said I have espouse you to one husband he also said in Ephesians that God would have a glorious bride without spot without wrinkle he will prepare himself a spotless bride to Mary and she'll be without blemish how many's familiar with that scripture so that he will provide the atonement to sanctify this bride and he sanctifies her so that he can marry her it's almost like creating your virginity because we know in our flesh we weren't born virgins we were born with a sin nature but by the power of the word he creates our virginity and shows us what we were from the foundation of the world that before came in the picture I was in the mind of God thus I'm a virgin unto the Lord because he Sanctified my life that's power friends when you're creating virginity but he says I'll wash her I'll make her a spotless bride before I married so then he he she will be a virgin and then when you go to the Book of Revelations it says the marriage of the Lamb has come and the bride hath made herself ready praise be to God lay some foundational things that at the end it's about a marriage at the end time it's about a spiritual union with you and Christ that's what it's about that's what the parable speaks of and so now the marriage has come bride have made herself ready the end time is not you know it's about a marriage it's not about a it's not about a a a dating relationship with Christ when it gets to the end it's not this casual dating of Christ Christ or a part-time onag again off again relationship with Jesus Christ can I get an amen am you may be God maybe have winked at your ignorance in past days about that but not today we're not called to a dating relationship we're not called to to to come in relationship at at a camp meeting with them and get all stirred up and then we we deny them later while we're at school we're not called to a dating relationship we're not called to a a a clicking uh on again off of it I'm in a relationship you click the button and you're in a relationship two weeks later you unclick say I'm out of a relationship that's not that's this generation how they go about relationships might as well take a minute and say this generation has cheapened relationship has cheapened marriage has cheapened commitment friends are not committed anymore within a drop of the Hat somebody drops a friendship there's no loyalty can you because it's an adulterous generation and nobody's loyal to one husband or one one spouse or one person for life completely for life it's in and out if I Don't Feel Like Loving in you anymore I'll just drop out of the relationship I'll just divorce you it's a divorce generation and spiritually it's a divorce generation cuz people go to a camp meeting go to a meeting they they give themelves okay I'm all excited and then all of a sudden they're right back to the things of the world that's not a marriage relationship I'm going to preach this morning that's not a marriage relationship in the end time it's not a dating Rel relationship it's not an on again off again I kind of come and go as I and Comm and people approach church that way as well if it's convenient for me if it fits around all all of my schedule then I'll be there but no I this is a marriage can you say Amen this is not about church attendance this is a union between you and Christ there's two groups one wise and one foolish that's right that's what the word of God says but notice all the virgins all started out on a journey to go meet the bridegroom all heard the Midnight Cry Now friends I'm telling you this Parable is not talking about out there it's pretty internal because they're all hearing the Midnight Cry now it's time go you out to meet him possibly sitting in the same group hearing the same preaching all were stirred out of their sleeping all were stirred up by the word by the Midnight Cry all of them got up and were woke awoken by the cry all of them got up and all of them trimmed their lamps which is part of the process spiritually trimming the lamps you can have a lamp a vessel and and the vessel speaks of Your Vessel for the Lord this vessel and so you can have a vessel but you see you've got a a a wick in there if you guys want to show that picture of uh just so we have a visual for the young people and everybody else uh this is kind of what it looked like back in Jerusalem the days of Jerusalem this is kind of what it looked like and this is what he's speaking of in the parable is that you got a vessel you got the oil in the vessel and then you got something sticking out the wick sticking out the end and this is type of thing if you didn't uh and maybe some of you know this most people know this if you don't keep that trimmed at the end it won't burn bright like that and if it doesn't burn bright in the darkness you won't be able to see right so there's some components there and for the parable all the components are there as far as trimming the lamps they Rose it's dark out it's midnight it's become gross Darkness upon the people it's a dark time how many how many would say say I in the last two years we're living in darker times I'm feeling it in my spirit if you got any God about you you know this is different now we're in different territory this is dark dark times we're living in it's not like 30 years ago when we tend to camps and went to meetings this is a darkness that is set into us people are questioning where they stand people are fighting mind battles can you say Amen we're in a different time which lets us know we need to trim our lamps we need the oil like we've never needed it before we need to be established and know that we have a reserve of oil back can you say Amen or we won't make it through this Darkness oh Darkness Darkness Darkness so much out there if you don't know it's really getting more more dark you better get on your feet and Rec recognize there's Darkness rights I've been a Christian since I was 16 years old and I have never since in the last two years watch gross Darkness take even some Christians life and they start to it's unstable don't know where they stand and I don't have a hatred towards that I'm just saying oh God what's the answer answer right I can tell you this sermon I preached this morning couldn't get away from it about a month ago I got this note in my Bible and it just says the last minute Discovery is that you don't have enough oil that's what this sermon comes this isn't just some concocted thing this is what God told me to preach on this morning every individual needs to be established and know that they have the reserve there's nothing more important than the oil your money your job your career your house anything your boyfriend nothing nothing is more important than God they're all stirred up they get up they trim their lamps all the same group doing all the same things now maybe wearing all the same things but something happens they started a journey towards the Lord all together towards the bridegroom but without this group was without the most important thing they began the journey without the most important thing and the discovery was I don't have enough to finish the journey I don't have enough to make it through to make the journey and to finish it and we learn from this Parable if you don't learn anything else the tragic end I I read to you the rest but the tragic end to starting a journey without the most important thing start it's better to start and if there's discovery that I don't have what I need you can start today you can start right now God I want to start this journey all over because I realize I didn't start it the right way the most important thing is for me to seek the baptism of the Holy Ghost and his oil in my life and be honest about that because there's many coming to me and discovering discovering and I say praise God you're discovering this now it's time to lay the right foundations and say I'm praying for one thing in my life and that's the oil they started the journey towards the Lord and realized they couldn't finish the journey because they didn't have enough oil if you were to trying to think of an example an illustration and I guess it's any kind of Journey I guess you could plan a camping trip and you're going to go across the country and maybe meet someone special at the end of the trip maybe somebody special in California or Arizona I've got a lot of special friends in in Arizona but you're going to meet someone at the end but you got a month of and you're going to make it a camping trip you're going to need a lot of things for that camping trip especially if you don't have all the conveniences of life you're going to have to think it through you got to have what you need and you're going to be in the wilderness if you go across the country you're going to be in the wilderness you're going to need things you're going to need food with you because if you're going in the wilderness you don't have a place just to conveniently go buy food you're going to need food you're going to need snacks I bring a lot of snacks when I do things when I go overseas I can't eat the food very much so one of my suitcases is full of snacks you're going to need things you're going to need to think about this trip and this journey what do I need what's essential for this journey towards the Lord you better think it through so I need my food I need my I need lots of stuff I need snacks Twinkies whatever I need to you know and you're going to need some warm clothes because it's going to get cold on the journey money probably not very much hallelujah amen he caught it cuz you're not going to be around Walmart you're not going to be you're going to be in the wilderness you're going to be around lots of stuff but you're going to give be so your money is really no good and I can tell you I can tell you that where we're going in this marriage with the bridegroom your money doesn't really mean anything you can't buy your way into this your retirement that you have set up God bless you but don't you ever let that be a security our security has to to be in the Lord today and this kind of Journey Through the Wilderness your money is no really no good Your Nest Egg isn't really any good I've had Brothers come and say I had a nest egg for 20 years and now the economy now it's gone it's finished it can be gone just like that friends I've said it over and over again we cannot put our trust in worldly Goods or worldly things or houses or lands we can't put our trust in governments or any of these things we have one place especially right now to cling to and make sure we stay filled it's about the holy spirit it's about walking in his spirit it's about remaining filled with the spirit it's about getting of the Holy Spirit if we don't have it it's all about the oil in the last days it's about the oil you get your warm clothes you you know you get lots of stuff and then you think you will you're supposed to think you will have 12 hours usually out of that that day that it's going to be completely dark and so you won't have any light so you have to think about light you're going to need light you're going to need flashlights I'm being practical so you understand if you forgot the flashlights and you're going a month 12 hour hours out of your day is going to be complete pitch darkness is anybody catching your spiritual journey and anybody catching the Midnight Hour that you live in The Darkest Hour the midnight hour you're going to need light you're going to need flashlights and guess what what if you went and you had flashlights but you didn't bring the energy for the flashlight oh forgot the batteries that would be me on a camping trip but when you think about being in the dark for 12 hours and the Animals because that's another thing to think about the vicious animals that come out of the woods and you you're going to in and snakes and all these other things you got to think that you're going to have to have some weapon against the an animal you're going to have to have some protection can you say Amen so you're thinking this through of head because on this journey and it's so true to the Christian Journey it's not going to be at Walmart it's going to be a Wilderness you're going to have dark times can you say Amen you're going to have vicious animals come at you you're going to have vicious people come after you it's going to be a journey that's not perfect so you need the essential things and one of the most essential things you'll need in the darkness is light is light I want you guys to keep that up because I want that image to be in their minds today in the congregation's mind this is what it is you can trim your lamps it can be Burning Brightly but I can tell you if that vessel is depleted or that vessel never got oil to begin with none of this is going to work right and you're going to be traveling through the darkness with juice you in your own energy and I'm telling you you can't make it in this hour without the oil Hallelujah can't make a marriage without the oil can't have a family without the oil can't be a young person strong in the Lord without the oil this came to me also when I was speaking a few weeks ago to the young people about a strong young man that can that can stand against a weak girl a strong girl that can stand against a weak Boy or the wrong kind of boy it's strength God is calling for strength in this hour in young people God's calling for strength in the congregation where does that strength come from the oil the Holy Spirit that's where it originates from it's that your vessel is got a reserve of the oil that's where we become strong in the Lord so on this journey let me finish this monthlong trip to meet someone special you need batteries because batteries would be the essential thing tied to the light that's going to shine to keep you through the darkness it's energy to fuel the light and the Holy Ghost the holy spirit is the the only energy God has provided in order for you to have a light to make it through this Darkness there is no other psychology there is no other source to go to can you say Amen there is no other doctor God has provided it in the oil can you say Amen in this Dark Hour nothing will make this journey or finish this journey without the oil of the Holy Spirit and they didn't have enough because they didn't why didn't they have enough when they started they didn't make it a priority when they started and to every Christian the holy spirit is what we should make more important than anything else in our lives thank you for watching our message today if you would like more information please contact us by visiting our website literall life. church and if you would like to
