it was Mr Ford that I don't know if Mr Ford was mentioned but that's who the ball family's with tonight he's he's uh I think 99 and on his just a uh they say his last week here so we just whatever the will of the Lord is but let's pray for them as they're with him tonight and just that God would give them strength through this time can you say amen amen we're going to reading our scriptures tonight from Exodus chapter 12 and we want to just say thank you for your prayers we uh had to fulfill a meeting there in Phoenix and had a very very nice time with the Saints and Phoenix brother Ron Peterson's church so uh we appreciate the opportunity to be able to minister there Exodus chapter 12 we're reading and we're going to continue on with the subject of blessed families tonight how many want your family to be blessed and uh we have different sometimes different uh facets of that in the generation we live in sometimes we have a single mom raising children well that's a family too sometimes we have uh different situations that's come up not because of the the of them so much but because of the times we live in but I believe your family can be blessed no matter what combination that is I think the Lord can bless your family as well so want to make sure that we qualify that Exodus 12 and we'll read together here uh several verses uh concerning the token and this is the next place in scripture where families are mentioned the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt saying this month shall be unto you the beginning of months it shall be the first month of the year to you speak ye unto the congregation of Israel saying in the 10th day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb according to the house of their fathers a lamb for a house and if the household be too little for the lamb let him and his neighbor next unto his house take it according to the number of the souls every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb your lamb shall be without blemish a male of the first year ye shall take it out from the sheep or from the goats and ye shall keep it up until the 14th day of the same month and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening and they shall take the blood and strike it on the two doorpost excuse me the two side post and on the upper door post of the houses wherein they shall eat it and they shall eat the flesh in the night roast with fire and unleavened bread and with bitter herbs they shall eat it eat not of it raw nor Soden at all with water but roast with fire his head with his legs and with the uh pertinence thereof and ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning and that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire and thus shall you eat it with your loins girded your shoes on your feet your staff in your hand and ye shall eat it in haste it is the Lord's Passover for I will pass through the land of Egypt this night and will Smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt both man and Beast and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment I am the Lord and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are and when I see the blood I will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when I smite the land of Egypt and then if we skip over to verse 21 it says then Moses called for all the Elders of Israel and said to them draw out and take you a lamb according to your families and kill the Passover amen heavenly father bless your word tonight I pray that you make it real to us Lord and we just commit this time together and fellowship around your word we commit it wholly to you may the Holy Ghost speak tonight through these things Lord we just pray you will remember the ball family Lord with Mr Ford and just encourage them and be with them Lord and also want to remember the mayor's family the mayor of Toledo passing away and such a tragic thing Lord and I just pray that you'll remember his wife tonight and all the family as they have the funeral tomorrow just be with them and comfort their hearts as well father and we just commit that to you we commit this evening to you and father I just pray that each song and each thing that's done and each word that's said would be a blessing and be an encouragement to the people of God we commit the service to you in Jesus name amen and amen praise the Lord Shake somebody's hand tonight God bless you as you take your seats and you've come out here in this cold weather it's going to get a lot of Colder this weekend but uh we appreciate you coming out won't tell you how warm it was in Phoenix over the weekend just to be nice amen well we want to go back into this uh part four here of blessed families and we want to we've been taken just um each time it's mentioned through the scripture and we started of course with Abraham that's where we got our text where it said that the the families of the earth will be blessed through Abra Abraham and uh we've seen that it was the faith of Abraham that brought the blessings on all the fam so uh we wanted to start there because we believe that it takes the faith of Abraham to bring this kind of blessing on the families and on our lives we uh we are the Seed of Abraham and that's because we believe like Abraham it's because we have the faith of Abraham we believe we're Abraham's seed because we have the same faith that he had and uh so that's that's what he said when he said the families of the earth will be blessed we're not interested in this world's blessings and such but we want God's blessings we want our God's blessings on our family and uh we can pursue a lot of things but boy we want to know what God's blessings are and we want those blessings to fall on our families especially as we realize the great attack on our families uh all the time there seems to be something Lord that Satan's trying to get in on attack marriages attack families and so we're aware of that that's no new news to you and so we're in a great battle for Satan to try to uh split up those things but we want God's blessings on our families we want to be able to know we're in his will and we want that and we we we if we look in scripture we find that Abraham in that faith and I just want to go back over it just a little bit so we understand in case somebody wasn't here we want to realize that Abraham's Faith was uh we can say it this way that what Abraham found was his six sense and the six sense declared to him what his other five senses wouldn't declare and that's what faith is um I was reading the definition of faith that the Sunday school teacher wrote on the board tonight I didn't bring it out with me but I thought it was excellent it was just a a belief a belief in uh something that you don't have proof for but you're completely confident and you trust in it and the reason that if it's true Faith it's Revelation faith and the reason that you can put confidence in it when these eyes don't declare it there's no proof of it it's because the six sense is stronger than the other five senses the six sense declares that it's true faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen so when there's no no uh there's no evidence as far as see taste feel smell and hear there is evidence as far as our Revelation faith in the six sense and this is what Abraham found this is the this is having a revelation and Abraham had a revelation particularly of the promise of his day the promise that it was related to him for his hour that's what he had faith in it was actually a personal word for him that you shall be the father many nations it began with God speaking to him and calling him out from amongst his Kindred a a separation had to take place and then God begin to tell him the promise of that day that you're going to be the father of many nations you're going to have a child and all these promises for the hour for that day was related to Abraham can you say amen and the promise of the day is always related to the people of that day our promise of this day one of the major ones is the is the rapture and that's related to the people who's going to be raptured am so we have to believe the promise of the day just like Abraham had to believe the promise of the day we've got to believe all the word of God but we've got to believe the promise of our day and we've got to have faith in that promise of the hour that we live in we have to believe it because uh there there's there's no other reason except it it had a revelation it has to have a revelation just as Abraham had of the day he lived in it's a revelation of the promise related to that hour this is Abraham's seed in every age is those who believe the promise of their day how do you prove that how do you know that because in we find when John talked to the when Jesus talked to the Jews in John 8 and: 31 when Jesus talked to the Jews and the religious men he he who were claiming to be Abraham's seed physically we are Abraham's seed remember they claim that and Jesus said no you're proving that you're not Abraham's seed now how could they say that they said we're from the lineage of Abraham we are we are his seed physically that's why there's no grandchildren in the message everyone has to have a birth everybody's sons and daughter of God there's no grandchildren and so here they were by a a natural lineage they were claiming Abraham but Jesus could safely say you're not Abraham's seed because it's the faith seed and you're not believing the promise of your day your hour you don't believe in me so thus you're not Abraham's seed that was a pretty strong thing to call those people that and say that you're not Abraham's seed it's pretty rough it's pretty harsh but it's in John 8:31 and he says say you may be Abraham's seeds naturally is the way he was saying it but not truly why they didn't believe the promise of their day right they didn't believe the promise of their day and history holds a mystery in every age history holds a mystery in every age and Believers catch the mystery of their age Abraham's seed keps the mystery of their time from Paul's day all the way through the church ages the Believers caught the mystery of that hour under the angel messenger of that hour there was seven stars in his right hand the same Jesus that was in Naz Nazareth this been exciting me lately because and I I might bring more of this on Sunday because the same Jesus that lived three 33 years on the face of the Earth was not dead he resurrected can you say amen and we pick him up there and then we we see him fill the people with the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost but we can pick him up in the first chapter of Revelations where we see Jesus again and and and the the Sevenfold Glory of his person and it describes all of his glory and all of those things that he is all of the things that his his his character is and there he is again right in the midst and he's standing in the midst of where in the midst of the candlesticks he's standing in the midst of every Church age Jesus is standing there and we find that's where Jesus the same one that went to Calvary is standing there now and uh that's our Christ but he stand there with seven stars in his right hand right and at the very end of first or second chapter it says and those seven stars are the seven angels to the seven Church ages so now as we see every age and every time Old Testament new New Testament we find this distinction in Abraham's seed as they believe by faith the promise for their day that's how we know the distinction they caught the mystery of their time and they believed it by understanding no they believed it by Revelation they they held to it by Revelation it's by Revelation and so and then as we uh have preached several times is that in their age they didn't necessarily understand all the details of that promise now we can read our Bible and would find that they didn't understand all the details remember uh the prophet saying in Christ the mystery he says those people he says they didn't know all what they were doing they just know that they were LED of God to do something here they are living out their age and they didn't know all the details of what they were living out in that time didn't have the full mystery of God for that time but they caught it by Revelation can you say amen and they're even living it out brother B says they didn't even know all all the details of it but they're living it out they're living out the vision for that day because that's what they're called to in that day God is Christ is always giving his word in relation to what his people are going to live out in that day he gave a word to each generation it's related to his people his seed living that out and so uh the seed who believes it then we can conclude and say it was that kind of faith that brought a blessing in all the families of the earth that's right that kind of faith that brought a blessing on all the families of the earth we also talked about Oneness we went back to the beginning and broke down what Oneness was in the beginning the first family and the the beautiful subject of Oneness and the Oneness that was in marriage uh between Adam and Eve came because of their Oneness with God they had a Oneness with one another because they had a Oneness with God you can't have Oneness in a family unless that family is serving God and wanting to be one with God Amen you can't have Oneness in a family you're going to have disruption in the family if if one of those persons is not connected with God and in fellowship with God and I and I and I'm going to break that down just a little bit more in in a bit but it's difficult because Oneness is the most important thing that's why he created the family to have Oneness to have it with him have it with one another and that they came uh in a the reason they had Oneness is because they came into agreement with one thing they they were and then he says then he says they had the same nature as God that's why they could be one with God because they had the same nature of God there's no way to be in Wess with him unless we have the same nature that's why he fills us with the Holy Ghost and when he fills us with the Holy Ghost it's him not the third person of him it's him so we have the same nature as wrote the word the same nature within ourselves and that's why you come into this Oneness and unity with Christ is because you have the same nature living within yourself and so true Harmony is lined up then with a single uh Melody line we talked about Melody and Harmony and things and how that uh there's a there's one Melody line but true Harmony lines itself up with that Melody line brother says you have Harmony in the home one perfect picture of Harmony in the marriage in the home and agreement with one another there has to be a Melody it's not necessarily or or the mommy orology no it has to be the word of God the word of God is the absolute and we all agree we're going to follow this word of God when life brings a question we're going to search the word out and find the answer and then you'll have Harmony when everybody's in agreement with one with one thing amen that's the only true Oneness that there is at least in serving the lord you can come one into we want to build a career we want to build a family business to where you grandkids are multi-millionaires and people can come together in Oneness and stuff like that and do some incredible things but I'm talking about God's Oneness and God's Oneness says we have to be of the same spirit and come in agreement to have harmony with the melody amen that's what brings a blessed family as well there has to be an absolute and the best form of agreement is when the Holy Ghost nature of the word comes in and that's why was just take take a step back for families because before you're a family you're have a marriage before you're marriage you're single like many of you sitting here tonight and so that's why it was emphasized so much from Brother bradam make sure that person has the Holy Ghost and make sure you have the Holy Ghost before you get married why because you want a happy family you want Harmony you want Oneness right and so where does it start having the same nature as who wrote the word so that's why he says don't don't he told his own daughter uh she liked George Smith there and said you know hey uh does he have the Holy Ghost and even on the phone he says George do you have the Holy Ghost yet that was his question to a potential son-in-law do you have the Holy Ghost he said honestly I can say brother Bram I don't have it yet he said well you guys might might better wait and I'll be praying for you that you receive the Holy Ghost and so I think it was two or three months later I I'm just um guess in because I don't know why this come up but this story come up where uh one night there in in a service or I think maybe it was in a motel room he prayed through to God and he just really feel like he received an experience with God and I think a couple hours later brother randam calls him and says George you received the Holy Ghost didn't you tonight and so he say yes sir I did and so then they began their courtship out that but why is he making such an evence don't don't don't make any plans and don't get close to someone unless you can see the evidence and know that that person has the Holy Ghost for because you'll have no true Oneness oh you'll get together you'll have relations you'll have children you'll build a home together you'll do all these things but the foundation's not right for Oneness you got to have the Holy Ghost you might make sure that guy that good-look guy or not so good whatever it is that tall blonde oil well you better make sure he has the true Holy Ghost you know you got to start asking the question does he own a Bible is he around at church do you see him what's he into uh and do you see the evidences in his life that's showing I know friends that we can't tell anybody we can't come and say you don't have the Holy Ghost only a prophet can see into those things we got to leave that alone but yet we can see the fruit coming the overall fruit coming from a life that's right and they can look at your life young girl and they can see the fruit what's the biggest thing in your life what's the most important thing in your life is your life lining up with the word of God and if you can't see that man I'd wait I'd wait it out because you know one place brother Bram says if he doesn't have the Holy Ghost he'll make your life hell on Earth that's right right there'll be no Oneness there it it could be really really bad and so first we start that that's why it has to be the Holy Ghost before you get married and then as you get married and have children bring them up and want to bring them the admonition of the Lord you may have children that don't have the Holy Ghost yet you will have children that don't have the Holy Ghost yet and the only way that works right is that the children have enough respect in the parents Holy Ghost for while until they get it the parents have enough holy ghost in them they can see it in their lives that the kids respect it and you can have Harmony in the home if those children respect that experience with God and their parents am if they lose respect for it then there's going to be there's going to be turmoil but they they without the Holy Ghost can have enough respect and honor and for for this experience that Mom and Dad has had they've gave their testimony you can see God in their life see the change in their life and they resp ECT that enough and say I trust them and I'll follow the instructions for this home and what a blessed thing that is but you know what that's not the best the best is that the parents begin to pray and the young people begin to pray that they get the Holy Ghost because the ultimate is to have that home where everybody has the same nature as Christ the nature of Christ then then you're headed towards a real a goal here because then there's not this when it comes to the absolute of the word there's not this fight that come together in harmony you guys excuse me for looking like you know this with this down I broke two pairs of glasses and I I don't have the money right now to go spend for the astronomical am amounts that they are so I got these from the store my wife hates them you probably hate them um so I can't look at you this way and then I have to keep looking at this and it looks like I know it looks like my dad looks like an old man so let just get that out of the way all right so when when the whole family would have the Holy Ghost wouldn't that be quite a family wouldn't that family be something that's really charged to accomplish something for the kingdom of God oh that doesn't mean they're not they're not that doesn't mean they're perfect okay we're still in the flesh and you're going to get in the flesh sometimes you're going to say things in the flesh but I find when there's a holy ghost there there's there's more willingness to reconcile there's more willingness to get make sure that was made right can you say Amen there's something motivating a Holy Ghost and even that child that has it that that that they want to come together and say let's not let the devil get in between us here that was the devil doing that and you you hear all that in a holy ghost person it's not it's not some mechanical psychological thing is said let's call the let's pray together let's get this T it's so wonderful to have others in the house that have the same Spirit man it's wonderful and and so now the top prayer of parents should be before any other prayer for the future for their kids is that they receive the holy ghost that that you get them in the atmospheres the camps the services wherever it is you do everything because that's the top desire every true parent in here can say that's my desire above all things that your top desire not is not that they you send them to college not that did you send them off to get married not that you uh that you get them the best clothes that's not your number one priority for having children right or for your children right you got to say it's like John said I have no great Joy than to see my children walk in truth and he was speaking about his children spiritually but I've used it as a father my dad has said it to me he's he's happy that all four of his children are serving the lord and he's written text to me I have no Greater Joy matter of fact they they put it on their uh bedroom the other day in big stencil things you know I have no Greater Joy than to see my children Walk In Truth see ultimate I don't care if they make a million dollars it would be nice but but I that's not the priority pray those children through to the Holy Ghost because that's the ultimate thing they have to have to overcome in this day that's the answer to everything can you say Amen it truly is it truly is as so many parents even in the marriage message they come along and they're raised up but that's not the priority and they're giving them this and giving this the best clothes and they're getting them all the you can get them to all the camps but you should be praying God deal with them and fill them with your spirit it amen that's the way it should be for sure and so when we have that the and I'm just slowing down on this things so I can just uh give these encouragements to you this is what we should do for our families uh to for them to receive the holy ghost that they walk in truth then you can come into a Harmony to The Melody of the word and the next thing we talked about then is the hand of faith that must be used to cut away the things that come to try to break Oneness you can have you can have the sword brother Bram said but it takes a strong hand of Faith to drive it to the heart of the enemy and obvious we have to cut off unbelief and cut off things that try to break Oneness right so it doesn't come easy does it we still have to have the hand of faith and use the sword to cut things away that are trying to break the Oneness in the family and to be in agreement with with the word now in Exodus 12 we better get going here looking at this uh scripture we find another key place that families are mentioned in the scripture and it is the night that the token was applied to the homes of the children of Israel while they were living in Goan and it was after uh Moses had displayed the signs to pharaoh and all of them and they went up and down Janice and jamas withstood them and uh they they copied some of the things Moses did and that whole thing when it come to the end God finally said that's enough and he's going to send the death angel throughout the land and so now he drew the families and gave the the Jewish people instructions here that they should come together this this evening this night and uh this evening time and that's why it says in in the this this night that the death angel was going to come uh whenever whenever I look the at the evening time in scripture I always perk up my uh my attention because it may be a type for our evening time because in the whole history of time we live in the evening time of God's history and so whenever it says the evening time there's other places you know that uh I I think uh uh Isaac was introduced to Rebecca and then they he came in the evening time and brought Rebecca to him who who was that brought it to him elizar brought Rebecca to him and it was it the evening tide I think and so you know all those things are typed in ch so this evening when the token was to be applied is speaking of our time because the death angel was getting ready to come and uh so we are in the evening time of history and guess what the most important thing to do was in this evening time the lamb must be brought into every house right the lamb must be brought into every home in the evening time the priority is bring the lamb in the house and we're going to find this helps us in this subject of blessed families is that is this is typing our day and that probably one of the most important things you can do to bless your family and to have a good family is to make sure you're eating the lamb in your home your best meal will be lamb amen that's right to make sure you're bringing the lamb and every house had to slay a lamb every house individually had to have the lamb in their home that's right you you you you couldn't borrow off of somebody else you had to bring the lamb into your home and I like the if you look at the third verse there or the fourth if the household be too little for the lamb let him and his neighbor next to his house so to me uh that's sharing the lamb that's sharing Christ with somebody can you say Amen so so I I believe that we should do that but every every there was a lamb for a house and so this points to how important it is that we bring the word of God and bring the lamb into our house and present Christ to our children and have it is the thing that we partake of so it you can't depend on what just comes through Sunday school you have to bring the lamb into your home there's a whole church world and maybe even some message people that get so religious they depend on what's going to be taught to their kids at Sunday school or at church but this rure says in the evening time you bring the lamb into your home you feed on the word of God Amen and so a lamb for a house you can't depend on Sunday school and eating the lamb is a type of eating the word because Jesus is the Lamb can you say Amen we can move swiftly along this because we understand the lamb in the Old Testament type Christ he is our perfect lamb he is our Lamb with no blemish uh pilate said I find no fault in this lamb he exam him and there was no fault in our lamb there's faults in you my friend but there's no fault in our lamb tonight you've got mistakes in you but there's no fault in our lamb and and so now the a lamb for a house the the the lamb is types to eating they were going to eat it they they prepared it they dressed it they did they they even uh uh had certain things that they wore and all these other things and so they're going to eat it and when we partake of something like that physically when they did that it's a type and what they were eating was the lamb well that that goes perfectly with what Jesus said in John chapter 6 because he actually presented himself as something we spiritually partake of right when he said except you eat my flesh and drink my blood now we could just stand back and say well that's the lamb here's our lamb Christ he's going to Calvary but Jesus Took the Revelation further when he says I will come in a form that you will spiritually partake of me it isn't that you just believe me to be the lamb you've got to eat me right amen come on now right am I staying scriptural now Jesus said except you eat my FL and that's why that that that statement stumbled so many of them 5,000 at the beginning of the chapter and there's there's 70 left uh plus 12 and the 70 when he got to that point they said this is a hard saying who can hear and 70 of his closest ones the ones he gave power to cast out Devils early 70 of those guys said this is too hard which the word hard there it goes back to a meaning of harsh this is too harsh this is too harsh of a statement and they walked away from him that's when he asked his disciples will you go away also so the whole nature of Christ is that way uh is that he's not about crowds friends right the nature of Christ is to tell you the word tell you the truth and this way he says I am something I am in a form when I come in flesh I'm in a form that you can eat of course it doesn't mean physical eating of Flesh we know he didn't mean that but he did come in a form that we could eat in what is that form eating the word because the word is Christ he put himself in a form that we could spiritually eat and partake of amen amen type perfectly with Exodus 12 it's perfect because they had to eat the lamb now if back in Exodus it would have said eat the lamb would have continued on bring the lamb uh you know sacrifice the lamb but in this night it was bringing into your house and it's not good enough just to to to sacrifice the lamb but eat the lamb my and so Jesus says further in that chapter he says just to to describe what he meant by except you eat my flesh and drink my blood showing that he is life he said later he says my words I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life so so now you have the blood you have Christ you have now you have the word my words I speak he gave it away he told what it was you know the disciples are trying to understand even the 12 what he just said and they didn't understand but he really explained it when he said what do I eat of my words that I speak unto you they are alive the blood the blood is going to have life in it we will not physically drink the blood of Jesus Christ but we will partake of the life of the blood and where do we find the path of life to the blood we find it he said through my words he saiden it'll be through the word can't separate the the blood from the word amen it's the path to the blood the path to the blood is the word that's right Jesus said it himself you can't separate the blood from the word his words coming out of his mouth then is what we eat and I might add this to say that the mouth that he uses Through the Bible the mouth is always referred to as the prophets the mouth of God is referred to as the prophets the mystery of Christ is declared through the prophets according to Revelations 10:7 amen the mystery of Christ is declared All Through the Bible because the mystery of Christ didn't just start at the evening time right didn't just start in just when Paul began to preach the merer of Christ I I'm having some studying this recently with uh a little bit study and talk on the phone with brother Aaron McGary because he looked at Paul's Ministry and how uh Paul's I I don't want to get into this completely but Paul was called to bring the mystery of Christ not just the days of Flesh of Christ right he said I'm here to preach the mystery of Christ and so it was a further revelation of Christ wasn't it and you're in that Revelation because you're in Christ that's right so he didn't the disciples knew Jesus after the flesh but Paul knew him by the by greater Revelation that's why he's called to his position that day to bring the mystery of Christ well that mystery was preached throughout the whole Bible and you know it was declared by revelations 10:7 in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished in the seventh angel it will be finished the mystery but did you ever read the rest as he had declared to his servants the prophets that's right the mystery of Christ was spoken All Through the Bible amen by the mouth of who by the mouth of the prophets amen that's what the Bible says and then you'll find in 2 Chronicles 36:12 Jeremiah was declared the mouth of the Lord Jeremiah the prophet was declared the mouth of the Lord so now let's let's move on now then the blood comes in a form that we partake of it when he when he has it in the word we partake of it we don't partake of the literal blood of the Lord uh these things are so easy to understand we we realize that even that day uh when he said except you eat my flesh and drink my blood if you looked at it carnally uh what in the world do he say you know is he a vampire you know are we vampires that's the carnal look at what you would see what Jesus says there and look at what Jesus is saying but it's a spiritual meaning that we ourselves we don't have a connection with the physical blood of Jesus Christ but our connection is the life of the blood and US partaking of the life of the blood amen as we partake of the word we can never separate the blood from the word and we can never SE separate the blood from light right we can never separate the blood from the word in scripture you can't isolate a scripture on the blood in the Bible and separate it from other scriptures that's right because other scriptures declare the path to the blood is the word amen other scriptures like 1 John 1:7 declare that the path to the blood and the cleansing of the blood is light you know what I'm talking about if you walk in the light as he is in the light uh you have fellowship with one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses you from all sin so there John as first second third John as John warns of the Antichrist Spirit coming he he begins talking about light and he ties the blood of Jesus Christ there with with light be and and what is light Thy word is a lamp unto me my feet and a light unto my path right so now you'll find the path to the blood is through the word of God and through light when he puts the light out and light is what understanding right everybody understand what I'm saying tonight this is this is rocking science it's just these are scriptures that often quite often people isolate scripture sometimes to themselves and form a Doctrine on it right but we don't want to do that every man's capable of doing that denominations are capable of doing that every man's capable of doing it but a lot of times they isolate something and try to form oh okay this is what it means but then it doesn't match the rest of scripture so you can never separate the the blood of Jesus Christ from the word or to the or the light or understanding John says you'll start to walk in darkness he says he that uh he that W uh can we read it just a minute because we're trusting my uh recol recollection and it's not good first John verse 5 this then is the message we heard of him and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no Darkness all remember the theme through these first three chapters is to give warning of what how to go up against the Antichrist Spirit and the first subject he's going to deal with here is is light the True Fellowship of God and the light God is light and in him is no Darkness at all if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth person can say that they're walking in the light and that they're walking in the darkness of the word in other words they're not walking in the understanding that God is God has shed light on something and they refuse to walk in it they say I'm walking in the light no you're you're not that's right right no you're not but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses us from all sin can you say praise the Lord there's the path to the blood and listen we're finished without the path to the blood without the blood of Jesus Christ friends we're lost there is no hope for any man outside of the blood of Jesus Christ it's all in the blood it's in the blood of Jesus Christ Alone that we have salvation amen but we find that then the I'll just say this before we move on the Antichrist Spirit separated the blood from the light and the word and thus made it more and more ineffective throughout church history I'm going to say it again the Antichrist Spirit separated the blood from the light and from the word and thus made it more and more ineffective made the blood ineffective throughout church history true were they still believing in the blood oh yeah we believe the blood the Catholic Church believes in the blood of Jesus Christ that's what began the Antichrist Spirit can you say Amen it was already working in the early church but what's the main distinction of it the main distinction of the Antichrist spirit is to separate the blood from the word and from light further light and and present light because because John referred to present truth Peter referred to that we walk in he says that we be established in present truth why do you have to say present truth why didn't you just say we be established in the truth yeah he he made a states that present truth because he knew the Revelation that there's when the light comes to the age that's what the people need to walk in good is anybody getting anything out of this tonight and so so now as as the Antichrist Spirit came it separated the blood from the light in the word and thus made it more and more effective the Catholic Church separated the blood from the word because they begin to take out the parts of the word that they didn't want right got got their own Bible now right right and and separated from from uh all these other things and then we but we still want to hold on to the the subject of the blood we want to hold on this to this but look at all the stuff and look at all the stuff they added to it they added to the blood of Jesus Christ they said it's the blood yeah but you got to burn candles you got to do this you could pay yourself out of purgatory they had all these additions and that's the Antichrist Spirit now you have daughters of the Antichrist Daughters of the mother of harlots the mother of harlots daughters and systems that do exactly the same thing this pulling out different parts of the word but every time you take away the word you interrupt the effect of the blood of Jesus Christ every time you isolate a scripture and not take the whole word you you uh you interrupt the effects of the of the blood of Jesus Christ that's why at the end time he said I will restore what's he restoring well first the truth of the blood of Jesus Christ the truth and Luther caught a little bit of it Luther caught it he's he's saying he's saying I this this candle doesn't save me right he come to a truth to purify the revelation of what the blood of Jesus Christ was and what justification was God began to reveal that to him you know what it was it was light yes and when those people come under that light of that messenger that U fifth angel messenger when they come under the light of that and light was shed on it they they come into an experience with Christ of the true measure of the blood of Jesus Christ for their lives because the Catholic church and the systems had d destroy the effects of the blood changing somebody that's right by Creeds and dogmas so the I'm only elaborating on this so that we understand the blood of Jesus Christ and that we understand how powerful it is and what it is to us so that's what it means by bringing now the lamb and the home Christ bring the word Christ being brought in and eating it together as a family we're speaking of blessed families not by the world's standards but blessed in God's books and this is it my question is are you bringing the lamb into your home are you eating it h are you preparing it look what they did in Exodus 12 they prepared it they took time it was a priority yes bringing the word into your home is just just not just a flimsy thing but it's it was an important thing that night they took time they they dressed it here back in Exodus and even there was a certain way that they ate it it he says and thus shall eat it with your loins girded your shoes on your feet your staff in your hand just a a little bit of a dress code there and I'm not bringing one here tonight I'm just saying here's details of how they prepared this this was an important thing in the home that night bringing the lamb to eat it together preparing it they took some time with it it must have been a priority by what God is bringing it to them in this way and they took some time with the lamb and homes today are not blessed because they think a little visit to church on Sunday and hearing us scripture is enough they're not bringing the lamb into their home it's not just the written word of Christ too say well I read my Bible no Christ is more than just the Bible we want to see Christ Living in Mom and Dad we want to see Christ Living in those children we want to see the expression of the person because remember he's not a book He's a person this Reveals His person but he's more than just a book so when we why do we read the book then because that's our access to get to the person that's how does the person what's his characteristics who is he and we glorify him and bring him and brother R says we when we talk about him he comes near how wonderful when we talk about Christ he comes near that's how we welcome the person of Christ into our home is when we talk about his precepts we talk about we're reading and sometimes it seems so mechanical you you got those little kids that are falling asleep on you I got a 12-year-old that falls asleep on me shouldn't have said that sorry honey she only does that like once a year she usually she's listening really good but uh you know that's the thing they they fall asleep but you know what they read the word of God to them read the word because it's our access talk about it talk about what he's doing because when you talk about him he he comes near then it's more than a book and then those K children get the to the AES that mine AR now they know when they feel the presence of God they've been to enough camps they've been in enough and they've actually been in our home where they know when the presence of God comes in the room and I mean he's always there but I mean in in a real more effective way where you can actually feel his presence it's so wonderful to know that you know something else is happening here and it's so wonderful it's so wonderful that it's more than just a book it's more than just a Book and Tape it's more than just something of of of of the the message it's a person can you say you Lord hallelujah thank you Lord I'm about ready to cry here because I this is what's important amen this is what's important is the person of Christ in our homes bring the lamb into your home and and so it's not just the written word but it's the living Christ take time to eat it and it becomes so real we want to see him by Revelation this is not meant to put a a lot of pressure on you men to be preachers because a lot of times you say bring the word to your family you know they feel that they have to you know give a whole and you know I'm not asking you to get out out of your calling the Bible says stay in your calling please because that's that'll that'll be worse for your families if you get out of your calling if you're not a teacher don't teach the word of God if you're not a preacher Don't Preach the word of God brother sister if you're a farmer be a good farmer serve the Lord because and he say the man that gets his lunchbox in God in Simplicity he says he says the man that grabs his lunchbox kisses his family has devotions with his family gets his Lon goes to his Factory job he said God can do more through that simple man than all the priests and all the big dignitaries and all and all the intellectuals god in simplicity so God can reveal himself even more in that man than the preachers amen amen but don't get out of your calling and I'm not pressuring you you got to bring a whole discourse on the Seven Seals to your six-year-olds good luck with that but you know what still teach them and and read to them the word of God and teach them and live the word to them is the Lamb the center of your home when your kids are small when our kids were small we had to be brief in our family alter time because of their attention spans when they're two-year-old and got the twozies there's not much attention span there on the things of the word of God so we had to you know be brief and then as they got older we been begin spending more time breaking it down to them and we read sometimes we read interesting stories like biographies and stuff like that biographies of great Christians sometimes we use that for our devotional but as they get older you begin spending more time breaking things down for them and tell them what the Lord is opening up to you share with them brothers and sisters share them with them what God has opened in the word to you in this time this great unveiling of God in the last days that's what it is it's Revelation means the unveiling it's taken taking the unveil off it's the unveiling of God and all of it's unveiled in the end time and what he unveils to you share it with your children share it with everybody share it with your business partners share it with tell what the Lord is showing you but certainly don't tell the whole world and not tell your children that's right amen amen and so when and when they get older and do get a relationship with him then it's not as hard because there's a hunger there to eat the lamb too and so so they come on board with it more the best meal served in your home is lamb the lamb can you say amen amen we sat a couple Sundays I I we miss church last Sunday was it two Sundays ago and we sat and listened to the message uh brother brand preach respects and we really really enjoyed it as the prophet just went from scripture to scripture and example example teaching us how important it is to have respect to God's servants that's right so if I would encourage if you want to start somewhere just start there it goes along with what Solomon said that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom it's hard to teach wisdom if you don't have the fear of the Lord and fear and respect not fear in the sense you're scared but it starts with the fear of the Lord and respect that God is real God speaks through his servants and even when we don't understand he says somebody he said brandom Tabernacle he said someone I know people get in the flesh sometimes people speak in tongues sometimes it's real sometimes not he says but don't say anything about it don't criticize it what's he doing he's and maybe that thing was wrong maybe that prophecy was wrong but he's teaching the people from the word of God don't criticize it don't say anything about it because when you criticize it you may find yourself disrespecting criticizing God that's God servant and God did speak through a my be careful of that what a tremendous time it was and you know I want to say qualify and say don't get the impression that we do that all the time we listen to tapes all the time we don't do it enough but or that we have devotions every night we don't have devotions every night um everybody has their time they probably spend in the word but two or three times a week we just gather everybody together for prayer and devot devotion time and then we have a lot of time we'll do something like that but I tell you it was wonderful and we just encourage you I don't want to give the impression tonight that we do this all the time we're the perfect family in doing this we need more of a lamb in our home and we we could use more of it and I just tell you how much we enjoyed from the youngest age all the way up how much we enjoyed just sitting and listening to that um message of the Prophet it was just wonderful so when we it's just gathering together and focusing on something in the word and you when you do it the family will feel more secure in facing life's problems your wife will feel more secure that you're solidly based on the word and that you know where you're going you know and and and it just brings a security about it those children feel more secure they may face all kinds of things the next day they may face all kinds of things at school but that's the anchor isn't it it's just an absolute that there's a security we we prayed together and and we've invited God and no I know he's on our side to fight our battles with us amen when brother Bram speaks of family altar he spoke back in a quote uh an early quote he says he's praying he said heal the sick tonight father make the blind to see father make the deaf to hear the dumb to speak the cripples to walk cure the Cure the heart trouble Lord cure the cancer and all kinds of troubles and then he says God and I pray that you'll mend up broken homes and make the ones that's in homes that's indifferent fathers and mothers who doesn't pray give them an experience tonight that they'll start a family altar in their home Grant it Lord so he's praying for cancer to be healed he's praying for the deaf ears to be open God can do all of this but he's also praying for broken homes to be mended and he's praying that fathers and mothers who are indifferent towards each other and their uh he says here that homes that are broken up broken homes that they'll experience something tonight that they'll start bringing family altar back in their home again 1963 he says you fathers you mothers are you ready to establish altar in your house and take the television out are you ready to take the deck of cards off the table and them comic book books that your children's reading preparing their little mind for the blast the devil that the devil's going to give them are you ready to establish the old family altar again or you do you just want to continue on the way you are amen so I want you to see something in this tonight that uh was a little different that evening another thing that's a little different I I don't know the time uh yeah I do it's on my iPad 8:20 all right so I got about 10 minutes here or however long the Lord wants I want you to see something else that was different that night never before had God instructed them to apply the blood to the doorpost of their home remember now it's the evening time so we can bring that to our evening time and say that they had the blood they had the lamb but this night they were to apply it to their home I want you to understand that they apply it to the doorpost of the home in other words words it was on the outside it was on display why why first of all because it was going to be time for the death angel to come so the blood had to be in the form that was displayed to show the death angel who you were as a family because it's was going to hit all of Egypt it's going to hit all the families but you had to openly display your identity with the lamb in order for the death angel to pass your house so it was all about identity who are you ident ified with right and so the death angel could tell that's a believer's home by the display of the blood on their home not just they had the blood in their home but they had it on display there was a distinction in that night that was made that is a type in scripture I believe of of our time because God wanted to bring something through the holy ghost that the blood of the Lamb the blood of the Lamb would not just stay there but the blood of the Lamb would be on display by the Holy Ghost by what was called in in uh Exodus 12 the token it's called The Token which is a type of the Holy Ghost the token and so now we have the blood but we also have the blood on display and so that becomes a token and it shows the price has been paid the death angel said the looked at the blood and says I'll pass over that home when we have the blood applied to our lives then the death brother Bram says death is in the land today spiritual death is already in the land going through killing people killing families spiritually and he says he passes he looks in there says and that's a sign that the price the full price has been paid other words a lamb has died for their life there has to be something on display to show that right aren't you happy tonight friends the full price has been paid amen that's a great thing to display to the world but that that thing to say the price is that token means like going to the years ago when you went to the train station you were get received a token not so much a ticket but a ticket it's like token and when the the head of the train looked at your uh ticket he seen that the price had been paid you might have paid it a month ahead of time but the price had been paid so the token in your life is the Holy Ghost it shows the price has been paid by Calvary can you say Amen but something had to be on display and so the death angel knew you as identity as a family I am identified with my lamb and I I have the blood of the Lamb on display no one could tell that from the outside unless it was on display and we should have kept something in this that's what we call the token a sign the price has been paid in this case a lamb died the price was paid but what's the evidence that the price was paid the token the Holy Ghost it shows to the world the price has been paid so you you have that distinction is that uh the lamb died yes the lamb died Christ died for our sins but there's something beyond that in the sense of the whole the Holy Ghost displays to the world that price has been paid and it also causes the death angel to pass Jesus shed his blood on Calvary and we believe that but then he applied the blood to the lives of the people in the upper room and gave them the token that the blood had taken effect that's good I have to say that one again Jesus shed his blood on Calvary how many believe that but then he applied the blood to the lives of the people in the upper room 120 he applied the blood to them through the Holy Ghost can you say amen and he gave them a token that the blood had taken effect on their lives so you may believe in the blood but has the blood taken effect and everybody could tell something had taken effect up there they knew themselves for sure this is what was promised by the by the prophet Joel it's happening right now I have been filled with the Holy Ghost you know what that was it was the effects of the Bloodshed on Calvary you could believe it all you want to but in that Upper Room it was more than just believing they were feeling the effects of it hallelujah hallelujah praise God and so they gave them that token that the blood had taken effect notice for years they had the Jews before that night for years the Jews had kept up the blood for years the Jews had had a lamb you know even job before job was the oldest book of the Bible job brought a lamb Abel brought a lamb he brought a sacrifice because and he did it because he didn't read no Bible that said it what do I bring to worship before God he caught it by Revelation c a revelation and he's bringing a bloody lamb it's all bloody and everything Abel all the way through they kept up the lamb they kept up the lamb they they believed they they kept up the lamb but this night it wasn't enough just to keep up the lamb it wasn't enough just to have the sacrifice I hope you're listening real close when that night changed it wasn't enough just to believe in the sacrifice or just to have the sacrifice it had to be on display that's right at the end time it's not enough just to believe in the blood but you have to have the token of the blood on display in your life for the death angel to pass after that night see job brought the lamb All Through the Bible they brought the lamb Abraham all of them bringing the lamb bringing the sacrifice but that night at the evening time keeping it up was not enough believing it was not enough showing there was more to just a mental exercise of believing in the blood that brings results that's right showing us today that there's more than a mental exercise of believing the blood that brings the results there has to be an experience with the life of the blood amen amen right and teachers who don't teach this take their people off track I'll give you an example I was at a concert one time and during the concert I was enjoying the concert and this fell got up and uh he gave us testimony of how he gave his heart to the Lord and was saved and I was rejoicing it he had a great testimony and I was just you know he was just going on and I thought that was wonderful God's really touched that man and it was just like one of the southern gospel concerts so that was good we went out to music and then I was over in the parking lot and I looked over the parking lot and there's that man behind the behind the car kind of hiding I guess but he was behind there just just smoking a cigarette just going on and on and on smoking it so I tried not to judge but I said at that young age I just I just thought I'm going to challenge this guy I'm just to talk to him and I just went up to him I said I said brother I said you know you just gave your testimony how God changed your life I said you're up there Tes him how God saved you and I said I don't want to knock that but I said How's it that you can fit that with with uh your temple being the Holy Ghost and you smoking these cigarettes boy he got so defensive he just said I just want to let you know I'm saved I'm Sanctified and when I believed I received the Holy Ghost I've got the Holy Ghost and I'm heading to heaven and kept just smoking off now I don't blame that man and I'm I'm not going to question what he has I'm not going to tell him what he don't have I don't blame him I blame the teacher that taught him wrong that's right he wasn't taught correctly in the scripture what a true experience with God is because with that experience of the blood is going to bring you to the Holy Ghost feeling to realize the scriptures that say my temple is a temple of the Holy Ghost so it wasn't that man's problem no some hopefully let's pray someday he caught further light in on the scripture and he realized further truth because that teacher misled him I don't know what denomination it was but he misled him he isolated a certain scripture and said okay you did that you're saved bang bing bang that's it you don't have to change your life you don't have to do anything you don't have to you know no it's a deception it's a deception it's the same deception that's watered down throughout the ages the effects of the blood of Jesus Christ listen God can change a life in the worst condition that it is whoever it is God can change your life if the Holy Ghost is there and when he does it he does it well we don't want to water down the new birth can you say am man we don't want to water down the blood we want to see its full effect in our lives and we want to we want to witness of it to see the full effect in other lives that's right am praise the Lord hallelujah amen so he gave them he applied the blood on in the upper room so that the effects of the blood could take effect so the token was applied to the home not the church the first that applies to your house this house okay I'm not just preaching tonight to your physical homes but I'm going to get to that in just a second but it's this house that the blood is applied and it's on on display and the blood is on the doorpost of the house the people of the world ought to see the results if you say you have the Holy Ghost they are seed in your life if there's no Sanctified set aart life there that's that's the second stages of Grace justification sanctification and then onto the Holy Ghost it it it brings even other things in your life but we ought to see a Sanctified life separated life it's not that you're a perfect person but overall we see a Sanctified life if you're going to claim the Holy Ghost separated from the things of the world let's not water down the Holy Spirit let's leave it how it is if you don't feel like you're there then don't try to water it down and bring the Holy Ghost listen to me now don't try to bring a new interpretation of the Holy Ghost to fit your lifestyle so you feel better about the sin that you're doing let's leave it as it is and let's surrender to him say Lord take my life further because obviously I've got some compromises let's not water down Salvation let's not water down the Holy Ghost so the token was applied to your home and it's applied to this house Your Vessel the holy ghost in your holy ghost in your life showing that you are identified with your lamb the word right it'll show who you're identified with your life will show who you're identified with whether it's with the word or not so and that's Amen to every word of God how do I know the blood of Jesus Christ is there by the life that I can see that displays the word of God if the word says it then that's it this also applies though as we close brothers and sisters to our homes Exodus 12 is not applied to the church or the synagogue it's applied to the home and so that tells us there is there's actions to what we believe that we uh administer in our home based upon what we believe and one of the things the prophet taught us in the token here is and I'm going to read a couple quotes and we'll close the end time is one of an application of the token just like that evening was that it wasn't just having the blood in your home but it was applying the blood right it wasn't just and this is the hour of the application of the blood if there ever was an hour for it this is the hour of the app not just believing the blood but the application of the blood and because of that that's what led the prophet to say things like this in Egypt when they went down to Jericho if you want to read this in Acts 6631 excuse me not in Egypt but in uh in Jericho acts 1631 Paul told the Centurion believe I am the Messenger of the hour believe on the Lord Jesus Christ thou and thy house shall be saved that's right believe for your house bring them all under and now you've seen the god of Heaven perform a miracle it's before judgment do you believe it yes what can I do and he said rise and be baptized Paul took him out baptized him said now believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou and thy house shall be saved so we have the ability to be able to believe for us but to believe for our house as well to believe for our children this effect can go to our children as well believe what believe the Lord Jesus Christ for your house apply the token to your house then what do I do when you apply it to your house move all of the trash out so now where's now is where this application comes now is not where this home is like a a Bible believing home that says Do You Believe In The Blood yes I believe in the blood do you believe this this yes I believe in that no it's a home that actually when light is shined on a thing in the word that they need to do they apply it they go do it say uh children you know uh God showed me something in the word we haven't been doing this for years but I can see it clear now in the word it's what we should do and so we're cleaning up this place around here that's the application of the blood token applied to your home he says move all the trash out get all the short skirts amen catch the theme Now Catch the theme it's the blood it's the application of the blood and these things that work their way in obviously are not in harmony right are not in harmony with a home that's Christ centered and following the word that's right get the short skirts out the shorts the cards the cigarettes the televisions and whatever more and kick them out the door when you go to apply the token you won't stand for it yes sir take it all out all the dances the parties the rock and roll can you say Amen to that all the vgar newspapers and the stuff that's of the world kick it out the door and say we're cleaning up this place around here if you don't feel like you're in a spiritual Revival this may be the reason that you don't realize you have to apply the token to your home that's right if you feel spiritually destitute maybe this is the part of your life that you haven't applied is that we're cleaning up this place around here and getting this stuff out and like Jacob did he told his wife he said wash your clothes and everything put away them gobs we're going over Jordan you know when Joshua said when he was crossing over he said wash your clothes come not at your wives when they crossed Jordan there was a sanctification there and say we're getting ready to go over so get ready for within three weeks across Jordan he's getting ready was applying the token that's what he was doing some actions had to be taken we're getting ready across door he brings it all through the Bible there he shows he shows two examples showing us that that that theme of actions to sanctify your life something's coming up that night I'd say something was coming up the death angel was passing through the L amen that's pretty important right and friends we're living in in in we're living in the the last Dark Hour here this is almost over in fact I pray that it's over sooner than later I even so come quickly Lord Jesus but there was a preparation of those who were looking for him to come to sanctify their lives applying this to their lives in preparation for that come it's it's in the Bible it's in the Bible he says let your family let your loved ones let them now this is the part that if you give me three more minutes I don't like to leave this part out of applying the token because usually we only hear kick the TVs out kick the short skirts out kick them out do it apply it and it kind of gives this impression that there's this real arrogant dad that's just going through the home and throwing out stereos and you know just yeah get this stuff out of here so I want to read the rest of the quotes amen CU there's something wrong with that picture matter of fact you're not going to have much respect for your family if you do it that way but so many years in the message friends that's the way it was done there was divorces took place because the way the guy thought he was applying the token to his home wife said I don't even proud of that I don't see any Christ in that right had had had men confess to me says I lost my wife because of the wrong way of applying the word of God tried to repent tried to repair it just couldn't be repaired damage already done a Zeal without knowledge that's right but he says get ready apply it believe it clean up let your children let your family let your loved ones see it in you that's right it'll take effect yes sir then apply the token in prayer with consideration with believing apply it with such love and so forth wow till you know it's going to take effect it's going to take place that's all apply it in confidence believing it's going to help when you talk to that child when you talk to your husband talk to your wife talk to this loved one believe that it's going to help them just stand there and say Lord I've claimed them they're mine I'm getting them for you now there's a spirit of prayer and the spirit of love to apply the token because this isn't about you this isn't about you it's about applying the token the presence of God in your life I want to bring the presence of the Lord more in my home I want to bring the lamb in my home that's what it's about you can't do that with a bad attitude that's right apply it and create that atmosphere around you that they'll just drop right into it

left the faith and left the the the the things that they once held dear many friends Lord have walked away from things they taught me things they taught me they've walked away from them that's a hard hard thing but we pray for them Lord we pray that your love would be extended to them Lord the the blindness of their eyes it would be lifted off off their eyes that they could see again we realize because of things sometimes the homes can have different situations we have single moms raising their kids here Lord and we have sister inz who lives with an unbelieving husband and so Lord every situation you can bless the families you can still bring a blessing to them Lord when they follow the word of God with all of their heart when they have the fear of God for the principles of God and
