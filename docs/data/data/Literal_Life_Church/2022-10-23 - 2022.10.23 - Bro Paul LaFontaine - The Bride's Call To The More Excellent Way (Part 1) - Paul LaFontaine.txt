========================================

through six or seven Bibles and this one's in the place Pages start to come out and I'm going to talk about Divine love today and it's First Corinthians 13 12 and 13 what I want to read from and that's the one page of my Bible That's fallen out and I said in that just like the devil that's the one chapter he does so he wants to tear out of the Bible for sure but I'm putting it back in and we're going to read from It Anyway even if the devil don't like it so I want to read from First Corinthians 12 I'll just read one scripture now and then we'll pick up 13 afterwards First Corinthians 12 and one verse and if you know your Bible you'll know that it uh it's speaking of correcting the gifts it's talking about the gifts in the Corinthian Church Gifts of Prophecy all the gifts there's so many that Paul mentions uh the nine spiritual gifts and all the other helps and all these other things matter of fact we could just read all the things he mentions here verse 28 he says God has set some in the church first apostles secondary prophets thirdly teachers after that Miracles then Gifts of healings helps governments diversities of tongues are all Apostles no are all prophets no are all teachers no are all workers of Miracles no have all the gifts of healing no do all speak with tongues no do all interpret no but this is scripture that I want to use this morning but Paul says covet earnestly the best gifts and yet and yet of all the gifts yet I show unto you a more excellent way yet I show unto you a more excellent way and I'd like to speak on the bride's call to the more excellent way father we pray you'll bless your word today thank you for our children Lord I pray that you'll instill the gospel and the truths of the Gospel in their hearts and their minds I pray that you'll protect them be with him so burdened early this morning of the Brokenness in this world and the Brokenness of families Lord it almost makes us a bit fearful to raise our children in such a place it's becoming Lord darker and darker every moment but Lord we have a token we have a hope we have a strength in the word Lord we have your presence that we can call upon in our homes and our families and our churches and Lord we're so grateful for that and I pray that your great protection will be over their minds over their hearts Lord and for the congregation as a whole I pray father that you'll bless each one and Lord lift them up and strengthen them today by the word of God whoever may be listening we place them Lord completely in your hands each of the souls that's in our care we place them in your hands we pray you'll bless the word today and Lord we've many have traveled a long ways we've come Lord to sit here and to learn from you today and so Lord I know that you'll never disappoint a heart that's making this sacrifice to come and to sit and hear your word you you never disappoint us Lord and I pray that you'll help us to learn your word and may your anointing come that our ears can receive it right in Jesus name amen amen Shake somebody's hand again before you sit down God bless you each one In The Name Of The Lord amen I want to continue speaking a little bit about Divine love and we know that we're in a series here in the relationships after Redemption and so at the last message that we preached on that a few weeks ago we talked about relationship staff Redemption it ended up in Romans talking about love and the particular scripture that said oh no man anything but yet it says we should owe them love we're in a debt to everybody with the love of God so I was very moved by that and never quite seen it that way that we should not be in debt of course we shouldn't owe anybody anything but we owe everybody we owe everybody the love of God that we have on our heart and we're not really allowed to withhold that from some people and give it to others we owe the love of God to everyone that we meet it's a pretty powerful scripture we have an obligation I don't like calling an obligation because God's love is never comes out as an obligation but he he Paul brings it like a debt we have have a debt to everybody and we can't withhold that when we owe that we owe the love of God he gave it to us and so we owe that to everyone else so we ended on the subject of love and so I want to go and just elaborate on then speaking about the bride's call to the more excellent way and I'm sure you've heard some sermons and different things on Divine love and and it's good to talk about and but we want to make sure that we understand what Paul was saying here in the more excellent way that he's talking about because because often in our generation love has been watered down there's different meanings to love it has been perverted by the enemy and so because of that our perception of love can come down to just giving just a charitable giving or some type of Act of sacrifice but if you read in First Corinthians 13 closely you realize Paul takes acts of sacrifice he takes tongues he takes intellect and being knowing all the Mysteries he takes all these things and he says it's all fine it's part of the Kingdom but without love so an act of charitable giving to give all that your goods to feed the poor we look at that as love but the love that Paul's talking about is not that it's actually something deeper than that so because we live in a generation that love is misinterpreted love is dirtied it would just would you say that I mean when you have two homosexuals saying they love one another then we know that Satan has perverted a genuine love for a man and a woman even and so we have different perceptions by what with the television that we've seen we've grown up on the Perceptions in this world that we live in and all of you are aware of that every day but we must understand we shouldn't attach God's love to something that we hear in the world or see in the world Paul's speaking about a way in a a and divine love here that's quite different and quite deeper and that's why as Christians we want to look at it he says I want to show you after speaking of the gifts in the church tongues and interpretation and not only speaking of the gifts but correcting them Corinthians is the book of Corrections and the in the Corinthian Church which was the great spiritual church and they had the gifts working and they had prophecies working and they had all those things functioning and yet with all of it some of them got out of order and Paul had to correct them and say do things this way do things that way so Corinthians is the book of Correction on many levels but especially the gifts and so then right in the middle of correcting the gifts right in the middle of showing and he says here covet earnestly seek after the best gifts so that shows us that there are gifts that are that that we can have but then there's the the better gifts if you want to know an example of that chapter 14 and verse 1 uh speaks of uh Desiring spiritual gifts and he says and but rather that ye may prophesy so he takes tongues and interpretation and he actually says it's better if someone speaks an unknown tongue it's better that they prophesy that's better so it's not that it's better in the sense that God has different but there are better gifts that we should cover he says if somebody speaks a tongue in a public setting they shouldn't speak that unless there's a prophecy because the unbeliever won't understand what's being said and they say you're crazy you see so there's a fine-tuning there's a correction there's a way God there's an order God handles those gifts and every taking the gifts away but then Paul says covet the best gifts and I think we should do that but in saying covet earnestly the best gifts then he says this he introduces and he says but Corinthians I'm going to show you a more excellent way and to these childish immature Corinthians I don't know if their ears were too open because they were enjoying so much the gifts of the Spirit working in the church and when he says but I'm going to show you a more excellent way I'm going to show you something that's a deeper level I'm going to show you something that actually trumps all of that and I don't know I don't know I I don't know how open they were to listening to it but I do know this more excellent way is the culmination and the calling of the Bride for the last days and whether all the Corinthians came into all of it or not we as the Bride of the last days are to come into this way that Paul was preaching about as a matter of fact I believe it's the final culmination of the bride and what she comes to she will come into a victory of divine love how many believe that together so so now he introduced it he says I want to show you a more excellent way it is only chapter 13 that he introduces this in such a a big Way chapter 13. so let's read it real quickly because uh if you don't know it then I want to be referring to this he says I want to show you a more excellent Way chapter 13. it's Unique to itself though I speak with tongues of men and of angels and have not charity I am become as a sounding brass or a tinkling symbol and though I have the gift of Prophecy and understand all Mysteries and all knowledge and though I have all Faith so that I could remove mountains and have not charity I am nothing this is quite a rebuke to the Corinthians because there are people of faith there are people of the tongue's interpretation there are people of the gifts working their faith would rise because Jesus said you could remove mountains with faith and their faith could rise to do that and Paul's actually saying now just be careful because you can have all Faith to remove a mountain just like Jesus said and still be missing the substance of what you need and though I bestow all of my goods you sell everything you have to feed the poor and though I give my body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth me nothing you can imagine what the Corinthians are beginning to feel here because Paul's taking all the things that they lift up and emphasize and he's saying it's all of God it's all wonderful but you could be missing the substance of divine love charity and so that's the first three verses and then he goes into explaining it charity suffereth long charity is kind charity envieth not charity vaunteth not itself is not puffed up Charity does not have pride in it it does not behave itself unseemly it's seeketh not our own there's no selfishness in Divine love it is not easily provoked thinking no evil Rejoice is not iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth beareth all things believeth all things hope with all things endureth all things charity never faileth but whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether they be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect has come then that which is in part shall be done away he not only is preaching about this entrance of divine love and this this realm that we're to come into this excellent way how many want to come into that excellent way not only is he preaching it but he now he prophesies there's a prophecy in it saying that then when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as the child but when I became a man I put away childish things he's actually attacking childhood to staying just in the Realms of the gifts and giving at the level I've given my body to be burned he said we can't stay at that level or we stay childish in our Christian walk but this more excellent way is maturity is adoption is mature love is a victory in Divine love it's higher it's better can you say Amen it's a more excellent way than just being in the Realms of the gifts when I was a child but when I became a man I put away childish things for now we see through a glass Darkly but then face to face now I know in part but then shall I know even as also I am known and now by the faith hope and notice he says he abides we never get rid of faith we got to have faith to live by we we never get rid of Hope how many needs hope to live by now abideth all those things he's not getting rid of any of it now by the faith not writing by this hope but the greatest the greatest of all these three is love and don't forget that the greatest of these is love all the substances are there all the things from Christ are there but the greatest of these is love so now when he refers to it as Charity in our minds charity is giving to the poor and charity is because we have a different meaning today but in the Greek it's agape and Agape means it is the highest form of love and when you have the highest form of love it it is not man's love it's not originating at all in man or our minds or our hearts the highest form of love does not originate with us it only originates in God so the charity and love he's talked about does not it cannot and will never originate in man at all it doesn't originate in you it originates in God thus if you have God within you that's when you tap into this more excellent Way It Is God it's not originated in us trying to be better trying to be nice it doesn't origin anything in mind I need to be nicer to people it's not that it's not human at all can you say Amen this resonates in God himself and when he puts that into an individual they have a potential to come into a more excellent way that they function every day by Divine love that the gifts function with the motive of divine love that everything we do is being motivated by this Divine love the highest form of love I don't want any I you know we have filio love we have Agape that we have filial love and then as brother Brahm says it keeps getting down as Satan perverts loves I I have a filial love brother Bob says you have affiliate love for your wife a man could have affiliate love without God a failure love for his wife there's somebody uh somebody insulted your wife that man would want to kill him and that's what philia love would do but God's love brother Ram says would pray for the man's soul so it's a higher level you see so we can't stay oh Lord help me to say this there's no way Believers can stay in Realms of love that are just more human we're not called to just give filio love there's an affectionate love how many believe we have to have it in our families you have to have it for your children husbands have to have it for wives wives have to have it for the husband it's just not not Agape you need but if you don't have filial love or affectionate love in your marriage good luck with that and so we have other levels of love there's there's sexual love as well which God gave a place in marriage we have those things but you see now we're not called just to human loves or emotional loves we are called to a more excellent way and that does not originate with us it originates in a victory in Divine love for the bride can you say Amen we are the ones called to come come into that love and it is a better way so now it doesn't originate in man it's it's only possible to enter into this excellent Way by those who have him by the Holy Ghost in their soul there's no other way to tap into it this excellent way except by the Holy Ghost because it is him he is the Holy Ghost he is the originator of love he is the the Supreme form of love can you say Amen so you couldn't have this you couldn't access it without the Holy Ghost it's not possible to be genuinely expressed with Divine love to genuinely express it except he is living on the inside outward Acts outward acts of demonstrations may try to duplicate Divine love even without the Holy Ghost people try to duplicate it try to duplicate this love but it'll never be really real until you have him living on the inside I'm just separating that now that's why someone's got to say Lord if I don't have the Holy Ghost please fill me with your Holy Spirit God it's too late to be messing around God let me have the real thing but when you have the real thing you have potential for adoption and you have potential for mature love and you have potential for the more excellent way that Paul's preaching to the Corinthians say Lord I want to I want to move every day into this more excellent way I don't want to live in the other realm with the rest of the church world and the rest of the message so to speak that stays in this realm of just prophecies and giving and all these other things but there's a more excellent way than all of that and I as individual this is to me the bride's Revival this is we have faith to move mountains we've had Miracles you know I just want to say that somebody keeps saying that we're looking for this and we're looking for that I'm always under expectation whatever God will do but I just want to say people preach things sometimes as if we're still as if we haven't had any miracles for years since I was a boy I've watched the original faith of Pentecost manifested around me we're not waiting for that that's been Among Us I've seen the dead race I've seen the blind eyes open I've seen cancer healed and I still want to see it but it's not like we're waiting for that to come that faith has already been here how many would agree with me it's good to know it's like people preach it as if this is coming this is coming but see now since the prophet brought us back to the original faith of Pentecost and we catch that by faith you're you're seeing you've seen it even some of you that maybe have become bitter towards the message or whatever you have to admit that your whole life you have seen the power of God you've seen people healed and when God chooses to take somebody you continue on believing because you've seen enough evidence God can do it praise the Lord so now Paul himself draws a distinction in demonstrations like selling everything you have and giving to the poor or sacrifice and giving your body to be burned Paul draws a distinction in sacrifice and if this is hard because love is sacrificial even Christ's love is sacrificial but you see demonstrations of a sacrifice if somebody wakes me up at three in the morning says my my tire's flat you know I I do one of two things I get up and go help them with it or I'll call Ryan or somebody to go do it I don't know but you know it's it's it's acts of sacrifice and all that's great and it's and it's fine but Paul is the one who makes a distinction giving your body to be burned and and also selling all that you have been giving it to support these are demonstrations can you say man and and and and things that we do but he draws a distinction in that that you could give those things and still not have Divine love he's the one who does it right into the Corinthians and so we have to make that distinction especially when we're justifying ourselves and we feel guilty often when people feel guilty they'll do demonstrations of Acts to relieve their guilt oh boy come on now don't let me lose the amens hello we do it in human nature the Catholic does Burns a candle to do it to relieve the guilt because there's no blood there to relieve their sin and their guilt of sin if they preach the blood of Jesus Christ that'll completely relieve you of your sin but instead burn a candle do this do something nice do do something and say all this we got to be careful we should continue to do those things we should continue to do them more if we can but let's never fall to the deception that we can do all of it and sometimes do it out of guilt sometimes speak in tongues to appear more spiritual to people sometimes the gift of God working through us I'm up here and this gift is working through me as a pastor to teach to you but the the gift that's working to feed you today I still got to serve the Lord I still have trouble sometimes at home I still have to stay close to God myself the gift is not the idea to full identity of who I am can you say amen and I can live on my gift and say I'm okay because my gift went well today or I I got a lot of praise and compliments and so I'm I must be a good Christian because I got a lot of accomplished no that's the gift working I can't buy into that deception of the Praises of people when I step out of this Pulpit I have life to deal with and I got to deal with it as an overcomer in Jesus Christ just like you do and the church World lifts up gifts of singing and Gifts of preachers and all these other things and they left the gifts and then all of a sudden you see something somebody fail behind the scenes and they're not living the life because why everybody interpreted their Christianity by their gift that's not mature love that's not the way that more excellent way and all those gifts working even denominations and even sometimes in the message all of it looks wow this is God and it is God because they can anoint he could anoint someone with a gift he can use somebody speaking from my heart today so Paul draws the distinction in these things so chapter 13 listen now is a special window into this more excellent way for the bride it's a view into Believers coming into the highest form of love itself it is the place of Revelation that the I'm giving it some different um perspectives so that you'll catch it first Corinthians 13 is a place of Revelation that the bride will come into it's a prophecy it points to our day actually as the full fulfillment because he says that when there will become a day when we see face to face now often we think of making it to the other side and seeing Jesus of Nazareth his face I longed to see him that way but the face and the scripture says countenance of his Radiance of his glory and we can see that now as we look into his word we catch the very face and Radiance of Christ and the Bible says we're changed in the same Glory by looking in his face so a face-to-face relationship with Christ you're going to be changed from glory to glory how many believe that we can see Christ face to face through the word of God today we can see him face to face not his physical characteristics but we can see who he is and he prophesies and said we see through a glass Darkly Corinthians but then face to face and when we have this face-to-face relationship not Facebook not two-faced book not texting but a face to face with Christ and when we have that that's when we can come into in the end time to this more excellent way it is prophecy when we come into that we will come into an excellent way above anything that the church has ever seen before and that's why I say the bride's call is to come on into this more excellent way I'll read some more quotes and things to you later to show you this is the hour we're in this is the ultimate this is where we're moving into and I pray all the time as a minister I pray all the time that somehow we can be a minister to be led to set the people under the right expectations of what we're looking at here before the Rapture what what are we coming into and I can preach anything I can I can preach that we're coming into more tongues and interpretation and if I preach that for six months we would see more of that manifested and there's not a thing wrong with it except I'm uh trying to be submissive to Lord what is your achievement what is your final achievement for the Bride of Jesus Christ what does it say that we'll end this with and and and there's enough quotes enough scripture to show and this is one of them then we shall see face to face and we we won't know in part but that which is perfect will come and when that which is perfect has come then there'll be a tremendous entrance of the Bride into perfect love let me just stop and say this there's a hunger in me to come into a deeper place I've been praying about it for years I've had this hunger for years and the thing about the hungering for more of God it's amazing that the bride hungers for more of God how many of this morning you say I Hunger for More Of God it's amazing we Hunger for More because we're the people at the end time that's been blessed with the restoration of the word the seven sealed book of being open Elijah sent back to us all the Mysteries revealed we're sitting here with the full I told the ministers in the office this morning I said there's so much Revelation coming across the pulpit every service that we're so blessed sometimes we take it for granted of what's being said we are so blessed to hear even uh five minutes of what ministers are saying last Sunday with brother Diggs it's a wealth of Revelation it's a wealth of the love of God being poured out upon us but we have all of these things I have enjoyed this word The Fellowship of the word miracle signs and wonders all these things for some uh some uh 40-something years serving the lord I've enjoyed it all and yet today 2022 whatever date it is today I am hungry for more I'm hungering for something and you know brother Madam taught us if there's a deep calling there's a there's a deep to respond he says if you're hungry for more of God that shows there is more of God that we're not done we're not finished can you say Amen we're not in a Rapture yet but there must be more of God and more for us to come into maybe it's this more excellent way that Paul is preaching that we've come into a deeper life with him in Divine love because see I can preach I can preach whatever expectations and I can hunger we're hungering after this we're hungering after that well I'm hungry I'm Minister said it a few weeks ago we're hungry and I like how he said it for a supernatural God hummus hungry for a supernatural God not just the acts or demonstrations of a supernatural God but I'm hungry for a supernatural God and if he does that through healing is sick or if he does it through something internally overcoming in me that nobody sees and nobody testifies about it's still the supernatural God and I'm hungry for that but there is a hunger in me for this life to be manifested more in me of this excellent way of divine love I don't know if it's for you but I'm of all of the Hunger of all the expectations I have of God I am hungry and I'm one side of him is frustrated that I'm not there yet I say Lord after all this after all you've showed me after all that you have done in my life I'm frustrated that I'm still not every day walking or I want to walk functioning by Divine love won't be being transparent this week was a a great one of those great report cards on where I'm at you know you get report cards sometimes from your children and you don't realize it and from maybe a spouse or something like that and you fail and you and you act in a way and you know as a Christian you just you walk away from it and if you're a Christian within seconds you know that you've acted out of place you know that's not the more excellent way that Paul's talking about in fact it wasn't even excellent it wasn't even good it was just way down here somewhere I said Lord what am I doing I'm praying for this this is my inheritance this is what I want to move into and it's in situations that come that are precious situations that's when I want to manifest it and I fail and then you get a report card because whether you want to admit it or not you'll get report cards from you you like a report card how your boss thinks you're doing everybody's still listening to has anybody shut me off don't hang up you know I've got if you hang up I got your number I'm going to dial you back up listen and it's the family we don't want to listen to because the family can be most critical sometimes and you think it's critical but if you look at it right it's your report card say Lord if I get their report card all the time I'll never amount to anything it feels like that sometimes but is it a true report card and if is there truth to it you know and this week I've got you know bees and C's and then I got an F then I got another ref it wasn't out living in sin and all that I'm talking about Behavior come on people wasn't in a bar somewhere b c f f maybe another C and you get a report card and you can run from it all you want to but if that's sometimes your family and they love you enough to tell you yeah then if you're mature you say okay I'm going to take what they said here I'm going to go pray about it because and then you realize they're speaking the truth on some things there's no sense in hiding from let's just running from it and then that prayer and that urge comes up in me Lord why you've given me the inheritance of functioning intense situations and manifesting your Prophet preach when when Divine love projects and there's a reason to use the word projects because it's not just having it it's projecting it you see it's not just having well I got the love of God and I love people well way too something comes up a tense situation a disagreement intense moments of Fellowship I call it and wait how much of that Divine love you say have is projected in that situation and he says when Divine love projects IT projects it's like a projector the old slide projector we're projecting things up here they've got that in the computer and it's hidden but now they project it out to you those songs out to you when Divine love projects where everybody can see it he says when you do that Sovereign Grace kicks in yeah and that's what I want that's I don't know if anybody else wants it but I'm standing here saying Lord and I have nothing to hide I want it and I'm hungering it for it so bad and I'm not gonna give up until I have all of it manifested I'm here for the duration because this is the victory for the bride this is the calling of the Bride this excellent way the Corinthians heard it but we're not just supposed to hear it even in this sermon this morning we're supposed to take a hold of it and see it in our lives can you say amen I hunger for it and it's amazing that we still have a hunger for God with all that we have it's amazing we've seen all these things that I mentioned to you but you see and we see the loose ends tied together we see it we have the faith the Pentecost restored to us can you say Amen we see years of the repeat of the original church Faith Among Us you say well we're supposed to be restored to the original faith and I know some ministers were going to be restored we're going to be restored to the original faith of Pentecost I don't understand that because we've seen the characteristics ever since I was a child I've seen the original characteristics because Elijah came and his ministry was to take us back to the original word and not just the result to restore us back to the original faith and Pentecost and when we've seen the The Works of God through him we've seen the Son of God exercise the faith to do what Jesus did again we're not waiting for that to happen it's been happening we're under the original Faith Can you say Amen we're already there now if you individually don't see it in your life then you'd say Lord give me more of a hunger for it let me see it in my life but I guarantee you if you cry out for this Divine love to be manifested in that realm of divine love he'll do miracles in your life he'll do different signs in your life but we're not seeking the signs first we're seeking a place in Christ first that we're one with him and when we're one with him you don't have to worry about the Miracles you don't have to work them up and have a pep rally if the people individually get in touch with God and Oneness with God you won't have a problem seeing the supernatural God am I okay this morning that's the approach that's the approach we're waiting for the original Faith No it's still coming what the Dynamics it depends on what your interpreting is the Dynamics because you know I was telling the brothers this morning is that I remember as a kid and I'm being very honest with you I don't know if I'll let this out on public but I remember as a kid being in conventions and camp meetings and the word being so glorious especially when I received the Holy Ghost at 16 the word just exploded to me and now I have the amen are on the inside and it's 16. I'd hear sermons by brother bisco sister Nicole's pastor and brother Harold Hildebrandt and all these brothers at conventions in 16 I was exploding I was saying wow this is amazing I feel so close to God and then we get to some services at the end and someone would give a tongue and an interpretation I thought I just watched this a young boy and I just thought and we'd all become reverent but I watched the change in the people when someone gave a ton of interpretation just a solemnness and just this whole relevance and receptiveness arose in the congregation now God is speaking and I've never said this publicly before but I thought in my heart as a boy I thought but wasn't God speaking in the Pulpit just now and why wasn't the same sobereness and reverence there as when the tongue was coming forth I reverence the tongue and many times it was of God it was God speaking but the Reverend said now and it's just the old Pentecostal Traditions that he hasn't spoken really until we have a tongue of interpretation that's a Pentecostal tradition the highest level that God can speak to us is through the foolishness of preaching God himself can be depositing Revelation through the preaching of the word faith through the preaching of the word so please don't think I'm disrespecting I'm just saying that's what I observed why is it that is it that way why do we live certain things and and then even in our lives when this happened we got certain events that we know God dealt with us and we're living off those things but then we're disappointed when it doesn't happen that way listen God can be speaking through the smallest things and you don't realize it God can be expressing his Supernatural but if we're looking for big things we'll miss it and he brought forth The Headstone the Capstone with crime crimes Grace Grace unto it the Capstone The Headstone comes at the end time which is Capstone Divine love that's the Capstone and he brought forth The Headstone with crimes Grace Grace unto it and the next scripture says who hath despise the day of small things the headstones come in the capsules are what a great move of God praise be to God and then he says but don't belittle the day of small things because it the third poem won't be a public show it's not going to be a national Revival it's not going to be a Revival movement in the message everybody's got to become a part of no it's going to be an individual Revival and God will Express himself in the third bowl without a public show sometimes a supernatural God in your everyday life Indian that's what I'm hungry for can you say Amen so it is this excellent way it is this excellent way that we're hungry for and if you know the message you see that the prophet even all the way up to 65 he was still hungering for something himself and a lot of it was wasn't a national Revival he would say things like we've had healing campaigns and we've had proactive meetings and we have these things and he says where has it gotten to us there was a certain disappointment with all the exuberant meetings that were happening there was a certain disappointment and and yet where where does it come to what's the end result of it if it's a new birth whether we thank God but if it's just just simply emotional thing he was saying that where are we going I think brother Brennan was hungry for adoption he was hungry for mature love he was hungry what is it that I'm hungry for there's something more and even him with all that he had seen in all the meetings even up till 65 he's still hungering for something I love this quote here in humble myself in 1963 just after the seals he said it's my time for consecration to God if you guys have that quote it's my time for consecration to God God's time to speak to me I must just have a little change in my own life I preached a little sermon called the little change and we hear so many sermons on the big change which is the rapture the big change of our bodies but Brothers in 1963 I must have a little change in my own life now this is after the seals this is after all the healing campaigns for about 30 years this is the dead race this is blind eyes this is all kinds of healing campaigns and still the prophet is saying saying I must see a little change in my own life he's not preaching about the big change of rapture he's preaching about a little change in his own life you better stay amen and get excited I preach this little change thing to ten thousand Africans and they come unglued to see that we're just not looking for the big change I mean he's looking for the big change but I'm preaching about a little change in our own lives it's just a little change but it's it's important and if brother Branham is saying that after all of the seals and all the meetings he made he's saying I'm feel I it's a time for consecration to God God's time to speak to me I must have a little change in my life not not as I think that I'm wicked but I want to feel this is the change I want to feel a little more closer to people see the people that I've tried to tell the gospel truth to and they turn their back on it and walk away and laugh at it now to me that seems like an insult to me I don't care to me but but to the things that I've been saying it's the truth trying to help them like shoving out a boat and say here here it is cross over here get out of that swollen stream you're going to die you're going to Paris there and they just laugh at you and walk away well to me it feels like if they walk away there's nothing more I can do about it see that is that convicting to us that's the level of Love he's at and he's hungry for more because really we're just like anybody else if we say well if they rejected it that's all I'm going to help them said I need a little change in my life we're not called to act like the millions of Christians around this world nominal Christians we're not called to be just a standard message believer we're called to a more excellent way and he says I walk away and nothing more to do about see that I can that I can do but I want to run down to the bank now and persuade them come on back see I've got to have that feeling see because I know there's somebody out there that hasn't come in yet and I'm going to fish he said until the last fish is caught I want to do that now and now in order to do this I'm expecting something to happen just stay right there I'm expecting someone to catch this thing when he says to on the bank come on back last Sunday when I preached the spirit and the bride say come is your life saying come the spirit and the bride is saying come because we have a fountain open in the House of David I'm expecting something to happen in a prayer meeting something and many of you remember the vision of the last poll that third poll rather you remember there was something happened just before that I seen that light come and go into that place and said I'll meet you in there and I'm looking for something to happen so he's still looking for something to happen in other words the prophet didn't he wasn't shown all how all this is going to interpret and play out but he's hungry he's tying this little room the tent vision and the third pole to Something in him that I need a little change in my own life don't underestimate the big things that God still needs to do in the bride to the little tying it to the little changes that's needed in your life can you say Amen you're still not shouting like those Africans ten thousand of them but they got excited about that they said brother Paul really go the ministers there's about 400 minutes they said You Preach like an African I said well that's a compliment I know you're getting it this morning don't be praying all the time for the big change and trust me I'm praying for the Rapture all the time I want to get out of here how many just me and sister Carrie how many want to get out of here I want to get out of here I'm tired of this world but we're still here for a reason can you say amen and before that big change comes Lord if there's a little change that's needed in Me God help me I'm hungering for it I want it can you say Amen blessed be the name of the Lord it just shows he was hungry or something he goes on another quote he said this is this one's way back now this is in 1959 he said well then brother bear I'd like to ask you a question all the people that's claim to have the Holy Spirit and so forth won't they come in the resurrection I said if they have the Holy Spirit but when we be but what we've been putting too much emphasis on is the other thing instead of the real thing the love of God Paul said all these things could happen I could have all wisdom all knowledge and have yet not have love it profited me nothing I could speak with tongues like men and angels and still not have it and we put so much emphasis on these things upon great healing revivals and miracles being worked did not Jesus say many will come to me in that day and say Lord Lord have we not cast out devils in your name in your name haven't we done many many mighty works I will say unto them depart from me you workers of iniquity I did not even know you what a disappointment that will be but look what a surprise it'll be when he said those that didn't even think they deserve to be there when they were hungry and we fed you when were you naked and we gave you those we didn't know when you did this he said instantly see that third pole see that no public show they didn't know they were doing it when did we feed you Lord when were you hungry when would we clothe you they didn't even know they did it and so much you've done in the least of these you've done it unto me and how the world needs something today we let other things come and take the place of a real thing love we're leaving out living he loved me he died for me it was a sinner when I was unlovable he loved me anyhow my prayers for the church that we can have such love till we'll love people whether they love us not that's what the church needs today is to express a love even to a man that could spit in your face and you could still with not with a hypocritical standpoint but from your heart pray for that man's Soul that's the kind of Revival we need here in Los Angeles with the kind that kind of love manifested he calls that a Revival boy we have different interpretations of Revival but brother REM called that a Revival for Los Angeles and it's probably never going to happen to Los Angeles but Lord let it happen in me let it happen in this Los Angeles because sometimes I feel like a Los Angeles let that Revival the bride's Revival the catch the love the excellent way can you say Amen Let It Be In Me can you say Amen let revive Ascender Revival and start the work in me praise the Lord so Paul preaches this more excellent way to the Corinthians and when he preaches it then I can see what I'm hungry for it's this way that he spoke it's this more excellent way this more excellent way that he's preaching back then 2000 years ago I've seen what God can do and I will never stop believing for the supernatural God whatever Paul was pointing to which I don't know how many Corinthians came into it or stayed immature with their gifts I don't know that but whatever Paul was preaching I know the more excellent way that he prophesied is to the bride is to come more and more into it can you say amen and so now we started to hear the prophet refer to the word Capstone I want to get to this he started to refer to the word Capstone and he began to describe for the children so they understand a pyramid if you ever seen I wish I had a picture of one but a pyramid the the Egyptian pyramids were built and they started with a real big foundation to them and then as the pyramid was built up then it hones in and it gets closer and closes but all those stones had to perfectly fit with one another and go up interestingly enough the Egyptian pyramids never ever had a cat put on them uh I don't know if they made them and didn't put them on but there was some Revelation there that there wasn't put on because it wasn't till the end time spiritually that a Capstone was to be put on the church and then brother Brown says he was the Cornerstone and they rejected the Cornerstone so Christ the Cornerstone was rejected by the Jews so now you have that happening too that they didn't put a Capstone on those pyramids but you see that we find that that spiritually speaks of what the bride is calling is what the bride will move into uh it's a Capstone love and then he taught us the Seven Virtues of each age Faith virtue and he brought it in the pyramid Faith virtue knowledge temperance patience brotherly kindness and each age have those things growing into the final age 2000 years of virtuals being virtues being birthed into each age and at the end of the age it's just the time that we live in God caps it off with a Divine love the Capstone is love not faith not just Faith because that was the foundation not just Faith but perfect love and he brother I'm preached the message perfect faith perfect Faith where we're supposed to commit yeah we come into a perfect Faith but did you know the scripture says faith which worketh by love he quoted that scripture Faith which worketh by love so the kind of faith that we come into is not just a faith to remove mountains not just the faith for miracles but of Faith that's motivated by Divine love a perfect faith how many wants it this morning Faith to remove mountains not just that but Faith which works by love a Capstone caps the pyramid It's the final move of the Bride she is she is becoming one with him he caps us and takes us to a Rapture I want you to notice it's a simple illustration but as it keeps getting closer and the prophet refers to this that it's less and less there's only elect few as it gets smaller and smaller numbers as we move up the pyramid it's smaller and smaller and smaller numbers that are catching the Revival for their age it's less people catching it because the beginning ages you know 3 000 Souls were added to the church the first day many numbers but not at the end time you say well there's a lot of Christians on the other I'm not de-christianizing anybody I'm saying and they've got all the signs Miracles and wonders I'm saying who's coming into this more Alexa excellent way and who is this Capstone coming down on an elected few just an elected few and brother Brown says it's the the stones fit so sharply perfectly together everything's got to be right I'll read it everything's got to be fit just right and you're not going to fit unless you allow the Lord fit you right are you willing to say Lord fit me perfectly for the Capstone to settle on my life get out of my life what I don't need there so the Capstone can perfectly fit on me amen whatever it is fit me it's kind of like uh we don't you know cut the word to fit us we get caught to fit the word can you say Amen we don't cut up the word just like my first Corinthians falling out Satan would love would have loved for me to lose this last night and I don't have my text to read but I found it I put it back in Satan I'm putting back First Corinthians 13 the excellent way I'm putting it back and preaching it to the bride he hates that scripture in fact I'm just going to tell you there are more messages that are preached even on our ranks on the first three verses of First Corinthians 13. then there is the rest of the verses if it's the more excellent way the Paul is preaching why is that there should be more sermons on the first three verses of exercising Faith to remove mountains listen friends I want to hear it all I need it all I need my faith built up I I I need all those things but we hear so little of that matter of fact if I were to break down and take a few Wednesday nights and just break down every one of those characteristics and tell you what it really means that true love doesn't Envy It's Kind it's uh it doesn't seek its own it's not easily provoked irritated if I were to break it down like Paul's bringing this excellent way I don't know if some people would even regard it as a sermon and yet it's the more excellent way if you can't say Amen or agree just say I'll think about it brother Paul I'll take that this morning I'll think about what you're saying I want to be preaching and living I want all of it but I don't want to overlook and be emphasizing something too much that I shouldn't so God's Building a pyramid how many wants to be a part of that he says notice in the Lutheran age what did we live justification way down here at the bottom planting the foundation Stones Luther West that we believed in sanctification to come to the minority Pentecost still the baptism the Holy Ghost up in the minority but watch the church that goes right out to the end of it right out to the end of that that church is going to have to be so perfectly like the ministry of Jesus Christ to when the Stone comes it sets right smack in the groove oh hallelujah oh if you can catch it and know what I'm talking about the very Ministry that Jesus Christ was doing here on Earth when it comes back the very same Ministry he had Pentecost will not will not have to widen itself out into an organization but shape itself up in Christ until the headstone and the church will fit one to the other and them so submitted to you can't even take a razor blade and go around and find the crack where they were put together and that's how the church has got to come so much like Christ and look what we got to do then cut away and circumcise eyes and chop off and form and mold it into the image of Jesus Christ until that church and the cap comes right smacked together look at the church today and it's conditioned later on in the quote he says look at the church today it's condition weak backslitting gone back to the world that speaks of Christ exactly what he said I stand at the door knock and the later see an age he put out he put them outside they organized him out and and no they put him outside organized him out and set him outside our Creeds and so forth took him out but he still stood at the door and knocking and said everyone that I love I chasten and rebuke that's right trying to cut them down and bring them to a spot to where the great Capstone comes the ministry that's in the church and the Capstone will just come right straight together like a magnet they will just seal right together oh God help us to have I I'll be it'll be there don't worry that's what I like about this God's word said it's going to happen it'll be there that Capstone can you say man is coming down it'll be there don't worry it'll be there he said it would be there so let us fit ourselves to meet that Cornerstone it probably means headstone there or Capstone let us fit ourselves to meet the Cornerstone let us love and project our lives in Christ and be sincere and stay with the word until when he comes we just fit right in like the glove over the hand like that with him oh that's the church that God is waiting for praise the Lord I've been thinking how Paul basically took emotions and knowledge and faith and sacrifice and said it means nothing without the Holy Ghost love he's talking to babies in Christ Corinthians immature he's probably choking the babies with what he said then he describes what divine love should look like in US probably blew their mind talking about that if you look close he basically covered almost every aspect of men in the church not the world men and what was going on in the church that lean on these demonstrations too much and ignore growing into the actions and character of divine love tongues the Corinthian Church was leaning too much on the demonstrations right and not growing into the actions and character of divine love tongues prophecy understanding Mysteries great surges of Faith to remount room mountains I just want to make a comment is that sometimes the church the churches will swing this way for a few years then God will bring him back they'll swing this way churches will swing sometimes a certain way but the Holy Spirit just brings them back into balance let me believe that if they're of the Holy Ghost they're going to bring back a balance but notice how it swings it swings into the two places that Paul's preaching in the first three verses of First Corinthians 13. it will swing sometimes to emotionalism it'll swing sometimes to emphasizing certain things but then it'll swing to though I understand all Mysteries and have all knowledge churches will swing towards intellectualism as long as you understand the Seven Seals you're going to make it as long as you hear our teacher from our church you'll make it in a rapture you're just swinging that way and for the first three verses covers all of it can you say Amen by saying no don't swing that way don't lean on those things don't emphasize just those things don't versize just the faith to remove mountains don't emphasize just that great surges of Faith to remove mountains giving to the poor even sacrificing your body to be burned wow just think about in our minds that is the demonstrations of love of God but you remember brother Brown said I didn't bring the quote with me but you remember he says now what is the evidence he said I didn't get to talk about the evidence of the Holy Ghost he says watch the Holy Ghost not so much in demonstration but watch it in action what it does according to the word and when he says that we can lead towards demonstrations and want to see the demonstrations instead of looking at the actions what it does according to the word the actions of the character of Christ and the demonstrations oh we just want the demonstrations we want all of it but we don't want to leave out the actions and that's the evidence of the Holy Ghost don't watch it not so much in demonstration but watch it in the action of the word Paul doesn't remodel a room of all of this and say we're not going to do all this he just says that it's no guarantee that Divine love is there because we are doing this you can have all this and be missing the core of him real love divine love I think it's high time that we were walking in these last days and not leaning on past partial demonstrations that were okay that were good it's amazing that the things Paul says is really all of the extremes of the entire church World each of them will lean this way emphasize certain things when they have moved to when they've moved away from Holy Ghost character and divine love then they swing certain ways emphasis on tongues and prophecies emphasis on the Mysteries real intellectual atmosphere emphasis on demonstrations of Faith emphasis on charitable giving Outreach what's our church doing to spread the gospel emphasis on sacrifices dying out from the monks in the Catholic church to some of even our Church's teaching that we are slave and believe it or not this has gone around we're teaching that we're becoming slaves bearing the load of this dress code so one woman said to me when I did this I've been taught this hair is my heaviness that I wear for the Lord it's a load on me we're going to call 30 day fast to kill ourselves for the Lord legalistic leaning towards legalistic we have emphasized clothing more than the real thing and Paul's saying all that is in the word but I'm showing you a more excellent way it's funny how these things still get emphasized the calling for the bride is for this true Capstone Ministry of divine love can you say Amen true Ministry I just want to throw this out to you since you're still sitting here I wonder if many Christians hide behind some of these manifestations of the first three verses of First Corinthians because they don't want to seek Paul's more excellent way and they don't want to admit that they're lacking forgiveness for someone they know that they're lacking love the way Paul is describing it here for some people and they know that they are still should I go back and just read them seeking their own they're still easily provoked They Don't Really Bear all things they don't endure all things they become proud and so they hide behind the first three verses I just wonder if they hide because they don't want to see Paul's more excellent way they don't want to admit they're lacking in forgiveness and the love the way he's calling for it in our lives it's kind of like having a beautiful house and it's cleaned up and as far as visibly to visitors The Maids come in and cleaned up all the outside stuff but there's a lot of clutter that you're ignoring behind the scenes and you're feeling the you know it's kind of like my my barn I might as well bring that up John you're here this boy John's a worker with me the kid's been listening to me all summer in my truck I've got to deal with that Barn I've got to declutter that burn he's a witness right I got to get to that Barn and you're ignoring it you feel the call but you're ignoring it and you feel like that as long as the maid and everybody keeps the visible part white you can always have somebody over if that part's taken care of right yeah it looks beautiful it's it's it's it's it's workable for somebody to step in the front door but I'm not taking them to the barn not going to the barn and you feel this calling and guess what you all be proud of me I was so proud of myself because finally this week finally I tackled the barn and all the stuff in it that didn't belong it's been going all summer we hide behind things that make us look very spiritual to others but in the barn there's things that are easily provoked there's no forgiveness for someone no forgiveness for a mate but you're doing okay because you're hiding behind something spiritual that took place to you you're hiding behind an exuberant thing that happened and you're testifying and you're talking about that and talking about it but you see now don't hide behind those things when God is trying to show you a more excellent way is that okay this morning just thought I'd drop that in we hide behind things that make us look so spiritual to everyone else but in the barn is a different story and there's no forgiveness for some people there's a limit to everything listen we have to be careful of that now just if you give me a few more minutes I know it's five to one and I should have told you that so you do you wouldn't even know but just my last thrust here before vacation the mountains are calling and I must go brother Brandon begins referring 11 times he refers to from 1961 a prophecy that went forth I believe was in Phoenix about his ministry and this was the prophecy he reads at 11 times all the way up to 65 he says because prophecy said about about brother Brown's Ministry because thou has chosen the Narrow Path this is in the quote the harder way the house walked in your own choosing now I can see that Moses had to make his choice to see thou has picked the precise and correct way correct decision and God says it is my way he said he underlined my way God's saying you've chosen my way the holy spirit's speaking back because of this and then he says because of this momentous decision a huge portion of Heaven awaits you awaits thee what a glorious decision this is God saying this to him you've made sacrifices you've chosen way but you haven't chosen your way you have chosen my way there is a more excellent way can you say amen and I believe he chose God's way what a glorious decision that was made this in itself is that which will make and come to pass the tremendous victory in Divine love it's a prophecy was the rest of it true then the end of it is true the decisions have already been made even by God's Prophet that will bring his bride into a victory in Divine love because remember character is not a gift character is a victory but we will come to this victory so then he comments after perhaps this is the great time coming that we should be looking for and surely this is itself a tremendous thing that will bring to pass and come to pass the tremendous victory in Divine love love divine and that's the verb before the adverb then it's divine love which is God you see and then it takes the love of God to dash out there on the front line and stand in the gap for the people and these rickies and briquettas that have so sassed the words and I've called them Ricky and raquetta God give me to understand I shouldn't do that because there's many of them that are still his children can I get an amen this morning see they can't help because they act so much different some of these old cold formal churches has got them that Spirit upon them and they're in the in a prison as Israel was in prison just as much as Moses went down to deliver them from slavery human beings that loved Jesus Christ would serve him if they only knew what to serve him by and they're in bondage under denominationalism that tells them don't do this and don't do that but the call of God must come whoever wants to come March towards the promised land let him March the spirit and the bride are the only ones that are saying come come and March with the word come if you're hungry I shouldn't call them rickies or ricketta because some of that is God's children can I get an amen this morning how do we know who's God's children not God's children I noticed some people listening and and uh you know inviting people to church please continue to do that some people have advised keep you say well it's a half hour it's an hour away just invite him invite them let your spirit of your heart say come he that's thirsty come can you say Amen let the love of God manifest I have one more quote and I'm closing this morning I used to think Divine love I used to think of that and this love began to pour out an extra we got love but we need the abundance of love the overflowing love you say oh I love Sinners but oh brother sister do you love them well enough to go out and talk to them and woo them to Christ hmm all of us message sometimes I call us message brats spoiled I just say it to me we get so secluded and we got what we got and we know everything you say I love Sinners yes I love Sinners I love them I love them right from here it used to be I shouldn't tell this I won't tell the person's name but you used to be this sister in a church and she's rather big and she was always coming up and giving a big bear hug to all the young guys the teenage guys this probably should have been doing it but she'd come up just give them a big hug and one of my friends said to her one time she was headed towards him you know brother so and so let me just give you a big cup he said can we can can I just love you from over here I love that I love you sister but I just love your from a distance oh I love Sinners but oh brother sister do you love them well enough to go out and talk to them and move them to Christ you see what I mean you say I love the Lord but can you trust him when the doctor shakes his head can you trust him when everything else is gone you need an overflowing baptism of divine love how many of this morning say Lord I'm I'm getting coming to the close of the service but I don't want to miss telling you give me a baptism of divine love this morning give me a re-baptism of it Lord please give it to me I know it's for me it's my inheritance we need an overflowing baptism of divine love when it seems like when you pray and your prayer is not answered do you still love him is there something that keeps purging you on that's God's Sovereign Grace has to take over it's got to and he's in the sermon he's in the sermon when Divine love projects then Grace Sovereign Grace will kick in and take over amen God bless you this morning I have something to read to you that expresses my heart um this is a letter from I won't mention his name it's from the Adrian Correctional Facility just a few days ago I'm going to share this to congregation it's got this on 1016. God bless hello Pastor Fontaine you do not know me at least not in the conventional sense nor do I know you however I feel God spoke to me through you I've only seen your commercial on television and within that short segment 30-second commercial I I got a sense of your pure heart and genuine spirit and that resonated with me strongly praise be to God but see we don't talk to people sometimes we don't say things but we have to realize friends no matter what you feel about yourself God's deposited something within us and the smallest little words we're talking a 30-second commercial with just lines of what I preached but there was something in the lines and this is what I've been praying for that God has attention your resonated it connected with them could this be a seed of God we haven't even got to the broadcast yet just the commercial God can be so powerful he can reach out to get his seed we should never estimate my mom wrote a song years ago it's wonderful song it's called unspoken words unspoken words how my life is so filled with them unspoken words how I wish I would have said them oh dear Jesus help me throw aside my pride and help those around me Lord for them you died unspoken words my life so filled with regrets I didn't say something but there's power in the words of the bride with what he's deposited within us you know some of the depression instead of the family issues and the squabbles and the selfishness probably would be washed away everybody listen nobody's excluded in this some of your hardships and trials and focus on all these other things would be washed away if you would focus on those around that you need to speak an encouragement to and tell about what God's done for your life in Christ foreign a religious person Pastor Fontaine but I'm definitely spiritual you may question as to my reasons for writing you and the truth of the matter is I don't know particularly I just feel moved in my spirit after some recent tragic events unfold my life in the lives of my loved ones I ask God to please help me change my life I've used drugs I've sold drugs I've robbed stole and hurt people I've made a lot of decision done things that I'm not proud of I don't and will not live that way anymore two years ago I got down on my knees and prayed I didn't know what to pray for or how what I did know was that that I didn't want to continue living the way that I had been so I asked God God if you're real please help me and I ask Jesus to come into my heart I live a life differently today I take responsibly for my deeds and behavior I don't use drugs God hiss things God has transformed my mind I've been in prison now for 18 years and I will be getting released next year I don't know the purpose God has for me and until it's revealed to me I will continue with take talking writing testifying to what God has done in my life I want to contribute I want to give back I want to do my part it is my hope and prayer that my life my experiences my behavior and my addiction and talking about those things may potentially help someone change their mind and ideas about living that type of Lifestyle that could possibly leave them to something worse or death I'm still new at all this walk and I'm still figuring some things out I'm not yet who God has intended for me to be but by God's grace I'm definitely not who I used to be well he don't know that quota brother Bradham but same inspiration that brother Ryan said this guy sees it thank you Pastor for allowing me to be sharing my story with you and whoever you choose or see fit to share it
