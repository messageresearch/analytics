========================================

to go and call some call someone's uh to him that's that's what we do it for revelation two verse one unto the angel of the church of ephesus right these things seth he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks and we'll just ask the lord to bless his word this evening let's pray heavenly father we just thank you very much for your goodness and grace to us lord thank you that we can gather together in your name o lord father i just pray that you bless the service this evening lord i pray that you would lord minister your word in in clarity lord may it be the dissolver of doubt the answer of questions oh god that we might be able to stand on solid and firm ground and be able to recognize how firm the ground is on which we stand the lord in jesus christ and we pray amen you may be seated see if we can get started here super well um we started out with the opening verse revelation 2 1 we're speaking unto the angel of the church of ephesus and you would think as you read this that it would be so clear whoever the whoever this angel is that they whoever is listening to this angel speak look at this angel preach it'll just be very very apparent this is the voice that we need to be listening to right now this is god's man that who's speaking to us it should be perfectly clear and i'm sure paul wishes it had been that clear to the people he was preaching to because what we're going to take a look at this evening there was a struggle in paul's time just like there's a struggle in our time it seems like you would if you look at the scriptures unto the angel of the church of ephesus right you should have been very very clear to ephesus who their angel who was who their messenger was but whenever god's doing um a work leading his people forward he's using somebody to blaze a new trail and whenever you're blazing a trail so it's even dads if you're going on vacation and you're saying hey folks we're going to take the scenic route i know which way i'm going anybody get doubted sometimes by that yeah definitely so if we're a trailblazer in some way or another even more so spiritually speaking there's going to be a question are you really sure where we're going dad are you really sure where we're going angel or messenger that's that kind of goes with the territory of being a leader so the angel of the church of ephesus was the apostle paul and brother branham identifies paul as a new testament prophet and that is where brother branham and message of believers today we get a lot of blow back from folks saying that paul wasn't a prophet that's the that's the argument back but nowhere in the bible does paul claim that he was a prophet he was an apostle but not a prophet your brother branham states very clearly different places he was a prophet messenger to the first stage until god starts the work of how he's going to finish the work in the seventh age so the identification of paul is a new testament prophet that's highly disputed by christians and denominations and my folks have left the message and the purpose my purpose this evening is by god's grace to to kind of show the difficulties that paul encountered in getting people to recognize the position god gave to him it wasn't easy we kind of assumed that it was because everybody today anybody who claims to themselves to be a christian say yes paul was the apostle of the gentiles he wrote books of the bible god was speaking to him it's that that's an easy call for us now but when god's fulfilling his word before your eyes that's a different that's a harder call to make and it takes a step of faith it takes revelation so i want to show um that i believe that paul actually does make a case for himself uh being um having a having prophetic authority we'll take a look at some illusions that paul makes especially in the book of galatians this kind of want to tie together the struggles the challenges that christians had in paul's day and accepting this author this this this prophetic messenger authority they're similar to the challenges that we have today and that just kind of goes with the territory of living in the time when god's fulfilling his word right just it just goes with the terror this is the time that we live in this is the challenge we have to deal with and we'll do that but that doesn't just because there's a challenge out there doesn't mean that paul didn't have that authority or brother branham didn't have that authority paul was pretty clear though here in galatians 1 8 he says but though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you let him be accursed it takes some guts to write that you've got to be really sure of your case he's saying if i come back and say something different what i've already said i should be cursed with i said to you the first time that was the gospel that was that was what god is doing if anybody comes with any other gospel than that they are wrong they're accursed he's got authority and he's not he's not afraid to to state it which means that the other authority holders of his day are going to look at this new kid on the block saying who are you who are you to claim this so when you make it when god is using you in such a way and you're making this authority claim which he was called to make it's going to be inviting challenges from other folks who already have authority they don't want that that threat here's one of the quotes that where brother branham identifies paul as a prophet he says the messenger angel to the church of ephesus was the apostle paul that he was the messenger to the first stage of the gentile era cannot be denied i will look at scriptures later he says i am the apostle to the gentiles though to peter was granted the authority to open the doors to the gentiles it was given to paul to be their apostle and prophet he was the prophet messenger to the gentiles his prophetic office by which he received the full revelation of the word for the gentiles authenticated him as their apostolic messenger brother brennan is making it pretty pretty clear here and later on in my notes i think the uh on the on on page six to message the unveiling of god brother branham talks about how you've got matthew mark luke and john the gospel writers he says they they wrote the things that they witnessed as they were with with jesus but it was paul who had the revelation of what was being done and he goes and declares even more it's on it's on page six says paul wrote the new testament matthew mark luke and john they only wrote what they saw but paul had the revelation he pulled it out for he had met the pillar of fire and the middle of that top quote paragraph 298 of the unveiling of god the disciples just wrote what they saw him do but paul had the revelation he went down to egypt for three years and studied and saw that god that the god of the old testament was jesus of the new the revelation and you could look and see that the gospels have a lot of great truth but paul does take it a step further this is this is that he's declaring making clear what what what was actually being done there in the gospels this kind of reviewing from uh from last week we talked about brother branham looking at the basic keys as he talks in the beginning of the ephesian church agent the keystone of the bible they saw was that there is an unchanging god with unchanging ways and would at the first stage you'll have to do it the last also there won't be a change and part of that we can take a look at paul the the first church age messenger he's the standard by which to judge every other messenger and help help actually help identify who they were brother brandon says his manner of ministering set the pattern that all future messengers were to aspire to and actually such the pattern for every true minister of god though he wouldn't attain to such heights in the prophetic realm as did paul and then brother branham highlights several characteristics he says he was absolutely true to the word he was led solely by the holy ghost he didn't check in he wasn't sent with the imprimatur the approval of the jerusalem council they weren't the ones telling him where to go he didn't communicate with them he was a brother but they were not his ultimate authority he was directly under the holy spirit and he ministered in the power and the demonstration of the spirit he wasn't he was trained in philosophy of his day but his books are not are not books of philosophy his books are books of of of of revelation showing everything is being rooted in the old testament showing how all that happened there is just god is continuing to reveal more and more and more by the assuring it's the power of the spirit jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever it's not just words on the page when that eudecus falls in the book acts at a late night service that he falls out of the open window on under the floor it's a good thing we're all seated on the floor tonight we wouldn't have that but paul goes over there he raised him from the dead so jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever and he had the fruit of a god-given ministry and he says that brother braham says this is that we have an unchanging god with unchanging ways that's the first key to understanding how god works and he says the second is a key is a little bit less glorious so there are two vines running through the church and we kind of we went over that a little bit last time but um i was reading in the seals book this morning that in the second seal brother branham talks about how satan is a masterful impersonator whenever god starts to do something or something's getting ready to be fulfilled satan's has a sense of something getting ready to happen he runs out all kinds of different false impersonations of it ahead of time and at the same time and he uses the false vine to distract and confuse so that we can't see as easily what god's doing or there'll be a fear oh my we see the real thing happening if we've been burned so many times by the false that we're afraid to step out and actually believe the true and that's that's what satan has done and the second seal he says all these things he talked about how and the middle of page one on the last days as a prophet has predicted malachi chapter four but um he says i'm not here to cultivate a cult of elijah's man to religious robes we've had all plenty of those already and there were people before brother branham came who were doing those things so they had a sense of some of the great happened but that's the same way it was back when back in jesus's day gamaliel is having a counsel with with church leaders there in jerusalem and he says there was a sodus he he had this uh this this group following saying he was going to be the messiah and he had all 400 people go after him they all perished in the wilderness this was a similar thing but those false things did not make jesus ministry false there was they had nothing had no impact upon the verity or the or the accuracy or the truth of jesus christ ministry but brother bran says all those things the false are only for running the real thing that is to come to throw the people off he says now see satan raises those up watch the shrewdness of this fellow that we're talking about here satan where we're unfolding him right here just stripping him down by the scriptures and letting you see who he is that's one of the beautiful things of the message it's god going back and saying look how satan's working look how satan's working look how satan's working even now and brother graham says this truth that there are two vines throughout the church that's a that's a very special truth so that we can see what god's doing today um so then when the real true servant comes on with all the impersonation to it to upset the people's mind satan does that and those who can't discern right from wrong they just stumble over it but the elected won't do it but you know what if you've been burned by the false multiple times or if you've if you've if if you've put your hopes in this man or that man it can be really hard to put your confidence in another man some other time how god might be doing things because all those impersonations can lead to scars and and complexes for you okay let me turn this off all right i think we're back all the impersonations that we can see in in other ministries they can create scars they can create complexes that hinder us accepting what god might be doing for us later in in reality and they've been there done that you think you can get soured on things man there's so many things that have gone around i wish i could just be on an island somewhere and be by myself and i think brother brandon went through that too there's a quote i was a couple several probably six seven years ago i did some little study on on complexes and the quote about to read spoke to me immensely he's in he said he's in phoenix and he's preaching at brother outlaws church and if you're and brother outlaw his his church was the brother bran had been in i think in the early 50s or late 40s one of the first places out west where he'd been ministering and brother brahms just kind of reminiscing there how what a wonderful time we had those times top of page two here people would stand in the prayer lines be healed just praying laying hands on them and he says the ministry has come up higher certainly has the gifts have been multiplied but somehow or another i wish i was just back like i was at the first place you see why he wished he could just rewind because he had to go through so many things and everybody else who was following his ministry did too and all those trials built pain complexes calluses it wasn't easy but you say he says but more we just forget some of the things they ever learned i think it'd be a lot better off if we could forget some of the hard stuff we had to go through and the hard feelings have developed we'd be a lot better off but i think the road to god is the path of humility and service there's nothing better in the world to lift us up to christ than that and then he says you get to see carnal impersonations and so forth it just it dulls you and puts something in you and when i read this quote the first one it felt like it was a light shining right on me because yes it's exactly right it dulls you it it puts something in you i wish it didn't do it but it just makes you it kind of brings you up i think it gets you in the state of complex and i put in the word skepticism because you've seen this failed this failed this failed this failed something just kind of builds up and he says if god's going to do anything in my life i'm going to hold it at arm's distance for a good long time and that's what he was shining a light on there and he said i wish these brothers we should not be there but that is satan's goal so we can be disappointed so many times that whenever god's doing something we'll keep it at arm's length and never take a step of faith that yes that's for me so when brother branham says that the second basic key is is slightly less glorious it's still pretty glorious that there are two vines in the church and if we can he's he's stripping down and seeing where satan's working who satan is that's a glorious thing because we can recognize we can expect there's going to be some fanaticism there's going to be some crazy things that happen but that doesn't take away that god is doing something special and i should be looking for that when i see it i'm going to step out and take and and take faith take it with faith brother branson is in the revelation of jesus christ in the chapter one the church age book he says if people could get the true revelation of the true church and what she is what she stands for that she can do the greater work she will be an invincible army if they get a true revelation of the true spirit in the framework of the christian church and by god's spirit deserve to withstand the antichrist spirit satan will be powerless before her because the people say yes i am that i don't care if so many other people say they believe the same thing as i do they don't i'm still going to take my stand with boldness because it's the truth they're going to be people who might say they're the same they might say they believe the same but there are two vines and i'm not going to let the false detract my the boldness in my stand i've been reading a book lately on martin luther just finished it this last week and my goodness the extremism that went with his ministry his ministry resulted in a little bit of a civil war there in germany it was crazy but um brother branham says revival signifies a move of god and power and every time god moves satan is there to move also and he talked about luther in this same paragraph it's amazing that he was able to keep his head above the fanaticism but he says i hope you're spiritual minded enough to get that and capitalize on it don't let all the false things going around distract you from taking the true word of god and just devouring it that's how you capitalize on it the devil's purpose is to erode your trust erode your your confidence so that you won't take that step onto the true word of god as god's fulfilling his work by bringing it to pass he wants to keep it at arm's length keep it at arm's length and never really take it and make it your own that's his goal brother branham says hey be careful there are two spirits in the framework of the true church don't let the false keep from identifying the true and capitalizing on it amen so paul's authority like i said was frequently questioned during his ministry even though um everybody would accept every christian would accept the authority he claimed for himself today if he is kind of consider how his claims must have come across to his first century hearers and i just want to take a kind of get ourselves a little bit of acquainted with how god was moving in paul's life some historians will debate the actual dates that are on the chart here my purpose isn't so much to say was the was it this particular or that but the space between the years that's pretty certain based upon what paul uh talks about in his in his uh there in the book of acts what luke talks about in paul in his epistles so jesus christ is crucified resurrected i think 80 33 and then the holy ghost is poured out on the day of pentecost 80 33 then the church is just growing for several years there well in 1837 approximately that that's when stephen would be stoned and those are that's the event that leads up to stahls conversion well um then saul will calling paul now he's going to be going to arabia and then in damascus and then he finally settles and settles in syria we'll look at this some of this in galatians chapter one in fact let's just go ahead and turn to galatians chapter 1. i don't have these scriptures on the screen if you have your bible be nice to look to them galatians chapter 1 and then verse 17. it says after my experience there with the pillar of fire neither went i up to jerusalem to them which are apostles before me but i went into arabia and returned again into damascus and then after three years i went up to jerusalem to see peter and abode within 15 days so we have this idea that paul is the angel of the church and he's instantly out there ministering that's not the case he was he was he he was three years spending time with with with the lord getting them he was all he was already a student of the old testament he is having the revelation of the old testament just poor he it's all being revealed to him he's three years there other verse 19 other of the apostles saw i none saved james the lord's brother now the things which i write unto you behold before god i lie not afterwards i came into the regions of syria and cilicia and was unknown by faith to the churches of judea which were in christ so there was a period of time there i think that's probably close to 10 years that paul was unknown he'd been called of god yet he's somewhere in celestia perhaps tarsus we don't know exactly where but he's just mending nets he'd been called by god he had revelation but it wasn't his time yet and then barnabas from the church in antioch goes and barnabas is an interesting looking guy and an interesting brother in the book of acts he's always trying to further fellowship furthering fellowship he says hey we want to do mission work i know just the guy let's go get paul you guys don't know him yet but he's going to be a great one he's not making a name for himself i'm going to be the next missionary barnaby he's no he's not doing that he's saying paul's our guy paul might be the one he goes and brings paul to antioch and then they go on this mission trip together he was unknown by faith they think my how god works his angel of the church of ephesus he's an unknown for a long time and then so then he just goes on and then we can read through the book of acts and see how all these things take take time paul doesn't really come up in the book of acts until chapter 13 or 14 i believe a lot goes a lot goes on there maybe we can turn to the book of um turn to keep a finger in the book of galatians and then go over to the book of acts chapter 15. galatians in acts 15 go together paul takes his first missionary trip up into galatia asia minor and he's out there for probably a couple years and then he gets back to antioch and he gets word from the churches he or the places where he had been that other men had been traveling behind him teaching another gospel which included you could be following jesus but you also need to keep all of moses law you can be a gentile you can come and put your faith in christ but you still have to be circumcised you have to fulfill all of the law and when paul hears this he feels like blow on the fuse because there's no that is not the gospel at all and think about it if you're a jew if you've been raised you've been reading moses's law you've got if you once you get to be your 13th birthday you have a bar mitzvah you memorize hundreds and hundreds of verses of it you you know it and then how revolutionary it is for somebody to come along and say you don't have to be circumcised that's a big deal because circumcision was the symbol of god's covenant with abraham all of a sudden you say that's no longer needed this is another gospel this is error i mean this is very a very understandable reaction to the jewish christians at that time but paul is paulie he's this is the message that's been given to him and he's not going to be browbeaten he's not going to be influenced away from it says no if any he says i marvel that you have been influenced so quickly to another gospel well um acts 15 1 to certain men which came down from judea taught the brethren after i'd been through they teach except you be circumcised after the manner of moses you cannot be saved and paul says what that means that your works are more powerful than the blood of jesus christ that is completely false then jesus christ came for nothing he suffered from nothing that is false and so they have to have an independent their first church council their first brothers meeting and it wasn't filled with brotherly love it was a difficult meeting because if everybody who is with all sincerity they think the circumcision was given by moses we've all the prophets are are agreeing with this and here comes paul teaching something so different how could paul be right and think also about it what had paul done to many of their families he'd beat them up throwing them into prison i mean there could very well be some hard feelings i can remember brother marcus becker took me years back i was in germany he was taking me to nuremberg a couple different places he told me about the first european ministers meeting in the 70s maybe and you have that's not that long after world war ii and it was it was a little bit tense i mean i remember my dad's from the south and we'd have thanksgiving or christmas down there and the civil war would still be fought sometimes 120 years later but it's not easy and with the wounds that paul had caused were very very fresh but um he's surprised at this at this minister's meeting in acts 15 he doesn't say about him there but he sure lets his pen go to work in the book of galatians so um and this jerusalem council paul and barnabas go there and they share what god has done among the gentiles and luke doesn't share a lot about of what paul had said there but paul does in galatians chapter 1 so we'll just we'll just move move back there let's go to galatians chapter 2 actually then 14 years after i went up again to jerusalem with barn i went up again to jerusalem with barnabas and took titus with me also this is 14 years since so there's a long silent period there i went by revelation i gave my testimony of what god was doing among the gentiles in verse two lest by any means i should run or had run in vain but he takes titus with him who is the greek and he was compelled to be circumcised because a false brethren was going to come in aware now and then verse 11 and then peter's there and he says i withstood peter to the face because he was to be blamed there's a there's a lot of tension there just to illustrate we talk about the angel of the church of ephesus the apostle of the gentiles it wasn't quite that clear to paul's hearers at the time if you look at the corinthian church paul found perhaps his most critical audience among the church at corinth i remember one time i counted up the number of chapters in each book of the new testament and the corinthians received most chapters if anybody in new testament were written to them and that wasn't because they were such a strong great church because they needed all those chapters written to them but he spent the whole three chapters of second corinthians defending his authority and testimony as a messenger of god um he lays out and i think first corinthians 14 i have here at the bottom of page two um if you think about what paul was saying and that we we read over it here in the 21st century very quickly if you think about what he's saying he's making some big statements he says if any man think himself to be a prophet or a spiritual let him acknowledge that the things i write unto you are the commandments of the lord if you think you're spiritual and don't believe what i'm saying you're ignorant that's some that's a big statement it almost comes across as arrogant but you know if you have the authority by god and you're hesitant to use it you're doing a disservice to everyone as well so paul is saying if you think you're a prophet if you think you're spiritual acknowledged what i'm saying has been given by god but if anyone wants to be ignorant i'm not going to fight with you just let you be ignorant that's a strong strong statement he's making he talks uh on the book of the in the his sufferings for the gospel nobody suffered for the gospel as paul suffered he probably he might have wished sometimes i wish i could have been martyred earlier because i would have had a much easier road home but you know what i think glory and suffering they often go together throughout the bible and if god gives you much you will probably have to suffer a lot for it i think about i think about brother uh brother ron spencer we we pray for him and talk about a man with testimonies i remember all the youth meetings growing up he always had the testimony if you count the things that happened to that man it's rough but you think my what wonderful testimonies i wish i had those testimonies do you do you want to go through the things that he went through so if you want to have a testimony you gotta have a vic take it takes a victory uh to to have that and he also had exceptional supernatural experiences visions revelations talks about a man that i knew which was speaking of himself humbly who was caught up into the seventh heaven i think i don't remember exactly but it's he's talking about these exceptional supernatural experiences he had his defense he says this corinthian church they want to have proof of my ministry excuse me from my father he says i'll become like a fool and glory but i think it's necessary that you know what god is doing through me so that you can accept god's grace to you now the question then is so we see paul's hearers had a hard time accepting his authority because we there's so much paul may take such pains to support that he has great authority which means he's answering questions but how did paul see his his own authority and to uh well i talked about galatians chapter one eight um and we can go back to galatians one versus we're still there galatians one one these brother branham says paul was led by no one but the spirit of god paul galatians 1 1 says paul an apostle not of men neither by man but by jesus christ and god the father raised him from the dead he was god's man he was not peter's man he wasn't james man he wasn't the jerusalem council's man he was god's man completely verses 11 and 12 galatians 1 i certify you brethren that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man i neither received it of man neither was i taught it because he was taught by gamaliel for years this is what i have now was not from grammaria i wasn't taught by anybody this i received it by revelation of god and that's why brother ben says the church is built upon revelation because revelation with revelation the sum is greater than the whole of the parts revelation gives you the complete picture and then the gospel he preached to the galatians is definitive and we reread that galatians 1 8 already i think it's interesting though um sometimes brother brandon will make statements i like i have this one from is this a sign of the end yes sir um and people yeah he's a little it seems like he's got some false humility here he says um friends don't look to me i'm your brother don't pay any attention to me because i'm just immortal i have to die like everybody else don't you listen to me but listen to what i've said what i've said is the message don't pay attention to the messenger watch the message and somebody could ask what's the difference when you're saying don't listen to me but listen to what i've said what's the difference well i think the difference is very similar to what paul says in galatians 1 8 but the weird angel from heaven preached any other gospel but we've already preached unto you let them be accursed don't just listen to me listen to what i said because if i ever say anything different from what i said the sample or there's that gospel then i'm wrong so it's paul saying something very similar don't listen to me listen to what i've said it's the mess and it's the message that's the key brother branham saying something very very similar but if we look at the rest of galatians chapter 1 [Music] he's people are going to see that paul is going to be echoing certain old testament prophets as he writes and he's going to be making illusions and i would say that anybody in paul's day who was raised in the um raised in the jewish faith raised in the synagogue went through the bar mitzvah the batman so that they would have probably made the connections to these illusions but if you weren't we might not make them as quickly because illusions are a reference to something outside the text that's going to give greater meaning to it so for example you can have you can have this this little play going on and then you some somebody might say man i've got so many goliaths in my life if you don't know the story about dave and goliath that line will not make as much sense to you you might have the idea that he's got obstacles he's got difficulties but when you know the story of dave's and goliath it takes on such a much greater meaning it's a reference to some to a story outside the story paul's doing that and i can the significance of illusions there's an example i have when i was in college i was i lived in i lived on campus and i can remember president bush it was in 2003 and he was giving the state of the union address and i'm in there in the in the in the dorm lounge watching the state of the union address with my fellow classmates and i hear brother i hear brother bush i hear president bush make the following statement he says he's saying um so many in our country the homeless the fatherless the addicted the need is great yet there is power wonder working power in the goodness and idealism and faith of the american people and i heard this he's preaching he's up there wonder working power in the blood i know that song it's a it's it's an illusion that that rung strongly with me nobody else in the room caught it nobody else did they said they just listened wonder working power don't we know where they missed it why is he saying that because he knows a lot of people who voted for him would know that him and i think man he's trying to get christian charities christian organizations to help with the needs of the time and this is this line is purposefully meant for their ears so they'd have special meaning to them and it's interesting though this is a another observer's uh statement about that he says there's power wonder working power the sentiments are classically revivalist the hymn was used in revivals but he says all bush did was replace jesus as the source of the wonder working power with idealism and faith of the american people and it's interesting that that happens very subtly where the we have this idea of civil religion high lofty sentiments without jesus but with our idealism and our own power but the illusion was there to communicate to his supporters i know you're christians i know you're voting for me i'm going to get you involved in the solutions to the needs so there can be this is like a coded message that i picked up on the different christians evangel from evangelical traditions they would pick up on but it would be lost on many other people and i i'm going to go through a couple of these from galatians chapter one that would be that we might miss but paul's hearers would certainly have gotten let's take a look at what paul writes here in galatians 1 when it pleased god who separated me from my mother's womb and called me by his grace to reveal his son in me this phrase who separated me from my mother's womb are there any is that that is an allusion to a couple other old testament prophets who said something very similar our first one would be in jeremiah jeremiah says before i for his god is speaking before i formed thee in the belly i knew thee before you came forth out of the womb i sanctified thee and ordained thee a prophet to the nations think about for paul's jewish listeners or for the ex-pharisee believers they know what paul is saying when he's saying when it pleased god who separated me from my mother's what are you saying you're like jeremiah that's what he's saying and they would have caught that and he's not just jeremiah isaiah says it's also in isaiah 49 listen no isles unto me and hearken you people from afar the lord hath called me from the womb that's what paul is saying about himself just like god separated jeremiah from from the womb and dedicated to himself like isaiah he's putting himself in their class that's huge we might not catch that right away but his listeners would have and they probably didn't appreciate it but he's stating it still the same and then we go on down later in galatians chapter 1 yes verse 23 paul is he says he was unknown by faith to the churches of judea but they heard the word only they didn't see him but they heard the word only that he which persecuted us in the times past now preacheth the faith with which once he destroyed and it says and they glorified god in me and then 14 years after i went up again to jerusalem communicated in the gospel which i preach among to the gentiles lest by any means i should run or had run in vain where do those underlying portions come from again he's not just writing this on his own he's making an illusion something that's said very similarly in the book of isaiah isaiah says in chapter 49 again and that and said unto me thou art my servant of israel and whom i will be glorified it's a very similar phrasing and paul is appropriating that to himself and then i said i have labored in vain i've spent my strength for naught and in vain yes surely my judgment with the lord is with the lord and my work with god and paul is identifying himself and his concerns with the concerns of the prophet isaiah that he that god might be glorified in him as well lest he run in vain and then um we see this next one uh this language about how god hath commanded me to be a i have set thee to be a light of the gentiles this is also an illusion this is i think it's actually spoken to um to saul there on the road to damascus but this is the very same language that isaiah is using now set the lord that formed me from the womb to be his servant i will also give thee for a light to the gentiles saul is drawing the paul is drawing these connections saying there's great affinity between my ministry and the ministry of isaiah the ministry of jeremiah that puts me in a class with the old testament prophets and um i didn't i didn't pick up these illusions myself because i'd read through the book of galatians many times and didn't catch it but a couple years ago i was teaching a my high school bible class where we were going to go through the book of acts so i picked up a book by n.t wright he's an anglican theologian this is a biography of paul i picked it up and i'm going through here and he's and he was the one who drew all these connections and nt wright was making the case that paul should be considered the prophet and when i read that from a denominational theologian my jaw dropped says brother branham said that we've been saying it for years and we got knocked out of the park there's no way that's not true but here you've got a denominational theologian saying the same thing and showing some really interesting proof for it i was impressed he also shows from galatians 1 17 where paul went he leaves damascus he goes down into arabia and then he comes back and he says that paul does this it's interesting why does he go to arabia later in the book of galatians he talks about mount sinai you have you have agar um mount sinai in arabia and that's just like the jerusalem of the day that's what the law was given and jerusalem today is full of law but the jerusalem of above that is grace he says what is he he's connecting the jerusalem church of that moment with hagar that wouldn't be appreciated by his his jewish listeners either but his connection to mount sinai is important this is these are nt rights words here it says mount sinai why does paul go there that's where god had come down in fire and had given moses the torah it was the place of revelation the place of law the place where the covenant between god and israel was made sinai the great mountain in arabia was in that sense the place of beginnings sinai was where elijah had gone when it all went horribly wrong inside it was where saul of tarsus went for the same reason because saul has felt where have we gone as a jewish faith we've all missed it the full the old testament has been fulfilled in jesus christ and we all missed it it's gone wrong and then the pillar of fire comes down to reveals it's the saul and he goes to the same place to kind of get reoriented he go god spoke to moses there god spoke to elijah there god speaks to paul there he goes back back then this is it all went horribly wrong it's the place of beginning it's the place of the where the old covenant was given this is the place where saul is also seeing what the new covenant completely means for the gentiles and so he says after that saul went back to damascus apparently confirmed in his understanding of himself as a prophet fulfilling the ancient rule of announcing god's truth and god's anointed king to israel and the nations that time that saul assault spent there in arabia going to the old testament having all the pieces put together for him he leaves a completely changed man he has truth that he hadn't they didn't have before paul in other words is not making it clear in galatians is not only making it clear in galatians one and two that his gospel was given to him directly not acquired second hand to the jerusalem leaders he is also making it clear that his call and commissioning have placed him in the ancient prophetic tradition whether of isaiah jeremiah or elijah himself his opponents are trying to go over his head and appeal to the jerusalem council but he is going over everybody else's head by appealing directly to jesus himself and to the scriptures as foreshadowing not only the gospel of christ but also the prophetic ministry that he paul had now received paul sees these things and it's because he sees i've been separated from my womb from from my mother's womb for this purpose just like isaiah was just like jeremiah was i've been a light to the gentile that's what i'm called to be jesus mentions that to me when i'm when i see them they're they're on the road to damascus and this is what isaiah prophesied about so other people i've been called to fulfill that for paul to stand so strong against so much opposition he would have to have a clear revelation of it and i think he really did know who he was and that he had a very unique ministry that we would see then as the angel of the church of ephesus but brother branham because he was the prophet messenger it's a pretty amazing call yes now wouldn't we think about if you think but put yourself in the position of paul's jewish listeners who've been raised and who were message believers of that day or who were raised in the church and everything and uh he then all of a sudden saul comes back and saying hey a circumvision doesn't profit you a thing it's not that it does it doesn't have any benefit into your relationship with christ what that is how that was the covenant with abraham now as as his listeners are hearing this i think they would have a question like wait wasn't paul adding to the word because that's a question that we can have when god sends a prophetic mystery like brother brandon says hold up he says now we're going to turn to the book of elijah hold up stop book of elijah we've got 66 books of the bible we can't add the book of the book of the bible because we're not supposed to add to the word and that's and that's true so we can have the question paul could have the question i believe he did it might not have been phrased this way but the question is saul aren't you adding to the word here and moses wrote in deuteronomy you shall not add to the word which i command you neither shall you diminish ought from it and i'd say people would say saul you're saying people shouldn't be circumcised that's definitely diminishing what moses taught us because he taught us that very very clearly and you're changing it and if you change or add to the word you're no longer keeping the commandments of the lord and john would later write in the book of revelation if any man add unto these things god will add to him the plagues if any man take away from the words of the book god will take his part out of the book of life the holy city this was a highly charged question a highly charged issue that saul would have that paul would have had to deal with and we have to deal with it too i just want to talk about that for a for a few minutes here um paul takes great pains and his epistles to show that his message sprouts out of the groundwork of the old testament that's what he does in the book of hebrews he's going through all the old testament types and shadows showing how look jesus christ ministry is a fulfillment of all these things it's not something it's not a new thing it's the fulfillment of the old things it's not um it's um it's completely consistent with what had already been revealed and when um when we looked at chapter one of the church age book there's a there's a quote there brother branham says about talks about how the greek word for revelation is apocalypse which means unveiling he compares it to unveiling a work of statue so here we have a sculpture we know the young men unveiling the sculpture who they are we recognize them it's princess diana's two sons william and harry and they're unveiling a sculpture here in 2021 in the particular uh garden and revelation is brands of revelation is compared to god take it to to the to the um to the covering being taken off the statue so you can see what what what it is and we can see right here very you probably can't see it at the bottom it says diana princess that's that's all that we can see so we can see we have a very vague idea of who the statue might be revealing kind of like in genesis 3 15 we're told that there's going to be some somebody coming a seat of the woman who will crush the serpent's head we don't have many more details than that but we know what the stats what what god's work is going to be about do we know who is underneath that that uh that blanket if you anybody know i didn't know who would we expect to be underneath the blanket princess diana and who else sorry perhaps the queen other ideas i would have thought william and harry but as you go through and the we do this because we have an idea where god might be going with something but when god unveils his actual work we can be disappointed not disappointed we can our our prediction wouldn't have come to pass because as the guys as the boys pull off the statue yes it is diana but when they take the rest of it off it's not william and harry it's a young boy a young girl and there's another set of two legs behind the young girl not the not that she's a four-legged girl but there's another child behind um the girl and if you look closely the young boy appears to be african-american so this is i when i expected this revelation of the statue to be diane and her sons that's now i would say that is like an old testament expectation of what god's doing i i've got it figured out i can see diana princess of wales there are two sons right next to it unveiling that's my expectation and i will in the old testament but i will die upon this mountain that is what it's all about it can't be anything else but once the cover is completely taken off what there's a girl that we didn't know about or there's an african what's going on here well it's it's symbolism of her love for children her love for the world etc etc but can you see when there's an unveiling we have to be ready for the sculptor to speak to us as he wants to speak to us we can't put the sculptor in the box even though i had a pretty good idea what i thought and could defend that the sculpture is going to be we can't do that we have to let the sculptor be the sculptor and god be god and in the ephesian church age brother brandon makes a statement god can't give a first revelation and then a second revelation you can't add he can't add to his own word either if he did he'd be changing his mind now he can give a revelation and then add to it oh stop didn't it say you can't add to the word he does say that let's just keep that thought and we'll he answers the question he can give a revelation and then add to it as he did in the garden of eden when he promised to seed the woman and then later designated that seed to come through abraham and even before that and then after through abraham and then later through the jewish people through moses and then later it would come by the same bloodlines in david and throughout the old testament there is additional clarity being given but none of those things are different revelations it's just more detail being given to the same revelation it was the same revelation it only gave the people more information to help them receive and understand it so when god shows more it's not a second sculpture it's not a second revelation it's just god revealing more of it amen hopefully we can see a little bit then that um that paul had challenges in his day of asserting his apostolic and prophetic authority those challenges are nothing are nothing new and we know brother branham and then we will encounter challenges and we assert brother branham's prophetic authority but that just kind of goes to the territory of following someone god is using to blaze a trail you would have thought at the ephesian church age after having had such a clear message a great messenger that this had been a revival fire that just went on for time and for time in eternity and i remember when brother burley spoke at the couple's dinner last week was that last week wow um he says that there didn't talk about the intimacy between god and the and and the bride there in the ephesian church and just how how how how close it was how had such a special connection and he said there didn't have to be a smyrnan age or a perk of me and age or a ladder change that didn't didn't have to be that way he says if the if you just maintained your your connection with god in the ephesian age that it didn't have you didn't have to fall away and he applied that then to us as couples we we can go through uh difficult times and if we don't don't handle those difficult times well then you can go from that fusion age to a time of suffering to a time of i mean all the way to where you're completely lukewarm and cold you can have that um but you don't have to you don't have to you can you can correct you can you can repent you can you can go back to that first love that's not destined to go off into lukewarmness and coldness but brother branham talks about how there was um that the church ages i saw this cycle of apostasy and it was there in the ephesian age he talks about in the uh here on the right you have a um a image of diana and this is a very different image than mo it took me a while i actually find one like this this is not the one that was in ephesus it was one that was found in germany in the church age book he says that the image of diana found in the temple of ephesus was unlike any of the other ones there were many other temples it was just a wooden block hardly with any kind of form at all it says there were just two iron arms going out he says it looked very innocent what could be look at a block of wood like that he doesn't have most images of diana will be this elegant uh female huntress with her bow ready to go and slay that looks threatening this doesn't this is the antichrist spirit in ephesus it starts out very innocent nothing nothing too dangerous here but that that thing that got started led to a cooling off of their love and it says the very name ephesus has this compound meaning meaning aimed at and relaxed the high aspirations of this age that began with the fullness of the spirit the depth of god whereby they were aiming at the high calling of god began to give way to a less watchful attitude i just remember the burley talk how easy it is as couples then at the very beginning you want to do everything you can to please one another and then after a while i really don't care if my dirty socks are next to the bed anymore i really don't care i'm going to do it and uh sorry honey um but we we can get that way we just don't care and that that where you can be you start out aimed at to please to love one another then just kind of relaxed and not really caring anymore and that happened spiritually a less ardent following of jesus christ began to manifest itself as an omen that in the future ages the physical vehicle called the church would sink the awfulness of the depths of satan it become relaxed and was drifting already the age was backsliding it had left its first love and during the church book there's lots to be said on that but here on page 95 he continues how history keeps repeating itself in the generations of israel we see revival in one generation only to see the fires fading in the next and then in the third generation if you look up third generation and quote you'll see a couple places where he talks like this in the third generation embers may be glowing slightly but in the fourth there'd be no there may be no vestige whatsoever of that original flame but look at the grace of god then god lights the fire again in the same process repeated it's the manifestation of the truth that god has no grandchildren amen and kind of going back this is a cycle of apostasy that you see in the old testament and you think about what book of the old testament parallels with the ephesians well joshua and ephesians parallel one of the ephesians is going out and possessing the the work the the the the promises of christ in the new testament joshua's where they're possessing the promised land well what book follows after joshua it's the book of judges and in the book of judges you see that cycle of apostasy going very very quickly just that cycle just kind of rolls throughout the old testament well if you look at the we don't have time to go into it now i'm just going to give you a short uh a short summary and then we'll be finished but in the last four chapters 17 18 19 20 last five chapters of judges 17-21 we see this atmosphere where every man is doing right in his own eyes that summarizes today that summarizes not just the world of today it summarizes the religious world of today every man does which is right in his own eyes and those last few chapters of judges we see a traveling levite who is going around and he's selling his priestly services to the highest bidder and there's one young man named micah who has stolen money from his mother and he ends up making a an altar and a false god and he's a he's amazing ephraimite so he's uh he's not in the in he's not in the priestly tribe so he's his own priest but once this levite comes around he says hey micah knows enough that levites are better priests than ephraimites i should ask this guy to be my priest and he pays him to be his priest and that goes along well for a while and then the danites come they're traveling along because they want to posses the danites were given land where the philistines settled in the south of israel but they want to go and possess this area way in the north because they've got too many battles here so they want to go and do their own thing and possess this village it's not causing anybody any problems they're going along their way and they see this this man this levite priest and they recognize him because he's been around obviously gotten a name for himself and sure enough it's better to be a priest for a whole tribe than for one family and he goes with them and later in the judges 1830 we are told the name that this levite it's his name is jonathan his dad was gershom and the king james version says that his name is manasseh if you look at other bible versions it'll be moses and this was very likely moses's grandson because moses's son was a gershom and if you look it's thought that why is there a name change well in hebrew the name of moses looks like that manasseh just adds one letter and it's thought that that the the scribe writing this copying this out that is so terrible the disgrace that moses's grandson would be doing this they added the letter there because manasseh means forgetting they added the letter there so that despair moses the shame of being associated with what his grandson was doing now brother branham talks about the cycle of revival apostasy the first generation got this great revival second generation third generation embers just dying out you see this how quickly this happens in the book of judges and then at the another thing you see at the end of the judge you see all kinds of moral atrocities but you see a sexual perversion on a terrible scale where there's even a story that's hard to fathom where this man's traveling with his concubine of his and he goes to this city and she's abused all night and he gets up in the morning she's dead in the doorstep he hacks her into pieces sends pieces of her body all the tribes of israel to get them all to judge this is a terrible it's a grisly story terrible but it just shows everybody does what's right in their own eyes and when you do what's right in your own eyes you're going to get some really bad stuff if you wonder about it just look at the stuff that you can watch today it's bad because everybody does what's right in their own eyes well in the so this launches all of israel into a civil war all the 11 tribes go to the tribe of benjamin and they try to wipe him out and there's a man named phineas who's going on offering sacrifices to intercede to god for these 11 tribes and if you look aaron eliaser phineas this is again this connection between moses and manasseh this sorry moses and jonathan just three generations that supported his phineas aaron's grandson as here in the story as well just how quickly this falling away can happen and when i saw this i got to thinking where are we today if you look at brother branham and then how many generations are we further i asked brother paul on the before service was brother john lafontaine in brother branham's meetings he said he wasn't but this his dad was but i put this and then if you look at brother branham brother john wasn't there but he was of an age where he could have been and then we're we're we're a third brother paul's a third generation away and how quickly a revival can fade and launch into when joshua's introducing the people they're going on and claiming their land and caleb says give me my mount and they just have all kinds of victories how quickly it falls there's a falling away there's a cooling off and that's the very that's that's the challenge of today because brother branham says to understand um revelation 2 5 where um john writes remember therefore from whence you are fallen and repent remember where you've fallen from he says it's not just a message to there but this talks about to understand this you must realize that the spirit is not speaking to the original saint of ephesus alone this message is to the entire age which lasted about 120 years its message then is to all the generations in that span and he says and history keeps repeating itself and it talks about the first generation second what i showed before salvation is not passed along by natural birth any more than there's any truth to apostolic succession we have to repent and i just think back we want to we don't have to have a leg to see an age in our own personal walk with god we don't have to have a cooling off when we're called we want to keep on with that have that close walk don't ever leave your your your first love we don't we're not doomed to this cooling off and that that you see all around the world we don't want that we don't have to have that god has something better for us and if we see the place where we have cold office remember where you've fallen from because if god started to work in you he's not going to leave you halfway he's there all you have to do is repent and say and brother bran says you're back now it's that easy we don't have to say all these kinds of prayers burn candles you're back repent you're back now and do the first works and this if you don't i won't remove your candlestick but repent because repentance is the game changer repentance changes the story so if you find yourself the story of your life and you don't like how the chapters reading we have to choose your own adventure story you could say what i want a different story repent that takes you a different page in the book and you're good to go amen well i trust that uh that hopefully brought a little bit of clarity to how god how god works he worked with a prophet messenger earlier in the first age and i believe that paul had he had scriptural basis for how god was using him he he stood upon that and if we can see how the devil likes to work showing uh showing false impersonations to to to distract us to keep us to help it to get us to keep god's truth what god's doing at arm's length we can see that there's two spirits capitalize on that truth and embrace the true don't let him don't let the devil keep you from that amen let's pray and then brother gideon i will give her an overview let's pray heavenly father we thank you very much for your goodness and grace to us lord i thank you for the for the great uh unveiling of truth lord that you did lord to brother branham's ministry of father i thank you for opening our eyes to that and lord i just pray if there's anyone here who like myself may have built up a skeptical attitude or skeptical complex to that lord i just pray father that you would lord grant deliverance from mass that we might be able to rejoice in what god has done instead of just keeping at arm's length if you've got a skeptical complex nothing will ever actually be good enough for you you'll keep everything at arm's length you'll be left alone i pray the lord that you would open our eyes to that that we might be able to rejoice in your truth oh god father just pray that you move in each and every life of god lord i pray that you would do a do a do a review of each of our hearts of god lord that we might lord not leave our first love or we might go back to that first level god an intimate personal relationship that's what we that's what elijah was sent forth to have a not just have new doctrines new new principles revealed to us but to have that relationship restored and i pray o lord that you would do that in each and every one of us lord we love you thank you in jesus name amen
