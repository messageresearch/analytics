========================================

amen i'll read this here now peter and john went up together into the temple and then in the hour of prayer being the ninth hour and a certain lame man from this mother's from his mother's womb was carried whom they led daily at the gate of the temple which is called beautiful to ask alms of them that entered into the temple who seeing peter and john about to go into the temple ask in alms and peter fastened his eyes upon him with john saying look unto us and he gave heed this man he gave heed unto them he heard them expecting to receive something of them then peter said silver and gold have i known but such as i have give iv in the name of jesus christ of nazareth rise up and walk so let's just pray tonight just ask for a blessing the reading of his word dear heavenly father we come before you tonight god we're just so honored to be in your presence once again god knowing god that you are the one that controls all things lord jesus in control of lord my mouth tonight lord jesus in reality if i just let go and let god tonight lord jesus i know that you you'll speak through me tonight lord jesus and speak to the individual tonight lord jesus just help me to do that tonight and god on the receiving end lord jesus the the people tonight god let the let that worship that was we we had in song with god let that let that be the softening period lord jesus where it softens the heart so that the word now god can come in so smoothly lord jesus and god let it not just stay here in the building lord jesus but let it be manifested in each and every one of our lives outside the building god that's our prayer tonight god we love you lord we give you the service in jesus name amen amen you may be seated amen so i picked the subject of expectation tonight so uh i guess the thought i guess it's always kind of been in my mind this thought of expectation my mom laughs at me all the time because i when i talk about expectation or expectation for for people i said i guess i've changed my mind in the last couple years that i i set my expectations so low for people you know i set my expectations low so i won't get disappointed right it which you know i'm still trying to figure out you know it's not it's a work in progress i don't know if i'm exactly right on that yet but um so this this sermon kind of started that thought but um we have we have a place where we can have a right expectation amen amen so that's kind of what i'm getting at tonight i love i love things that are sure you know i like a foundation i like things that i can i can look at and i can i can see and i'm like that that's for sure you know if we can see those things that are crystal clear that gets me excited and it's in its simplicity that you really have to dumb yourself down amen kind of gotta dumb yourself down sometimes when you're reading your words is it really this simple is it really this simple amen amen this thing is uh so let's let's uh let's sing this i'm song leading still amen so first question tonight where are your expectations so when you think of expectations you think of like i don't know you think of uh i don't know just the expectations you have for individuals you the expectations you have for let's say uh like your children or your spouse or something like that you have a lot of times human nature has a high expectation it's just our nature that sets this high expectation just right off the bat i don't know it could be the the standards we have or just how we grew up but a lot of times even growing up in a christian home i know that you see a lot of things that are so good that your expectation is so high of people and just just a lot of things you know so um i guess when the when the flesh um when the flesh is involved in this world um with high expectations and how things should be we are easily disappointed as i said um because because of our fallen nature we are bound to be fallible right because of this flesh we are fallible right because obviously we have a a seed i believe i have a seed within me that's it's a part of god and it's perfect right it's perfect because it's a part of him but with this flesh we are we are fallible amen so that's kind of where the expectations come and you have the husband and wife scenario right so i don't know too much about that i don't know too much about the husband and wife uh i haven't experienced it myself um i believe i will but um i've you know i've watched a lot and i've seen the right way and i've seen the wrong way but any one of you married people could tell me that you know if you set some sort of expectations for your spouse or a high expectation then there's going to be trouble right there's going to be trouble so i mean i go to the another example would be i go to the fridge i go to the fridge like constantly right expecting something incredible to be in there right open it i go out i go i'm sitting on the couch and it's just this cycle i keep going back to the fridge i open it i keep opening expecting something like a nice chocolate cake to be in there i don't know a nice steak like i said you don't like microwave steak so maybe not a steak but um but you know you know what i'm saying you guys have been there right so what i'm trying to say is if your expectation is high for something or something that is fallible why are you troubled when it doesn't go as planned right so some people expect a sensation or feeling so even this this could go on a spiritual sense as far as your healing you're expecting you're expecting or a healing or um like a deliverance but you're expecting almost like a feeling that goes with it which feelings are up and down right feelings they go up and they're they're everywhere and that honestly should not be our our basis for our expectations and where they should be right and that goes for god too god our flesh we get so excited sometimes and we can be on the mountain in probably one hour and then right back down the next hour it can be that quick sometimes especially on these phones right this this can numb you so quick you know it can i mean it like i know from my experience i've been i've been like i've been like let's let's say i i get home from a meeting or something like that i'm so energized with what god's doing i'll be on this for maybe 10 minutes and there it goes there it is it's gone amen and that affects that alters your expectations of what god is doing right so in this uh this lame man uh in this lame man's case his his expectation all the time was about money right that can be some some person's expectations sometimes and they they live off the next paycheck and they they gotta have it and if i don't have this next paycheck that's their that's their pride and joy that's their their the way they live that's just what they they they dwell on all the time and this this lame man he's seeking satisfaction with with money um that that ain't gonna get you through at all you know that that money is the root of all evil right and it's not it's not your satisfaction at all it may give temporary satisfaction but it is not going to get you get you to a satisfaction that is is consistent amen amen now i wanted to tell you that there is something that you can place your expectations in and never be disappointed because it is infallible and what is that it's the word of god how many believe that tonight it's the word of god amen it is infallible it is perfect amen we have we have a foundation tonight that we can come to and we can say where can i go where's my filter now i can go back right back to this word and i can say all right lord where where's my where's my expectation come from amen this is this word is where my faith where my expectation comes from amen this is the basis we've got to come back to this if we don't come back to this we'll turn to something else and we'll get in this cycle we'll get in the cycle of just going going up and down with just feelings and everything else we've got to come back to the foundation amen hallelujah amen it says the scripture says heaven and earth will pass away but my words will not pass away amen all the things of this world and then all the pleasures and even i think i remember my dad saying at one time even christian music sometimes even christian music can can get you in this high right and it can get i mean it's it's still good words still good things and if you if you keep that maintaining that and you're just on that all the time it can actually be in a lot of ways it can it can bring you down because you're you're going in it so much and i i'm not against christian music you guys know that for me i love christian music but all i'm saying is that that can there's a peak to that right there's a peak and that's when the word of god comes in the word of god is going to to push you through to that next spot amen amen hallelujah amen so in nursing school we have a thing called evidence-based practice okay evidence-based practice is something that has stood the test of time it's been practiced over and over and it's something that works right so i was just thinking how this could relate to even god's word you know we got nurses amen they they're just doing so much all the time that could be up and down like it's it's uh i mean some some of the things you're shocked you know with what some of the what the nurses do i'm not gonna give anything away but i'm just you know you know what i mean i'm sure you guys have that experience of nurses doing things and you're just like this isn't even common sense but they have they have this thing called evidence-based practice where it stood the test of time like this is going to work amen so that's why i related to god's word this is going to work amen hallelujah amen thank you god so your expectation in the word will always be satisfied but not only satisfied but now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundant above all that we ask or think according to the power that has worked in us amen unto him to be the glory of this church of jesus christ amen i love that scripture right there amen he's he's able to do exceeding abundant what we ask or think amen when our foundation's in that word this i mean it's amazing how much this word just i would say in the past years i can past year i can testify of this how much this word has exploded to me like just has come alive to me amen i i gotta testify of that just because that is that's something that you know i i probably have read the bible i've started in genesis just like you have over and over trying to read the bible every year you know and nothing you know you feel like you're just reading words you know and you know now i can it's it's amazing i can see you know just through your scriptures and i'm just like my god this is incredible so always seek that seek revelation brother branham said more than anything seek revelation amen why revelation is because that's that's where we got the the connection with god amen you see abel abel offered a more excellent sacrifice than cain why because he had that revelation always stick with that revelation of the word for your day amen amen all the all the other ages you know they they had a light right but now there's there's another light right so we've come to this light and we've got we've got we got to stick with this light we can't just dwell on the other lights right because they've faded out but that those lights have connected to this light and now we're in this light so stick with your delight for your day amen i couldn't say that enough amen that is needed for this day amen people this world and i've been in the i've been in the mental health hospitals for clinicals this this world we're here people we are here we are we're in the insane world amen these people these people know these some of these people they know scripture more than i do they're ranting off scripture just like that amen i mean obviously we know that demons they know scripture too amen but at the same time they you know they come and they they're saying they're god and everything like it's it's just it is crazy if you you if you come to you know and see that i i pray none of us get there you know with uh with the power of the blood i believe no none of us will amen praise the lord so i've got to let's get this next part here all right so we got this uh quote here i have an expectations i love this and if god's words and if god's word's no good then he's no good he's no better than his word and he'll he'll say this that god keeps every word that he said in every promise that he said and if you'll take the right i love this if you take the right mental attitude toward any divine promise god ever made he will bring it to pass if you can just take the right attitude and believe it with all your heart amen if you've got that right men it i love how he says this because he says the right mental attitude amen i was just so astounded we we almost we almost take away in some ways the what god can use through our humanness amen what he can use through our mental attitude amen it's like he he uses that for for his potential amen hallelujah thank you god so see you coming with that the next one the the individual it starts it's it's it isn't that you have to to have somebody to to lay hands on you with a certain sensation as i said before and my there's no many there's so many sensations today it couldn't be right by god's words but god's words still write see it's all right the sensation i have i don't know nothing about them but i do know that the word of god is right so therefore when god says anything it must ever remain that way and that's the way i believe it i've studied it and history and what he said and what take place and through the ages the church ages and so forth and see it just dovetailed together until i'm sad still i'm satisfied that he's god and every word is true and he keeps his word with his people aren't you glad he keeps his word with his people alleluia thank you god amen his word never fails amen it's the anchor amen amen it's the anchor in the storm amen hallelujah it keeps things together when the winds are blowing amen in life when you're in a certain situation i don't know what you're going through tonight but if you're in a certain situation it might be just this little battle it might be this little battle right here amen it doesn't have to be some crazy thing it might be just something maybe someone you're praying for and man a certain situation maybe a loved one's gone or something like that but that anchor amen it holds amen thank you lord amen that's what i want to get to is the faith amen the expectation that's why i love people talk about i'm talking about expectation and people kind of sometimes are scared of the word hope sometimes they're like oh hope that's just like you're hoping something right like it's just up in the air like i hope this happens but really faith is connected with hope hope is i believe the expectation along with the faith amen amen so and if god's word let's see i got okay so now we're getting to abraham i love the story abraham believed and expected for 25 years this is a long time he expected amen 25 years don't be weary and well doing people amen he has something in his heart he had a promise amen he held he staggered not the promise amen faith is not a shot in the dark i love this faith is not a shot in the dark amen it's not something that you let's let's take that right now so you you're shooting at something it's not like you're you ain't got a scope or you're you know you're shooting at nothing right it's not like you're saying oh lord i believe for my healing but you know i hope you know i guess you know i wish it would happen or something it's not like this hope or this uh i'm saying hope which i just said but you know what i mean it's not this like fluffy thing right it's it's uh it's sure so you you it's the it's the sight amen and then faith faith is not a shot in the dark faith is sure amen it's based on the word of god if we have this promise amen it's it's gonna come through amen praise the lord thank you god faith is not a shock shot in the dark i used to pray amen i used to pray for the holy ghost at camps this is kind of what i said before i guess i'll move on see sometimes i write notes and then i'm like i already said this so just bear with me tonight though amen thank you lord amen scripture says face faith is the substance of things hoped for or expected for the evidence of things not seen amen brother i want to come to get uh get to a few things tonight just about what things can maybe hinder your expectation of what god's doing in the church or what god's maybe he's uh he's dealing in your life what can hinder you um during that process of expectation right so i have just a few things here and i love actually what spark kind of this thought was brother barry last this sunday i was there and in whom in human nature sometimes we laugh and can and sound so wise with our worldly wisdom that what we make that what may sound good to others might be backed by fear right i thought this was amazing just because this we we have this this goal this prize in in in front of our eyes but we have obviously so many voices around us telling us what's right and wrong and i know this for a fact with nursing i really had to say lord i know there's a lot of good things in this medical field that can do good but i have to realize that god he's the answer he's the healer amen i have to realize that all this worldly wisdom honestly a lot of it is based by fear amen it's like we've got to protect you know how it is in this coven amen it's all backed by fear there's this fear involved amen that's right that's something that can hold you back from your true expectation of what your promise is amen amen thank you lord amen so a couple of other factors that may cloud or affect and then there's other things that may enhance your expectations right past experiences may affect your expectations what you've been through in the past your friendships it can go either or amen the people that you hang around is going to affect what you say what you what you do amen that can affect your expectations i mean man your faith it can affect i mean if you if you're around a group of friends and i i know this um just based on who you hang around and you want you know you want to be friendly and you want to you know adapt to the company you're in sometimes but at the same time know who you're around amen know know who's going to lift you up amen and encourage you in the faith amen sometimes sometimes you have people you know even bring you down sometimes like they want your empathy or your sympathy um about like a certain issue they're going through and it's like you know no you want my faith you know you want you know what so so be you know look for those people to be around that will encourage you and be there not blowing away the other people because we're supposed to be the light of the world amen amen but at the same time the people that encourage you and the faith amen praise the lord amen family can be family even can be a hindrance to towards your expectations amen the the people that love you so much amen sometimes you know even some mothers will they'll be so involved with you know let's say essential oils or something like that that they get so you know involved with that they that's their first thing they go to amen and let's say let's say you got healing or or something else or they got they got a pill for that or something like that um and not that we you know knock those things off because i am in nursing believe me i believe that these things aid in those those processes right but i i'm getting back to the fact what is our what is our foundation where are we looking amen for our source of strength our source of healing amen it's jesus christ you believe that hallelujah thank you god amen so then we have uh just distractions as i said before your phone that can i mean i know for me that has this this phone amen this is this is a hindrance amen how many can agree to that amen everyone i know that i know i know that's a fact for all of us amen it's it clow it almost clouds your your point of view with where you know where you're going with christ even amen and where he wants you to be even too you know and it may just be innocent stuff on there but it actually can cloud cloud your you know cloud where you're going amen amen um entertainment can do it as well things we feed on really things we feed on amen that can cloud our expectations feeling numb or stagnant may hold you back look to the word the promise amen so now i want to get into this date this story of david and i'm kind of clouding around my first um thought here which let me look at my time here okay we're doing right see i'm too worried about not go you know taking enough time now this is not good all right so um i know you guys support me so that's all right amen so let's uh let's take the story of david so you got david so he's uh i love the story of david because you have this you have this little scrawny kind of red-headed pretty looking kind of a almost you got him like you know he he plays music he's kind of like you know i don't want to use this term it's probably a modern term but he probably would be considered a fruity kind of guy right that's what that's what the term today is you know he would probably and probably to his brothers he he was to this right his brothers probably looked at him and he was like they were just like david oh my goodness this guy's a wacko he's just weird he's out there herding sheep and he's you know he's playing these music trying to serenade the sheep i guess i don't know what he's doing right so i love the story of dave just because you see the simplicity of who god uses amen amen so david i love the story i'm going kind of leading towards the story of you know the giant in your life right so david um david he he comes to the battle and he he kind of he hears what's kind of what's going on right he hears what this philistine's saying and he's he's he's he's basically you know going opposite of what the giants say is like no this is not gonna happen you know it was funny because his brother actually let me see if i got this yeah his brother david's brother seemed embarrassed of him as far as i read in the scripture he actually got embarrassed he actually got angry at his brother for talking like this like for for speaking victory right he's like this is embarrassing i don't want you around right and we're sometimes even for us we can have this whole battle going on in our minds with with our expectations of what god's gonna do we have a little you know voices in our ear that's like you know this is crazy this is this is not this is dumb you know with our human nature we always have these voices coming in that are just like you know this sounds crazy what you're talking about how are we going to take this giant you know it's probably some of the soldiers over there you know they see david and they're just like like david like they're they're probably laughing at them they're honestly are they're probably laughing at them and you know with the with the worldly wisdom some days you can almost laugh at the word right you can laugh at some of the things that say in here and i've been there i've been like how is this how is this even possible but then you got to realize i've got something in me that says no that's the truth amen amen hallelujah so david so you got this the story of david here um you got david going and meeting his giant he takes five smooth stones and i love what the song says even michael belton's song i wanted to i wanted to just you know say it but he said he picked up stones from the river knowing that our god will deliver he had already that expectation going into the battle going into the valley because you see this they're both on top he's going into his valley knowing that his god will deliver amen hallelujah do you believe he's going to deliver amen every single time this world word delivers amen praise the lord amen we've got joshua and caleb and this is kind of the thought brother barry was bringing as well but joshua and caleb you see another giant you know you see the giants they're kind of looking they're kind of looking and you know they're scouting out right and this is kind of the thought where you know the other besides joshua and caleb you've got these other people that are they're they're kind of sounding wise and their own into like they're kind of saying why don't we just why don't we just uh wait till the giants die or something and then we'll go take it right why don't we just do that but that was backed by fear like i was saying earlier it's backed by fear not by faith but what is joshua and caleb saying we are more than able to take the land hallelujah they had a promise amen they take that promise this is your promise now take that promise and believe it amen with all your heart amen praise the lord amen and don't neglect i love this don't neglect the little battles god gives you amen sometimes like i i'm being vulnerable with you this morning but um you know this morning i guess it's a victory too so i can testify this morning but something very simple um unless i have to take me back but anyways one of my clients their niece i believe or their granddaughter gave me a brownie all right gave me a brownie and a lot of times for me and clients when they give food to me i'm like no all right i'm not gonna use i'm not going to do this because it's just you don't know all right you don't know all right i've seen a lot so you don't know but anyways she gave it to me and i was like i just want to be nice i was like yeah i'll take it and then you know i get home and i think dad looks at her something like that and i was like he was asking me about i was like you know i don't really trust some of these clients when they give me when they give me like you know food or whatever so i uh you know i tell them just throw it away or i throw it away or something like that so then the next day i go into the client's house actually this morning so i go to the client's house and i'm like lord please don't let this girl don't let this girl ask me about this this morning or else i'm gonna be i'm gonna be up a creek right so anyways i go in there first thing she says first thing she says is like how do you like my brownie and so i you know i said well i haven't ate it i haven't ate it quite yet right right and so i go into hit you know the client's room fix them up you know clean them up i'm not gonna get in the detail with that um but so i uh i go back in there and you know the whole time you know while i'm cleaning cleaning the guy up and helping them out i you know i realized that you know that was that wasn't the full truth you know that wasn't i mean i don't know what it was within me and even while i'm working i'm messing up i'm doing because i like my my whole minds on that i'm just like and you know i guess as a as a you know young minister too you want to be you want to be very uh how do i say this sensitive to what god's doing in your life and be sensitive of what he's uh accomplishing in your life so you want to be sensitive to that and if if anything comes in between that or hinders you know something even tonight where i'm speaking to you i don't want earlier in the day to affect that or you know come in between that so that's what i'm going through you know in my mind i'm just like lord i think we need honestly i think we need more people like that you know being more sensitive to what being more sensitive what god's doing in your life and men not neglecting the little battles that he's given you amen not neglecting what the little things maybe maybe it's a maybe just just saying sorry to your child maybe you've got the something where you're you know you're talking to your child and you know you just brush them off or something like that you know you got something um going on you're too busy or something but maybe it's just maybe it's something some simple like that but don't neglect those little times or slack off when you can you can come in like that and you can you know be sensitive and say you know i'm sorry about that honey you know don't don't neglect those little battles god give you because that's what he wants to perfect you with amen he's he's perfecting you with the gold so why why i think that all these big things are going to make you this it's it's the detail he's getting into the details of your life amen and so that's just that's something free that you know god was doing with me this morning so i hope it blessed you but i love another quote brother barry said this weekend was your giants become smaller when you look at them through the promise amen amen if you're looking at your giants through that promise amen oh my goodness hallelujah thank you god praise the lord if you're looking at it through the promise amen this is your this is your filter this is what i'm looking through amen now all those giants they go down amen praise the lord amen it's by the word i love what brother boaz was talking about last week amen in the in the word how it's it's it's not the power that he spoke it's not the power that he used but it was the word of god that he used amen taking the taking the enemy i love that boy i was taking the enemy to the right battleground amen amen hallelujah isn't this word and the ministry just amazing right now how many been blessed i mean i've been blessed probably my whole life but god's good isn't he [Applause] thank you lord thank you lord amen i want to kind of bring it down to earth to uh sister in louisiana for i think it was a pruitt girl but she had a little testimony i'm sure a lot of you know it but um she had alopecia alopecia that uh you know hair condition that you know kind of your hair falls out in chunks you know so uh going to get prayer with those bobby pins oh yes she she goes to the prayer line with those bobby pins in her hand right she said i'm going to be wearing these amen bring your sacrifice amen your works will tell where your faith is amen you believe that amen take action whenever you're facing any battle you are take action do things do things that that make you think this is what i'm going for amen amen do things that will that will keep you on track amen you sometimes you gotta you gotta get creative with it but do things in order to say god it might be it might be healing let's say it's healing but just like this this sister here it might be healing so you you you take it and you you do not shy away you do not have any doubt on your profession you keep believing that with all your heart amen amen you believe for your lost family members as well just as you believe for your lost soul job offered a sacrifice for his family you offer one for yours amen that same thing it's it all has to do with your faith amen god's placing this faith he's giving you a choice amen he's giving you that choice of like what are you gonna do with that faith amen what are you going to do with what i've given you what are you going to do with this word he's giving you back he's saying how can oh my how can how can he i'm trying to get my words i guess i'm getting to i know where it's in my notes but i'll get to it so um back to the original scripture so this is where i'm coming to back to the original scripture where you've got this this lame man and he's he's in there he's at the i love how it's called uh gate beautiful amen this is just i don't know why it's named that but it's gate beautiful to see this miracle go on with uh john and john and peter and it's called gate beautiful because i believe god looks at your faith and he thinks that it's beautiful amen he looks at your your desires your real desires in your heart and he thinks that is just beautiful amen hallelujah just like i mean just like the the blood issue woman you know she it took virtue out of the lord amen there's something in him that struck amen praise the lord amen i i've never talked about this really before but we'll just let go um you wonder how even that with that instance you've got the blood issue you know a lot of times people you know a lot of times that comes to the heart you know that's that's where the heart starts you know that's where the blood comes from amen and you can even see nowadays i've noticed this um just you know since starting nursing but what's what's the main cause of disease this year does anyone know or does the main cause of disease um probably in the past 10 years what is it it's heart disease right or what's a cause of death i guess what i'm saying it's heart disease it's heart trouble amen i believe that natural types of spiritual people are struggling with their the working of their heart their heart is getting hard amen they're probably getting you know a spiritual heart a spiritual heart attack spiritual heart disease that's a process amen it's the things you eat it's a it's a lot of different things that affects this heart amen so um i guess give it to god he'll he'll make it he'll make it a heart of flesh amen you believe that tonight that was just something extra too um that god's been laying on my heart but you know you can't help but share something sometimes you know just like just there on the fly but there it is um so back to the original scripture here i come um first he asked for money which i already said before um he asked for money and that's where kind of his expectations was the whole time you know he's he's expecting money from all these people he's in that temple right so then you have i love the scripture amen who's seeing peter and john about to go into the temple ask in alms so he's asking for money initially right and peter fastens his eyes upon him with john right and says look on us he says look on us amen he says and i love this and he gave heed so now he he he's he's catching what's going on he probably this layman probably heard what's going on a couple scriptures behind knowing what's happening in this type of people amen couple scriptures before it even talks about the miracles that's going on within this group of people this book of acts church amen he's seeing what's going on so he probably is hearing this and he's like whoa now i'm seeing he says look on us look who we are amen and i love to see the authority as well dad's been talking about authority the authority peter and john have during this he says you know he says look on us he says he gave heed unto them now he's listening he that hath an near to hear let him hear amen amen faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god amen who's seeing and he gave heat unto them and now what happens his expectation his expectation has changed amen his expectation to receive something from them he probably didn't even know what he was going to receive right he's probably sitting there he probably he probably knew something was going to happen right he probably heard something like this is this is the people that have been have speaking in authority they they know who they are right and they they uh and then peter says obviously he he says silver and gold have i none but such as i have i have give iv in the name of jesus christ there's no other name amen that's more powerful than his name it's in his name that there's power amen praise the lord of nazareth rise up and walk he's speaking amen to the sky but this guy he had an expectation amen his expectation changed right then and there he's like wow this is this is it this is it could you imagine i mean just just bear with me here how much how much you can affect people's expectations as well how much how how much that can that can affect the people i mean you wonder why people just in the world come to you sometimes and they ask could you pray for this why because they may they probably know that something's gonna happen amen could you imagine that someone someone can actually their expectations can change based on your faith amen and your profession amen i mean they may see they may hear of a testimony i don't even know maybe on facebook and something like that that's like is this really true is this is this the god you serve amen and you know now you've struck an expectation amen can you imagine that hallelujah thank you god praise the lord it actually ignites you are a wildfire a man you are a fire and what does that fire do i remember someone saying this one time i believe it was zach carter if you guys remember him but he he's a good friend of ours and he's he actually says we were at one uh campfire and he says that a fire i may have mentioned this before but a fire actually creates its own atmosphere around it amen and i was just astounded by this i was like lord let that be me amen let that faith let that let that virtue let that those things be expressed that christ to be expressed through me where where i can be willing enough to to come to them and and have faith with them amen praise the lord amen we have we have that kind of power through jesus amen amen it's not not by eye not but not through me but but through him amen it's the christ in me just as david it's the christ within me greater is he that is in me amen praise the lord amen we'll go to uh let's see i got a few more points here where's my time i'm doing pretty good amen i'm probably just overthinking the whole time thing that's what i'm doing um so back to let's see so i got another quote from expectations it's just a small small little sentence here and he said every man that ever believed in god or heard god's voice expected him to do something it's just that simple phrase see you're you're you're caught in this place every every man that believed in god or heard is god's voice expecting him to do something you see this lame man so you heard his voice amen you heard his voice he's expecting to sit that's that could be the same situation as you tonight amen you you need sometimes you need an expectation change amen you need something something happened in your life that that may be troubling you the winds are blowing the storms storms are blowing but you need you need an expectation change and what what is where does that come i believe it comes by the word of god it comes from the word hearing that word amen the more we're in that word oh my the more the more we expect even more of god amen amen and his his expectations don't have any limit amen his word doesn't have any limit amen so expect i love what brother dixon was saying too i guess i'm just bringing all the sermons together that i've heard but brother diggs expect big things from god amen he's a big god he'll only he'll only be that big if you let him amen if you give him control in your life so let him have his way hallelujah praise the lord amen so he knew he was dealing with something different now he may have gone to his family for comfort before money for comfort worldly pleasures to give him some relief but now he recognizes that these men have something different maybe god is waiting for our expectations to change so we can really see what faith in god can do amen you wonder why people out there okay so that's what i see that happened again no one should not only should we have expectation aligned with the word but in right okay not only should we have our expectations lined with the word but in the right channel with god that our faith could be a tool in the process of someone's life or someone else's soul so yeah i've said these things so but if you so this is a few more quotes here but if you come tonight expecting just say lord i come to see you i come to to benefit of you to be healed i come for the benefit of my soul well i expect you to give give it to me because i'm here in this place that's dedicated to you to you and your glory and you'll just you'll get just what you expect that's right you always and you can never go above your expectations you'll always have to do that amen so with god i believe these expectations come to a different battleground i guess you want to say it these expectations because even having some meetings in brother branham's meetings you have people coming as critics amen and even for my testimony i i even i have even been there you know as a critic you know you come at the expectation of a critic you know but but why do that amen when we know we've seen god do it time and time again we know he's coming through for so many situations we see his word we can come we can look through any line in scripture and see these people believed amen amen these people believed we can see in brother's brain all you know all of his tapes you see just the faith that goes along with it i remember grandpa telling me actually one time one of his first sermons was crazy faith that was his title of one of his sermons faith is crazy amen to this world it is crazy thing amen so i mean i was just encouraged by that because at that even at that point in time there probably was you know this expectation even during the healing revivals and all that but their faith was so high i see i hear that from older people so much that their faith and what god can do was just so high it was at such a high place because what is it what is what does healing do a lot of a lot of it was divine healing what does healing do it's it's the it's the bait amen that's all it is the bait right to bring these fish in amen so let that not be the focus healing is a part of this you know god's kingdom it's a part of that let that not be the focus but at the same time don't don't forget the small battles god god's gonna heal you amen based on the word praise the lord amen now you now you want to have an expectation all the way from your heart soul body and mind that that god is going to give us a great outpouring of the holy spirit now i i feel that that it's it's near us and god is willing to give it to us amen he surely will amen if you come expecting some sometimes even for a service you know so i don't for me i mean we can talk about a service so much the real battle i believe is out there right real bad but you know a lot of times you bring it in right where we are amen for a service but come expecting come expecting your service amen as a song leader i'd love it if you come expecting more amen come expecting right off the bat amen it was one of these service a couple weeks ago where i i i come up here and i felt like i was already you know singing for like an hour you know and but there it seemed like there was just this high expectation amen but i mean it was just you know something come with expectations every every time you come in contact with this word whether you're reading a message whether you're listening to our pastor come with expectation right come with the expectation come with a question amen amen he sure surely he he will meet the expectation and do exceeding abundant amen praise the lord amen our god never fails i mean he's a mighty god you believe that tonight he's a mighty god he never fails praise the lord we have something where we can place our expectations amen amen thank you lord when god is involved you get what you expect he actually puts the choice back on the believer amen what are you going to do with this word as i was saying what are you going to do with it take it take it and eat it amen praise the lord let that word become you amen praise the lord god will be as big as you let him be in your life this is what makes him lord when we accept and receive his blessing that's what we need to do accept and receive it amen yeah i remember brother i was just thinking this before but brother junior woosley when i was a little uh you know byc camp was such an awesome picture he uh he brought out probably about 20 bill you know all like us kids and you're kind of holding it out there and he's just you know he's sitting there he's like who wants this who wants it you know who who who really wants it and you got all these kids and even me and i you know what i was doing mom i was doing my puppy dog guys do you remember my puppy dog guys it was killer i'm just gonna say when i was when i was a kid those puppy dog guys and they it made all the mothers cry okay anyway i was trying that with brother junior woozley he probably couldn't even see me but all the kids just going i want it i want i want it i want it he said and then you got this one kid comes up he goes over and takes it that's a good picture isn't it you have to receive that amen you've got to receive your blessing whatever it is amen as simple as this is tonight amen this is this is powerful stuff amen amen your faith and what how god sees your faith that's beautiful amen amen go on and take your blessing go on and take that holy ghost amen his word said it amen i believe it that's it amen praise the lord it's healing it's healing it's it's uh it's depression whatever you're going through tonight depression anxiety i know at this time anxiety that can happen like that amen it can it can rise up so quick i mean i know there's people at home even tonight you know uh you know going going through depression or going through sickness i know there's a couple families out but but go go on and take take what god has given to you and don't be shaken don't be shaken don't you doubt amen god's gonna come through amen he will make a way amen praise the lord he said it his word says it this this is the truth this is the truth amen praise the lord so what will you do with the word amen that's what he asked his word lays dormant without vessels to hold and express him amen so his word really without us it's dormant amen how how can how can uh see um where was i getting to how can a tree grow without water or you know how can i guess what i'm saying is how can a i see grow i'm trying to get my thoughts together here how can this is what makes the lord um so the word lays dormant without uh vessels to use it so you know god has a spirit flowing you know god's poured out his spirit amen in the last days here right he's poured out his spirit but how can you know how can his his spirit you know do anything without vessels amen amen so you're a vessel tonight amen let go and let god have his way praise the lord amen how can a tree grow without water um get in the okay so yeah how can a tree grow without water or the sun how can its roots go deeper without the winds moving to the tree to loosen the soil i love this thought of revival see it's a revival and the christian walk it's revival after a vile revival it's it's a daily dying dying to self dying it's a renewing after renewing amen don't think that one experience is going to do this for you amen it's experience after experience after experience amen amen so don't don't uh this flesh like i was saying earlier in the in the sermon i was talking about just how distractions and everything can get you away from that expectation amen but but always seek for that renewing that refreshing in his holy spirit amen and that comes a lot of times with being involved in your church you know people can people christ uses people amen god uses people he uses people to encourage you so don't neglect the fellowship either here amen don't neglect the fellowship there could be a word spoken out there in that fellowship hall that you may need some sunday i don't know what this you know you may get a few things in this sermon but people of god and fellowship my that has done wonders in my life amen let the people come together when we're all in one accord i'll give you some homework just look at the first few chapters of the book of acts and see how the book of acts church operates amen see how they're working together is a beautiful picture of just what they're doing they're all in one accord they're all in one mind amen i mean i i couldn't say that they they all you know specifically you know we're fond of all of one another you know they may they may have had their issues too but all i'm saying is that they had one purpose one mind they had one expectation amen amen they wanted to see the holy spirit move amen they had a commission they said i love that song and hopefully we can see it sing it soon nessa and gabi uh go tell the world about me that's what god's saying go tell the world about me amen go see go see what what he can do amen hallelujah thank you lord so god expects himself so this is kind of turn this around i'll just end on this tonight yeah wow i can't believe that i've gone in almost an hour that's crazy [Music] all right back to it just a few more lines that god was giving me um you know just to end it but i kind of turned it around you know we have expectations but what does god expect of us amen what does what does he see when he sees that seed amen what does he see i believe he sees himself he's actually looking at that seed he's seeing himself amen god expects himself to be expressed through you because his seed his nature his character in you that seed in in you who started oh yes you started a good work he's faithful to finish it amen wherever that work has started you may you may feel like you're you know the worst christian there is but he who started a good work in you he is faithful to finish it amen wherever you may be tonight amen just just just keep walking keep moving forward amen don't turn back amen praise the lord speak and go forward right right dad speak and go forward hallelujah so someone said i love this too someone said one time that they're worried about missing the rapture um you know and you got people all the time i know i i you know you sometimes you just go through that that mental warfare of just you know god am i really going to make it you know you're worried you're worried if you're bright or not or you're worried about that and you've got that constant battle sometimes and my i guess my someone said one time i loved it it was just just be in christ if you're in christ he won't forsake his own amen just be in him amen amen if you're in christ if if that blood's applied amen if that token's applied in your life amen amen he he sure you're a part of him now amen praise the lord amen so you have if you're a part of him then he can't leave you be so in tune with his program that your program gets lost in his amen stay resting with the word and ex and expect his character to be expressed through you be flexible to the program and i love this and choose life amen choose life amen this is life amen man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of my mouth amen praise the lord let's all stand tonight amen what's the musicians would come i mean maybe tonight i don't know where you are i don't even know you know obviously i can't you know discern discern hearts you know myself or anything like that i don't i don't know what you're going through but maybe tonight there you know you were corrected on some things and you say to yourself god maybe i i've been off track with my expectations you know my expectations of you and you know i i maybe god i put you in a box sometimes maybe i i limit your capability lord and maybe maybe tonight why don't we just worship a little bit and express your heart to him tonight give him yourself i mean i love after service worship amen this is where we can just dwell on the words that we're given and say lord i want you amen amen i want these words to be lived in me i want it to be expressed through me amen praise the lord amen amen [Music] lord [Music] oh [Music] please
