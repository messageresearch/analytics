========================================

bibles to first for samuel 17. familiar scripture reading but when brother brother paul had just spoke to me about coming here i think it was maybe back in january or somewhere when i was looking there and just as just getting off the phone and the lord just seemed to just drop just dropped this thought and it's just been been building so i want to just just take here in first samuel 17 and this is here where david there is coming into a face-off where goliath has is coming to against the the israel or the army of israel and here in verse 20 if we can start and read there the bible said david rose up early in the morning and left the sheep with the keeper and took and went as jesse had commanded him and he came to the trench as the host was going forth to the fight and he shouted for the battle for israel and the philistines had put the battle in a ray army against army and david left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the carriage and ran into the army and came and saluted his brethren and as he talked with them behold there came up the champion the philistine of gath goliath by name out of the armies of the philistines and spake according to the same words and david heard them and all the men of israel when they saw the man fled from him and were sore afraid and the men of israel said have you seen this man that has come up surely to defy israel as he come up and it shall be that the man who killeth him the king will enrich him with great riches and will give him his daughter and make his father's house free in israel it's amazing they knew the promises that was made in the made in order to remove this man who's defying the armies but they lacked the courage to obtain those promises and david spake to the men and stood by him that stood by him saying what shall be done to the man that killeth this philistine and taketh away the reproach from israel for who is this uncircumcised philistine that he should defy the armies of the living god the people answered him after this manner saying so shall it be done to the man that killeth him and then verse 28 it speaks how his brother they heard when he spake unto the men and alab's anger was was kindled against david and said why came us down hither and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness i know thy pride and the naughtiness of thine heart for thou art come down that thou mighty see the battle and david said what have i now done is there not a cause and he turned from him toward another and spake after the same manner and the people answered him again after the former manner may god bless the reading of the word as you're being seated tonight i'd like to just speak on a on a little thought take just a few moments and speak on the thought of run to the battle run to the battle when we look on a little further here in the same same chapter that we are reading here and we see this this engagement that has taken place we find that how that here the men they they bring they bring david to saul and saul begins to ask ask of david concerning what he said and david just quickly speaks out let no man's heart fear don't let it fail him because thy servant will go and fight this philistine they they needed courage and you know when you when you look at this they they were the the covenant people of god but they had they had gotten away from that reality of the living god and they needed courage and you know many times when we look at just you think of the word itself encouragement you know there's an awful big word stuck in the middle there courage and there's sometimes in order for that courage there needs to be some right encouragement and so here when as they come back in here saul begins to evaluate and look at david and he begins to just look at what he sees on the outside you're you know you're nothing but a youth and and this philistine he's uh you know you're no match for him but you see remember how saul was chosen saul was not chosen by by a substance of what was in him saul was chosen based on stature and so here saul was only reflecting of what he himself had had went by and been chosen by by what what could be seen on the outside but you see god doesn't choose a man based on his abilities if god would have had a man let's say if david would have been a man that was just as tall as saul or even taller it would have not highlighted who was back in the camp but god specializes in choosing a man choosing people who are not qualified for what god is calling them to do but when god makes a promise god has therefore he has subjects in mind that he is going to bring to himself and that god will fulfill that promise through his life you've heard it said before god does not call call the qualified but he calls those who are unqualified but he qualifies them with himself and to find that how that god you know david would just kind of begin to rehearse here in the presence of saul and and begin to speak about you know the testimony that had been upon his life and and david you know as he speaks about this he speaks of how that when he was you know watching the sheep and here was a lion that had come in and a bear had come in and and david speaks of how it was right out of the mouth of those lion right out of the mouth of the bear that he went and he took that you know it wasn't that the lamb itself was was out there running around in the line where bear was after it but it was actually in the mouth of that predator but david was at a place oh my david was testifying that he says nobody can say it's over or it's finished or you've passed beyond redemption god can come right down and he'll snatch you right out of the mouth of the lion he'll snatch you right out of the mouth of the bear there might be situations and things that can be present in a life that you can look at and say i don't know how i'm going to get through this but it's not beyond god there is nothing impossible with god and that's what david was testifying where others would have said hey it's already in the mouth let it go you know how people want to say hey it's already passed just let it go but david what was this this was more than the natural genetics of a man this was a pulsation of almighty god that even when the fall took place in eden god himself didn't throw in the towel he came down and said i will make a way back hallelujah and here there's a testimony that david is ushering in at that time he said who is this uncircumcised philistine he recognized the weakness where the rest of them were all caught up and they were talking about his size and his stature and where everything was but david looked at the vulnerability he's an uncircumcised philistine and he's defying the armies of the living god let me just say this david was a body ministry man david was looking at it if god did it for a lamb god will do it for the whole body david was identifying he's god of the entire church he's god of the entire body he's not just god in the pulpit he's god in the kitchen he's god in the factory worker he's god and mama he's god and daddy he was identifying that god is the same god oh my you see david he had an experience and a testimony that he could say the lord what god did there god will do the same thing here time doesn't take away from that situations don't take away from that i don't care what viruses come it doesn't change i'm still the lord that healeth all thy diseases we're not we don't act arrogant about it we don't pretend that it ain't there because that ain't faith but faith says yes it's here but god is greater so david wasn't ignoring the circumstances the circumstances were there but he was letting them know that god is greater than the circumstances david had an experience with god that he was relying on you see david knew he knew he was blessed of god before he was ever anointed david had he had this confidence the god's love to him it was real to him think of how god would let him know that that i brought you from the sheep coat god would let him know where he brought him from you know where god brought you from you didn't bring yourself i didn't bring myself god brought you god drew you or you might have been sitting on a church pill but it had to be the living god to draw your heart and begin to stir it and stimulate it and draw it to himself this is why when the scriptures we speak of this of a real positive experience and a sheer testimony this is why paul would express to examine ourselves whether we be in the faith to prove ourselves it's to examine with everything that we face in life even with the situation that arose last year you recognize that we appreciate doctrines but doctrines don't give you safety there's one place of safety and that's in him that's our anchor that's our stabilizer that's our whole that's what gives us vision beyond these circumstances david was able to draw from this and i think of the time that we're living in you know brother branham would say it he would say it in this manner he would say you better get into christ and get sure in your heart right now because there's a time coming where you're really going to need it there's a time to know that you know that you know that you know where you're standing it's not just in moments of crisis it's even in decisions of life that you have before you you have to know where you're standing and to know that god is on my side [Music] here was the spirit we think of this run to the battle you know paul said it like this paul said if the trumpet give an uncertain sound who shall prepare himself to the battle and you know all around us the things that we are witness and we see even what has compiled with even in this past year we've seen we've seen how god how that even in his word where we're standing we we see that even where jesus we we see the things taking place around us and jesus would say when you begin to see these things taking place lift up your head your redemption draws nigh we know these are things in the word that's promised to come about men's hearts would be failing for fear we see these things we see even how god we recognize in this generation how god would come down in this generation and would veil himself in his word how god would speak through his prophet and god would declare his promises and god would make that word real to you and i he would vindicate it to his children that's where we would draw comfort from in this hour we would draw encouragement from that it would stabilize you and i there's a lot of uncertainty in the world there's a lot of things in the world as brother brown would say so many voices and i tell you what in this hour that we're living in there's all kinds of voices but let me just say this for every voice that's out there god has given the bride of jesus christ a word filter there's one voice that we're to be locked in on and that's the voice of the holy ghost and the voice of the holy spirit will discern every devil it'll keep you from traps and getting sucked in to the things of this life and keep us lined up and ready and looking to the coming of the lord it's a certain voice it gives us stability it gives us strength because it's been a certain sound brandon would say it you know like this when we look at it he says there's only one certain sound that's the gospel prepare for the battle what battle the coming of the lord prepare yourself for battle now against evil when evil is besetting the people on every hand everything going wrong home life going wrong you in failing nations breaking atomic bombs around home splitting up motherhood going low immorals among the people distrust amongst one another denominations fussing and stewing what what what you want to do be certain prepare yourself for the battle if there's ever a time in an hour to be prepared for the battle it's right now we're not coming to a battle we're in a battle i tell you every every demon out of hell has been released it's right here moving and trying to approach in those same ecclesiastical spirits that were bound there at the river euphrates they've been released but that's not the end of the story the very first very first word in revelations 10 and i saw another mighty angel that's what i want to focus on that's what i'm counting on right there hear god vindicating his word vindicating his word by his presence in our midst it's a sound that sounds out in our heart you know you can set and sit right in in it right next to somebody else and somebody else it just goes right by them but there's something to you it's different there's a sound to it it's just as though that it's just you and god right in this building you're hearing straight as god is just speaking to your life god is unfolding the things of your life and he's ministering so personally to your life let me just tell you something if you want to know let me tell you a young person if you want to know whether god cares about you or not look how god comes right to your pew he comes right to your seat and he deals with your life listen don't don't hide your head in shame just look to the lord and say god you're expressing your love what do i do surrender to his voice he's letting you know he loves you he cares about you this is why when jesus says he could say my sheep they hear my voice they know me and they follow me hallelujah you see in this hour forgive me but i'm just going to just kind of be myself if that's all right you see they there's a need and you can find that here israel they're in a state of defeat and we look at it that they're holding to well we still believe in god and do you believe that god is the same well yeah we believe that god's the same but do it so what's what is ironic is that how a person can say we believe that god is the same but they don't want him to be the same god he's the same god of his word his nature he's never changed what he did before he still does tonight he's never changed one bit but you see it's not a god of theology he is the living god of his word that he comes and he confirms that word in our midst he reveals himself to be the same god to be the living god and that's what calms and gives strength to us as believers that's what encourages your eye is when he comes and he begins to take that word and begins to speak to our hearts that's what the church of the living god that's what we look to because that's what's really positive that's what's really certain but you think of that we we think here in in the scripture that we're very familiar with of hebrews 13 8 jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever i think the greatest thing we can do is just welcome him and say god you be god lord jesus be the same one right here do the same thing lord in my life same thing in my home same thing in my church be the same god lord jesus when here as we look at this of the certainty of the word you know jesus said heaven and earth will pass away but my words will not pass away i think of like the uh the the the black brother brother branham would refer to on that scripture he said the brother had said i would rather be standing on the word than on the world i'd rather be standing on the word than in heaven because the scripture has said heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never fail amen is that right so there's there's an assurance upon that word and here even in isaiah said the grass withereth the flower fadeth but the word of our god shall stand forever hallelujah numbers 23 god is not a man that he should lie neither the son of man that he should repent hath he said and shall not he do it hath he spoken shall not he make good behold i have received commandment to bless and he hath blessed and i cannot reverse it david would say the testimony of the lord is sure the law of the lord is perfect converting the soul he would go on to say my covenant will i not break nor alter the thing that's gone out of my mouth solomon would utter every word of god is pure you see it's one thing as we can look at those promises god has given us his word when god gives his word that's god obligating himself it's god obligating himself the promise to every generation of promises here in his word god is obligating himself to his word and he out how the god when he speaks that word god will provide everything that's needed for you and i to come into that place to where the word and us are not two separate things but where the word and us become the same thing so the word itself it now moves from a letter till it becomes open it becomes an entrance way for you and i this is how we come to this in running to the battle coming to a place where as we're standing on god's word god's always had this preparation and the word the word is the very weapon that god has given his children to face the enemy to defend his attacks and to conquer him we're not just to be defending off his attacks we've got the sword there's times where we do have to defend off the tax but let's make sure that we're also standing there and reminding him he is a defeated foe it doesn't matter how we feel doesn't matter what we're going through you may not even be able to get the words out of here but you can say it from right here satan i don't care you're still defeated hallelujah amen goliath's attack on the army of the living god it was an attack on the word of god david was standing there you see david here he is standing in a place and david is standing upon the word he he already knew he was blessed before he was ever anointed but now here he is standing here within the word and david just simply believed and he knew god was the same god you didn't have to tell david hey god is the same god that parted the red sea he knew god was the same god that's what david was a witness of it was not historical facts it wasn't quotes to david david knew that god was the same god he knew what god had promised in his word and he's acting upon those promises god had told the people in that time if you will obey my voice i will be an adversary to your adversaries i'll be an enemy to your enemies i'll tell you that's somebody you want on your side we want him on our side but remember if we obey his voice god will only back up his word is that right you see even where god would speak through moses and he would speak and remind the children of israel that even when you're looking at a situation as he would say and and you're frightened at it but i want you to remember the lord god is among you almighty god and terrible he would he would david with these no doubt would be promises that david is drawing from he's rehearsing and how david would stand there and recall within his heart and within his mind god had said there shall be no man stand before you you see david standing there as god had spoke that there through moses david realizes this pertains to me as well what god said there i'm standing in the land and there shall not be any man that would stand before god's children god had told joshua the same thing and here we find that how that david standing here in the midst of this time you know to stand it means to present oneself to present as though to stand before here's an opposition that's coming before that of israel but you remember that israel when they came in the land there was a situation that arose where a man by the name of aiken he took a wedge of gold and a babylonious garment and when that came in and he hid that in his tent and when that was hidden in the tent you find among israel at that time that even though the rest of israel didn't know what was going on but it's amazing how sin can pervade the camp they come into a place of becoming very prideful we don't need to take everybody up there to fight this battle we only need to take a little bit of people up there to fight this battle but they weren't winning the battles because of their numbers it wasn't their numbers that was winning the battle it was god that was winning the battles god was only using them as they yielded themselves to god but there was something that had come in the camp and it was hindering victory joshua joshua was a scriptural man as well and joshua could look back and say is there not a cause what's going on here why is there not victory the way that it needs to be you know what he looked back to because god can't fail god's word can't fail what god has said god stands to back up that word so joshua isn't looking at that the problem is with god the problem is not with the message that he's given but now it's time for an examination and it has to start here because he's the same god so to stand right there you know that takes a mighty big man when i say man i'm talking about brothers and sisters alike to be able to stand there in the face and let the word examine our lives hey we're not here to put on a show we don't come to church to be told where our good places are we kind of know those places but we come that the word would bring a scan upon our life because there's a desire in our heart to be closer to god there's not one of us in here tonight if you are you got the wrong thoughts there's none of us can stand here tonight and say well i already made it when god has come in the depths of our heart there's a love for god there's a desire for god there's a pulsation for more of god there's a longing in our heart that god i don't want nothing between me and you it moves within our life and i think of how this weapon that god has given them because david he's knowing hey god has said i'll make you the head and not the tail you're the head and not the tail but god had told them if you get away from my word then you'll no longer be the head you'll be the tail once you leave the word and the authority of the word you leave your authority there is no authority outside of this word this this word because this word it's not a man's word it's god's word it's god that has spoken to us in this generation it's god that not only has spoken but it's god who is still speaking and vindicating his word in the lives and hearts of his children hallelujah that gives us courage to run to the battle i made thee to be the head and not the tail yes sir pardon me but you see with saul saul had come to a place when you look at the anointing here's saul is anointed here david is anointed saul was anointed with vile david's anointed with the horn is that right but if you notice with saul god when we look at saul's life i just forgive me i just have to say it like this it was self-willed saul saul did things that was convenient for saul it was not about anybody else it was not thinking about the rest of the body it was all about saul saul wanted all the glory when a battle was won and he didn't even win it it was jonathan his son that went up there the only reason saul wanted to associate with the prophet samuel because he knew god was with him he knew god was with him and he said if you don't follow samuel and i is that right she wanted to bind the people to him by fear but we know that's not how god works god does not bind his people with fear but where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty that word loosens you and i it illusions you and i to be a son and daughter of god brother where you don't have to wait upon your pastor to live in victory there is victory in your life when there's a need that comes up you don't have to have your pastor on speed dial jesus is right there amen he said i'll never leave you nor forsake you that's a certainty whether you feel it or not it's a certainty of god's word but saul when it was convenient even when saul in different times when it came down to repentance it wasn't that he really wanted to repent in his heart he wanted to save face before the people just you know return with me and walk out here samuel with me so you know i'll be in good standing it was not there was a real lacking of sincerity in his life that's right he intruded into places he shouldn't have been is that right he had no authority being there but he comes to a place where god identifies you have rejected the word of the lord and remember when saul laid hold on on samuel you know on the on the mantle and it rent and samuel expressed it to him god has removed the kingdom from you this day and given it to a neighbor and i want you to notice these words as it speaks here you're familiar with this and samuel said the lord hath rent the kingdom of israel from thee this day and hath given it to a neighbor of thine that is better than thou and also the strength of israel who's the strength of israel god the strength of israel will not lie nor repent for he's not a man that he should repent remember david would be the man that would testify of this in his life and david would say the lord is the strength of my life you'll never find saul speaking of god being his king but you'll find over and over of david in the psalm saying lord thou art my king him david knew his position and his position was under almighty god he knew it was god that had called him my my my he knew it was god that had elected him he knew it was god it had anointed him he simply knew that all about my life it's god my mama he was looking with that reality and there was a strength now that david is testifying it wasn't his stature it wasn't the stature of david it was the strength of god [Music] we're in a real contest we've been in a real contest i believe we're living in a time where where it's it's really time for the word to be living and made manifest not that it hadn't been but listen these i believe this with all my heart it's not going to get easier from here on out faith isn't waiting on for you know the next doctor to rise on the scene and some cure about this we thank god for all of those things but that's not what faith is based on if your faith is based on that you know you you you hear it today tomorrow you hear a different story you hear a different story over here but this is why that within the midst of this hour it's a time i believe it's god's grace and god's mercy that it can let you and i know if you don't have that assurance and that assurance and that stabilizer in your life that god can come down and really bring a real assurance that you're not worried you're not caring about the world you know where you're anchored and you're resting and for those that are anchored and resting oh what a comfort that it is to know that he holds the future he holds my life right now my life is in his hands and there's not a devil can take me or touch me until god is finished with me that's a comfort in this hour it's a contest of strength that's on and when god how that god would make his strength known is god makes his strength known by coming in his word and coming into his church brother brown would speak and bring this up here in the message the contest and he would deal with it says now the word you know he says we know who has the most power god does because the word is god and who's stronger than god the word is god and the word becomes our strength god in the church becomes his strength to pull satan to his own fires that he has made as jesus said if you abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done you see when we look at this and we see this anointing upon david's life you know when we many times you know you can look at somebody else and say my i i wish i wish i had what they had but there's nobody superheroes here are you with me we're talking flesh and blood that's right here we're talking lives that go through that go through battles and go through tests but when we're talking about god on the inside we're talking about a strength and a stabilizer that holds us in the midst of tests in the midst of trials even in the time when you felt like giving up you couldn't give up because you didn't start this work god started this world that's the strength of god standing there even in the midst of the test and of the trial he's holding you we look at this and i think we're living in a time as brother adam would speak of how and he would bring that of the message being like that of how he says you see a woman you being a young man and you would see a a young lady that you could say you know what she'll make she'd make a wonderful wife and all of these different qualities and all these different attributes but she's not yours until you start pursuing her you have to pursue her you have to you have to you have to express and have to go after her is that right it don't happen by osmosis you you have to move after her brother braham said that's the way the message is you can sympathize with it and say it's right but you've got to take it yourself to become part of it see the message being preached but you've got to reach out and you've got to become a part of it you've got to be joined with it it's not just enough to make eyes at it but it's to say i want to be one with that that's what god's desiring a real oneness and a real union but he's a gentleman he won't force himself but you've got to take it yourself to become part of it then you and the message become one then the anointings with you as it is with others these scriptures even that we opened up with david when he comes jumps out of the carriage he runs to the he runs to the battle then we find out even later on as he steps down to meet this philistine david himself draws near to the philistine you're not backing up the philistines out there david is going to meet him it's not backing up then we find even as it get as it got a little closer david ran now in order to run you know just like with with with children they don't start out running they start out walking is that right we don't all of a sudden start running but we got to walk you take certain steps that are first is that right this is why even when we're looking and we we look at the glory we look at the reality we we recognize and how that god is is right here among us and god speaking to our hearts and you would say brother samuel what is it that god is desiring surrender amen surrender it's it's it's a simple surrender and dying out to self we can never get around that because god will never come and unite with that old nature there's got to be a dying out first is that right now brother branham when he goes through this whole part here after the seals and then he comes in down through the messages there in june and july of 63. he's dealing with with things that he's seeing in the church and he he speaks of how he sees a lack of sincerity where he says he says i don't see people acting upon the word like they ought to he said i see he says well i said there's questions he said that seems to be in people's minds could it be me i wonder if i'm a part of it and then he says god has laid something on my heart for the next service it was he that is in you and brother adam takes that whole service on he that is in you i know you're familiar with it and he would deal with the reality of a true repentance he would deal with true confession you know confession is as he said clearing everything out if if you know that you've done something wrong to somebody go make it right why would brother samuel you don't know what that's going to do to me but think of the body think of the body think of your life think of inviting god into the camp and what it means so he's dealing with these things of how that that a lack of confession of where it can be among among the people and you know as we said god god is only obligated to his word god will come to his word and this is why that we we must be standing upon his word that's what gives you and i assurance to run to the battle to those things that you and i that we would be facing or called to face it takes more than just our strength it takes more than just our knowledge brother it takes an anchor in the midst of that time it takes a god with skin on it a god in the midst of the storm that's able to stand there and give us strength in that hour so many times here where israel is out and here that here's the army in a situation there's got to be a removing of the hindrance of what's over their life you see you can never do anything with condemnation over your life condemnation it hinders confidence and if there's anything between you and god make it right if the life hasn't been fully surrendered surrender it all to him lay it all down to him say say god come into my life and be fully lord in my life i think we're here in this time to dedicate this this building that god has blessed you with god has provided but what an awesome opportunity for us to dedicate these vessels to god a time to really dedicate ourselves to god and see condemnation has a way there can be things even the devil can try to hold over your head let me just say something here he'll even when it comes time for you to take promises he'll try to bring up all kinds of things from the past but let me remind you there is no condemnation to them that are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit if you're standing right there you can look at that devil and say boo because there's no condemnation it's already been dealt with right here god has come down and dealt with that in your life the desire is not there it's flee your desire is for god for his word it's him that you love the very thought of sin haunts you [Applause] hallelujah this is how we're running to the battle i think of how when god as he came down and he sent samuel down there to anoint david saw you know samuel went down there and samuel he picked he picked the first one which would have been a much larger stature and everything surely this is the one but god already had his choice one after one after one after one went by finally samuel stood there he says you got another one samuel was there to anoint a king that god had provided for himself he knew god had sent him there with a message there's a reason i'm here at your house there's a king here there's one to anoint oh my there's a reason that god has knocked on your heart it's a son and daughter of god on the inside to be anointed with his presence it's not by coincidence or chance that this message came across your pathway it's not a coincidence you were born into a home you heard that voice you heard it crying out it's not a coincidence but what do i do let god anoint you [Applause] samuel wanted to know how am i going to get down there how will i get down there if saul finds out that i'm down there he's going to kill me but god said i want you to come down secretly through the sacrifice i want you to call them to the sacrifice you see in order for victory to come back into the camp we've got to come back to the original sacrifice we've got to come back to the original atonement the original baptism of the holy ghost we must come back to the original word the original grounds that belonged to believers [Music] call them back call them to a sacrifice they didn't know what was going on they didn't know what was taking place but god was moving down oh hallelujah glory be to god what about in this generation hallelujah god himself he came down in this generation is that right and that same god is here with us but how many would have looked upon the little statue of a man and said seventh grade education ah nothing to it he don't know much about this or much about that but god wasn't there to impress their intellects that's not what the believer is moved by the believer is not moved by deep intellectual things the believer is moved and stabilized by the living god coming down in their midst that gives them confidence and hope in the midst of darkness in the midst of trials in the midst of situations when god comes down and says i'm still the same god i haven't changed a bit [Music] anybody in here want to join with me and say god be god in my life don't change a bit we don't want to alter him [Applause] we haven't united with him with hopes of how that we can form him to our ways but we want to be shaped and molded to his ways how am i going to get this anointing on him call them to the sacrifice they got away from the sacrifice they're looking at other things but a call comes look away to jesus look away to him who's the author and finisher of your faith look away from all of these schisms and all of these things that are out and look away to him who is the living word aren't you glad aren't you glad a call has come to your life you may not have been setting in the meetings you may not have been sitting there and seen brother branham but let me just tell you something that same god that sent brother branham with the message that same god is in the building tonight that same god is the same god that reaches down and touched your life as a matter of fact you are a product of this message glory be to god so the strength of israel the strength of israel it was not their numbers it was not how tall they were how broad-shouldered they were it wasn't how eloquent they could be the strength of israel was god you take god away from israel they're like any other nation god said you want to be like any other nation fine i'm leaving because it's god who makes the difference a church is a church but god's the one who makes a difference a home can be a home but god is the one who makes a difference marriage can be a marriage but god is the one who makes it a real marriage you leave god out of the equation you're in trouble but oh with god in the midst brother all things are possible you know what david coming into the camp david wasn't dragging back into the camp you know coming in there and you know telling all the oh yeah this is terrible hey do you guys see what everything's going on i tell you this stuff they say we're going to have to do this now and we're going to have to wear a mask for the next 30 years and we're going to have to do this and i'll tell you that's so terrible david had been having fellowship with god david where you been i've been quarantined out there with the sheep but you see he had been locked away with god amen he had been having fellowship with god and when david as he comes running back into the camp you know what it was it was a reminder they needed courage and here came encouragement god had wrapped himself in the gesture of david and god was coming into the camp to encourage israel he was coming to remind them of who they were you're not a trodden down bunch of nothings you are sons and daughters of god he came into the camp to make an example of this is what god intends for each and every one of you to be that's real encouragement i say that's a body ministry think about how brother brandon would say oh i hope i'm alive to see when she puts on that robes of resurrection power this was a ministry oh my that even when brother branham would stand there at the end of perfect faith he said if you don't have faith for your healing i'm gonna put my faith and i'm gonna pray i've already spoken it and i'm gonna pray you claim it you believe it let me tell you something god has anointed this word upon a people and this word has already been spoken and what god has spoken he ain't gonna repent for he never told a lie he's still the same god to confirm that word and make it real what's happening get a little bit back in your step start walking and then you before you start then you start running here comes their champion that's what they called him champion evidently he'd been in fights and he had won fights what he didn't know he might be looking at a small little ruddy boy but there was a great big god on the inside it's amazing how israel was hearing these things and it just it brought fear to them but when david heard it david saw it for an opportunity you see it's just like the devil you let the devil try to get a hold of something he can take a quote he can take a scripture he can try to run you down but you let the holy ghost get a hold of that it'll turn the situation for bleakness and darkness it'll cast out fear it'll dismir dismiss worry and unbelief why because it's the god of his word i love this word champion it's a man of the space in between they had a man that was coming between the space of two armies what they didn't know is there was a man by the name of david who god had already come down in that boy's life it was god in simplicity but there was a god there that could feel the breach are you with me there's one that could stand a living god a living word that could stand right there as the champion in that hour oh my well was it it wasn't taking away from the word it was god coming back and said what i said back here that i'll make you the head and not the tail god was declaring that and said this is what i'm here to do i'm an enemy to your enemies i'm an adversary to your adversaries my standing right there that how that they in the midst of that time how that through that hour david was identifying himself with the living god he was identified by god i said moments ago i i don't understand when when when somebody looks at something and says we believe he's the same god but don't want god to act the same way don't want god to do the same things this is where true identity is true identity is not just with teaching true identity is with the living god of the word it's god himself identifying his presence and this what this is what david was saying how about you and i david was identifying that i was with moses when he crossed the red sea david could stand there i was with there with joshua when the rivers of jordan were partying i was there when jericho when the walls came came tumbling down what was he doing it was the presence of god coming back into the camp of israel how did he get back into the camp because there was a life that was surrendered and willing to invite god back into the camp without restraints it just goes to show it don't matter how old you are it don't matter how young you are it don't they don't matter about size or statute don't even matter how long you've been around the message god doesn't look at things like that god doesn't god doesn't do things like that by rank god will come where there are hearts that are longing and desiring for him to speak and design for him to move he just loves to come where he is invited and welcomed where there's no restraints put upon him where you don't say well jesus you can come but i don't want you doing this i don't want you acting this way i don't want you doing this we want jesus to come the god of the bible we want him to come and be the god of the bible to do the same thing that he did before this message never took us from that are you hearing me brother branham when he stood there and preached and taking sides with jesus and he gathered the brethren together and he's rehearsing how he studied that early church and when he preached restoration of the bride tree and he rehearses and he said brothers i look for and expect the same thing to be right among us and he challenges us in that hour he challenges us not only as pastors not only as evangelists he challenges us as husbands as daddies he said we have got children that's coming on and we've got to think of them he said we don't know the moment nor the hour we've got to make arrangements for them but samuel what are you saying i'm saying that the same lord jesus the same holy ghost that was poured out on the day of pentecost i'm saying the same holy ghost inside of my life to change me that's the same holy ghost for my children it's the same holy ghost for every vessel everyone that's ordained of god it don't make no difference it's never been diluted the atonement is just as real and just as full of glory and power i don't care what all demons out there have rose up you might say brother samuel you don't understand now there's phones out there and all these things and our children have access that's a lust devil and god's already conquered that devil there might be all types of devices and all types of things but there's a mighty conqueror in the camp there's a god who's already triumphed and he's already defeated that let me tell you a young person all you have to do is lay it down and receive that and say god i take you out your word lord jesus we're dealing with the defeated devil now he's running his mouth like he don't because like he don't know it but remember he's roaming to and fro seeking whom he may devour while all the things that we see coming up and you see all the darkness and you see all the voices and everything else he's howling is that right brother brown says his howling and all of this he said that that's rising up against that of the holy spirit in this last days it's setting up denominations what are denominations it is breakers against the spirit of god he identified it was walls it was denominations it was things being set up let it not be said among us that we've set up walls you might say i believe this message but don't set up a wall in your life always be a vessel that the holy ghost can come and move through your life and use you that's our inheritance that's a privilege david was identifying himself with the living god my my my my saul wanted to put some things on david david you know he thought he respected saul you know saul was his elder saul was older david i want you to see this david had a spirit of humility it was not arrogance the anointing upon his life and positioning it did not bring arrogance it did not bring pride saul was his elder saul said here you take this right here and and you go on out there remember it was because of david behaving himself wisely that saul knew god had anointed him to be king it's one thing i hope it's all right it's one thing to behave yourself wisely around everybody else but how do you behave in your home because you see this is where real respect and real authority comes from the same god that's in the service is the same god that goes with you he's the same god that goes when you're on the job you see god god doesn't want you being somebody different here than you are out there god wants you being yourself but he wants you to be filled with him he wants you to be a vessel that even when situations arise as they come up you're ready to stand right there run to the battle you're running to god you're running to the battle maybe on your knees and you're in prayer god help me how do i face this situation lord let's be honest there's many situations i tell you i think probably i could speak probably for all the pastors and ministers that's here try to found things of of truth and you know do we open the church here or do we do this or whatever more you've had to pray and wait on god god give you peace within it you know one thing about the will of god peace always comes with it and looking to god and god never made us a promise well nobody will ever get sick but he made promises when it comes i'll take sickness from among you many many other promises that are there but in the midst of this time how david is standing there tell saul i can't i've not proved these things i've not fought any battles with this i gotta go into this battle with what i know that's been tried true tested proven what's certain to me he wasn't looking for something new he was using the same experience he had the situation looked different but god was the same god david runs down there to the brook i'm i'm coming down and david runs down there to the brook you know he wasn't nervous a bit david runs down there and he kneels down and he starts taking up stones every one of them stones were promises those promises were right there but somebody had to go out there and take them david knelt down and he began to take five promises now you know how the prophet brings it that's j-e-s-u-s faith but you notice he didn't he didn't sling all five stones he just took one stone out because once you've got jesus you've got everything you have need of you've got the victory to face any obstacle in any situation is that right he's more than enough for whatever that you would be facing david begins to you know sling that that stone around this was you know for david david walked out there this is what david was doing what david did this was just another day in david's life come on now you know what i'm talking about there ain't no breaks from the devil like and one brother told me said i'm going to do something that the devil don't do and that's let you along you know what i'm talking about but it's always coming even when you you wake up right there maybe in the morning sometimes sometimes you'll try to come around try to trouble you in your sleep what do i do don't accept that thing just put it right back at him you don't have to just you don't have to debate with him you don't got nothing to prove to that devil you don't have to dispute with him you don't have to try to find 15 quotes what should i do just be a son and daughter of god get out of my way devil begins to swing that stone there was one vulnerable place in his armor he was an uncircumcised philistine and though david was a marksman it was god that directed that stone to the forehead of the giant knew right where to put it you know david in the midst of that hour david went to that battle with not a hope so with not a maybe so david went to that battle and when goliath as he came out there goliath said who are you sending out here this guy nothing but a youth he's ready david's calling out and saul or goliath is calling out all these things what goliath doesn't know he's only advertising of this man is small in stature ready he's flesh just like you are he doesn't realizing he's only advertising only calling it out but there's a god the living god who's right there veiled in david's life it was god who accepted the challenge it was not david's person it was god in david that accepted that challenge oh glory be to god it's god in you that accepts the challenge i tell you right now there's tests and trials that's come our way we wouldn't have put our hand up god said hey i need i need somebody you know that i can show my glory through lord are you are you asking for people to walk on the water i'll be the first guy sometimes it's battles and when you look at this with goliath sometimes the battles and things that you face it doesn't go away just within a moment but god gives you victory in your heart you can look at that devil and know he's already defeated day after day but you already have a certainty and a settlement this faith has dropped right there in the womb and you know it's settled how do you know how do you explain it because god has just dropped a faith within my heart anybody know what i'm talking about things sometimes you're praying about or things you're facing you can't explain it but how awesome that is when god drops his presence right there in our life and you just know it's finished well give me a timeline i don't know but it's finished when's this going to be over or when am i going to see my loved ones i can't give the timeline but it's finished that's greater than even if you could see the finish it's greater to know that the god who is the author and the finisher dropped it in your heart that the victory is yours god will give you encouragements along the way things that you need even as you're looking at it signs things of encouragement he's a god who encourages us don't you love him for that david stands there man i tell you just like a seat of abraham he starts prophesying he's anointed right there of the word goliath you know goliath is trying to rattle his cage he's trying to say things you know what he's trying to do trying to get him to look at himself look at his inabilities and in our self we're no match for the devil but god on the inside is more than a match for the enemy let me tell you in this age you're no match for this age but god is more than a match in this age there's overcomers in this age here stands david in that time david said i'm going to take your head off you today i hope you had your last breakfast that you liked hope they gave it to you if you like filet mignon i hope you ate that today because that's your last meal because i'm gonna take your head off today because the lord will deliver you into my hand the god of glory come down and bring you into my hand david began to whirl that that sling shot around and god directed that stone right to the forehead of the giant david just didn't stand with that david clinton he ran right over there he took the head of that philistine off because i'm sure there might have been some that were way back there and they couldn't exactly see what was going on maybe they were kind of like you know kind of trying to look over you know one another and they couldn't see and david went up there and david wanted to make sure that he could show them that that head that authority has been removed and he held that head up and he brought it back into the camp to show that that devil has been defeated you know what that did it caused the courage to rise in the camp of israel david never had to tell him hey get off your chair hey come on come help me come help me it was the living god vindicating his word it brought a surge into that camp brother they received courage from on high and they rose up out of there they were cowards one moment and they left out of there with courage i'll tell you here tonight you feel like you got a little cold maybe you feel like where's god in my home just invite him back in the camp invite him back into the camp invite him in lay your life down if there's things that need to be straightened out look at you don't have to make it have to be a real long profession procession about that just lay your life down say lord i want to invite you back in the camp maybe you went around with some of your will your own self-will and this or that but listen there's a god here tonight a god who's rich in mercy a god who comes and he restores a god who comes when everybody can say it's over but there's a god that's here that still snatches lambs out of the mouth of the lion and out of the mouth of the bear you might feel you've gone too far but you ain't gone too far god is still god god is still able to reach and turn your life around you might say i'm too hard i've grown cold but there's a god right here in this mix right now if you'll draw nine to him he'll draw nine to you that same god will come down he'll smack that enemy that's tormenting you that devil that stands there with condemnation god will take him down what should i do run to the battle but brother samuel i need god god will meet you run to the bible god vindicating his word promises the promises you need in your life deliverance baptism of the holy ghost run to the battle run to the god who's vindicating his word and vindicating himself to be the same god you need healing in your body run to the battle he's the same god he'll do the same thing when the same conditions are met he's a god of his word not a man that he should lie nor the son of man that he should repent but what god has spoken he will make good upon him how many witnesses we got in the building tonight that god keeps his word god still pours out the holy ghost god transforms lives completely amen lies that god still heals god still delivers there's witnesses all around through this building right here witnesses all around you're looking at a witness tonight you're looking at a life raised in the message heard the message new quotes i could quote quotes i could finish certain quotes but that didn't change me i had to meet god in a personal way let me just tell you something it wasn't me seeking for god but god came searching for me [Applause] and that same god that sought me out is the same god seeking you out it's the same god to make his word real to your life impart life to you change your life you might sit here tonight maybe as a young person middle age whatever you might say brother say i still have holds on my life i would be honest in his presence and say god break those holds of my life lord turn those things from my heart lord father i don't want to be in that slavery in that bondage say god turn my heart lord turn my life around i want you lord i want to be united with you lord turn my life lord turn it around you invite him like that he'll come he'll come he's encouraged you to run to the battle maybe you've been discouraged in your walk but god comes right down in the midst not just this service but service after service to encourage you how god will come sometimes sometimes maybe it isn't you know real fiery sometimes how god will come as in a real still small voice and he just speaks to you in such a way that you know brother paul don't know that that ain't brother paul but god's letting you know i still call addresses i still know and i care what's god doing he's encouraging encouraging us to run to the battle let's stand tonight let's just bow our heads heavenly father lord jesus you're still the same the same god lord jesus your presence is just the same your characteristics your nature lord you still do the same work that you did in the beginning lord jesus i'm certain lord here tonight lord as you've laid these thoughts on my heart that lord that our hearts would not only be encouraged but lord there would be lord that encouragement into your promises lord lord for those that's gotten a little discouraged maybe grown lord a little a weak their vision lord god seems to have went from him lord the purpose got caught up with a lot of other things and focused on things that's going on out here i pray tonight lord that it would just lord the spirit of god just moving on hearts that in humility could look to you and say lord i want my vision restored my purpose lord god lord to be aligned lord in you i've got my eyes lord on these other things and i realize lord when my eyes are on other things and off of you that's when fear that's when worry that's when doubt all of those things can move lord i i want to put my eyes back on you

the same god lord you're the god who's dealing with my heart dealing with my life nobody can know my life like that it's as though it's just a personal audience with you lord i want to run with the
