[Applause] head and it's all coming down brother the go and lift up your head lift up your for the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king and without a prince and without a sacrifice and without an image and without an ethod and without a teraphim now I won't have time today to break all those down but just catch the simple theme the children of Israel got so away from God they didn't have a king anymore they didn't have a sacrifice anymore and all many of these things are elements that God gave the people to connect with God Amen these are some of these are essential elements to connect with God and when they rebelled and got away from him it removed all of these connections to God that they were without any of these connections without a king without leadership without a prince without a sacrifice and like it was sung about the blood of Jesus Christ if we remove the True Blood of Jesus Christ we're without that we are in trouble that's right amen their sacrifice was removed their King was removed right but here's Redemption just in two verses we see it verse five afterward shall the children of Israel return and seek the Lord their God and David their King and shall fear the lord and his goodness in the last days but I look at the conditions of some people and what they're going through and but yet I see a desire very common in many people that are coming and staying close to the word no matter what conditions they're in there's a desire common in many and it's it's seeking out this King it's seeking to be in the presence of the king the seeking within God's people you know the within God's people they're seeking the Lord and seeking the king doesn't stop with just salvation we don't stop seeking the Lord After we receive salvation some of you were saved when you were a child maybe or maybe when you're 16 or maybe last year but we don't stop seeking after we get receive salvation seeking the Lord does not stop when we're Sanctified can you say Amen seeking the Lord it does it doesn't end even after years of being in in church I don't think our seeking the Lord should end because we've been in church for years seeking is not over seeking does not is not over because Deliverance is not over correct if we still need Deliverance then we still need to seek God because there more is more of of God can you say amen and when there's more of God when there's a deep calling to the Deep there's a deep to respon on otherwise we probably wouldn't even be here this morning there has to be a seeking I hope you're not here for just a religious duty but I hope there's something in your heart seeking more of the king seeking more of God can you say m because seeking him doesn't end with salvation it doesn't end with sanctification seeking him doesn't even end after you receive the Holy Ghost there's more and when the deep is calling to the deep that shows there's a deep to respond somewhere that's right am and I would say it give us the benefit of the doubt we're here and we wouldn't be here unless we were seeking him more and we're going to keep seeking they talk about these Seeker friendly churches anybody ever heard of that Seeker friendly churches and they adapt everything for the Seeker but it's all what they're seeking if they're seeking more rock and roll then we provide rock and roll for them if they're seeking more of worldly living and still sit in church and so it's a Seeker friendly well we're we're we're the true Seeker Friendly Church and for a soul that's hungry for God we preach the word of God unrestricted can you say amen and if you're seeking for more of God and and less of denomination then you need to come out of that denomination come out of religion can you say amen and find a church that's truly Seeker friendly it can meet the needs in your life Lord that your grow going by seeking does not end because Deliverance is not over yet your deliverance did not end when he delivered you from alcohol your deliverance did not end when he delivered you from cigarettes or adultery your deliverance wasn't over right did you know that your full Deliverance did not end when you received the Holy Ghost there are some preachers that preach us preach it that way that your deliverance was over but I'm here to tell you your deliverance isn't over and so you're seeking of more of him isn't over cuz there's there's still things that don't get talked about a lot and we really need to be delivered from them maybe gossip or maybe possession minded the Love of [Music] Money religion Pride can you say Amen but I'm a Believer I have the Holy Ghost well we still need deliverance from things and if you've got them all covered the very fact you're still in this body shows you need to be delivered from this body so we still need Deliverance son of man Son of God Son of David Prophet priest and King Jesus is all of them Eagle lamb and lion you can say it any way you want to say it here Eagle lamb and lion if I can say it this way just get more specific now number one the washing of the water of the word by a prophet number two the intercessory blood of a lamb by a priest Jesus Christ and number three the character of a king coming forth this is our message and I'll get to it in a minute if I get to it when you look at the nativity scene all over right now after yesterday I'm looking at nativity scenes all together different because I'm looking at a baby which they didn't expect God to send but in that baby was the whole package son of man Son of God Son of David it was all there hallelujah hallelujah and when he sent this word at the last days and repeated son of man again it should alert us to the fact that God when he send something he's not going to just send one thing but resident within that word is Son of Man Son of God and Son of David to get us ready for a millennium it's all Jesus Christ the washing of the water and and and get this now your Old Testament you read your Old Testament oh but I don't understand this here it is you know here he comes as Prophet priest and King and did you know as you read through 1st Samuel 1st Chronicles 2 Chronicles you read through all these you know what the theme is is a lamb priest right prophets right and a king he's speaking something he's saying something the theme is pointing to that baby Jesus Christ I'm going to do something here I always like to say it this way in the Old Testament God was trying to say something but when Jesus came he was what God was trying to say the whole time he was everything God was trying to say this is what God looks like in a human being and if he looks that way and I say Lord bring Jesus in me he's going to look that way in your life the Old Testament it's Prophet there's a lamb that's slain there's a lamb there's a priest bringing the lamb all that's Jesus Christ that's right and then there's a king amen and all of these things were speaking of what the one thing God God would send that we would need and that is the king but when they looked at that baby it was it was not only the king but everything would be in that baby everything would be there so when he sent a prophet and and even when you're entering when you're entering the um the the tent the Tabernacle of God you know they had a place on the outside and so you're approaching to get into the Throne of God to get into his presence so you come first to the the table and you wash there and the sacrifice is washed God sends a prophet for the washing of the Water by the word but you're not done yet that's right then you go into the tent and then you got the different things you go there for for for sanctification the priest is inside that inner part and the priest prepares himself to enter for you that's the Old Testament in the Old Testament the priest enters that throne room for you with the sacrifice after Calvary we have arriv right to enter the throne room ourselves that's why he says in Revelations 3 he says I have overcome you will overcome and to him that overcometh I will grant to sit with me in my Throne as I have overcome and sin so this thing isn't about about Jesus it's all about Jesus but it's about you coming to kingship and priesthood that's right with him that's right you don't it's approach to the Lord approach the Lord you have a priest there you have a lamb there you have a prophet there and then you come into the royal in her veil yeah royalty kingship the throne everything speaks of this baby that was born that was the whole package that had everything within it when you looked at it that's right the washing of the word by a prophet intercession Blood by a lamb and a priest he actually was our lamb the character of King in other words our high priest Jesus Jesus Christ he was not only the high priest but he became the lamb too that's right this is my Christmas service so turn to Matthew Chapter 2 look at these fellas they traveled all the way across the desert Matthew Chapter 2 now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king behold there came a wise man from the east of Jerusalem saying where is he that's born King of the Jews for we have seen his star in the east and are come to worship him when Herod the king had heard these things he was troubled and all Jerusalem with him and when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together he demanded of them where Christ should be born and they said unto him in Bethlehem of Judea for thus it is written by the prophet and thou Bethlehem and the land of Judah are not the least among the princes of Judah for out of thee shall come the governor Thou shalt rule My People Israel then Herod when he had privately called the wise men inquired of them D diligently what time to start appeared and he sent them to Bethlehem and said go and search diligently for the young child and when he have found him bring me me word again that I may come and worship him also when they had heard the king they departed and lo the star which was saw in the East went before them till it came and stood over where the young child was praise the Lord one of God's Bibles was the heavens they didn't have a Bible like yours but you know they didn't go to the internet to try to find where the King was coming but one thing for sure they were seeking the true king that's right this morning just ask yourself am I seeking the true king and the true leadership in my life and uh there's a there's a statement up there those that got the slides when we go we're when we're seeking where last place you should go is to the internet right and Google it can you say Amen we can't trust anything can you say Amen am amen and even Abraham Lincoln said something about it I found that in Tennessee I thought it'd be pretty cool to incorporate in one of my sermons I have a lot of fun I enjoy life and even though Abraham Lincoln didn't say that when we're seeking God we don't Google it do what I was saying this morning get your Bible that's right get the message that's right these guys didn't Google it these guys didn't they went to the Bible they went to the heavens and it be to show them and the star when they heard verse 9 the king they departed Lo the star which they saw the East went before them till it came and stood over the young child when they saw the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joy why because they were seeking a king they were seeking the king and they were all already rejoicing when they found the star because the right star LED them to the right king that's right this wasn't just another baby this was going to be their King that they were seeking their entire lives maybe you sought him for your whole life but tell you I tell you you ought to Rejoice this morning if you found the right star that's leading you to the king they Rejoice with exceeding great joy and when they were coming to the house they saw the young child with Mary his mother and fell down and worshiped him and when they had opened their Treasures they presented unto him gifts gold frankincense and myrr and being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod they departed into their own country another way whenever we come before the king we want to bring something to him and the gifts that they brought to him reflected what they thought of him they had a revelation of everything that was in this baby or this two-year-old child as should say they had a revelation and their gifts that they brought their life that they brought reflect Ed what they said that he was right truth and he goes back to Prophet priest and King deity is a king gold represents deity frankincense is service the priest that's right myrr is death the lamb would die for us that's right even their gifts reflected who this baby was going to be it's not going to be that we're looking for a politician or we're looking for another type of King like Israel saying we want a king like the world we want leadership like they have all that was finished after we seen what Saul did and all of his me mess up and every even though he was anointed he kept messing up and God says it's time for me to give the true leadership to my people in this message it's time for the true leadership to come and it's not about men it's about the King Jesus Christ it's time for my people to get that and there'll be the son of David in that baby is the son of David in that baby is the son of man in that baby is the whole package the Son of God everything can you imagine if you'd have lived in that day and been there worshiping with the wise men which I believe if you have a revelation you would have been there but can you imagine there they're already rejoicing at the star they're already bowing and worshiping at the little baby that baby hasn't done anything yet right he hasn't done anything yet he hasn't healed anybody yet he hasn't had his ministry yet he hasn't been a prophet to rebuke yet he hasn't rebuked all the denominational systems yet he has not come in the office of Son of God where he fills people with the holy spirit yet he has not come as a king yet none of that's been manifested and yet they could look by Revelation amen and say it's all here CU remember he said they sought David the king in the last days they sought the Lord that's right and there's a baby and every the whole thing is there everything is there that's right you know I preached a few weeks ago on the potentials sometimes God gives you Revelations of the potential that lays with them something hey look at our Bibles here you get into this word you young people and everyone else you start getting into this don't underestimate the potential and the power of living a life in the scriptures that's right amen hallelujah and some of you don't know because you never been there you never experienced it yet we got a few real bible-based people in the church and I like them in the church if you become real bible-based and bathe yourself in this word you don't realize the power that's in that that's right can you say amen and you see things in potential form even if you don't see something that you need to Jesus to manifest in your life yet for deliverance if you're looking at the right thing all the potential is there for all Deliverance if you're looking at the wrong thing you don't have the potential for it but when you're looking at that baby you have the potential of all healing you had the potential of all Redemption you had the potential of the Lamb going to Calvary you had the potential of all your sins being taken away can you say amen and he was going to do all that and he did do all that he endured the cross you know what go Jesus said I would and did that I fulfilled that office of lamb and because because not because you're worthy but because I love you so much I made you worthy that's right amen you were worth it we had our anniversary last week and U we were out of town a couple days and so I wanted to take on Friday I wanted to take my wife to a nice place so we chose this Ruth Chris Steakhouse and uh so I had been a couple times before many years but I didn't realize how much the prices had gone up till we open the menus so so we open it up and we start looking at things and I'm praise the Lord all right so you have to you you start weighing the value of things the value of this woman I know and I'm I just struggled just a little bit and we can joke around about this and I did I I reached over to her and I said really enjoy this because it'll be another 28 years of mar before we come back to this restaurant again I said that to you didn't I so we joke around she was kind of you know surprised at it too you know 60 70 $80 just for the steak wow so we we ordered we did and I have to say the value of the food I mean I haven't tasted food like it was tremendous it was worth every dime as far as that goes it was really good and and so then you know crunch time came and we were going to and so the and this place is real I mean we didn't know how which Forks to use anyway we got towards the end and the waiter went in the back room and he was gone for quite a while and I said hun this is our chance to kind of scoot out the door before he comes back with the bill I would not do that all the children listening I would not do that but I can't say that the thought didn't come to me but I'll say publicly and I won't tell you what the bill was but she's worth every dime worth every dime amen mean that with all my heart it's the least I can do for her who she is in character and that's what our hearts is towards the Lord and that's what his heart is towards us I went to Calvary because you were worth it to me hallah I I went as the lamb because you were worth it to me how about Matthew chapter 1 and verse when he speaks to Joseph Verse 18 now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise when as his Mary Mother Mary was espoused to Joseph before they came together she was found with child of the Holy Ghost then Joseph her husband being a just man not willing to make her a public example was minded to put her away privately but while he thought on these things behold the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream saying Joseph thou son of David fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife you see he was dealing with his fear he was dealing with his fear for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost and she shall bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name Jesus for he shall save his people from their sins that's right I want to simplify all of this that I've said this morning to you when he comes it's for one purpose amen he will save his people from all of their sins when you looked at that baby the whole package was there when you look at God's word that he sends he will take care of it all you don't have to take some of the message and some of this and some of that it's it's provided in the atonement and he shall save his people from their sins that's my Christ today because I have been delivered from many things but I still need some Deliverance how many raise your hand and say I've been delivered from anything things but I still need some Deliverance in my life thank you thank you for being honest I need some more deliverance and that word says when he comes he'll save his people from all of their sins that's right oh I Rejoice today when we see the word you may not have everything you need yet but the potential is there and Simeon you kids know the story of Simeon old man he prayed oh God before I die can I see the Messiah the salvation of Israel could I just see it please he prayed he fasted he prayed he fasted and when Mary came to the temple that day he was to dedicate the baby and he got that baby in his arms and God showed him by Revelation yes he's holding that baby and he his tears coming down his eyes he reaches up and holds that baby says your servant can depart in peace now cuz I have just seen the salvation of Israel amen that's right he didn't see him do one Miracle he didn't see him as son of man he didn't see him as son of David he would be all that but he's seen all the potential right there and this will be the entire salvation of Israel Hallelujah don't underestimate the word that God sends and all that it's in it to finish the work in your life amen all the potential lies within the word can you say Amen David is already Among Us the son of David is already in our midst he's already manifesting himself cuz I can see it in the character of the people and I'm going to keep seeking that character in The People a people without fear a people without pretense a people without gossip a people that's growing to maturity a kingdom people for the Millennium they're being delivered from their corpse and their complexes and their fears they're being delivered from those things that's when you seeing the seeing the king of character on the scene [Applause] and I'm going to keep saking it in my own life in your lives until we see more of it because the son of David is among us thank you for watching our message today if you would like more information please contact us by visiting
