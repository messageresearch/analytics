the power we've got the powers reading today where brother branham said that you had the power he said to go create a world and go live on it if that was the will of god and so we we thank god for that if there's a power for that then surely there's a power to take care of whatever we have need of tonight whatever need that we brought with us to the service we believe our god is able to do that how does he do that by the word the same word that created the heavens and the earth that same word can create peace in your home and create joy in your life and create the things that you have need of whatever you need tonight we believe that he can speak that i've asked for the braden savage to come and and speak for us tonight um before we go um before i give the service to him but i talked to brother darrell ward today and texted with him and he wanted us to be praying for him as a church and he and his family all have this coronavirus and but so far it's been mild they have mild symptoms kind of like what we did but you'd be praying for them that it doesn't get any worse they don't have to deal with any of that and then they can be over with it kind of like what we are so i'm glad to be done with it myself so but they're going through that right now and we've been trying to get brother daryl in here all summer and we've got him scheduled again but i'm not going to say the date just yet because the devil seems to get into that but he's supposed to be coming in and maybe if they can recover from this quickly maybe he'll still be able to do that amen god bless you we love you all and and thank you for being here tonight as brother braden comes could we sing fill my cup lord lift it up lord make that your prayer tonight with all of your heart did you do that raise your hands to him tonight let's sing it together [Music] heaven [Music] my [Music] i lift it up lord i lip [Music] feed [Music] and make me home man let's just our hearts together man if you'd have a need upon your heart this evening just want to make it known to the lord by an uplifting hand i believe our our lord jesus is present he said where there's two or three gathered in his name there he would be amen let's just talk to him this evening heavenly father lord how great thou art lord and how wonderful it is to gather lord with saints of like precious faith here this evening lord on a wednesday night lord no doubt many has worked and toiled through the day to make their living but father lord yet in spite of that all lord here we are to worship you and lord we just asked lord that you would come by our way this evening lord and just speak to us father and lord as many times as i've said it lord that it lord anybody can take quotes and scriptures lord and put it together but lord we need you to do what man can't do and come by and minister lord to the hearts and lives of your people so father we just commit ourselves to you we give you everything we have lord our strength any ability lord we know lord has very little but father we're just looking to you to come and speak to every need here in this building tonight lord those who are streaming lord may you just be with them and comfort them lord and speak lord in a special way tonight lord we pray for we ask these things in jesus christ's name amen and amen amen you love the lord this evening amen god bless you it's certainly good to see each and every one of you i see some very familiar faces and some i i think i know about everybody so but it's so good to be here with you and i appreciate the invite brother ben for uh having me to come by and speak so it's just a real privilege and honor amen so without further ado let's just uh take our bibles and turn with me to romans chapter 8. we'll start reading with verse 28 very familiar scripture but we want to read down through verse 39 and then turn to first peter chapter one a little thought lord the lord had laid on my heart yesterday and got home and just began to study on it and he just began to pour it out so i pray that it'll it'll be delivered and at least in the way that it was given to me so amen it really done my heart good as as i studied on it romans 8 verse 28 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are be called according to his purpose for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we then say to these things if god be for us who can be against us aren't you thankful for that he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things who shall lay anything to the charge of god's elect he's speaking of you now it is god that justified who is he that condemneth it is christ that died ye rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of god who also maketh intercession for us who shall separate us from the love of christ shall tribulation distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter now in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord amen first peter chapter 1 start with verse 3. blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ which according to his abundant mercy has begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of jesus christ from the dead to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled and that faith not away reserved in heaven for you amen i'm looking forward to that day who are kept by the power of god through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time wherein you greatly rejoice though now for a season if need be you are heaviness through manifold temptations that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honor and glory at the appearing of jesus christ may god bless his word you can be seated this afternoon this evening i want to title this message tonight if i could speak just for a few moments i have uh several quotes that i want to uh look at tonight uh out of the church age book but uh so i may read a little bit more than what i usually do but it's just the kind of the way it it uh it came out this this time but i want to title the message the gold of god the gold of god and you know in romans 5 paul tells us that that we glory in tribulations because tribulation worketh patience and and you know we think of other words that that go along to help identify tribulation and and and words such as persecution testings and trials those words all meaning very close to the same thing but there's something about trials that is working for our good and many times uh and i'm speaking from experience and i know that we've all been through trials and and and it seems like the closer to the end time that we get the trials get heavier they get more and and they get more intense and they get hotter and you feel like when am i ever going to get out of this hot furnace that i'm in but but uh but we're at the end time and but but them trials when we're in the middle of them it doesn't look like they're working for our good matter of fact it feels like many times that it's taking us the opposite direction of what we should be going but paul tells us in the scripture that we read that we are kept by the power of god through faith and i want us to understand tonight first as we as we begin that that there is many trials that we go through my trials may be different than your trials and the next trial that i have may be different than the trial that i had before but there's one faith that we overcome all trials and it's the faith that we have in the lord jesus christ so there's many trials but there's one faith amen but and we are kept by the power of god through faith i'm glad tonight to know that god is not depending on me he's not depending on your power or your own strength amen to be able to overcome tonight but we are resting upon his his strength and his power his comfort his assurance amen that he gets it gives us from day in and day out i'm resting upon that this evening amen i'm not resting upon anything that i can do because my abilities are very very limited you know i i you know i think of the statement many times that that i hear people say well you know he can't sing his way out of a wet paper sack or he can't preach his way out of a wet paper sack i feel that way but nevertheless i know that if i can just yield myself to god brother ben that god will come and do what i can't do amen so i have faith i have confidence in that and as believers we have confidence not in what we can do but we have faith and confidence in the word of god and what the word says that we can do not within ourselves but through christ amen who strengthens us amen so we would be lost without hope tonight amen if if god was depending on something that we can do but you know verse 6 says wherein you greatly rejoice though now for a season if need be you are in heaviness through manifold temptations and i i want to look at that word season just for a minute seasons are temporary seasons come and go they're not here to stay they come and they go and they come and they go so many trials the many trials and persecutions that we have and are going through now amen and what we will go through they're gonna come and they're gonna go amen but the thing that it's working in your benefit will not come and will not go it will go with you in the rapture when we go amen so god's got something working amen for us amen and and brother branham actually in the church age book we'll look at it he actually calls it that the gold of god amen that that that is working for our good amen you know i sing that song yesterday as the lord was giving me this thought one of these days we'll be through with all these troubles and trials amen but right now it's working something good on our behalf this is why peter says that our trials are worth more than the genuine gold that perisheth amen the the gold of this world amen it's genuine but it's going to perish one day when this when this cannon fighter amen is nothing but cannon fodder anymore and and all the earth is consumed the gold amen will consume with it but the gold of god will not be consumed when the fire falls upon the earth amen you know we let's just take real gold just for a moment you know and i'm not speaking of fool's gold but there there is a real gold and i'm not speaking of fool's gold that's that's found in our rivers and our creeks but real gold you know real gold has to be beaten for the quality of it to be brought out amen you can pick up a piece of gold amen and it's not much shiny to it if there's not much glimmer to it amen but but it's got to be beaten and it's got to be put through the furnace amen for the for the real quality amen to shine forth it's got to be beaten amen and this is why peter compares our trials to genuine gold because through the beating of our trials and our persecution it's bringing out the true genuine heart amen of who we really are amen i've always thought and brother branham even makes mention of it he said a man or a woman is who they are when they're under pressure amen what they are is what they is when they are when when they're under the pressure amen when everything when the squeeze is put on them i tell you friends i i don't know about you this evening but i feel like the bride is going through a squeeze amen this is the last moments before we go amen and make heaven our home amen and we are in a squeeze right now amen i know it may be in an ecclesiastical realm too but our bodies amen physically our minds are going through a squeeze that we've never experienced before and we need grace we need mercy we need god's strength we need his power to come upon us amen and strengthen us day by day amen so so trials are working something so much more valuable amen satan means it for harm but god means it for good amen brother branham tells the story of the man that painted the picture of jesus amen knocking on the door and and there brother bill there's no there's no there's no latch on the outside of the door and there uh you know and brother branham begins to explain this picture how that it had to go through the hall of critics before it could go into the hall of faith amen and that's my point that i want to make with this with this story is that before that pitcher could go to the hall of fame and hang there it had to go through the hall of critics first it had to be criticized and go through all those critics first and that's the way the bride is today before we go in a rapture church we're going to have to go through the hall of critics we'll be criticized we'll be persecuted there'll be trials and tests even every day of our lives but it means one thing that he's getting us rapture ready and if he's getting us rapture ready it means that we're rapture material or he wouldn't be getting us ready for a rapture amen oh it encouraged me to know amen that god's got something better for me than the life that we're living now amen hey man so let him criticize let him let let tribulation come and i you know i don't like saying that because i don't like troubles i don't like trials i wished everything would go easy but god didn't intend for this life here on this earth to be easy he intended for it to be hard life is a battle amen you see church the only thing the only thing that separates us from the world is that the righteous will pass the test and the undressious will blow up when when trials begin to come they won't be able to take it because they haven't been pressurized amen for the time and the age to be able to take it amen but the bride of jesus christ has something in them that they will be able to stand the testings of time and i'll tell you what it is it's not somebody else's spirit it's not a man's charisma but it's the holy spirit that will keep you and lead you and guide you into all truth when everything in your life seems to be going upside down and backwards and the other way god will lead you in the paths of righteousness for his namesake amen we have a promise that will that you know we have a promise that god will not put more on us than what we can bear and he will test that to the very very limit but he promised that he would not put no more on us than what we can bear i want to share to you something that a little a little little thing that that i seen and it really done my heart good and i want to share it with you some of you may have seen it too but there was a little saying that come across my phone the other day and he reads like this it says if god puts a goliath in front of you he already knew there's a david inside of you or he wouldn't put you through it amen so if god if god has seen that there is a goliath and he's putting it in front of you he already knew before he put the goliath there that you had a david inside of you that would slay that giant oh hallelujah no we only got confidence in god but he's got confidence in you and me this evening he knows what he put in us amen i seen a picture the other day and had a little quotation on it and it's got a picture of a lion roaring and it says this the devil whispered in my ear you're not strong enough to withstand the storm today i whispered in the devil's ear i'm a child of god a warrior of christ and i am the storm amen i tell you amen the devil can whisper in my ear all day long amen you're not strong enough you're not big enough no i'm not but the christ that's in me is more than able to defeat you therefore i have become your storm amen amen oh church god knows what he's put in us and he knows that what he's put in us has already overcame the world second timothy three verse 12 says yay and all that will live godly in christ jesus shall suffer persecution there's no maybe there's none by chance but all that live godly in christ shall suffer amen in in the in the uh laodicean church age brother branham says this there is a gold of god first peter 1 7 that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth he said the gold of god is a christ-like character a christ-like character produced in the fiery furnace of affliction that is the right kind of gold so the christ-like character it cannot be produced in any other way but in the fiery furnace of affliction oh my natural gold will perish but the gold of god will not perish and the only way to achieve christ-like nature and a character amen is through the furnace of afflictions now watch what he says he says but what kind of gold does the church have today it has but the worldly gold that will perish it is rich and you know i've heard i've heard comments on the news and different things about about people thinking that that america will go into a third world country i different with that because that's against scripture because it says in the laodicean age amen that thou art rich and have need of nothing we will go on being rich and still having need of nothing in this world is that okay amen so we'll go forth and have need of nothing in this world because the scripture says in laodicean you're rich and you have need of nothing it is complacent it has has made affluence the major criterion of spirit out spirituality the evidence of god's blessings and the and the correctness of doctrine etc is now this is the worldly church it's based upon how many rich folks are involved in it you had better come before it is too late sayeth the lord and by of me gold try it in the fire and then you will truly be rich amen i don't care if you don't have but a dollar in the bank i don't care if your bank account is saying red negative zero in your bank account and you don't have none in your home amen to fall back upon you may be poor as job's turkey in this world but if you've got christ living on the inside of you you've got all that you can ever have got all that you ever need he said are we getting it listen to me now naked physically we come into the world but naked spiritually we will not leave it oh no we are going to take something with us what that something is is all we can take with us nothing less than nothing more so we had better be real careful now to see that we take something that will make us right before god so then what will we take with us we will take our character brother that is what we will take with us not what kind now now he says now what kind of character will you take with you will it be like his whose character was molded by suffering in the fiery furnace of affliction or will it be the softness of the carets laodicean people you see laodicean the people of laodicea and they're a characterless people they have no godly character whatsoever and many of them i say a large percentage of them they don't even have an understanding amen of what god is anymore amen when i was going to school now 22 years ago 21 years ago amen you know it was one thing my mom and dad took me to church amen a lot of the children that i graduated with their mom and daddy's took them to church but now there is a generation that is raising up and has raised up that don't even know nothing about church nothing about god amen that is the age that we're living in that's why you see so much amen uh protesting and so much killing and rapes around the world is because a pharaoh has rose up that knows not joseph and they rejected god and we're living off the fruits of america rejecting god amen but the bride of jesus christ amen they are a character amen that is christlike i tell you friends that's why i think the prophet of god would sit there and say amen that that if you can look out into the world and see the things that are going on and it doesn't vex your rocks it's so and it don't make you cry out amen even so come lord jesus there's something wrong somewhere your heart is not in the right place because when i turn on the news i think my my lord your coming has soon got to be at hand help me lord to be ready exodus 25 31 says and thou shalt make a candlestick of pure gold of beaten work shall the candlestick be made his shaft and his branches his bowls his knobs and his flowers shall be of the same here we see a type for the bride and i'm going to explain this let brother branham explain that here in a minute but the seven golden candlesticks that was made which in revelations we see represent the seven church ages and notice it was made out of beaten gold and the prophet of gold says in the church age again he says the true church of jesus christ the bride is locking to pure gold her righteousness is is is is his righteousness her attributes are his own glorious attributes her identity is found in him amen what he is she is to reflect what he has she is to manifest there is no fault in her she is all glorious within and without amen if you have the holy ghost here this evening i'm here to tell you you are perfect within when without amen in fact in her is summed up and manifested the eternal wisdom and purpose of god in you is summed up the wisdom and perfect will and purpose of god and brother branham says this and when i was reading this even before i i what he said next i began to think wow and he says how can one fathom it how can one understand it though we cannot do that and i want you to catch us tonight though we can't fathom it and though we cannot do that but we can't accept it by faith for god has spoken it amen we can't fathom it we don't understand it but we can't accept it by faith and i accept it by faith because he has spoken it but not only is the candlestick of gold it is of beaten gold handcrafted of beaten gold according to her blueprints which were spirit given i tell you friends the candlesticks were handcrafted the bride of jesus is handcrafted by our own amen we are sons and daughters of a heart carpenter higher than than building buildings and building tables but we are sons and daughters of the great carpenter the great sculpture amen jesus christ he is our maker he is our lord he is our king and kings oh my outside of her lord and master jesus christ was ever a people so beaten and purged as the bride of jesus christ what said what he said now he said outside of jesus there was there was nobody else ever beaten as much as the bride of jesus christ surely she is filling up the sufferings that christ has left behind now we're not given our lives in a way as going to the the post and they're whipping us like that you know there was a certain anointing back in the dark ages that they that they fell under amen to go through that there was an anointing for that but we have been anointed amen to overcome the wicked one in this mind right here because the prophet of god said the greatest battle ever fought was where in the mind amen where was where did david amen have to kill goliath at the only place that he wasn't guarded was right here in the head amen so now amen the battle the warfare is right here in the head is right here is where it's at and that's what we must have guarded at all times amen but i promise you and no matter how weak you get no matter how many struggles you have amen we will overcome because he's promised that he will not leave his righteous forsaken or his seed begging for bread hallelujah he said worthy of the gospel is the lovely bride of christ amen and as gold is malleable whereas brass will break with the beating this gold of god will bear her suffering for the lord not bowed not broken not bowed not broken not destroyed but formed as a thing of beauty and a joy forever by the trials and testings of this life you realize that the prophet of god said that that all down through the ages when we get on the other side brother ben amen that that that paul amen and moses and and all those old testament saints steve and those who are greatly persecuted when we get on the other side they're going to look at us and say how in the world did you make it through laodicea and we'll only be able to say one thing that it's by his grace that we made it through amen this little bride suffers a lot but his grace for her to bear it and we'll go through it when we fill it to the last straw his grace will carry us through when we feel we can't take another step he picks us up and carries us through hey man i i think of that that picture that's so famous hey man that you know the footprints on the sands of time how you know there's there was one set of footprints and the person that was walking said lord where are you i'm in a great trial amen i don't see you around where are you lord and he says oh child if you only realize that when you see one set of footprints that was when i was carrying you i tell you friend he's constantly got me on his shoulders because he's always carrying me in the day and hour that we're living in i can't walk without him holding my hand i can't look up the mountain's too high but he said greater is he that's in you than he that's in this world amen paul said it's not me that run us but it's christ that's in me so i say to the bride tonight who can separate us who can separate us from the love of god nothing will we don't bend we don't bow we don't give amen we stay the course because we were anointed to do so there's no weapon formed against us that shall prosper amen you realize friends that before god before god allows any storm in our lives to come he already knows the outcome and he already knows that you can handle it amen that's a consolation to me that when he sends a storm my way that he's got confidence in me braden i'm sending it your way because i know you can handle it i don't always act the best when storms come but his grace is always sufficient oh i'm so thankful for that church amen because we still got a human side that we fight but it doesn't mean you're lost it doesn't mean that you shouldn't raise your hands in church it doesn't mean that you should sit down and never read your bible again that's the devil amen i say lift up your heads i read and rejoice amen in revelations chapter 2 this is this is the chapter revelations chapter two this is the chapter that speaks of the seven church ages and i want us to notice you know that every time that that jesus is announcing another church age every time he writes something for each church age he says i know i know amen what a consolation it is that he knows all things amen he he is all-knowing he sees and knows all things amen and there is nothing that we go through that takes him by surprise amen his eyes are on the sparrow and i know he watches over us now brother branham says in the church age again he says now the lord god almighty says i know there he is walking in the midst of his people there he is the chief shepherd shepherd of the flock but does he hold back the persecution does he stem the tribulation no he does not he simply says i know your tribulation i am not at all unmindful of your suffering oh i want to read that again i know your tribulation but i am not at all unmindful of your suffering what a stumbling block this is to so many people like israel they wonder if god really loves them how can god be just and loving justin loving if he stands by and watches his people suffer that is what they asked in malachi 1 1-3 listen friends i've wondered the same things lord where are you where are you have you ever wondered that lord where are you in this trial he's right there he hasn't left you he knows amen the burden of malachi 1 1-3 says the burden of the word of the lord of israel by malachi i have loved you saith the lord yet you say wherein hast thou loved us was not esau jacob's brother said the lord yet i love jacob and i hated esau and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness you see they could not figure out god's love they thought that love meant no suffering they thought that love meant a baby with parental care but god said that his love was elective love amen the proof of his love is election amen that no matter what happens amen his love was proven how will i know that i'm elected i'm just about to shout right now because i know what i've been through i know some of the things that god has put me through but i'm here to tell you amen i'm rapture bound there ain't no devil going to keep me from it amen he may put me in the grave before the rapture happens but i'll rapture anyhow hallelujah he can kill the messenger but he can't kill the message he can kill the messenger but he cannot kill this word that's already prophesied the truth i'm losing my voice you pray for me i just got a little a little bit more here i'll try to close his purpose is that after we suffer i need to i need to go back up his love was proven truly he may commit you to death as he did paul he may commit you to suffering as he did job that is his prerogative he's sovereign but it is all with a purpose he if he if he did not have a purpose then he would be the author of frustration and not of peace amen his purpose he's going to tell us his purpose his purpose is that after we have suffered a while we would be made perfect and be established and strengthened and settled you know the devil is one of the ignorant people i've ever known he ought to know this you know he's had 6 000 years to study the human race amen and god all through time he's had a man a group of elected people amen that he's always bothered and i don't know why he can't get through his thick head amen that when he puts us through a trial that we're only going to come out stronger on the other end so it's going to make it that much more impossible to defeat him amen that's the way it was amen the more trials we go through the stronger we are when we come through it amen at the end i can tell you from experienced church amen that trials that i've went through and now i'm looking at i'm up at the mountain and i'm looking back down at that trial i'm looking at it and i'm saying lord it was your grace nothing less but oh how it has strengthened me oh how it has changed me how it has made me dig in your word that much more as job said he put strength in us you see he himself suffered he learned obedience by the things that he suffered he was actually made perfect by the things that he suffered hebrews 5 8-9 though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him in plain language the very character of jesus was perfected by suffering amen so if jesus amen amen learned obedience amen and his and his character was perfected by suffering how are we going to get by with anything less and according to paul he has left his church a measure of suffering that they too by their faith in god while suffering for him would come to a place of perfection i preached a message two days before cherith passed away and i preached on when faith is challenged and i can almost i can honestly tell you that i did not know what was coming two days later but god knew he knew what was coming amen and you know i've i've often looked back at that and many times when you when you know the bible says when you say you have faith then there has to be works that follow that faith it can john it can't just be a confession of faith amen so we say we are believers we say amen that we are christians we say that we follow this message with all of our hearts amen i'm going to tell you church when you make that confession satan is going to come your way and challenge that faith and you better know where you stand you know i i used to there i used to have a t-shirt it was a basketball shirt back in the day and it said you can talk the talk but can you walk the walk god's not looking for just people who can talk the talk but he's looking for people who can talk it and walk it amen amen amen you know i think i think of the saying that goes testify often use words when necessary amen so it's not necessarily what i preach over the pulpit it's not necessarily what your pastor over the pulpit will preach but it's a life behind it will speak louder than any message that he ever preaches amen because that's what you'll see at the end of the day is the life behind the message that's why i could follow a man like william brown i'm sure he had faults he had failures amen but he had the heart of david amen that pleased god when he was wrong he would make it right amen amen i'm so glad that we had a prophet amen that wasn't ashamed amen to let us know he was human amen he didn't want us to glorify him he wanted us to glorify the christ that he spoke about he said by their faith in god while suffering for him would come to a place of perfection why does he want this james one two and through four says my brethren count it all joy when you fall into divers temptations knowing this that the time that the trying of your faith work its patience but let patience have her perfect work that you may be perfect and entire wanting nothing amen you know my sister mandy she used to tell us all the time when back when she was in the middle of having babies she said you know i'm going to quit praying for patients because every time i do i just have another child but that's not the patience that the bible's speaking of yeah it goes with it i'm sure but the patience that he's speaking of in the bible amen you know in the pyramid when it goes up and it speaks of patience it's speaking of being able to wait upon god not rushing the situation but praying about it trusting in his word resting in his word amen i don't have much earthly patience i'll tell you that but when it comes time to waiting on god i don't have an issue with that because there's something about his word that i rest in amen why does he stand by the reason is in romans 8 17-18 and if children then heirs heirs of god and join ours with christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may also be glorified together for i reckon now i want you to catch this this is really good i know we've read these and it's a very simple thought but i want you to catch it tonight for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us so the trials and the tribulations they're not even worthy you can't even come close to comparing them to the glory that is going to be revealed in us i tell you church when this bride takes a lift off this earth amen her glory is going to be revealed what she was all alone the power that she held inside of her that keeping this world together right now amen when she lifts off of here the glory of god will be revealed hallelujah unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him you cannot reign with him you have to suffer to reign the reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering amen i hope this puts a a little different slant upon your sufferings today because we all are suffering in some way some some point brother branham goes on and says one of the most outstanding statements that i believe he ever made he says character is a victory not a gift gifts and callings are without repentance but character is not a gift it is a victory to gain character you have to have victories and to have victories it means to have something to overcome he says a man without character can't reign that's the problem that we see in in the country today is we got all these hoodlums running the streets writing every peaceful riot my foot hey man there ain't no such thing as people right you they may have started off that way but you know why they they're ending up the way they are because they have no character and he says a man without character cannot reign because power apart from character is satanic but power with character is fit to rule amen amen and since he wants us to share even his throne on the same basis that he overcame and is set down in his father's throne then we have to overcome to sit with him because on that day amen we will be judges too amen for those who are coming in and we have to have the right character and it won't be this well i remember how they treated me one day they had a snotty nose attitude no it won't be that kind of character it'll be a christ-like character so if we're having problems with snotty knows attitudes then we might want to change that amen lord help me you know i work out in the in the world as as as all of you do brother allen you see all kinds of people come in the bank everybody's got to go to the bank like they do the grocery store unless you're like me and you don't have a bunch of money you don't have to go to the bank very often but nevertheless you see all kinds of people you you rub shoulders with all kinds of different peoples amen and sometimes people irritate you and they rub you the wrong way amen laodicea we're not we're not exempt from laodicean spirit creeping in amongst us but we are not part of laodicea amen we are and we have been called to a higher standard than laodicea amen that's the grace that's given to us in this age amen to rise above it amen and he says and the little temporary sufferings we go through now as not worthy to be compared to the tremendous glory that will be revealed in us when he comes oh he says what treasures are laid up for those who are willing to enter into his kingdom through much tribulation so to tell you tonight that receiving the holy ghost from then on is the better roses i'd be lying to you it's going to be hard it's going to be troublesome but he did promise sister carla greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world amen and i've got that greater one in me so therefore devil i you ain't no match for me amen i have become the storm amen oh satan oh you can whisper you can howl all you want to then i'm not strong enough i admit i'm not strong enough but i'm not looking at my own strength i'm looking at the one who's living in me christ is living in me he's the strong one he's the all-knowing one amen catch us now think it not strange concerning the fiery trials that are to try you that is what peter said it is strange is it strange that god wants us to develop a christ-like character that comes through suffering no sir and we all have trials we are all tried and chastened as sons not one but goes through that and watch what he says a church that is not suffering is not being tried it hasn't got god in it take that devil take that devil amen a church that is not suffering and is not being tried hasn't got god oh my thank you lord amen i'm glad i got god in my church amen what a beautiful picture this is jesus at the door and i i read this and it just really struck my heart what a beautiful picture of the church before the church can ever be taken out of out of the critics it has to go through the critics first and then it's taken in the rapture to glory after it stood the test of criticism and it ought to make every christian happy tonight to know that you can live so in this earth not being of the earth just a pilgrim and a stranger a sojourner here knowing that our heritage is not of this world our kingdom is not of this world it's of the world that is to come knowing this that we're living in what they call the day of man the day of the lord will come that will be the day for his church all these things are earthly and will perish and notice what our lord sell all that live godly and christ shall suffer persecution every son that cometh to god must first be tried chastened child trained no exceptions every son that cometh to god must be tried and if we cannot stand the chastisement then the scripture says we become illegitimate children and not the children of god and isn't it a grand feeling to know that god's grace has carried some of you here through 20 and 30 years of trials and persecution god did that for you and it shows that you're a real child of god amen god did that for you and it's showing one thing that you're a real child of god oh my that ought to make the pope shout someday i hope the devil's listening someday in the face of all that has criticized you you'll be glorified and made a body like unto his own glorious body at his coming and we wait for that blessed hope amen i wait for that blessing of hope amen the coming of the lord jesus christ one of these churches six and nine wherever it is whatever part of the country it's six to nine amen one of these days i'm gonna wake up i'm gonna brush my teeth for the last time i'm gonna put on my working boots for the last time hey man i'm going to preach my last sermon for the last time one of these days friend we're going to take a ride amen a one-way ticket out of here and we're not coming back amen we're getting out of this old pesthouse amen and we're not coming back until it's burned and cleaned off amen that the bride can come back and live at oh glorious day i don't know about you but as the lord laid these things upon my heart my my heart just began to pound thinking lord more than ever do i realize i am a child of god i am a child of god and i'm glory bound and there ain't no devil gonna keep me from amen don't that make you feel good tonight amen let's just stand together amen we could just sing a song something really make no difference whatever brother alan or whoever wants to sing amen i think we're living in the in a glorious time church i just want to encourage you here this evening don't hang your head low keep it high amen let's be encouraged in the lord amen because there's more for us than who's against us amen the prophet one day he looked out and he says about you the only one and the lord showed him and said no you've got so many thousands over there that ain't even bow to me to balaam amen let me tell you there's a bride across this land that's not bound to the things of this world that's not bending with the changes of cultures but they're staying within the word [Music] um lord i've come [Music] [Music] away by the
