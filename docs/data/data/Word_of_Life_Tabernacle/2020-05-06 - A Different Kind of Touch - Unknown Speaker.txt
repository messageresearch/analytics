would to Matthew chapter 9 Matthew chapter 9 and verse 20 thank you for the music Matthew chapter 9 and verse 20 what a privilege it is to be in the house of the Lord I want to speak to you tonight on a different kind of touch and pray for me that I'll be able to deliver this the way that I feel it my heart we were we were studying on 1st Corinthians and we'll continue that I'm just gonna take a little break and figure out the best way to do that and now according how we feel lad but we want to look at this tonight and has just been on my heart for the last few days and behold a woman which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years came behind him and touched the hem of His garment for she said within herself if I may but touch His garment I shall be whole what kind of faith is that I may but touch His garment I shall be whole but Jesus turned him about when he saw her he said daughter be of good comfort thy faith hath made thee whole and the woman was whole from that hour I pray the Lord would add his blessing to the word you may be seated this evening as I was thinking about the situation that we're in now and one of the things that's hard is that we can't touch people like we would like to and maybe some of you don't like people touch you and so for you it's not a problem and but most of us were social creatures not only with seeing one another and being able to being in each other's presence but also with touch we have five senses which is seeing hearing being able to taste smell and touch and people usually list touch as the last of the five senses but it's probably the most important sense that you have and every time they ask doctors or scientists or whatever about this what sense could you do without the least it would be touch because if you were unable to touch you would be unable to operate to be you you wouldn't be able to stand you wouldn't be able to feel pain and so you have to be able to just to be able to have a bearing of where you're at you touch the world that you're in if you'll if you're preaching you touch the pulpit if you're sitting there in the pew you you touch the Pew you know some part of your body knows about where it is and it's how you know your position in the world and over time it's become kind of a sense of how we know our position with one another that we touch if you love someone you tend to touch that person and when you do it you know how you touch them it conveys something and there's lots of ways that I could touch my wife I could slap her across the face I would never do that but I could that would be touch but she would understand that that I wasn't happy something was wrong it wasn't me because I did I would never do that but it would still be a touch or I could walk but lay my hand on her shoulder and that would mean something I could pat her on the back that would be a touch it would mean something to her over time and something that I thought was interesting on Sunday was that we had a problem or at least I did I don't know about y'all trying not to shake hands you know how hard that is when somebody tells you not to do it right and and so we're not supposed to shake hands and I agree with that right now we're not supposed to do that and and it's the custom as far as keeping everybody safe and so I was trying to set a good example and I'm out there like this I'm not afraid to shake your hand just trying to set a good example I know this brother Danny was walking around with his hands in his pockets and you know and you're trying not to to shake hands with one another that's hard isn't it and sometimes you do it not not even thinking because you're so used to doing it and I know that there's people that would say well we should just do away with that in the world that we live in now with so many diseases and things and maybe there's some merit to that as far as diseases but it got me thinking why do we shake hands it's because we touch one another it's a way that you can touch somebody and they know so Jane that you're you're there and then that you're you're real and and your relation to that person you ever shake hands with somebody that didn't like you you know and and so there's lots of ways that you can tell out whether somebody what their attitude is and you can actually affect someone else's attitude by walking through and shaking somebody's hand in in a certain way or not shaking their hand so a handshake is important handshakes always been a sign of a cooperation I'm we're sealing the deal where we're shaking hands and you might be thinking tonight where is he going with this but there is a point to it and it goes beyond shaking hands but it's always been this this way the game of being able to meet somebody and cooperate with that person even the North and the South would shake hands the surrender of the south it was a way of the deals been made it conveyed peaceful intentions the Greeks they say started that because as far as shaking hands the way we do today because when they would shake hands they knew they didn't have a weapon in the right hand so you shake hands to no persons not armed and so you have no ill-will toward anyone it's a sacred bond it in some time in the 17th century the Quakers because back then everybody would bow or tip a hat or something like that and the Quakers were simple folk and they said well we'll just shake your hand and that's enough for us that's the common thing to do and so it become a common greeting and it's something we still do today but it's it's a way of knowing where you stand with people now in the Bible in the early church and especially in the Jewish church they didn't necessarily shake hands as much as we do but they greeted one another with a holy kiss and I think if brother David got up and and sort of saying shake hands with everybody around you if he got up and said greet your brother with a holy kiss we might have some some awkwardness today it would be a little awkward because it's just not something that we do but in that culture that's what they did they shook hands with one another and they greeted each other rather with a holy kiss and they would kiss on the neck and brother branham deals with that and talks about how that they would kiss one another and greet one another and that made you feel welcome and so the early church used this in their public assemblies they had a time set aside to greet one another they would actually greet one another and so it didn't necessarily become abuse but it just become impossible as churches grew larger and people that had at different customs and things weren't used to that and so we've moved now to shaking hands brother Adam talks about this and in shaking hands brother Branham is very Pro shaking hands if you've read the message he your brother brand was very much for shaking people's hands and I don't say this to to make us feel bad because we can't right now really and the law they they just wouldn't like us doing that somebody come on got a picture and we are all shaking hands out the church they would they would send it into the paper and we'd get put on the on the news that we're not we don't care about people and things like that but brother Branham is very proud shaking hands and what I want to get to you is that it's more than just a tradition but it's touching someone and brother Brown says though I like that he said I like a good warm feeling don't you he said I hate that old cold formal way we got people today he said they're so far away from one another he said you don't care for one another that's what's the matter he said even church members get the same way I underline that for me even church members get the same way they don't care for one another and brother Branham takes just farther than and he's talking about how when when Marian and Elizabeth greeted one another they they grabbed gave each other a hug and and and shook each other's handed and they were so happy to see one another and he said that he said that's what's the matter he said they don't care for one another he said why if anybody does anything wrong trying to shove him down he said don't shove him down pick him up help him that's right and so you could say that shaking someone's hand or being near them being able to touch them as a way of saying brother I want to help you I want to cooperate with you I want to be a part and that's why streaming as good as it is I'm so glad we were able to do that during this time but it'll never replace live church services because there's something about being together and being able to say that and being able to convey to one another we're in this together we're fellowshiping together we're right here like sitting across the table and being able to feed on the Word of God and being able to say brother I'm with you and so brother brown says don't try to criticize him and tell somebody else go to him with your arms around him go to him with your arms around him that conveys something you ever seen a little child and I've noticed melody will go up to Joe and give him a hug I'm not that comfortable with Joe yeah I'd give Joe a hug but but you know what she just goes up to him after I was ranting because she she's a little she don't have the inhibitions that we do but she looks at that as you know she's found him to be somebody that's trustworthy and somebody that gives gifts and and so that helps a lot with a child but the child is willing to do that they'll just run up to you and hug someone and I think we should be more like that when it comes to not just a physical hug or a handshake but in bringing someone into our our world letting somebody into our vulnerabilities if you could say it that way III don't necessarily feel like I I you know maybe that person they don't you don't know him that well but we're soldiers together and in the army of the Lord and we're brothers and sisters in crisis and we ought to be able to break down some barriers in fellowship with one another and I'm preaching it myself too because I tend to be a bit formal in dealing with people but if you deal with people a lot you kind of get that way you get gun-shy and you don't like to just really open up because you get hurt but you have to take it's worth it to take the risk of getting hurt in order to actually have the closeness and the companionship and the Brotherhood that comes with being together so brother Brown says he said don't try to criticize him and tell somebody else go to him with your arms around him and today he said they got so afraid they don't want to shake hands anymore he said but I like a good old Methodists pumphandle handshake I'm not preaching that to convict you that's not the point tonight about not shaking hands because I'm the leader in that I won't shake your hand tonight either so you don't have to worry about that but he said you know one of them kind he said get right down and shake we missed that don't we why because it means something in Galatians 2 and 9 James and Peter and John received Paul and Barnabas into their into their fellowship as ministers said they gave them the right hands of fellowship that we should go into the heathen they into the circumcision it was a the idea of they would grab each other's arm and they would say I'm your brother and this goes back to an old Jewish custom in Leviticus 62 you can find it where it says that if a man lied to his neighbor what was delivered him to keep or in fellowship or or let means partnership who literally means taking the right hand if you shake somebody's hand and then you didn't mean it you shook somebody's hand and then you went and and misused the money or something like that it would be maybe to farmers cooperating together to businessmen cooperating together and and then they shook the hand but the one doesn't keep up his end of the bargain and so it was a terrible thing but it was called in fellowship in fellowship it's literally putting of the hand and so we still have that today that when a business deal is done you know you go buy a car that sales going to shake your hand 15 times and and we were taught in insurance sales my dad was an insurance agent he would go out and they taught that well you should always shake their hand when you get there when you leave because it's a it's a sealing of the deal if you make a connection with that person shakes their hand look them in the eye then it's easier for to sell them something because you made that connection now brother branham talks about this right hand of fellowship in the ordination of ministers he says that's the ordination I know over the Bible he said it's the right hand of fellowship he said all that gives brother McKinney the right hand of fellowship in this church raise up your hand and then he later instructed them to go shake his hand and they laid hands on him shook his hand and he gave him the right hand of fellowship brother Branham says speaking of new converts he said I want and he does this in several places he said I want you to look and see all that standing around everywhere you it's your eyes up he said now when these people sat down he said you give them the right hand of fellowship by shaking their hand because you want the new converts to real to know that they're a parked brother branham talks in a bad way about handshakes too and you'll find that that he says it's no substitute for the Holy Ghost right just going up and shaking hands to me in the right hand of fellowship is not a substitute for the baptism of the Holy Ghost because the one who you ultimately have to touch is Christ that's who you have to touch to be safe touching me will not make you saved much as we love you and sometimes you have known for for many years and I see the Andrews here and and I've known them and when the kids were little I was surpassed her then and and but you know knowing me it's not what gets you into heaven but it's knowing him touching me doesn't get you in heaven touching even a prophet wouldn't get you into heaven but it's touching him Genesis 32 and 25 we find an instance God touching a man now it's a wonderful thing for God to touch a man and he did this through an angel or theophany or body that he would make you had to have some form that he could be in to be able to touch and so we find that he touched the hollow of Jacob's fly and was out of joint we find other instances in the Old Testament that these people could be touched by the hand of God we find no instance in the Old Testament where the people could touch God they could be touched by God but there's no record that I could find where they touched God in fact they were told in Exodus 19 and 12 that thou should set bounds under the people roundabout no God speaking to Moses said I'm gonna come down in a thick cloud he said and I want you to set a boundary around the mountain because when I come down on it if they touch it they're gonna die I think about it's like the mountain of God had a had a caution tape around it he said don't touch it because if you touch that you're gonna die said take heed that you not go up in an amount or even touch the border of it said don't touch the border don't touch the border don't touch the hem of it earlier shove it whoever touches the mouth shall surely be put to death again he says there shall I hand touch it he should surely be stoned or shot through whether it be beast or man it shall not live on the trumpet sounded falling they shall come to the mountain now I love the fact that God wanted to touch his people so it wasn't enough just to be a spirit but he came down in flesh and he came down and walked among men and touched men and we begin to find instances of Christ touching people and you don't find that so much in the Old Testament where someone would do that though Elijah laid his body on the child and so there are instances of contact but in the New Testament this language starts to be used that he talks about in Matthew 8 3 Jesus put forth his hand and touched him you touch him and he said I will be thou clean and immediately his leprosy was cleansed so by one touch she was cleansed of his leprosy and leprosy is a type of sin so he could say tonight that sin can be cleansed with the touch of his hand one touch she touched him Matthew 18:15 this was Peters mother-in-law she was laying there with a fever probably had some kind of virus and Jesus went up to her and touched her and when he touched her hand the fever left her he didn't even pray over didn't even speak anything to her he just touched her hand and she arose and ministered unto them some blind man come to him and the Bible says he touched their eyes saying according to your faith be it unto you and he must be the Messiah because whatever he touched something happened but many touched him but some touched him for the wrong reasons it matters how you touch and so I'm kind of taking the long way around and previewing our story tonight what we're going to talk about but many touch him Mary and Joseph for the first to touch him there as they add him as a baby they touched in the same way that for the Allens touching his child tonight they held him they they had him in their hands constantly because that's what you do with the baby they touched him but there's no record that he healed them they just touched his physical body the disciples touched him and what a brushed up against him would have better near him the woman of ill-fame touched his feet with her tears and many many touched him but the woman and artex touched him in a different way now in mark 524 it tells us in a little bit different telling of the story and it says Jesus went with him it was gyruss who he had gone with to go and pray for his daughter he said Jesus went with him and much people followed him and thronged him they were all touching him if you've ever been in a throng and that that biblical word is interesting because I can't you can't think of much of a comparison here in the States saying 6 foot apart shouldn't be that hard for us can we stay pretty far apart anyway but if you go overseas when you look at a jeepney full of people and crammed in there or you get on any kind of public transportation maybe New York City or someplace like that we see that kind of crowding together and you think my how could they even do that and I realized that I've told you before I realized that in Africa they don't recognize like we do personal space they just come right and you get out of the service no come on throng around you you feel like you can't breathe and it must have been the way it was with Jesus the people were throught were thronged around him they were they were pressed around him there everywhere there was people and he barely had room to walk people touching him on every side a certain woman which had an issue of blood twelve years and it suffered many things of many physicians and had spent all that she had and was nothing bettered but rather grew worse and she had heard of Jesus came and the press behind and touched his garment for she said if I may touch but it's closed I shall be whole and the Bible said straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up and she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague and Jesus immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him turned him about in the press right in the middle of all those people he turns around he stops and there's all the people touching him and he says who touched my clothes now that word touched when he said who touched me or who touched my clothes that word that he uses every time is it's a word that wasn't used commonly in the Greek but it was hepta my which is means to Kindle a fire and what it is is it's a purposeful touch it's a touch with purpose it's not just to touch by accident but to touch because you meant to right now he said somebody touched me purposefully and his disciple said unto Him thou seest the multitude thronging thee and say it's now who touched me and Jesus said and this is the way Luke tells it jesus said who touched me we're all denied Peter and they they were with him said master the multitudes throng the and Pressley they're not just touching you they're pushing you around and they're trying to get get close to you the multitude is touching you and saying Sal who touched me my brother branham explains it like this he said now we find out that a little woman had a blood issue and she pressed through the crowd to touch the border of his garment he said and now the Palestinian garment had an underneath garment because of dust getting on the legs and in a robe that went over that and Jesus thronged with the people pressing him and that little woman touching his garment he said if you if she touched your coat you'd never feel it physically and she turned and went out into the audience and Jesus stopped them all and said who touched me someone touched me he said but I perceived that I've gotten weak virtue went from me and brother Brown says it was a different kind of touch and he elaborates on this he said oh don't miss this he said that's where this educated high headed world today is missing it they're putting their name on church books but failing to touch with the feeling to touch with the feeling I think it's interesting that she never required in her statement of faith she didn't say if I can touch him and he feels me if I can touch him and get his attention she never said that she said if I can touch him he didn't need to feel it she needed to feel it and I think sometimes we miss this because there's a time we realize we don't go by feelings but a man that believes God can can feel God if we say it that way there's something about it we believe in something that is real it's not just an abstract thing but it's something that's real and there's a lot of there's a lot of counterfeit emotion out there today there's a lot of people are doing things that that it's just emotion it's just sensation but we find that if there's a counterfeit it's a proof there is a real all right if you have a counterfeit hundred dollar bill just of proof there's a real one somewhere and so there's a lot of emotion but people failing to touch with feeling and you know we get into that in our marriages brother Brown tells the story about how the man went and kissed his wife goodbye just like he always did but not with feeling right we come to church sometimes like we always do but we don't touch him we fail to touch him like we ought to and when we don't touch him we leave unsatisfied like that feeling when we don't get to shake hands with one another you just kind of feel unsatisfied because you're unable to touch and how many people go to service after service after service unable to touch Jesus and he's there but they just can't seem to appropriate the faith to to touch him failing to touch with the feeling so jesus said somebody had touched me for I perceive that virtue has gone out of me brother Branham again talking about him about this situation he said Oh Concord tonight God be merciful use that touch use that touch not I'm Methodist I'm a Baptist Pentecostal I'm Nazarene use that touch that touches him there is a touch that touches him so they aside these traditions let's touch Christ and how many times do we buy tradition we just go through the roll and I'm guilty of that as well as a ministry you go through the roll and you you do what you do but he said let's excuse the touch that touches him we'll do everything else and make sure that it's right if your car something's wrong with your car you'll go through it with a fine-tooth comb to find out what it is so you can fix it have it running right but sometimes our spiritual experience gets broken down and we get to a place where we just can't seem to touch him and when we get to that place we need to find out what's wrong go through it begin to begin to fill up with the word again begin to get in a place where we can touch him I sang but then I touch him I prayed but did I touch him I went to church but did I touch him so he said lay aside those traditions let's touch Christ you may know everything about the message all the innocent helps of all the different views that there is of the message but did you touch him were you able to to have your need met because you touched him because you felt the touch and as I said he can touch us but can you touch him tonight I believe we can know brother Branham says when Peter might have said these words to the Lord they'll think there's something mentally wrong look at the arms and hands touching you from everywhere and then say who touched me said he rebuked him for it jesus said but I felt a different kind of touch a real touch so if I'm going to come to church if I'm going to preach I wanted to have that real touch to it don't you if you if you're gonna come if you're gonna listen listen and give a part of your portion of your life to hearing the Word of God may there let there be a real touch to it it may not be something when you jump and run all over the church with something that's sincere about it something that's real something that that you just just not a middle conception of something that's alive he said I felt a different kind of touch a real touch since so many of us tonight have confessions so many of us do different things but yet there's a touch there is something that calls detention to God and God reflects himself in his child the work that he does we're supposed to do the same she is actually doing the work of Christ she is operating the gift of Christ by touching him hey Ben God was reflecting himself in her and in her life again but the round said some of some of them said why master I believe it was Peter said why the whole crowd is strong in you why that's you why everybody is touching you he said but I perceived that virtue has gone from me he got weak it's a it was a different kind of touch if we could only see that brother sister he said if you can touch him with that certain touch he said oh sick people I'm fixing to pray for you just in a few minutes he said I do believe that I have the Holy Spirit he said but no more Holy Spirit than what you've got right out there or these men has got here he said the same Holy Spirit but it's a commandment of God and if you believe that to be the commandment of God a praying for the sick and laying hands on them casting out evil spirits and the promises he has made it'll be the same thing with you you'll get what you asked for if you can believe it can we believe it tonight he said you'll get what you asked for if you can believe it it'll be the same thing with you now we could ask ourselves this question what was different about her touch what was different I notice first of all she said within herself she said if I'm in but touch His garment I shall be home why she had the faith to know that once she'd touched him she would be well when you come to him you have to believe and who he is and you have to believe in it strongly enough that you believe if I can touch him even if he doesn't acknowledge me even if I don't have maybe this great sensation but I know if I touch him hey man I can be I shall be whole she said if I touch His garment I shall be whole and she said and a woman having an issue of blood twelve years which had fit all living upon physicians neither could be healed of any so she said I can touch him and I'm just kind of going back through this to remind us why her touch was different first of all it had to be a touch of faith and now it has to be a touch that was desperate she'd come to a place where she was tired of paying doctors and she had no more money to pay them anyway you ever been there I'm sure some of you haven't and you know you get to a place where you've done everything that you can physically and you just can't move that mountain you just can't make it any different but you say well I need something what what do I have need of you need you need to touch Christ hey man you need to touch Christ and she was done with all the touching that or all the the physicians that had poked on her and prodded on her she said I need to touch Jesus and so she was desperate and she was persevering because when she'd heard of Jesus she come in the press behind and touched his garment she came in the press brotherbrother said now in that he said a little woman up on the hill maybe she spent all of her living trying with the doctors to get a cure for a blood issue she'd had it several years and so she said within herself when she seen him coming no matter what the people say I believe that the man is the son of God hey man I think we could say that tonight no matter what the people say I believe this message is true I believe he's the son of God I believe Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever no matter what the people say he didn't die in 1965 but he's still alive tonight no matter what the people say he's still a living God he's the same yesterday today and forever she said no matter what the people say I believe that man is the son of God and she pressed her way through the crowd and being a weak and anemic condition weakening as she pressed through become weaker she got weaker and she got weaker and sometimes it feels like while you're pressing that you get weak to a point where you just can't make it but remember if he give me the faith to do it he'll give you the ability to press all the way through she had to press through the crowd she said as she weakening she finally got to where he was and she maybe had to squeeze through some of them pressing her way in one place he said that she had to get through through the the founder of the Mormon Church and all of his wives in other words she had to come through maybe that doctrine she had to come through maybe a oneness Fortuna's for 3 minutes whatever that it was she had to be willing to press through it she may be come through all kinds of doctrines around the message but she had to be willing with her Harvey to press through it she had to be willing though there was a lot of fanaticism and and people could point to this one that failing this one that did wrong but she pressed through it she pressed through it because she believed that God was still alive today and you're gonna have to press through some things if you want something from God if you believe that God still operates through the ministry today you're gonna have to press through all the false to get to Christ if you believe that God is still that the church still should be on fire for God then you're gonna have to press through all the deadness you gonna have to press through all the coldness to get to him hey Beth and she had to squeeze through so many times what we knew there's very little effort in it I'm not criticizing you but I'm talking about all of us is just in the human condition there's so little effort and we think well if God wanted me to do that he just let me do it but brother Brent said God can't push you through a pipe and pull you out the other end and say blessed is he that overcomes but there's got to be some effort put into it as you can say Lord I believe if I touched you I'll be well he wants you to do that brother bear said if you ever get to Christ you're gonna have to press your way to him cuz there's gonna be all kinds of people there trying to hold you back gonna be all kinds of people and I don't look at your wife or your husband or your neighbor if there's anyone near enough to look at tonight don't look around too much but you know there's people that are just there to hold you back but you can't get your eye on them can't let them stop you can't stop and get an argument with them because that'll just make you late Jesus is passing by I'm not gonna spend my time arguing with people about the proper way to do this or the right way to do that Jesus is passing by let me get to him let me find him in the throng let me find him though many others might be doing that maybe for their free kind of purpose at all but let me find him I'm here to find him what about you tonight when you come to the house of God I'm here to find Jesus I'm here to touch the hem of His garment I know I'll be well she was determined he said she was determined so she pressed her way until she touched the border of his garment he said who touched me and the discernment began to work for the Brenham said she touched him she went back and sat down on the audience and the discernment began to work he said I know somebody touched me and Luke 847 says when the woman saw that she was not hit I want to tell you tonight that you're not hit maybe a Wednesday night but you're not hit from Christ I may not always and I know that I won't always be able to anticipate your need and be able to call you when you need a call or be able to do there's just going to be times I'll fail at that because I'm human and you tend to be able to impact the most of people you touch every day the people you touch the most and so your your children and those in your own house you you tend to be able to impact them more but then the people around you sometimes you it's not because you intend to but things slip your mind and you're not able to get to everybody and you think well I just you'd say well if he'd have just been able to see me if he just knew that I was here he just was was there at the right time to speak a word but the woman saw that she could not be hid from Christ you may be able to be hid from the pastor you may be able to be hid from the church you may be hid from society you may be sitting at home tonight and and you're sitting there by yourself and you feel hidden you feel like there's nobody that can see what you know what you're going through but you know he can see you the woman saw she was not hit you can't be hid from God you might as well just step out and begin to testify of what he's done she could not be hid she came trembling she must have loved to testify like my wife does she come trembling Britney hates to get up in public and and sister Mina was that way and brother Browns wife and and he would embarrass her by and the people would embarrass her and she would threaten him I sort of like before the meeting and say don't whatever you do don't let them call my name she didn't like to testify some people do and some don't this woman must have been that way she pretty shy but she felt the healing touch of God she didn't have to make the biggest commotion nobody else knew that she'd come to church that day but jesus knew it nobody else saw her in the crowd but Jesus saw her and he gave her an opportunity to come forth and give her testimony and she came trembling and falling down before him she declared unto Him before all the people for what cause she had touched him and how she was healed immediately and he said unto her daughter be of good comfort thy faith hath made thee whole go in peace and mother and I'm always points out that word whole is so so and the Greek it means more than just her body but it's her soul she'd already been healed of the problem but now she was saved hey Ben she was made whole because she touched him and the Bible tells us tonight that we have a high priest and he says it like this we have not a high priest which cannot be touched so he's saying we have a hype which can be touched we don't have a high priest like like to Aaron we don't have a high priest like like that he would bear the sins of the people and go in once a year to the to the atonement to make it at Ulmer for the sins of Israel but he couldn't be touched by their infirmity but we have a high priest who can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities and that word me say empathize with or to have empathy for but brother branham always used it in conjunction with this story this woman and the next verse says let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace let's come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need why do we come boldly because we have a high priest who can be touched we're not there like they were at the mountain and a caution pay put around it say don't patch but we have a God who can be touched even when we can't touch one another even when we are unable to touch like we want to we're unable to do for one another like we want to but we have a god who's able to touch and we are able to touch him touch as I said matters number the Branham something you'll find if you listened to prayer lines brother Branham will say this he'll say what did she touch she said that 79 times that I found in the message what did she touch or he'll say what did he touch he said that 31 times that I found 28 times he says what did they touch you'll get down he'll go through the crowd and it'll always be people in the crowd that are away from him and he'll begin to call him out and deserve and tell them their name where they come from and all these things that he'll say what did she touch what did he touch what did they touch you see God's not limited to just up here but maybe somebody in the nursery somebody in the back room somebody that's wrestling with a baby somebody that's taking care of their children see well I shouldn't even come to church but you can touch it and so he would call him out he'd say what did they touch what did she touch what did he touch and even speaks and I want us to get this tonight as we think about it touching we want to touch Christ but we also want to touch one another and I mean in a deeper way than just physically touching one another but we want to impact one another's lives and sometimes being at a service and physically touching someone or waving at someone or saying hello impacts their life in a certain way the fact that you are at a service and I don't fully understand this but brother BAM talks about how the way one child behaves in one service in the sanctuary could be could affect the next service my children over the years have caused some bad services later but but brother Branham talks about that right brother Allen that's right I know y'all have kids so mine are getting older I can I can preach about this but it's not I'm not saying that a negative way it's just cause and effect the things we do but think about us older folks that are able to sit up and listen come to church if we come it affects the service every person who comes to a service affects that service every person who's president has some effect for good or bad or whatever it is has some effect on that service now listen to this brother Branham calls out a man in the audience he says you think you'd get over them ulcers said you was praying for that wasn't you sir he said I don't know you do I never seen you in my life he said that's right raise up your hand you're a nervous person real nervous I identify with this man sometimes back here I can't hardly think and and brother Helens seen me just Spectre a few times knows I'm nervous before church sometimes I'm nervous standing up here many times but this man was a nervous man I identify with that I know what that's like that you're a nervous person real nervous which just caused you to have ulcers he said go on and preach the word now you're a preacher anyhow he said so you go preach the word well that's wonderful but look where he goes with it he said you got your arms around your friend there so he must have put his arm around or on the back of the Pew or the seat where his friend was I come with into the meeting maybe he saw him he was struggling or something I don't know what it was but you can imagine any number of reasons why I might have had his arm around this other man and he said I see got your arms around your friend so what do you think about this sir you believe me to be his prophet or a servant you do if he were revealed to me what you want will you accept it now he's speaking to the man that the other man had his arms around he's already talked to the preacher he's pretty speaking to the other man he said of course you're wearing glasses a man your age should wear glasses praise the Lord I've gotten scripture for it or I've got message for it maybe we won't we won't make a doctrine out of that but I said a man your age should wear glasses but that's not it said your eyes are going bad you want prayer for your eyes that's what you want you've got arthritis too you want prayer for that so that's right isn't it man had some problems about the problems that a man that age probably would have right but he said that's right isn't it he said are you except you're healing now he said raise up your hand if you do it's over you can go home be well your faith has healed you he said what did they touch I want you to notice how God works because God can use you to touch him for someone else so it's like a connection you touch him and you touch your brother or your sister your wife or your children you impact their lives God can use you to touch him for someone else he said what did they you know reverently what did they touch before god I've never seen either man know nothing of them but someone was praying it was the big man there was doing the praying man identified with this quote it was the big man there was doing the prank and because he was sitting with his body around the other man as a contact that's what done it for the next man the next man wasn't even praying that's what brother Brown said he said that man was praying someone was praying was the big man doing the praying and he was standing with his body around the other man is the contact that's what done it for the next man he said now ask for them hey bet they were both healed they were both called out because the big man was there now what if the big man didn't come to church well number one his friend may not have come and if he had come he to baby been sitting alone no one would have had their arm around him maybe he'd have never been called out you say these things don't matter it does matter brother branham would take a vision and it would have to be exactly the same way everything would have to be just in order the way it was or he wouldn't pray for the person until it was because the vision had to be exactly correct God knew exactly who would be here tonight and if you had your arm around someone if you were touching someone if you had some contact with someone that you helped them get here and you invited them maybe you brought them here maybe it's a member of your family but God puts you in their life for a reason and God put this man in the other man's life for a reason the big man he put him in his life for a reason because the other man needed to be healed hey babe he said now ask them God be the judge he said now does Jesus Christ remain oh ask yourself this question tonight before we close does Jesus Christ remain the the high priest that can be touched with the feeling of our infirmities hey man do we believe it tonight does he remain the high priest that can be touched with the feeling of our infirmities is he alive tonight if he's alive tonight then he's still able you're still able to touch him and you're still able to touch others hey bet your presence still has an impact your presence in the house of God your present senses in the body of Christ as a member of a local church it has something to offer why because you can touch him hey bet and you can touch others I was impacted in my life by people who touched me and maybe you perhaps you were too in some of you that are older maybe even more closely than I was but I was impacted by people who were around a prophet and they impacted my life because they knew him and maybe they didn't get everything right maybe they even messed up and didn't do the right things but there was just something they'd been near him and so there's just little tidbits that come down him and so we learned what a prophet was like and and we learned that God made himself real in our generation and God does some things for us sometimes we don't even understand and if you go to a message called the future home of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride brother Branham in that wonderful message has a discernment line kind of at the end he just calls out people in the audience and there's people sitting there who were from this area and sister Alexander and sister Brown we're both I believe from this area sister Brown and not at the time but just a brown was at the time lived up by Alton Missouri mr. may brown and he said while he's speaking after he spoke sister Alexander and before he spoke to sister Brown he said what did she touch he said the same thing that woman with the blood issue touch the border of his garment not mine he speaks to sister Brown and I'm going to read it to save time but he speaks to sister Brown and he talks about how does she have sinus trouble and and she didn't come there she was kind of like that that man sitting beside the other man she just happened to be there she didn't come there for her own trouble but for a friend and she was just there at that service just happened to be there she didn't understand what he was saying she didn't bless her heart sister Brown when she was 19 years old she she had some knowledge of this message but it wasn't what maybe we would have today sitting here she was a wonderful person and I was privileged to be her pastor but she maybe didn't know those things but she touched Christ and somehow sitting out there and brother man makes his statement he said I don't know you but he does it and he called her out by name and he let her live long enough so that I could sit in her living room and listen to her tell me the story and I would sit there as her pastor at the time and listen to her tell me the story and I'm sitting there and that it just becomes such a touchstone for me because people can say well it's not true and I can say I know sister Brown to be a saint of God who told that story for for six 50 or 60 years from before she passed away at the age of 100 and I knew that she was a saint and a woman of God and so that would become something I knew that if she touched Christ through brother Brian's ministry I could touch Christ as well even though brother Branham was gone he said why did they touch what did they touch he wasn't a man but they touched the same thing that the woman with the bloody shoe touch o church what do we need to touch him with a different kind of touch we need to touch him with a touch of faith a touch of expectation a touch of desperation God let me get through until I know that other people may not know the church may not know you may not even get his attention for everybody to know but she knew and when she knew then he knew and so she touched just to him of His garment he couldn't feel it physically but it drained the strength out of him why because that virtue went out to heal her oh my if we could only touch him our services would be different if we could reach out and touch him our response to the Word of God would be different if we can reach out and touch him how he how we feel about God different just reach out grab hold of the hem of his garment they couldn't come in the Old Testament to the border of the mountain but she could come to the border of the garments of Christ and say if I can just touch it I'll be well hey Ben amen do you believe it tonight do you love him amen then if we believe that he's still the same yesterday today and forever would you just raise your hands to him tonight just touch him things aren't like we want them to be right now we want to be able to touch one another shake hands with one another but I want to know that I can still touch him I can still touch him when you reach out today you can still touch him you don't have to wait for another time you don't have to wait for another service or a high-powered evangelist to come through you can touch him right now you can touch him by faith tonight and you can know that you touched him and say um I'll be well I know I'll be well Heavenly Father we love you tonight we thank you that we're able to touch you father my hands are raised today father believing I need a touch from you God and I know every one of these people or and I don't want to preach without touching you in that way I don't want to sing I don't want to congregate Lord with my brothers and sisters unless I've touched you oh god I pray father that you would just move in this little audience tonight I pray that you'd break down every tradition and every barrier help us to touch you with feeling help us to touch you in the way Lord that we know that you can that we can feel it so that we can know I touched God tonight I touched God tonight something about it I may not have been on this child and run over the building but I touch God somehow I come in contact with the supernatural and when I did I know that everything's gonna be okay Fred granted tonight Lord I pray you at heal every disease every sickness father in this age when diseases are flying around the air we know the devil is the Prince and power of the air God you even stopped the storms stop the air the wind from moving and blowing when ten thousand demons of the sea swore they'd kill you you stopped it Lord you said peace be still may the winds of disease be stilled tonight may there be Florida a reality that we touch you God if I come here and preach it I study all week and I try to come and preach with all of my heart what good does it do if I can't make that touch oh that touch that I know that I've touched you Lord father and if I touch you then I can touch my brother my sister and I know that you can do something for them as well I mean we all feel that way Lord Father that we can touch not just for ourselves but for those we come in contact with that we can touch them like the man did just had his arm around him Oh God may we be willing to do that doesn't matter how wrong the man may be doesn't matter doesn't matter whether the sister maybe talked about us sir something was different but God we want to be able to put our arms around him give him the right hand of fellowship shake hands with them and when the time comes Lord we can do that and put our arm around woman Oh God so that we can know they can know that we're their brother we want to help them maybe there won't be perfect and they'll fail and fall many times but they can receive something from you if I can touch you I can touch you and I can touch my children you can make everything right if I could get a hold of your heart Lord but that virtue can flow to me then I can raise my children in the right wait if that virtue can flow to me Lord then I can rain I can help the church if not I can't do anything Oh God maybe everyone feel that the impact of that tonight if I could touch you let there be nothing in the way oh god I pray we wouldn't let the internet stop the service or the world tapas or our job stop us God that we would press through tonight and we would press through every service that we would press through until we knew we touched you lord I pray you granite Lord for each and every one of us Oh God we see the world that we're living in we see the time or the strong clothes it's very near I don't want my children to be raised up in a place where it's just a head knowledge I don't want them to be around and just be around the message and become acquainted with it I want them to feel that touch to be able to touch you Lord to know what it's like to touch the hem of your garment Lord there's so many things coming on this earth plagues and diseases and distress of nations and wars and rumors of war we see previews all around us overcoming tribulation Okabe we'd be more sincere than we ever were or Jesus may we resign ourselves to your touch Lord let us be desperate so that we might come press through the throng touch the hem of your garment we know everything will be okay granted father we pray thank you for sending a message Lord that we could know in this hour that you were real and you walked among us Lord it wasn't a man but there was there was God that come down in the form of the word and walked among his people the Son of man was revealed and now we know that you're not you didn't leave you're still here Lord so we ask you to come father and help us to recognize your presence she had to recognize there was something different about him before she could touch him help us to recognize you're here Lord and touch you with faith believe God that you're able to meet every one of our needs and if father we pray Lord I I just feel your presence tonight it I don't
