Revelation chapter 6 and verse 7 will go right quickly into the word tonight I've got quite a bit in this fourth seal we're trying to get condensed into this one service so we'll do that and I hope you've enjoyed the uh so far the overview that we've done the brief overview I hope it inspires you to go back and look uh in the seals and begin to study some of these things I believe we know where we're at and we know what time we're living in and I I think you think well that's something I learned years and years ago I have found things that I had forgotten things that I didn't know Revelation and things that I maybe I've not even presented all of it to you but as I've studied these things I thought you know it's been good for me and and so I hope it's been good for you too sometimes we just need to take a step up and say brother Ben I'm going through it right now I've got trouble in my life got trouble in my home got trouble in my body well sometimes you need to take a step up with the with the anointing of the Age The Eagle anointing to be able to see up above all of that stuff and looks over Church Strife looks over all those things and says hey you know where you're at you know who you are you're a son or daughter of God you belong to God and and we just need to take that step up and and take a look at the big picture for a minute and realize we belong to God Amen nothing the devil could do to take us out of who we are amen amen we're on the rock of revelation of the word amen amen Revelation 6 7 thank you for being here tonight when it opened the fourth seal I heard the voice of the fourth Beast say come and see and I looked and behold a Pale Horse and his name that said on him was death and the Hell Followed With Him and power was given unto them over the fourth part of the Earth a kill was sword and with Hunger with death and with Beasts of the Earth let's bow our heads together for a word of prayer I wonder if you've got a special need you'd like to make known or wave uplifted a hand God sees each and every one of those needs Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we're so thankful for your comforting presence we feel here tonight or no matter what we've been through during the week or what we've done Lord we can add our voice to the song I'm not giving up because we know Lord that you will not give up on us we thank you for that Lord Lord we can do all things through you who strengthens us and so we come boldly tonight or believing that you will give Revelation it will give strength Lord whatever these needs are that were represented by an uplifted man or whatever needs of those many that are watching tonight I pray God that you'd bless them Lord go into every home not just tonight Lord but every night through the week I pray that your Holy Spirit would would settle down over the homes every place where the token is applied Lord May there be a strength that would come up a victory Lord that we would know Lord we may be still fighting the battle but we know we have the victory because you're on our side I pray you granted Lord we love you we thank you for your presence we pray you bless these people in Jesus name amen God bless you can be seated finally come to the last of the Four Horses The Pale Horse the living creature that showed John this seal was the eagle represented the prophet this is where we are looking at the end of all things I I remember as we're approaching this seal now we we're not uh we're approaching some things that are in the future and I as we begin to look at these things it's like traveling out west if you've ever been on a highway at night as you're going you come up like coming to El Paso or a city like that and you'll come up over a hill and you'll look and you'll see the whole city out in front of you and you haven't reached it yet in fact it may be 30 minutes away but you can see it it's there and that's where we are some of these things haven't taken place yet as far as as far as the Antichrist becoming who he is and taking the heart of obese some of the things you'll you'll hear Brother random talk about tonight you'll see uh in the words on the screen some of those things are yet in the future but we see it but we don't have to be scared of it because we know that we'll never reach that place we're going home amen so we can see the end of all things we can see things taking place all around us but we're caught up don't ever lose sight of this we're not caught up in the fourth steel we're not caught up in the Sixth Seal or the fifth seal we're caught up in the mystery of going which is the seven seal the mystery of the seventh seal we're caught up in that and the revelation of that and we need to remember that as we approach these things now this writer or this horse he said come and the living creature said come and see the fourth mystery the book of redemption that's been hidden in this book and John went to see and he saw a Pale Horse and he said again the same writer upon this Pale Horse now he has a name called Death he said now notice none of the other horses no no time that this rider ever rode they didn't have a name but this one had a name he had been identified now he's called Death what he had he been identified by by the eagle right he's been exposed who he is remember in the first field they thought well that could be the church that could be something else and the second seal kind of began to see who he was but they still thought well it could be something else but this one no one thinks this one is good right this is death why because it's been exposed by the eagle anointing now he's called Death he's not aren't you glad for the message of the day it exposes death so we don't have to die amen so now I again it's not revealed under the lion anointing or the ox anointing or the man anointing but it's revealed under the eagle anointing he said but in the eagle age the last age the prophetic age where there is to rise prophetic utterancy to whom the secrets always come now if you go back and read the fourth seal and as you begin to listen to it you'll find other random lingers for some time during that seal on Elijah Ministry and the need for the Elijah Ministry and the promise of the Elijah Ministry now I will say this Elijah has come and gone and they did to him what they were supposed to and we don't need another Elijah Elijah's come the word has been introduced and taken the preeminence Among Us and I'm so glad he come and said Behold the Lamb of God who's taken away the sin of the world he's been here and gone he's done his part and now it's time to do our part but but he he comes down on that really hard so the people could see so we could see so he goes on he said God always Likens His prophets to Eagles he calls himself an eagle the eagle goes so high there ain't nothing else can touch him not only is he up there but he's built for that position when he gets up there he can see where he's at see he said a crow couldn't follow him he'd he'd explode or implode up there he's not pressurized to fit it but aren't you glad he didn't just call him to be an eagle but he called Eagles to go with him up there because wherever the carcass is the Eagles plural are gathered together so he can see where he's at now uh here Here Comes death rioting he said he was natural both natural and spiritual death in the natural 68 million natural deaths billions of spiritual deaths he he said in this fourth horse he said the first one was white and then the next one was red and the next one was black the fourth one all of these other three was represented in it because pale is red and white and so mixed together so he's all three horses mixed together so in the Antichrist Remember come uh in four stages it was three and one uh just like just like God is he remember he copies everything God does and so he first come and say Antichrist white second false prophet read the third the vicar of heavens and earth and Purgatory black and forth the Beast Pale Horse which is really just the three and one but it's him becoming incarnate Satan being kicked out of heaven he said and you find that in Revelation 12 13 we won't go to Revelation 12. uh but you you can go read that when you get home Satan being kicked out of heaven and then in Revelation 13 1 brother says one and eight I think is the way he says that whenever brother Brandon says Revelation 13 1-8 or Revelation 10 1-7 uh he's saying one through seven in one place he says inclusive but that's what he says they put a comma there but actually I think it should be a dash because it's one through eight where he's incarnate in the person of the beast in verse 8 it tells us that all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship Him whose aims were not written in the Book of Life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world what does that mean it means we won't worship him because our names are written in the Book of Life so he said we find out here this Satan after being kicked out of heaven incarnates himself in the Beast and now he's a beast Antichrist false prophet and now Beast been given the name of death and Hell follows him fully Satan on his throne he said now this happens later on now watch a prophet places this he said he is false prophet now he will become Beast after a while when he breaks his Covenant with the Jews so we know the moment when he becomes the Beast is when he breaks the Covenant in the midst of the three and a half years he said here he is sitting here with this beastly heart in him now here's the other person the Beast the Incarnate devil he said watch he rides a pale horse as he appears on his ride this last ride he said he's on his last now now now and if you watch the way but remember the seals and all like the church ages right there's not a definite starting date and a definite ending day but it Blends even the church ages blend but the seals more so because the first four seals cover it all and then you go back in the fifth and sixth and seventh now and run concurrently now if you don't understand that we're going to slow down when we get to the seventh seal and go over some of these things now he said it's he said it's on its last now so he's on his last tribe he said but that is not in our day what is done in our day the Beast is becoming incarnate he said that will be on down it's Cecile foretold he said because see the church has done gone up when this happens so the eagle showed us what is coming right and I can dwell on that for a while Church don't be afraid of what's coming you you can't be afraid of politics because if you if you fear that if you spend all your time on that you're saying that you doubt whether or not you're going up but a prophet if he's if he's right about anything he's right about this right we're going up before that so we should not live our life in fear of an antichrist system controlling the Earth because we're going home hey man yet he is in control today but he's going to become incarnate it's going to get a lot worse right for the world it's going to become a time when you don't want to live here it was hard enough to live through covert wasn't it that was a difficult time to live on the earth some of us are if the Lord tarries we're going to tell our grandchildren but bless God I made it through coven what did you go through huh it was it was a terrible time it was a it was people went crazy but there's much worse coming much worse coming but on the earth and there'll be much more control and much more things that will happen on the earth that's coming down the road but we're going home before that happens we may see different things come and let cover different things that will come that'll show us some of those things that are coming because he's on his last drive but before that happens we go home so this fellow appears and becomes completely the devil from Antichrist all the way down through false prophet and into the Beast the Devil Himself I'll say this if you're if you find yourself always fussing and fighting with other believers there's something big coming we need to look at the big picture right not spend all of our time worried about somebody that offended us need to look at the big picture there's a there's some problems coming down the road I just want to make sure that I make it in Brother David I just want to make sure that whether I go by way of the Grave or go by way of the Rapture that I'm ready at that time ready to go home so he's he's riding he's riding on a Pale Horse colored all up mixed with all kinds can't you see him coming mixed up just a mixture of everything all sorts of powers all controlled by one person to make him pale and deathly he said but when our Lord appears here on Earth he'll be riding on a Snow White Horse he'll be completely fully Emmanuel the word of God incarnate in a man a horse is a beast that represents a power his power is all mixed up why it's politics National Powers it's religious Powers it's demon powers all kinds of powers mixed together see he declared himself King over Purgatory but actually what he is is king of devils the king of demons a mixed Pale Horse he said he got all kinds of powers when Jesus comes it's not on a mixed horse it's one solid color horse the word hey man he said three powers United together see all mixed up in a color pale death spoke in the whole thing political religious and demon powers mixed together listen we don't go home on political powers we don't go home on demon powers we're not going to defeat the enemy with religious powers having the bigger church or the bigger well we're not going home on that we're not going home on the politics of the world we're not going home on those things we're going home on the word keep your mind focused on the word keep your eyes on the word that's how we're going home hey man you said so politics he's the king of politics Satan is he said smart sure don't try to outwit him yeah amen just trust the Lord that's all right he said the fourth stage of this writer is called death death means Eternal separation from God that's what death means to be eternally separated from God now he explains to us that Saints sleep they don't die remember Jesus told him he said she's only sleeping they said well she's dead but she's only sleeping Saints sleep they don't die you have eternal life brother Brandon said the kind of life that the flowers have is Perpetual life things that are to be said that's Perpetual life they go down in the fall and they come back up in the spring you don't have Perpetual life you have eternal life why because there's a part of you that never dies and let me tell you this it was never born it always was there's a part of you that was eternal before the oh my well how can it be defeated how can it not go back where it came from because it's a part of you that come from God going back to God amen so Saints sleep they don't die and he said now remember this Antichrist himself being the man his bride now see he's got a bride which is his church was given us space to repent and she did not do it and that church hates that tyrant so let's go back a little bit because now during the time of this black horse rider Catholic Church we know them today was given a space to repent and they were given that space to repent under that church age in the dietary Church age they were given a space to repent under the message of Luther and others who came out and at reformers who came out and exposed to church gave them a space to repent God gave them a chance and they didn't do it of course he knew she wouldn't do it Revelation 2 20 he said notwithstanding of a few things against Faith because our sufferers that woman Jezebel which calleth herself a prophetess to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication to eat things sacrificed into idols and I gave her space I gave her space to repent of her fornication and she repented not behold I will cast her into a bed and then the commit adultery with her into Great Tribulation except they repent of their deeds I will kill her children with death now watch so this this Jezebel has children see there's a mother Harlot and there's daughters right in the Book of Revelation so this Jezebel has children he said I'm going to kill her children with death that's a strange wording isn't it I'll kill him with this with what spiritual death I'll kill her children with death and all the churches shall know that I am he would search us the Reigns and the hearts and I will give unto every one of you according to your Works he said I will kill them with death he said if they're killed they're eternally separated he said remember he gave her a space to repent Arian age was the Dark Age the dark horse rider wrote in that time when all the masses and everything had to be paid for the prayers the novenas and so forth now see his black horse after he refused to repent and thy attire changes his writing from a black horse to a pale one death for his last Ministry so he's not fully Beast yet but he's already changing over onto this Pale Horse Ride Now brother Branham goes on if you go into the fourth steel and talks about that individual rejecture he said let me shake you for a minute if you reject one day he said you'll reject God for the last time listen to me tonight church I know we're mostly Christians sitting here tonight but if you're if you're a person that has turned down the voice of the holy spirit in your life maybe conviction over something or another you you need to follow the word you need to do what God says you need to believe God you need to just just repent you might as well just let it go because he's going to get you one way or another but you might as well just repent because one day it'll be the last chance he's given us a space to repent while Mercy is on the throne while there's time to repent I don't care what you've done Now's the Time to repent don't leave little things between you and God don't leave little things between you and your wife don't leave little things between you and your husband don't leave little things between you and other people in the church no no don't let it sit there little unforgiveness and bitterness this is the hour when the bride is called it was a Zeal to repent do you believe that tonight amen for the individual rejects just like the church did but that church rejected him all the way back in that early Reformation h uh so he said see the loving long-suffering of God before he passed judgment upon her he gave her a place to repent a place to repent oh my and it's in the name of the Lord I say this he has give the Protestant Church the same thing now this just happened lately right 1956 he said America got her last chance right but it just happened where he gave the Protestant Church the same thing and she won't do it he said the message that shook everywhere you realize this message was bigger than just us right this message was for a reason sometimes you look at the message you begin to think look at all the things brother saying why is he even saying that well he's not just preaching to us is preaching to us but not only to us he also gave us space oh my for the Protestant church to repent right that's what he was doing that's what God was doing through the ministry of a prophet he said she's going to have her own dogmas and Creeds I don't care how much you explain it you talked about the last plague that was in Egypt was death he said that's the last plague that's hit the Pentecostal Church his spiritual death she's dead he said that's in the name of the Lord she is spiritually dead he gave her a place to repent and she rejected it now she is dead she'll never rise again he said the sleeping virgin would not get the oil right remember when they showed back up the door was already shut they'd have to go through tribulation period even even the Virgin had to go through tribulation period to be purified but we go home are you with me so far now this is an important principle her rejection makes the perfect way for Satan to come into her and be incarnate so it's the principle of if you reject the Holy Spirit then then something worse will come on you if you disbelieve God something worse will come on you actually becomes incarnate he said that's exactly the same thing that the Protestant church becomes a harlot is because she rejects the Vindicated truth of the word of God and that gives the devil a place to come right in and incarnate himself and he'll make an image unto the beast when they consolidate them together right right Yonder now going just exactly what he said he said see how long-suffering aren't you glad you serve a good god a god with long suffering what a wonderful you realize how long he worked with that Protestant church he worked with her all from the time of Luther he worked first with the Catholic church for all of those years and then he worked with the Protestant church for all of those years trying warning them trying to give them a space to repent all through the powers of the message you give them a space to repent but she turned it down oh my I'm so glad the bride got something inside of her that she will repent and she will turn to God she will be in a state of Revival I believe that at the end time not a state of emotional Revival not a state of intellectual Revival but a word Revival there'll be something in her longing for the word of God oh my look where did she fall from he said oh look let me back up he said see a long-suffering what a wonderful love there's no love like that look at those even spit on his face and things he forgave them he said that's God look he said she was asked to repent go back to where she fell from now where did she fall from from the original word of the apostolic Apostles and Prophets that's where she failed from that's where the Protestant fell from right now look repent he said go back turn back before it's too late you see the heart of a prophet he's preaching to that Protestant church he said he said one of these days that lamb will leave his place then it's all over so it's her daughter's been asked now he said before being judged with her to return back then what did they do they finally form up in the image unto the Beast another Power notice an act of the Lamb's bride like she did in Revelation 13 14. you realize what we're doing the message has to get out it gets out to get the last one true but also has to get out because it's the last warning to the church and so Revelation 13 14 so he now watch he says they finally form up an image to the Beast so the Protestant Church treats the bride he said like Revelation 13 14. where he says he deceiveth him that dwell in the Earth but the means of those Miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the Beast saying to them that dwell on the earth that they should make an image to the beast that's how he treats her he's pushing her saying to her you should make an image to the Beast you should you should all get along you should accept the Trinity Doctrine you you should just be like everybody else right that's how he treats the bride saying to them that dwell on the earth they should make an image to the Beast which had the wound by a sword and did lift so death followed this writer Hell Followed this Rider Revelation 6 8 he said I saw Pale Horse pale horse's name that said on him was death and Hell Followed With Him He said now hell always follows death in the natural he said when the natural man dies hell follows him that's the grave Hades see in the natural you exhibit in the spiritual so Lake of Fire he said all right into Eternal separation where they're burnt up I want to say this and maybe we'll take it sometime as a thought but I've had this thought lately you know you have to bury your past there's a reason for that you have to bury your past and the reason we bury our past is because you can't let your past rule your future right but there's also a truth in your past that your past when buried it actually can become fertilizer if I could say it that way for your future right the seeds got to go on the ground and die and rock but when it rots and it loses its form and and it just becomes dead then what happens it actually becomes fertilizer so not you don't go through anything without a purpose everything you go through is part of the dirt right that makes the seed grow yeah think about it for a minute the seed has to rot so so it has to go through Grace So hell Hades follows death but in the spiritual it's the Lake of Fire exit into Eternal separation where they're burnt up he said look what this is all coming to what is it it's going right back the way it did he said it started in heaven it's coming to the End Time battle watch see how this Force feels wrapping everything up he said no the battle started in heaven it'll be finished on Earth in the form of Armageddon Antichrist refuses the true bride Doctrine and therefore he takes his own bride now builds her up under a Creed of his own takes his own bride makes for a denomination she gives gives birth to other denominations he said as quoted in the Holy scriptures gives birth to daughters and she becomes just like her mother natural worldly denominational opposing the spiritual bride the word he talks about Esau and Jacob he said he's Gathering them together on his mixed colored horse because he's got political power remember I already got the politics but he gathers his religious power and his demonic power he pulls them all together and he writes so they are gathered by that now I love this they are gathered by literally gathered by false Doctrine two Armageddon their commonality is a trinity Doctrine that gathers him to Armageddon but we'll prove it by the scriptures Revelation 16 13. he said I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon out of the mouth of the Beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet but they are the spirits of devils working miracles which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world to gather them what is it the three unclean spirits like frogs the Trinity Doctrine to gather them into the Battle of that great day of God almighty they're gathered by false word to the battle of Armageddon he said now watch where he gathers them from the four corners of the earth they're Gathering now I I know maybe he said brother Ben it's just it doesn't interest me maybe it should I'm not condemning you for being tired that's that's the way we are you know on Wednesday night I've got service the next Thursday night Friday night Saturday morning or Saturday they're doing something special at the church up there tomorrow night and then the meeting's coming up and and we got all that going on and but you know what we need to just take a step aside and let us let our Spirits be lifted up for a moment because we're being gathered by something yeah or either being gathered by this or by demonic power oh I want to be gathered to the word don't you so they were gathering now for The Showdown The Showdown will be at Armageddon according to the word he said now here they are joining themselves together coming to that Showdown to Armageddon riding on a mixed colored horse one horse of white one horse of red one horse of black three different political Powers spiritual power controlled by demon power which is the Antichrist mixing that all together you got a pale sickly looking thing he's riding on look what he's writing on this pale looking grizzled colored horse mixed with black red and white coming to the battle Gathering his subjects from every nation under Heaven he said did not Daniel interpret the dream seen that streak of iron run into every Kingdom of Rome remember the toes where we're a mixture of iron and clay right that iron that Roman system run into every Kingdom now I hate to burst your bubble but that iron that runs into every Kingdom we're part of that as a nation right he got politics don't get wrapped up in politics he's already got that he said now here they come Gathering they're gathering in now to do oh my God bringing his subjects from the four corners of the earth riding a pale sickly three-colored mixed horse same man but he's not the only one doing the Gathering he said in Revelation 19 not only is he getting ready but Christ is getting ready to meet him he said the battle is going to be hot and heavy Christ is gathered his not from the four corners of the Earth because there's going to be a little bitty remnant what's he doing he's Gathering them from the four corners of Heaven now think about it the bride will not represent a large number of the people on the Earth but there's a large number with him right and but what what does that large number come from from the four corners of Heaven when he comes back after the marriage suffered what what who is this with him he's gathered them from the four corners of Heaven amen he said he also has a name not death so he look listen death was identified in our day how many know that guess what's identified in our day but life was also identified by the same message had the same Prophet life was identified and we've got to recognize that today no matter what you're going through no matter what's happened around you no matter what's going on I know I know it's hard to look away sometimes but we need to recognize the word that we have life has been exposed in our day just like death has been exposed he said he said now he said he also has a name not death but the word of God life amen God wrote right on his thigh the word of God he said that's the only life because God is the only source of eternal life there is Zoe he's got wrote life amen so what is the word life hey man it's a Living Word not a dead letter A Living Word he said he's got wrote Life riding on a white horse and here is a man with three different powers mixed up Called Death Gathering his Earthbound delegates and Christ is gathering his heaven-born subjects faith those with him are on white horses also they are the they're called listen the chosen before the foundation of the world he said amen and they are faithful to the word called chosen before the foundation of the world now watch called before the foundation of the world chosen before the foundation of the world and then faithful to the word by their choosing yes yeah see you can't help but be called you you had nothing to do with you being caught but you do have something to do with being faithful that's what a prophet taught us you you're faithful to the word I'm so glad that God has brought a faithful little group together in Hardy Arkansas and other places even around here many places many churches that represent of faithful people that are faithful to the word not faithful to a pastor not faithful to a church although that's good but faithful to the word by their choosing glory to God oh see you get to choose whether to come to church you get to choose whether to serve God that's the truth we're a free world agent but we didn't choose whether to be called we didn't choose whether to be elect we were already at the elect but we got to choose to be faithful amen all he said all stimulated look at this group that's riding with him he said they're chosen they're faithful and they're stimulated with new wine and oil just riding Right Along coming down to meet him he said here we see life and death coming to the final struggle the White Horse of True Life The Pale Horse of mixed Creed he said white was the only original color he said and when if he is the White Horse and he is the word then to mix anything with that any kind of creed add one word to it take one word from it is to pervert the whole thing truth and error cannot mix how many know that tonight it cannot mix it's either thus saith the Lord or it's wrong let me tell you somebody says the Lord said it better be the Lord said it's either thus saith the Lord or it's wrong no matter what Holy Father said it Saint bonifer the Archbishop of Canterbury he said I don't know who said it if it's contrary to the word is perversion it won't mix he said why this fellow done I don't care what he done how much holy he is anything like that this is the only he said this is the only direct truth that we have huh no church no Creed has no truth if it's outside of this how do you know he's holding up his Bible because he many times did that I said this is the only truth that we have how is this battle going to go yeah you want to know how it's going to go he told us he said it's going to go like this John Jesus Promised John 11 25 Jesus said unto her I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though that he were dead yet shall he live whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die but leave us now this amen and of course that scripture and he said Here Comes Satan with all four corners of the Earth with his Protestants with his Catholics all together marching right up to the battle of Armageddon and here comes Jesus coming down from heaven with resurrected Saints Vindicated word I love this somehow with Harvey I'd forgotten this or I missed it or something but we will vindicate him at his third coming who do you think vindicates him now think about it for a minute you vindicate the word by being raised from dead trespasses oh my you realize what you're doing you realize what you're doing but the Journey about living the gospel in your day you you actually vindicate the word of God you vindicate the word by being raised by being quickened by being filled with the Holy Spirit in our day you Vindicated me so I don't feel much like a Vindication I got struggles I sometimes have a hard time staying awake in church but you're a Vindication because you were dead once and you're alive today hey man you were you were dead and lost in in sins and trespasses you were you were without God you were ungodly you drank and smoked and carried on or you had a religious spirit on you but one day you came to life for the daddy and when you come to life you Vindicated the word of the hour what Vindication do we need of the message of the hour it's you amen you are his vindication Here Comes Jesus from heaven with resurrected Saints Vindicated word he said notice you want to know how the battle is going to go you come with resurrected Saints vindicating that his word is true Hallelujah so Satan knows then the Bottomless Pits is ready for him Hallelujah one thing for him to see Jesus on a white horse riding down is one thing for him to see him but when he sees you but Bill he's going to see you he's going to say there's that one I kicked him all over Hardy I I gave him sicknesses I I made it hard for him to work I did I made it hard for him to keep his family in the house of God I did everything I could to discourage him and here he is riding Out of Heaven vindicating the word of God maybe he went by way of the gravery when the Rapture but there he is and it so demoralizes the devil that he says oh the bottomless fits like oh I want to demoralize him tonight don't you hey man the resurrection vindicates Hallelujah we're just getting started Church so much here look I'm not talking about tonight I'm gonna let you go tonight Satan knows Bottomless Pits is ready for him I believe that when you raise your hand in spite of what he's done to you in spite of how he's fought you a spite of going through hell and back I can say it that way you have to bury yesterday because yesterday's too painful to remember and so you you don't want to have to look back at it and say you have to just keep going and keep going and keep going and every day you wake up as a resurrected son or daughter of God you just you discourage the devil you demoralize him you make him realize that his end is coming there for him he tries all that much harder he don't quit he don't even quit when Jesus writes down he tries to defeat him but he cannot defeat him greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world you are his vindication his word is true Hallelujah amen and all you notice you realize all the accusations he wasted his time you realize the accuser has stood up there for all of these years 6 000 years he stood in the presence of God and accused and brother Branham in the four seal he said he he stands there and says I I talked to Eve and and I got her to do things that were against the word and oh but and the father one day he's going to get kicked out of heaven and he's gonna see you the ones he accused and wasted his time on riding back on white horses talk about demoralize might as well quit devil can't win look at it it's Jezebel it's a jezebel system now once you watch this we'll close he said he notice what happened after death their dead bodies are destroyed by wild beasts just like Jezebel Jezebel in the Old Testament is the type of the church today according to the word of God brother Brandon said now he talks about Revelation 2 18 which we already read in Second Kings 9 36 I love this remember remember the servants came and told jehu after he caused Jezebel to be cast into the street and then they told him they couldn't find the body all they found was kind of gruesome all they found was the hands and the feet and the skull they said what happened to her the dogs ate her and they remembered they remembered the word of a prophet Elijah to be specific and they said this is the word of the Lord which he spake by his servant Elijah in the portion of Jezreel shall dogs eat the Flesh of Jezebel he said the same thing happens to the Jezebel church and her daughters Revelation 19 17. and when he comes down on the White Horse I saw an angel standing in the sun he cried with a loud voice saying to all the fouls that fly in the midst of Heaven Come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great God he said the Jezebel churcher actually bodies to be eaten by a thousand Beasts of the earth just exactly like Ahab and Jezebel was in the natural so are they to be in the spiritual form of church he said to Elijah was the prophet in the days of Ahab and Jezebel National and he has promised to do the same thing according to thus saith the Lord in the word to The Jezebel spiritual his Spirit form of ministry so he actually spoke their judgment Elijah though in his day properly and profoundly Vindicated he said could not turn them back to the word remember Elijah thought he was all alone he said I didn't do nothing remember brother random had those same thoughts he looked at that church at American church he said Lord is this what I produced right but then he saw a preview of The Bride amen and Elijah thought that he he never could you remember this is the the famous quote where brother Brandon said 700 instead of seven thousand everybody gets hung up on that but there's a great spiritual truth here Elijah never even knew one of them was that way he said look these seven thousand were unknown to the prophet I never knew him but I believed the word the seven thousand were unknown to Elijah he thought he was the only one saved until God opened up one of the seals and showed him the mystery in the book he had 700 that never bowed down to them Creeds that they had that's the reason he said I think John was doing a lot of shouting the other night he must have seen his name on there he said here is the fourth seal open and the writers are the four horses that's revealed to the best of my knowledge he said now this is all that took place on the Earth he told us all of it think about it this is all that took place on the earth now we get in the fifth seal we go to heaven you can see what's been happening in heaven what's happening in heaven this is all that took place on the earth I'm so glad I won't be here to see some of this huh he said the next seal we see is in heaven where Souls are under the altar sometimes we get discouraged as musicians are coming sometimes we get discouraged we think well the business anybody believe the message anymore is anybody going to make it said I got seven thousand got seven thousand not bowed their knees to bail oh my God he said I got people you don't even know about I believe that's the case tonight there's people we don't we've never even met love the Lord with all of their heart I've been in some of their homes overseas and it humbles me because I realize there's people like that all over the world or they may have little different customs and things but this same message that I preach they're preaching the same word that I preach they're preaching it in in the Middle East they're preaching it all over Africa they're preaching it in Asia they're preaching different parts of the world I've been privileged to be and some of you all have seen some of the things that over the years where missionaries have went and come back and you know it's a it's a great inspiration to me to know God's word is true there will be a people that'll be raptured a little Remnant he calls them but don't don't worry you're not alone there's a great cloud of witnesses that are cheering you on from the other side already went home would you bow your heads with me I want to I want to ask you tonight what power are you following what part of Elijah's message speaks to you some people are attracted by by the part of the message that shows War coming and famine and sicknesses and all the things that are coming on the earth and that's something we know it's something that that Elijah's message showed us we've been lifted up to see those things that's not what attracted me to the message attracted me to this message when I started looking at it and I began to realize that's me that's not me in the tribulation period that's not me in the one that got deceived by the by the beast that's not me it's not me one that had had to hide from an atomic bomb that's not me but I saw me riding on a white horse coming back with him called the word of God no matter what you go through how deep your trials get how hard it gets remember I'm gonna be there one day I'm gonna be there with my children I'm gonna be there with my family I'm gonna take as many as I can with me I'm gonna be there [Music] I'm gonna be there and be riding one of them horses [Music] I'm gonna be there I'm gonna make the devil mad just like I'm doing tonight because I'm on proof that God's word is true I'm gonna be the Vindication of his word could you say that tonight just make that in your heart make that determination I'm gonna be what God called me to be I see myself in the word I'm not I'm not following I'm not can being condemned by the message I'm being lifted up by the same Elijah the same Elijah that showed the destruction of Jezebel but also also he showed the elevation of Elisha and the quickening power that would come oh my that's the agent we live in the same Elijah that showed the foolish virgin and showed the false Church also showed the bride and I'm so glad to be a part of that tonight elected by God but faithful by my choosing to be faithful to the word of God Amen Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we love you tonight I pray you would help us to see the eyes of faith see Lord that we are not writing we're not writing the Pale Horse with with the Enemy we're not we're not being overtaken by him Lord we're riding with you we're being gathered by you someday Lord after after the weddings supper after those glorious times Lord after the Rapture
