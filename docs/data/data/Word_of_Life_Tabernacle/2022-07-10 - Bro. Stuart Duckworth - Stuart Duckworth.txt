our brother stewart to come amen just be just be mindful of the lord this morning that what we ask anything in his name he's able to give it to us amen i was talking to matt and his friend told him

and i thought you know what what a hope we have and i couldn't imagine to be hopeless but you and i have a hope and we have an assurance and i told him i said before that happens we'll be gone amen so amen let's just sing this we invite brother stewart to come i'm gonna keep pressing on holding [Music] up first verse well satan tried to stop me turned me aside said there's no need for you to go on no need to try even if there was a rapture you'd never make it in i just tell old satan i'm gonna prove you're a liar again and i'm gonna keep pressing no holding on and known the bride is pressing on [Music] i'm gonna keep pressing home to the higher calling of my lord pressing home oh we are [Music] amen amen are you pressing on this morning amen do you love the lord jesus yes amen if we could just play something softly there just for a moment amen if you'd have a need this morning just won't you just lift that up to god and amen we just come here to enjoy his presence amen the songs have been sung and amen we just want to draw from his word this this morning just for a little bit and ask him to come by our way man the lord we we come before you this morning lord we're just a privileged people lord once again to be in your presence lord and once again just to feel you lord and to know that you're here lord and that you're you're ready and that you're able lord to meet every need lord and to come by our way lord and so we just we just want to lord lift up that name this morning the name of jesus we just want to speak jesus this morning lord may life come among us lord lord may you just come and have your way lord you you hide in simplicity lord and you reveal yourself in the same lord this just come this morning over just a simple people lord but we love you lord just come among us lord speak to every heart every life lord may you just grant these things in the name of jesus christ amen amen we certainly love the lord we love you this morning amen amen brother ben said to greet the church and it sounds like they had had good success been over there had to preach many services i sure wouldn't want to want to be in their their place but i believe god god used them amen god laid it on their heart to be there and that that's what they've done and you don't just go somewhere like that just to be going and so you pray god but just give them an easy trip back home and and give them rest in their bodies because i'm sure they're they're going to need it amen amen and i'm looking forward to hearing all about what took place amen if we could we'll turn the scriptures this morning to hebrews the 9th chapter the 13th verse we spoke on this thought before the power of the testator just want to kind of continue with it just a little bit here hey man we love the lord amen we love his word amen i mean y'all probably won't have to see me for a little while so this will be it this will be it maybe for just a little while i mean looking forward to some good preaching coming in and amen just certainly anticipating amen the things that are coming amen hebrews 9 13. for the blood of bulls and goats and the ashes on heifers sprinkling the unclean sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh how much more shall the blood of christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to god purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living god and for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament that by means of death for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance for where a testament is there must also of necessity be the death of the testator for a testament is of for a testament is a force after men are dead otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth amen there in the 18th verse whereupon neither the first test testament was dedicated without blood so the first one was dedicated with blood and so the second one also was dedicated with blood amen you can be seated this morning amen we'll just try to try to preach a little bit this morning and then try to try to hang on to our voice for a little bit as long as we can hey man i just i just want to enter in this morning i just want to enter into his presence amen amen and to be able amen to be able to partake in the things of christ and the eternal inheritance i mean we've got to enter in i mean you can't just sit on the sidelines and amen you've got to enter in god's provided way amen and that's by the blood of christ how much more this blood if that blood would would purge and make clean and god would accept that how much more this blood if we can come through his blood and then you have to come you have to come by faith to be able to receive something to be able to come to god you've got to come by faith you can't come any other way amen you've got to come you've got to come with a revelation with an understanding and and know what you're doing know know how to approach god and come his provided way amen amen and can't nobody do it for you you've got to come and worship you've got to come and enter in the service each and every time you've got to come every day of your life and and live for him nobody can come and do it for you amen you've got to worship god in this hour amen so we want to enter in this this morning it's an eternal inheritance it's not something that's that's tangible though though it could be god could give us something tangible amen but it's everlasting amen it's got a lasting effect it has an eternal effect this blessedness amen this blessing these riches this morning it's from eternity it's an eternal thing and so the power of the testator amen amen he has made a covenant with with us amen by his blood that testament there amen that's his will he's wrote out a will he's made a covenant amen he sent his word amen it is binding this morning amen by his blood amen and the first was dedicated with blood and so the second amen has been dedicated with blood with the blood of christ amen in his word and his will as the testator amen that is what he has left us he has left us his will amen his word and he wants a people that will take that word and when they can have amen that can think the right way and then they can understand the right way i mean they can grow up and they can they can partake and they can receive and they can understand amen what he has left you the will amen amen and go forth in action amen to take what he has given amen and not just amen even just use it for yourself amen but amen but to give out to give to others amen because if you truly if you truly leave leave something good behind and then it can keep going and it can keep going if i leave my children something if i could really somehow in this life accumulate something amen i would want them to to take that and to receive that and to keep going with it to build it to bring to bring forth more amen and to be able to help somebody and then to pass it along somehow and then so what god has given us in this hour amen as believers he's given us his blood he's giving us his word amen amen it's and it's eternal amen amen and we want to see amen and in his word in his will as the testator amen what he has left us i mean we want to see we want to see who he is in the word we want to see we want to understand the power of christ we want to we want to understand that that way we can speak of these things because you have to put the word on your lips you have it has to be in your heart you have to put it on your lips it has to be in your mind amen and speak that word amen i want to see who he is i want to see his power this morning amen amen so here in the scripture we see speaking of that of that blood sacrifice of the old testament amen a transition and emphasis from that old sacrifice into the actual fulfillment of the top and the shadow of what god had in his mind amen of what the true sacrificial land the son of god would be i mean that was a shadow amen the blood of the old sacrifice and bulls of goats could never bring a perfection amen for the bible says it could never make the comer there unto perfect and every year they would bring that sacrifice and they were forgiven amen but they would leave with the same desire that they had when they come but because it was god's provided way even in god's eyes and in god's eyes they were forgiven they were made clean because they came and they partook and when they came and they entered in amen and perhaps you know it didn't make any sense at first amen but a believer in those days and when they had to come and enter in and then they couldn't skip out they couldn't skip a year and to be a real believer amen you had to you had to come continue that to come every year and maybe you felt bad leaving you think what's this for i'm leaving the same way amen but by faith they looked into the promise and then by faith they understood amen and by faith they walked amen and performed and entered into what god told them to do and if we'll just do that if we'll just do what his word says it ain't got to make sense amen we don't we don't necessarily have to understand everything amen but god amen will give you the faith and if you'll have the faith to walk and to enter in amen there's a blessing in there there's mercy in there there's grace in there amen so so then the bible says how much more how much more the blood of christ i mean if they could go faithfully year after year leaving the same way and they could go forth faithfully amen how about you and i am going to have the understanding that we have and to have the knowledge and the revelation that we have of the blood of christ how much more can we enter in this morning amen in faith amen how much more can we enter into the service amen and say amen amen and not only say amen with our with our mouths but say amen with our lives say lord yes i believe that i believe your word amen your blood amen is rich this morning how much more the blood of christ amen that we could enter in that we could stay with it then we could stay with it amen amen how much more the blood of christ amen who through the eternal spirit offered him himself without spot to god amen he said purge your conscience as we read from the from dead works to serve the living god and so with this blood it brings a perfection it brings the perfection needed that we can walk away different amen that we can walk away different amen it's it's that powerful it's the blood it's the blood that god had in his mind they made us a sacrifice amen and only through christ only through that blood only through that sacrifice can we be made clean amen and that he offered himself without spot amen without spot amen to bring in perfection and to bring forth a church without spot themselves without wrinkle without any such blemish aiming to bring forth a perfection in a people that only his blood could bring forth no works no dead works not no religion nothing you can perform yourself and they could bring it forth only by the blood of jesus christ amen will bring forth that life in a believer amen it'll change you it'll make you different amen it'll make you think different it'll make you walk different it'll make you act different amen amen it'll bring forth the church that he wants the type of people that he wants amen and brother branham says here and things that are to be the blood of jesus christ think of him the dripping bloody word amen amen the blood the word of god bleeding bleeding blood to wash the bride him amen yes yes sir she stands perfect virgin unadulterated she never sinned in the first place and he says how can you do it amen how could you do it it's he said it takes a a perfect word it takes a word to wash the bride and then wash us with the water of separation and there bring you into condition and you stand this morning amen by the blood of christ how much more shall the blood of christ amen it will bring it to a state of justification amen though you've never done in the first place it'll bring you amen to a place that you never sin bring you to that place amen we stand this morning redeemed by the blood amen we stand amen as we receive the word as we receive the word in our hearts amen that covenant amen that word that he brought forth it's a bleeding word it's a word that's got life in it amen the bible says a letter killeth but the spirit giveth life amen he the bible says he he's made us able ministers of this new testament amen to bring forth a church amen not by the letter not by the law not by a bunch of do's and don'ts and legalism amen but by the spirit of god to bring forth amen and that's what brings life as a spirit of god amen amen so by his life and his truth by his grace amen he makes us free amen amen that the perfect son of god would have a church amen without spot wash purge clean whole amen that she would come to a perfection in him by the blood amen and brother ram says there's a perfect place calling you amen there's a perfect place calling you to that perfect place amen jesus said be there for perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect amen it's a perfect kingdom that he's bringing us to it's a perfect place that he's gone to prepare for us and then it's an eternal inheritance and in this life a man is not what he's leaving us this old this so corrupted life is not the end of it but he's bringing us he's calling us by the blood by the bleeding word of the hour he's calling a bride to a place of perfection amen and we've got to be perfected here amen we got to be perfected if and if we're going to marry if we're going to marry be the wife of a perfect son of god we've got to be the perfect bride of jesus christ and that's what his blood done for you and i hey man i just listened to the song service and i just heard the songs about blood and the amen it just inspired me and i i don't i don't want to ruin that this morning i i believe god has something in his mind for us here today amen hey man i love preaching about the blood amen brother brother said if if your religion ain't got no blood in it if ain't got no life and it's a dead religion and that's the religion that we have it's a blood religion amen it's dripping with blood it's dripping with the blood of the lord jesus amen amen if we make a rapture it'll be by the bleeding word it'll be by his grace it'll be by his mercy if we if we if for anything in this life at all it'll be by his grace and mercy and that bleeding word hebrews 12 and 24 and to jesus the mediator of the new covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of abel so when abel was slain by cain amen there there the voice of his blood the bible says cried from the ground amen abel's voice abel's blood had a voice that's what the bible said his blood had a voice amen but this blood this blood of christ speaks of better things and brother adam says in the token he says the blood is speaking then the blood has got a voice and the voice of the blood is the word hallelujah and that's what makes it whether it's right or wrong the word is identified by the voice of the blood and the voice of the blood is the holy ghost he said that brings life it is life and it brings life to the word and quickens it amen amen he says sure the blood speaks it speaks a better thing the old testament the blood spoke of guilt but in the new testament it speaks of redemption and in the old testament spoke of death and sorrow in the new testament testament speaks of resurrection and life it speaks of healing it speaks of joy it speaks the power it speaks of life it speaks of heaven and then it's speaking amen it's speaking of that perfect place that we're going to church amen the word amen the voice of the word the blood amen crying out to you and i amen that you don't have to try to be worthy you don't have to try to be good enough amen but his blood is already good enough it's already made a way if you'll come god's provided way amen amen it's out with the old it's out with the old and then with the new it'll make you different it'll change your life and then it'll turn that frown upside down and then it'll make you live in joy and happiness and it'll quicken your life with resurrection power amen all provided by the blood of christ oh my god it's god's provided way this morning it's always been god's provided way amen but over time over over the church ages and then christ died once he never had to come and do it again but what happened is we lost the word but in this hour the word has been restored we lost it under man's ideas and in the dark ages and the falling away amen from the truth amen amen but in this hour we've been restored amen amen under the seventh angel messenger under elijah a god sent ministry restored the word and it brought back its meaning to you now the blood has always been there jesus don't have to come and die again and when the blood is effective this morning amen the blood of jesus covers all of our sins he says speaks peace resurrection power and life and healing all of the redemptive blessings that the blood was shed for it speaks for us certainly the blood speaks amen see the power and the blood this morning amen if i could remind you amen i know it's simple i've been listening to god hiding himself in simplicity just seemed like i hadn't listened to it in a long time but i've just been trying to listen to it over and over amen but it's so rich but even in that title god hiding himself in simplicity god god hit him and hid himself in the in the in the womb of a virgin wrapped himself in a blood cell that's how god became available to you and i hey man he took on flesh and man he in simplicity hid himself in a manger how many he lived as a boy he lived as a child and then he came he came for us and he came to age amen he came and he came in and received his ministry received amen the holy ghost the dove came down upon the lamb and he gave his life and he didn't live for himself he lived for others and that's what the blood does i mean that's what that life does that life of god it don't live for others it don't live for yourself it lives for other people and then eternal life is living for others and that's what that life produces and that's what the church amen that's what we are to produce the top of life if we have eternal life if we have amen that blood that holy ghost within us amen we will live with for others we won't live to ourselves but it's just in that simplicity amen in simplicity god reveals himself amen amen see the power of the blood this morning it can never lose its power amen it's something that will bring life amen it'll take an old dead life it'll take an old dead person an old dead church member amen to make you a real christian it may make you a living epistle make the word live in you amen where you're reading known of all men amen as i said before with the blood of jesus it's out with the old and end with anew amen brother branham said he said it's a bleeding word the word became flesh and gave his own life the word bled for you and that same blood cries out amen that his blood is still effective this morning as it ever was it's still the same quality and it's never diminished it covers all right amen don't let us lose its effectiveness and meaning this morning and in this hour amen what happens is we let things amen the things we hear and it becomes so common to us oh i've heard that a thousand times right i've heard that over and over and when we let things become so common to us amen what what message am i going to listen to well i've listened to that one i've i've listened it no telling how many times but if you'll just listen one more time amen it's a living word and god will show you just a little bit more he'll give you just a little bit more for of what you need amen amen don't overlook the thing don't let it become common to you don't let this church service become common to you don't let this opportunity today amen don't look it over maybe it's simple this morning amen but don't let god pass you by amen it's effective this morning there's power this morning in the blood of jesus there's power in his name amen amen amen don't don't let it become common to you amen let it let it mean more now than what it ever has amen let the word mean more now than what it ever has living for god let it mean more now let it mean more every day amen amen so through the word through the word i mean when we hear preaching amen that's the voice of the blood brotherhood says the bleeding word the word bled for you and that blood cries out just as abel's cried out from the ground that blood is crying out this morning from the word amen it speaks of life as brother brown says speaks of healing amen the cancer you could be ate up with cancer you could they could completely give you up but the blood speaks of healing this morning amen i've got a uncle with stage four cancer he's not doing good i passed him on the on the road last sunday he was just asleep over in the passenger seat wore out hey man the doctors can give you up man can give you up and remember the blood is crying out by my stripes you are healed it doesn't matter how far gone someone will be amen stricken with illness amen god is is able to raise them up amen there's power in the blood this morning him and there's healing for the people of god there's joy and when the blood speaks of joy it speaks to faith amen this morning and it'll help you rise up out of that condition as we spoke of jeremiah last sunday it'll help you it'll help you bring you out of that condition bring you out of that old pit out of that whole mindset amen amen the blood speaks of redemption this morning amen it speaks of fullness of redemption amen not just what jesus done on the cross and many paid for redemption there but there's a fullness to the bride of jesus christ in this hour there's a fullness to the sons and daughters of god a fullness of redemption amen amen for what took place on the inside the redemption that took took place on the inside that redemption is going to take place on the outside and this whole body is going to come subject amen as i walk in the spirit as i walk in the spirit of the bleeding word this body is becoming more subject and there's a fullness of redemption that's taking place this word this message speaks of that fullness it speaks of the fullness of redemption when our bodies will be changed will be changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye that's what the word speaks of amen amen don't lose sight of the rapture don't lose sight of the rapture in this life i mean that's what we're living for that's the day we're longing for that's what we were made for that's what that's what god has called us to in this hour by his bleeding word is to a rapture amen there's grace this morning there's rapture and grace oh i can't make it the bleeding word says you can make it there's rapturing faith this morning amen by the by the open word by the revealed word of the hour it's here this morning it's here in this hour amen do you love the lord amen so he is he is the mediator of this new covenant amen he's there there this morning amen there this morning with those nail scarred hands there this morning amen as that sacrifice there to make good on what he has promised amen and with his blood he validates amen what his word says what his word promises he is there this morning to uphold your confession and your profession and when the power of his blood is what is what is over our lives this morning do you believe that by faith do you believe that this morning to be a christian amen you got to have faith in him you got to have faith in what he done to ever take that first step say i'm saved you got to believe in what he done you got to believe that he paid the price to ever get your healing you got to believe that his sacrifice was more than sufficient amen do you believe that this morning amen his blood is over our lives and when god sees us he looks through that perfect blood amen that blood covering us amen and as we confess his word he is there making good amen to uphold what he has said amen look by faith this morning church amen look by faith this morning in this hour and see who's standing for you if you have need of something see the god see that jesus christ amen the one that gave his life see him there there this morning amen the mediator of this new covenant amen he's our goal between you don't have to come to know man you don't have to you don't have to tell nobody just go to god in prayer go go to god and speak to him and he's there amen to confirm his word and to uphold his promise brother brown says he says remember he can never do nothing until and for you until first you say that he's done it believe him and accept him and testify of it he said do you know that he's the high priest of what our confession he's sitting there at the right hand of the father to make intercession upon our confession see we've got to believe accept it and confess him and he's before the father to make good anything that we confess in the redemptive blessings amen he says here again he says you you profess something or confess it you profess it that you believe that if you say something amen you believe that amen you believe from the heart that it's right amen we don't go you can't go to god in doubt you can't go doubting you've got to believe that it's for you i mean you've got to believe that his word is right amen amen and maybe it's maybe it's hard for you to maybe you've really got a need and it's hard for you to really have faith but just keep saying the word keep saying until you believe it and something will strike in your heart you say lord i know the word is right maybe maybe i don't feel it like i should maybe i don't feel it deep down inside but keep saying it keep confessing it keep believing the word keep pressing on amen you profess something or confess it you profess what you believe he was wounded for your transgressions with his stripes you were healed you confess that and let god go to work no matter the need no matter the situation amen by your stripes i'm healed this morning amen i know this is simple but i mean god will hide himself in simplicity and so he's high he's the high priest amen he's the he's the mediator of this new covenant to make intercession upon our confession and brother ram says he cannot do nothing for us until we first accepted and confess it he said you could get down to the altar and pray till we were we were laid on our faces and died but he said until we believe and accept his pardoning grace we're still lost no matter how we could scream or how long we could stay or how long you could do without food until in your heart that revelation that gives us that jesus christ died to save us and we accept it as our own personal property says it's something that christ did for me did for you and to whomsoever will will believe it then you're saved because you have believed it and you're healed the same way amen you got to believe this morning you got to have faith every day you got to have faith every every time you walk out of the door you're walking by faith you're stepping by faith you breathe in by faith but you do it unconsciously amen but you got to come to a place you got to come to a place when you really need something it ain't about getting down amen and crying amen and begging for it and and so forth and then we do got to get down the altar we do got to get down to business with god it does take that but if you'll come to the place where just say lord i believe i accept it and i confess that then god can begin to go to work on your behalf i believe in a real experience i believe in a real experience this morning amen hey man i believe that something you got to meet somebody that's right moses with all his training and with all his knowledge was a failure he was going to try to do it his own way amen but when he had that experience when he met god god sent him forth amen not with an army not with his understanding but he sent him forth with a stick amen in there in that sense that simplicity didn't look like nothing man amen but he had met god and god sent this man forth with a stick amen and he and he took down a nation he took down the greatest kingdom of the world and then he just took that which what god had given him in his hand and he went forth by faith under the commission and we as the church amen we've been commissioned in this hour am going to take the word you say i don't know much i don't understand much but take what you have amen and god will use it he'll multiply it he'll bring a power in your life amen amen the little bit that you know the little bit that you understand and what you feel like you are and god will bring a power if you've ever had an experience if you've ever come down amen and got to business with god amen and you know him and you know that you know that you know amen all hell may be against you but all heaven is behind you his anointing is with you amen and in his blood and man cries out amen they've got to sacrifice that's my perfected church that's my perfected people amen no matter what the world sees them how how they portray them that's my people amen and they've got power in their lives they've met with me they've met the word amen amen we can try to do it on our own amen but if you'll just come and believe this morning confess him amen what he's already done believe that it's for you he'll go to work and amen amen so it's by means of his death those that are called amen that they would receive the redemption from that old life if you can accept and confess him and you can receive amen whatever you have need of this morning amen by revelation it becomes your personal property amen if your name is in the will this morning it's been given to you amen if you've been called this morning amen if you can see yourself in the word if you can identify yourself and your word in the inheritance i mean if your name has been called if you can identify with it it's yours this morning and what you've got to do you've got to take it you've got to take it in faith this morning and believe that it's for you believe that god has given it to you and don't let the devil move you off of it one bit if if somebody give me something if somebody give me a piece of property that's my property if there if there's a legal document if there's something binding that that's mine and there ain't nobody gonna move me off of it in the natural how much more in the spiritual but we let the devil kick us around every day and then because we don't see ourselves like we should we don't understand and think and speak like we should amen but it's time the church rise up claim what's hers claim who she is believe who she is and kick that old devil out kick him out of your life he ain't got no place there this inheritance is for the people of god amen it's an eternal inheritance i checked the devil doesn't have eternal life i mean he's got an end he may live for thousands and thousands of whatever years but he's got an end but you and i and man if we're sons and daughters of god we had no beginning and we had no end because we are in the mind of god put him in his place knock him down a notch kick him off your land this morning take back your inheritance take back what's yours amen you've got to claim it it's been given to you it's been given to you it's bought and paid for amen you just got to go take it got a few more pages here i ain't going to close y'all calm down amen i just couldn't get this scripture i couldn't get away from it i tried to make it fit and i hope it fits this morning i couldn't get away from it ephesians 1 and 17 amen the messenger messenger of that age placing the church the ephesians amen placing them he says here that the god of our lord jesus christ the father of glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him amen the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that you may know what is the hope of your calling know why you're here know what your purpose is right amen that you could have revelation and wisdom and know your purpose amen and know what you're supposed to do and and how you're supposed to you know approach where you're at god can show you his will he can show he can show you these things what what the hope of your calling is what you're supposed to do in this life amen god can show you that show you who he is show you who he wants you to be amen what are the what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of his glory of his glory and inheritance in the saints and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us word who believe according to the working of his mighty power which he wrought in christ when he raised him from the dead and set him down at the right hand in the heavenly places far above all principality and power and my dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to come amen so it's by the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him i mean that's something that's given amen amen paul paul prayed that god would give that to you he'd give you the spirit of wisdom amen in james it says if any man lacks if any man lacks wisdom if any man lacks of these things let him ask god let him ask god and he'll give it to you amen and if you need revelation in your life this morning and then if you need to know what you're supposed to do where you're supposed to be amen we can't all figure it out you can't figure it out on your own and remember god will show you his will he'll show you what your purpose is and then he'll show you his power amen he'll he'll give you understanding amen of what the riches of his glory is of what his power is amen amen amen to know the riches of his glory the inheritance amen there's abundance it's it's re it's his riches it's the abundance of whatever we need there's plenty there's plenty in this inheritance that's been left it's the it's the riches of his glory it's in his will to give to you amen and his power isn't exceeding greatness power to us to believe and its power goes it goes beyond this morning it can go beyond what you can see or feel it can bring you out of the lowest of the low it can bring you up amen it's a great exceeding power this morning amen god is able to do amen all that you could thank your ass he could go beyond that he can his grace abounds this morning his power amen to us word is in his greatness it's an exceeding greatness it's available to you this morning amen amen don't be afraid to go before him amen as brother brown says we stand justified this morning and then we stand justified amen and we've got to ride amen by the blood to come to him amen let your faith loose this morning let it loose in your life let let his power come let him see what let's see what god can do let him come amen and show that great exceeding power amen amen and there he sits this morning far above anything of this world any power of this world he sits there this morning far above all principality all power and everything there he sits this morning and then he's not bound by anything his power in your life is not bound by anything i mean if my god's not bound why do i have to live like that why do i have to think that i have to be bound amen but it's power to us it's great it's exceeding i mean that's inherent that's his inheritance that's what he's left to us it's the power of god in our lives amen don't let the enemy try to cut you off from what's yours amen don't let the accuser don't let satan talk you out of it in this hour amen but the bible says it will overcome him amen by what amen by the bleeding word by the blood of the lamb and by the word of our testimony it takes the blood it takes the word amen it's more than just a testimony but there's got to be a life behind it there's got to be something backing it up and there's got to be someone amen far above this world amen in the world that is to come there's someone in position tonight and when to intercede on your confession amen amen to what's rightfully yours and who you are and what you have need of he's there this morning amen brother branham says here we'll bring it down real quick here just a few more notes and that's it i promise noth not much more he says here he's making every enemy his footstool all devils is under his feet all sicknesses under his feet all sin is under his feet and we're in him amen we're more than conquerors through him that loved him that loved us him and everything's under him and if we're in him everything's under us this morning and then satan's under your feet this morning and if you he said if you abide in me and my word and you then ask what you will amen enter in this morning enter in every day enter into his word amen about in him and his word in you and you can ask what you will that's the power that he's given to you to us amen know who you are church no know the dominion that's been given amen can we stand this morning amen amen for one of the scriptures that we read before for a testament is a force after men are dead otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth amen his will is in full effect this morning amen he didn't just die amen but he died and he rose again he's the same yesterday today and forever and in his word this morning to you if you'll accept it is in full force and when the word has been restored and when the fullness of christ has come back into the church amen the fullness of the word the fullness of christ is here this morning it's in full effect amen the the blood is just as strong as it ever was it's just as effective as it ever was and if you'll let it take
