[Music] he put control reassurance way down in my soul he's got it all in control do we really believe that sing it one more time oh he's got it all in control everything i go through oh he's got it all in control i put that reassurance way down in my soul [Music] he's got it all in control amen let's bow our heads together heavenly father we believe that you have it all in control lord even this service i pray father that you would just do what you do lord in our midst and lord come among us because we've seen you so many times before in a communion service just come down in a special way ask you to do that tonight lord father we're doing what we can do it's not much but it's what we can do to remember the great thing that you did lord we thank you for that help us never to get too big or too educated lord to forget what you did for us lord we thank you we worship you today for who you are and what you've done lord we feel so little unworthy even we've been made worthy by your blood and you chose us so hard to be here and to stand here today we didn't have anything to do with that but we're so grateful that you did it lord thank you for all you do i pray father that healing would even come and all those things that we have need of lord as we obey your word father in this part that we can do we believe father you will continue to open up paths for us to be able to do and and the things that we need to do lord as a church prayer granted tonight and thank you for it in jesus name amen amen god bless you turn with me to psalms chapter 116 we'll read verse 12 to start but you'll want to read leave your bible open just for a few moments and we'll just go through these scriptures i won't hold you very long it's so good to be back in the house of the lord amen to know that he's with us that's the thing we don't as brother brown said this morning we don't want to presume that he's with us we want to know and we believe we can know because we come according to the word and do the things that the word requires and god is with us and we believe that today psalms chapter 1 16 and verse 12 what shall i render unto the lord for all his benefits toward me in other words how can i repay god i pray the lord would add his blessing to the word you may be seated this evening what god did for us is so great that there is no way we can give back something of equal worth anything we could touch with our hands would already be so uh messed up that we it just wouldn't be worth what he did we could never repay and so david even looking forward before the cross he says what can i give back to god look what he's given to me what could i ever give back to god that would be close to that have you ever felt like that what shall i render unto the lord for all his benefits toward me what has he done he's gone above and beyond some of you have known people like that maybe in your life maybe a spouse maybe a child maybe a parent they've done things for you that you could never repay and so you try and do something and you just could never pay that back maybe give the ultimate sacrifice and there's just nothing you could do to repay that and so david said what will i do to repay this and and he goes back if you go back in in the chapter in psalms chapter 116 he says what has he done he's heard my voice he says i love the lord because he hath heard my voice and my supplications do you believe he's heard your voice today because he hath inclined his ear unto me therefore will i call upon him as long as i live you see he hears you when no one else does he's listening when nobody else is listening i might not hear you you might say something to me and i may not really hear you may not get it but he hears so grateful that he hears and he knows and and when he hears he hears exactly what we need i love the lord because he's heard my voice he's inclined his ear unto me it means that he listens for my voice he listens for me and therefore will i call upon him as long as i live and the second thing he's done for us is in verse 3 he saved my soul it says the sorrows of death compassed me the pains of hell get hold upon me he says i found trouble and sorrow i like the way he puts that i found trouble and sorrow that was me the trouble and sorrow that i had in my life i found it i stumbled into it i that's who i was when i found trouble and sorrow verse four then called i upon the name of the lord o lord i beseech thee deliver my soul gracious is the lord and righteous yeah our god is merciful david understood that in a way that few people could he says the lord preserveth the simple i was brought low and he helped me return unto thy rest of my soul for the lord hath dealt bountifully with thee what has he done he saved my soul that's a benefit i can't pay back i can't do anything about that i can't give him anything that would be an equal value to salvation he's changed my walk in verse three he said for thou has delivered my soul from death notice the three things my soul from death my eyes from tears and my feet from falling he's delivering my soul from death we're grateful for that he's also given me joy when i don't have a right to be joyful i put got a smile on my face anyway because he's delivered my soul from death my eyes from tears and my feet that's the third thing from falling help me walk right think of jacob when he met the angel and he touched him he walked differently from then on that's the way i was that's something that god gave me i can't repay him for that he changed my walk he says i will walk before the lord in the land of the living i can walk right because god touched me one of the benefits that he has given me number four in verse 10 he he said he's made me trust him he said i believed therefore have i spoken i was greatly afflicted i said in my haste all men are liars you ever said that in your heart maybe not out loud everybody's a liar all men are liars but god's not it made me trust him amen i can trust him with my fears i can trust him with my with my inner thoughts i can trust him with my sin and the things that i've done that are wrong i can trust him to be merciful i can trust him to keep his word i can trust him to give me i may not be able to trust anybody else but i can trust him amen i can trust him and because i can trust him i can trust the message of the hour i can trust a minister that stands behind the pulpit though he may be fallible and fleshly but yet at the same time god has a message that we can trust we can trust our bibles we can trust them to be the word of god aren't you glad for that today you don't have to reach around say well it doesn't really mean what it says but i can trust him david says i can trust him i know he's not a liar i said in my hates that all men are liars but i know he's not and so i believed what he said amen when i was greatly afflicted i thought that everybody lies but god is not a man that he should lie we can trust him today we can trust him just by simple things he it may not make any sense that well what does taking communion mean but it does something that we're being obedient to god and when we're obedient to god we can trust him he'll keep his word so if you need healing tonight say lord i'm doing what i can do i can't repay you i can't pay you back for all that you there's no way i can equal what you did for me on the cross but i can do my part i'll take the cup and so we look at the things that god has done for us like david we can look back at our life and dave and and like paul did when he said in romans 8 31 what should we then say to these things if god before us who can be against us amen he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things psalms 116 and 12 it's the verse that we read he said what shall i render unto the lord for all his benefits toward me what do i give back to him then he answers his own question he said i will take the cup of salvation it is pleasing in his sight for me to take the cup whatever's in the cup i'll drink it it's a cup of salvation i'll take it i will take as a strange answer to the question what shall i render it seems like an oxymoron but maybe it's the wisest reply that could possibly be given the poet said the best return for one like me so wretched and so poor is from his gifts to draw a plea and ask him still for more sometimes the best thing i can do is say lord i need you you've given me so much but i need you to take the cup of salvation was in itself an act of worship it was accompanied with other forms of adoration so the psalmist says call upon the name of the lord it means that he will utter blessings and thanksgivings and prayers and then drink of the cup which the lord had filled with his saving grace what a cut this is upon the table of infinite love stands the cup full of blessing ours by faith to take it in our hand make it our own partake of it and then with joyful hearts to laud and magnify the gracious one who has filled it for our sakes that we may drink and be refreshed we do this figuratively at the table the communion table we do it spiritually every time we grab ahold of the covenant realizing the fullness of blessing that it contains and by faith receiving the divine contents into our souls let's just pause for a moment tonight and that's what i'd like for us to do tonight in this service just pause for a moment take a long deep drink from the cup that jesus filled for us and then let us worship god in the bible a full cup speaks of abundance either of judgment or a blessing he said that he wouldn't it wouldn't call israel out of egypt until the cup of the iniquity of the amorites was full it was an abundance of judgment that's what's coming to this nation an abundance a full cup speaks of abundance when they would have a feast they would fill the cup to the top so you'd know there was plenty they weren't trying to keep some back fill it to the top that's the way this nation they're waiting for judgment like that but we have a cup during the passover the head of the house would take the cup and and what they do today what the jews do today and it's been passed on by tradition but they will take the cup and fill it four times and they drink from it for each of the promises made to israel in exodus 6 6-7 we won't read it for sake of time but you can go back and look at those promises it's the first cup was called the cup of judgment or sanctification and that's where god said i will bring you out i will separate you and the second cup that they drink is the cup of salvation of deliverance where he says i will save you from bondage and the third cup is the cup of redemption where he says i will redeem you and the third or the fourth cup is the cup of restoration or praise where he says i will take you and i will be your god and so they are fully restored back and so they drink from four cups but in first corinthians 10 16 paul speaks of the communion cup and he calls it the cup of blessing and that is also with what they would have known what the jews that were there would have known is the cup of salvation but but they didn't drink from all of the cups just one the cup of blessing and i'm so grateful that i didn't have to drink from the cup that he drank out of because jesus drank the cup of judgment he drank the cup of judgment when he said in matthew 26 39 let this cup pass for me and yet in our cup of salvation is hardship and persecution and even he tells the disciples some of you will drink from the cup that i've drank from meaning that they would be persecuted but their trial as hard as it was was still a cup of blessing because their own though they might die and then they might even be crucified but they could never pay for their own sins every trial that they could go through was still a cup of blessing because that the cup of judgment has already been drank now look in psalms 116 again verse 13 he says i will call upon the name of the lord so he says i will take the cup and i will worship god because he took the cup for me aren't you glad that he did you see there's a time to raise your voice as we said this morning it's all about emotion but there is a time when god wants to hear your voice i will take the cup he said he inclined his ear he's listening for me to speak up and worship and he says in verse 14 i will pay my vows unto the lord now in the presence of all his people i can't repay him but i can keep what my promises you know we make god all kinds of promises well i'll go to church more i'll uh i'll try to do the things that i should do i'll not use the language that i used to use i'll not do the things that i used to do and then brother jt seems like we're hard to keep our promises without his help it's impossible but david says i'll pay my vows if i promise god something i'm going to i'm going to go through with it god help us today if i promise god something i'm going to do it i'll pay my vows now in the presence of all these people i promised god i would worship him let me worship you lord i promise god i would praise him let me praise you with all the i'll forget about everybody around me i'll forget about the things going on outside i want to worship you because you're worthy of my praise you're worthy of the worship you're worthy of the adoration that i can give i will take the cup i will pay my vows it says i can't repay him i can keep my promises i remember the promises that i made you remember when you got married you made a promise to your wife you said for better or for worse and sometimes you wake up in the morning and it's better and sometimes you wake up in the morning and it's worse but it's for better for worse sometimes it's a couple blessings sometimes it's a cup of hardship but you get up and you pay your vows you do what you promised you would do and so verse 15 of psalms chapter 116 says precious in the sight of the lord is the death of his saints we want to keep our vows don't we all the way to the end verse 16 says o lord truly i am thy servant i am the servant of the son of thine handmaid thou hast loosed my bones i will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving do you have that that you can give to him today you've got you know we we've all got a hand that we can most of us have a hand that we can raise and we've got a voice that we can raise and and we should do that because that's the very least that we could do it's the very least that we could do it here he's done so much for us all we can do is just take the communion and say lord help me to keep my my word i'll take the cup of salvation i'll drink it whatever's in it i'll be a real christian help me to keep my word lord he says oh lord truly i am thy servant i am thy servant the son of thine handmaid thou has loosed my bonds i will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving will call upon the name of the lord i will pay my vows unto the lord now in the presence of all his people in the courts of the lord's house in the midst of the o jerusalem praise she the lord he says i'll pay my vows i'll keep my promises you remember one of the disciples peter was a little bit of a loudmouth and he made a lot of promises he couldn't keep i feel like peter sometimes i think most of us can identify with that at some point in our lives come out there and said i he said they ain't ever gonna take you jesus said get the behind me satan peter said i'll be with you all the way to the end you're not gonna run me off pastor pastor jesus you're not gonna run me off it don't matter how hard you preach it doesn't matter what happens i'm here next service he's gone because the next service was difficult the next service jesus was crucified or about to be crucified he was being beaten and he'd been taken by the romans and all the hopes and dreams of the disciples seemed to be shattered and and peter denied him before he denied him jesus told him something he said i've prayed for you you look back at the moments of your life you look back at what you were and what you've been through and how many times you made promises to god you couldn't keep but jesus said i prayed for you and when he said that he had not only said he prayed for him but he said but all those who believe through their testimony i'm one of those amen so he prayed for me he prayed for you he said i prayed for you and when you were converted i said the problem peter the reason you can't keep your word the reason you just can't seem to deliver it is you've just not been converted yet but when you are strengthen your brethren well peter must have felt when jesus came back to him he knew he'd not kept his word but jesus never talked to him about it peter had already repented but now jesus come back he said would you feed my sheep do you love me if you love me feed my sheep if you love me feed my lambs if you love me i've got something for you to do if you love me keep your word peter he challenged a man who had fallen a man who had failed to do something even greater oh my peter denied him but jesus never denied peter so grateful for that we get embarrassed though of sometimes of what we believe we shouldn't be brother branham tells the story of a girl went to college and got on the wrong company you all know the story she comes home and she's riding along in the train she got this little girl that she brought home with her and as they're riding along they come to the stop and there's a woman there that scarred all over her face and her neck drawed up and little hands bony watching for her to get off the train and a little girl that was with her said look at that little hag out there on the train track and isn't she awful looking that was this other girl's mother and she sat there and thought well i don't want to make my friend embarrassed i'm embarrassed that that's my mother she looks like that and so she said oh she's very ugly they got off the train and mary the little girl's name was mary and she got off the train and her mother ran up and said oh darling i'm so glad to see you and she turned her back to her she said i don't know you and started to walk away just like peter did there was a conductor standing there he said wait a minute i know how mary's mom got those scars you see when mary was a baby the house caught on fire she was hanging laundry out on the line and and mary was in the in the house a little baby unable to get out and the fireman said you can't go in there and the fire was taken up the house but she covered her face in a wet blanket she run in when she come out she couldn't use the blanket for herself she had to save the baby so she put the blanket around the baby and run out with it and her face was scarred to save mary and she was she she was ashamed to be identified with the very thing that saved her so the reason she's ugly is so you might be pretty you mean you would turn your back on your mother that made such a sacrifice and in shame she bowed her head you see paul says i'm not ashamed of the gospel of christ not ashamed of the fact that he died for me not ashamed of the fact that my sins drove the nails in his hands and his feet i'm not ashamed to take communion i'm not ashamed to stand for him i'm not ashamed because it is the power of god to salvation to everyone that believeth to the jew first and also to the greek i will take the cup because you took the cup for me aren't you glad you have a god like that would you just think about his benefits for just a moment what he's done for you how he saved you how he brought you out and then he brought you to this place where you could just do something it's not much the elements in themselves don't mean anything but it's a symbol of the fact that he gave his blood for you his body was broken for you he said in this due in remembrance of me i can't repay you for what you did lord but i can take the cup we bow our heads together i'm just going to stop there i i feel like it's a good time for the communion service to begin if i could get a piano player an organ player we can begin to play the old rugged cross i let's just have a word of prayer heavenly father we're so grateful to be able to do this today satan has fought us at every turn lord we know you're a god who knows everything before it happens and even satan is a creature of permission he's not able to keep us or to hinder us any more than you allow him to so we thank you for that lord we believe that you've done for us something that we cannot repay but we can take the cup that's the least we can do we can pay our vows we can raise our hand and say man you did so much for me lord i'm not worthy to stand here any more than any of these other folks lord but you took the cup you took the cup of judgment so i could take a cup of blessing so that i could be healed so that i could be saved lord if i'm persecuted if if people are ashamed of the message that i believe if they're ashamed of of the gospel that i hold to may it not bother me lord i'll take the cup i'll pay my vows i'll do the little things that you ask me to do because it's little foxes that spoil the vine i pray lord that you'd help us to have that attitude i'll do that today lord i pray that you just move in our midst lord as we come into this next part of the service and we know that you're here you promised you would be and so we ask you to just come and and fill our hearts as we partake of the communion may you just fill our hearts with love for one another we realize every one of us is a sinner in the flesh but we have a redeemed soul lord may that soul begin to take preeminence in our life begin to be the control tower in our lives we pray lord may we think of one another pray for one another give lord grace to one another i pray that there would be healing take place lord during this service and salvation whatever you have whatever we have need of lord as we obey your word may you do the things that you promised you would do we pray in jesus name amen amen let's sing that saul cherish the old rugged cross that the brothers would come and brother caleb or the caleb that we've asked him to hell
