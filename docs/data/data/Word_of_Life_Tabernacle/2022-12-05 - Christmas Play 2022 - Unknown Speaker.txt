foreign [Music] hold me every day [Music] beautiful but if I just yield this vessel and let him have his way [Music] for me every day [Music] over 2000 years ago in the days of Herod King of Judea Caesar Augustus issued a decree that a census should be taken of the entire Roman world to be taxed everyone was required to go to his town to register so Joseph went up from the town of Nazareth and Galilee to Bethlehem the town of David because he belonged to the lineage of David he went there to register with Mary who was pledged to be married to him with great child Joseph and Mary as they traveled to Bethlehem Mary was exhausted and she told Joseph this baby's going to be born soon this is so Joseph looked a little panicked and he urged the donkey to walk a little bit faster for his sweetheart they came to the first Inn Caesar's Palace and Joseph asked can we stay here stay here The Innkeeper crossed his arms and rudely shouted we have no room for you [Music] they walked around town to the next gym Desert Inn or is that dessert in I may have wrote that wrong Joseph again asked do you have a room available do you have a room available but The Innkeeper could not help him he just shook his head sadly and waved them away feeling desperate and ready to pull out their hair Joseph and Mary walked further along and found the next Inn best Eastern Joseph and Mary asked do you have a place for us to stay do you have The Innkeeper told them I'm sorry I am completely booked I'm sorry I'm completely booked any clean books Mary was becoming quite distressed and groaned in pain Joseph got down on his knees and pleaded with The Innkeeper to help them finally The Innkeeper put a finger to his head and said I have an idea yeah he told the couple you can use my stable out back you can so Mary and Joseph said thank you so much thank you so much and went to the stable where they made themselves as comfortable as they could the baby Jesus was born [Music] Mary wrapped him in swaddling cloths and laid him in the manger okay okay thank you Jesus Jesus Jesus [Music] the angels singing [Music] he was Herald by the Angels born a lonely manger the Virgin Mary was his mother and Joseph voices Earthly father three wise men came from afar they were Guided by shining stars see King Jesus [Music] Jesus Jesus [Music] glory to the new Jesus speaks us Jesus [Music] Lord glory glory to him now nearby there were shepherds out in the field tending to their flock of bleating sheep okay now the sheep can make some noise you know what a sheep says they were enjoying their fairly calm evening and laughed with each other suddenly an angel of the Lord appeared in the sky the ship the Shepherds were terrified they were so scared they fell to the ground the angel gestured grandily and said do not be afraid do not be afraid the angel told him the joyous news this night a savior is born in Bethlehem this night if the savior is born in Bethlehem then a Heavenly Host joined the angel they raised their hands and praised to God and said glory to God in the highest glory to God in the highest and on Earth peace and Good Will to men and when the Angels left the Shepherds were amazed at what they had seen and heard the oldest Shepherd stood to his feet and said let's go to Bethlehem let's go to Bethlehem let's see this for ourselves let's save this for ourselves the other Shepherds jumped up they were all excited and danced about then they said let's go let's go and so the Shepherds herded their sheep to go see the newborn savior they found Mary and Joseph and baby just as the angel had said and when they had seen it they told everyone near and far of what was said about baby Jesus okay down here everybody [Music] God's Christ is [Music] everywhere [Music] come
