that we feel here already we thank you for the opportunity that we have to come to church just tell you how we really feel lord or we don't want to be hindered by by lord what people might think of us but god we just want you to know how much we love you today lord how much you mean to us lord you're worth more than all the world more than everything lord and you're more than enough for my needs lord i pray that you would meet every need that's here tonight speak lord to your people i pray you'd move me out of the way lord move take the opportunity presented by my weakness lord to to make yourself strong i pray you granted today lord lord we know that you are a god who cares lord and we care that's why we're here this morning on a sunday afternoon lord because you cared for us and so we're thankful for that lord but lord you said you care lord that we believe that we cared enough to come then we know we'll receive what we ask for we thank you for that we pray lord that you bless this service in jesus name amen amen amen do you love him this evening so good to be in the house of the lord and to feel his presence here with us i want you to turn with me to uh the book of deuteronomy chapter 32 and verse 11 very familiar scripture to message people i'm so glad to be messaged people this afternoon message 32 and 11. deuteronomy 32 and 11 i should say it is the message amen i enjoy reading from brother branham's quote book as some would say that's where he read from was the was the scriptures amen deuteronomy 32 verse 11 as an eagle stirreth up her nest fluttereth over her young spreadeth abroad her wings taketh them beareth them on her wings i pray the lord would add his blessing to the word you may be seated this evening the nest must be a comfortable place for the chicks as they're born there they're familiar with it it's soft it feels good everything's just prepared for them mama comes down and provides shade when they need it and and gives them food when they need it they don't have to go hunt they don't have to kill anything they just sit there and the food comes down and everything is provided there for them their safety in the nest every once in a while the mama eagles spread her wings and they get to take a ride down into the green pastures and run around for a little bit have a little pentecostal revival and then she gathers them back up whenever there's any danger she takes care of them it's good to be in the nest isn't it it's so good because she just takes care of them and and they i'm sure they appreciate that so much and then as they begin to get bigger you know it's something about a little chick that's just hatched out of an egg it belongs in the nest you look at it and it fits in its surroundings but it's a different thing to see an almost full-grown eagle sitting in a nest it's not where it belongs it needs to be building its own nest and and going out from from mama's home and going out to a place and and begin to be a what it was meant to be and so one morning the little the chick wakes up and begins to begins to think well there's something different about the nest it it's become uncomfortable it's become embarrassing it's become a strange place it i i feel things i didn't feel before in the nest and the reason for that is mama's decided it's time to move and so she stirs the nest by making it uncomfortable enough now i want you to to hear me today because that's what god does in our lives many times it stirs the nest by making it uncomfortable enough that maybe we we're just not happy exactly where we are because he wants us we've reached a maturity level that he wants us to go beyond what we've ever been and to do things that we've never done and so he's moving us on now that is a move of god it's a move of mama eagle to stir the nest but it's not necessarily a great revival although he may use it for that as well but it's actually god will allow things to happen in our lives so that it'll make us uncomfortable enough he said brother ben why did i have to go through what i went through maybe god wanted you to be uncomfortable with where you were are you hearing me tonight maybe god wanted us wants us to be uncomfortable with where we are i tell you what i don't want to gain any comfort from laodicea i don't want to get to a place where i'm so comfortable that i can look around and i just fit in and there's a time when you fit in the nest but now is not the time we're beginning to grow up to a point where we just don't fit in anymore with our surroundings it's time to move and so there's a stir a moving stir means to wake up that's a good thing on a sunday afternoon isn't it wake up start moving it's to agitate a stir that's like that thing they put in a in a washing machine it's called an agitator they tell me the washing machine don't work as good if they don't have one in it at least that's what my wife says it's an agitator that's what god does he agitates us he wakes us up and so it's a move of god but not always in the way that we think it ought to be we find in the wilderness in the old testament that the people were stirred to build the tabernacle in the wilderness and this is the meaning that paul gives in into timothy when he says stir up the gift within you by the laying on of my hands stir it up there's a gift that you have there's something that you have that benefits the body of christ and god wants you to stir it up he doesn't want it to lay there dormant a halfway christian a halfway preacher a halfway singer a halfway church member he wants you to benefit the body of christ you don't want you to always be on the receiving end of everything but he wants you to be on the giving end don't you want to be on that end is so much more blessed to give than to receive so he wants to stir the nest so that you can be uncomfortable enough with your surroundings that you actually begin to use the gift that he gave you sometimes god stirs you up and so we find when the tabernacle when it was time for the tabernacle to be built in the wilderness that god began to stir up the spirit of the people and so it says they came oh i'm so glad we come to the house of the lord today they came everyone whose heart stirred him up that's the people that are here on wednesday sunday afternoon or wednesday night or even a sunday morning in this day and hour it's the people whose hearts stirred them up everyone whom his spirit made willing and they brought the lord's offering now notice what they were stirred up for they were stirred up to bring an offering that god has all different ways of stirring us up sometimes to bring an offering stir up our spirit to bring an offering and so they brought an offering to the work of the tabernacle of the congregation for all his service and for the holy garments verse 26 it says all the women whose heart stirred them up in wisdom spun goat's hair now you would have thought that if god stirred the hearts of the women that he would have stirred them to be like miriam and run around and dance with it with a timbrel that's not what he did i think about half of us are asleep this afternoon he didn't stir him up to all dance like miriam there's a time for that but he stirred him up to spin goat's hair because that's the job that needed to be done all that god today would stir up some men and women some boys and girls stir up the spirits of people so that they could do the job that needed to be done see if you'll allow the holy spirit he'll stir you up to be to mature in your work to mature in who you are to become a mature christian to be a better pastor better songwriter better whatever it is that you are if you're just a lay member in the church he'll stir you up to do your part in the house of god so the women were stir up stirred up in wisdom to spun goat's hair exodus thirty six two it says moses called bezalil in ohio lab every wise-hearted man in whose heart the lord had put wisdom even everyone now notice there's two parts to it so god put the wisdom in them what was this wisdom for this wisdom was to do certain things for the tabernacle some of them it was to make the gold pieces some of them it was to make the uh the brass some of them was to to to weave the goat's hair together there was different things that they had to do and he and he stirred them up to be able to do this this is what makes a church work is when god stirs up the spirit of the piano player stirs up the spear of the organ player stirs up the spirit of the drummer stirs up although you don't want him stirred up too much but stir up the spirit of the people in the congregation he stirs them up to work stirs them up to work oh my and so we find the same thing when they rebuilt the temple after they had solomon's temple had been destroyed you remember the story how that they heard that the temple had been torn down and the walls of jerusalem were torn down and god stirred up the spirit of men because god always uses a man but the bible said he doesn't use the agency of a mechanical device he uses men he uses men and god stirs up their spirit and i'm glad today that god has stirred up the spirit of some preachers to preach this message god has stirred up the spirit of some people to listen to this message to be a part of the house of god even on a sunday afternoon god stirs up their spirit to be able to do it and so the lord the bible says in haggai 114 the lord stirred up the spirit of zerubbabel the son of shield till governor of judah and the spirit of joshua the son of jose the high priest and the spirit of all the remnant of the people so notice what he did he he stirred up the spirit of the natural governor he stirred up the spirit of the priesthood and he stirred up the spirit of the remnant of the people so he works on both ends of the line he works from the pulpit to the pew he works on the deacons he works on the trustees he works on the pastor and he works on the people in the pew god stirring up the spirit that's what we need to get things done somebody's spirit's got to be stirred you realize though but see we take that wrong we think well if god stirred up my spirit i danced in the aisles if god stirred up me in my spirit i'd start preaching no maybe god would stir up your spirit to clean the restrooms maybe god would stir up your spirit to vacuum the floor i know sometimes he stirs mine maybe god stir up your spirit you realize it's the same holy ghost the same holy ghost that moves in me to preach moves in my wife to clean the house it's the same holy ghost that moves on on the song leader to sing or the or the specials or the or the musicians the same holy ghost that moves on them moves on you to raise your hand moves on you to lift your voice moves on you to clap your hands it's the same god it just stirs up the gift that's already in you gifts and callings are without repentance but he actually stirs the nest and puts you sometimes in uncomfortable places because he wants you to manifest what you were born to be amen now sometimes god will stir up the spirit of your enemies now we don't like that as well do we we want to we want we want to see the people stirred up and the people in revival sometimes in order to get us where we need to be god will stir up the spirit of our enemies that's what he did in the bible listen first kings 11 and 9 the lord was angry with solomon because his heart was turned from the lord god of israel which had appeared on him twice and commanded him concerning this thing that he should not go after other gods but he kept not that which the lord commanded wherefore the lord said unto solomon for as much as this has done of thee and thou hast not kept my covenant in my statutes which i have commanded thee i will surely rend the kingdom from thee i will give it to thy servant and verse 14 he said the lord stirred up an adversary unto solomon hadad the edomite he was of the king's seed in edom you remember some sometimes god will bring an adversary into your life just to stir you up to make you do what you were supposed to do you remember samuel's mom when she was there hannah i believe her name was she was there in the temple she was crying why was she weeping why was she so so wanting a child so badly well it's because she had an adversary in her life and the other wife of her husband was her adversary right it was an adversary in the home that caused her to be stirred up to want to produce a child and that child become a prophet of the lord but the reason why she was crying she was stirred up is because of the adversary and so god sometimes will stir up your enemies and that's why you can't get too upset at them you can't get too mad at people who do you wrong because sometimes god will stir up business people against you he will stir up people at work against you sometimes god will do it and you say why would they be against me i haven't done anything wrong well maybe in some cases we have and god does it for that reason but there's times when there's nothing wrong god just wants to make you uncomfortable he needs you to be uncomfortable so you can become something better he said god wouldn't do that to me god would never make me uncomfortable god would never make me uncomfortable by a sermon he said well i won't go if i'm uncomfortable listen sometimes god wants you to be uncomfortable have you never done that to your children there's times you want them to be uncomfortable listen if my son's not i see he's not working he's not doing what he's supposed to be doing i need to make him uncomfortable enough that he learns how to work right i need to make him uncomfortable enough i'm sure that some of you could say amen to that we got to make our children uncomfortable enough just we don't want to hurt them that's not the purpose but you've got to make them uncomfortable enough so that they don't want to live we don't want to stay in that condition you've got to make them uncomfortable sometimes god has to make you uncomfortable sometimes he's got to make me uncomfortable sometimes bring an adversary into our life just so that we stay where we're supposed to be and do and become what we're supposed to become again in in first kings 11 or first chronicles rather 5 25 it says they transgressed against the god of their fathers when a whoring after the gods of the people of the land whom god destroyed before them and the god of israel stirred up the spirit of poor king of assyria and till the till gasps feel he's their king of assyria and he carried them away do you realize god might stir up the spirit of the democrat party or the republican party i'm gonna quit doing that whatever it is they they stir up this he'll stir up the spirit of the political party just to make you uncomfortable enough to want to go home he'll stir up the spirit of the people he'll strive have you ever wondered about why in this age suddenly everybody's against the message everybody's got a website everybody these things were always out there people were always saying stuff but all of a sudden it come on so intensely maybe god stirred up the spirit of some people to try to make them disprove the message just so it could become more settled in our heart god of israel the god of israel stirred up the spirit of the king of assyria he carried them away even the reubenites and the ghanaians and the half tribe of manasseh and brought them into hala and haybor inherit to the river goes into this day he stirred them up to move them ii chronicles 21 16 he said moreover the lord stirred up against jehoram another king of israel the spirit of the philistines of the arabians that were near the ethiopians philistines that might be the democrats right there might stir up people in your church god would never do that and sometimes they might be good people and that's why we got to react like david did we said maybe the lord told him to do that it's not that it's right to do you understand but you can't come too hard against it because you need to recognize what god's doing in your life verse 17 it says they came up into judah and break into it and carried away all the substance that was found in the king's house and his sons and his wives so that there was never a son left him i love this save jehovah has the youngest of his sons there had to be a seedline there had to be a king so one was spared so god sometimes stirs up your enemy sometimes god stirs up kings or people with power in your life to fulfill prophecy ezra chapter one we're all familiar with this so that's sometimes he stirs up your enemies sometimes he'll stir up friends aren't you glad to have friends and sometimes your friends are not always how can i put this because you do have to be careful who you hang out around but sometimes god will stir up the spirit of someone outside the message the spirit of someone outside of maybe of your family outside of what we would call even a believer and it will stir up their spirit to help you and you don't even know why but it's god getting something done right he's stirring the spirit now ezra chapter one verse one now in the first year of cyrus king of persia that the word of the lord whether it's the purpose of god stirring up the spirit of osiris is to fulfill the word of the lord by the mouth of jeremiah might be fulfilled the lord stirred up the spirit of cyrus king of persia that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom and put it also in writing saying thus says say osiris king of persia the lord god of heaven has given me all the kingdoms of the earth he had charged me to build him a house at jerusalem which is in judah who is there among you all of all his people listen a heathen king making a proclamation god stirred up his spirit to make a proclamation and say where is god's people at he said his god be with him let him go up to jerusalem which is in judah and build the house of the lord god of israel he said he is the god which is in jerusalem god can stir them up a times memory needs to be stirred and i'm just kind of laying a background for where i want to go today and then we'll close quickly but sometimes memory must be stirred god will allow you to remember certain things on purpose but he's got to stir you up to do that and sometimes by repeating it to you over and over ii peter 1 13 peter says yeah i think it me as long as i'm in this tabernacle to stir you up by putting you in remembrance peter says as long as i'm alive i'm going to be telling the story as long as i'm alive i'm going to be repeating it i'll repeat it on sunday morning on sunday afternoon i'll repeat it i'm not gonna i'm not gonna go see we can in smaller services and afternoon times in times we tend to back up and that's the tale right there because what god wants us to do is take a step forward sometimes when there's not a hundred people in the building god wants you to step forward and be a worshiper god wants you to step forward and put more into it right than what you would most of the time and sometimes he's got to stir up your memory to do that he said as long as i'm in this tabernacle to stir you up by putting you in remembrance knowing that shortly i must put off this tabernacle even as our lord jesus christ has shown me so he said i'm not going to be here forever i've been shown what kind of death i'm going to die i'm going to die like he did so he said i want to stir up your pure minds way of remembrance that's what he says in second peter 3 1 the second epistle i write unto you and both which i stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance that you may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets and of the commandment of us the apostles of the lord and savior there's a difference in knowing something and being mindful of it all right i hate to use peter as an example but peter i'll tell him go take out the trash he'll get up put his shoes on go outside come back in a few minutes and say i don't know what i was doing out there so well you forgot to take the trash with you there's a difference in knowing something being told something and being mindful of it right when you're mindful of it you keep it on your mind if you're not mindful of it the first little distraction you'll go a different direction right and so you've got to be mindful of the words of the prophets you've got to be mindful of the commandment of the apostles he wants you to be awake to be alive as we said this morning to be in a place where you're awakened and stirring where you're stirred enough to be able to know what's going on where you're not caught up in a comatose kind of feeling where you're not charged overcharged as the scripture said with surfeiting which is just an overabundance of of sights and sounds and overabundance of food and overabundance of things until you get to the point where you can't operate in a spiritual realm anymore he wants you to be awake so he makes the nest uncomfortable and that allows the little eagles that the eagle mother eagle has raised to fly for themselves brother brown said this mother there comes a time she's got to stir up this nest and she throws it all out throws all the soft part out and puts some trials on you you realize that means you're at a place of maturity god would not allow you that to be done unless you're at a place of maturity you're ready to fly but the fact that you're going through it means you're at a place of maturity to take it now that's just the truth now it says because he will not put more on you than you can bear he said now what would a little buzzard do sitting in that nest he'd never get out of there that's all but an eagle he stirs his nest and he's ready he said now one day she says now i think it's time to take my little children on a flight and she comes screaming out of the air and they say yeah there comes mama now see you've got to be able to be stirred enough to recognize when mom is coming does that make sense he said they know it just like a church filled with the holy ghost when the holy ghost begins to fall hands will go up it's like hallelujah he's here amen he said oh i'm so glad why here sit your neighbor there he said you don't care who's sitting there mother jehovah oh i like the way he put that mother jehovah he's both father and mother to us he's el shaddai uh the the mother that we can go to and nurse from as we said this morning listen he said hallelujah he's here he said when your neighbor sits there you don't care who's sitting there mother jehovah is coming into the nest let him fall tonight let him scatter his big wings across this place here pack every person from a wheelchair every center to the altar he will come riding in on the wings of an eagle he said yes sir he will come in if he'll if you'll let him if you'll invite him you hear that scream come my sheep know my voice they can tell that brother brown said he was talking to a doctor he said billy i was having this meeting in a high school auditorium at jeffersonville and the people got shouting and praising the lord evidently the doctor had come to the meeting and he said he got shouting and praising the lord down there because some things happen and the doctor said to me i said what do you think about that doc he said billy you know what i think then people are just excited i said you're a doctor and you know you can't be excited unless there's something there to excite you i'm not concerned so much about that you know all the people are going to be excited the tears and the wheat right when the rain falls the tears and the wheat rejoice if there's no nothing we're to rejoice then then you got you're not you can't be a wheat right you know they say well there's false out there yes there's false out there there's false money out there don't make you quit using money right what does it do it makes you check more carefully to see if it's a real dollar bill or maybe a 20 maybe you wouldn't check a dollar bill anymore but he said these people are just excited he said but you know you can't be excited unless there's something there to excite you he said oh glory to god it sure does it's the holy ghost comes in and excites us we're ready to take a flight one of these days to glory he said sure it's excitable if that wasn't excitable i'd change it for something that was excitable if i got the holy ghost and it produced a sour dour that's a word we still use today a person who was always down in the moly grubs i'd go find something that was excitable i'm sorry if the message of the hour produced a negative attitude from the pulpit to the pew then i go find something that can produce a positive faith to get me in the rapture if all it produces is a is a negativity in our lives then what do we have and so we ought to be able to thank god if we're the only ones i know you know today's like today when there's people missing you think well just a few of us will just settle down but there's an excitability because there's something there that excites us and we're not excited as i said this morning by music or by something else we're excited by the word the word has an excitability to it because we know it's talking to us hey man i can get happy on a sunday afternoon even hearing about what jesus did for me even hearing about the blood of jesus even hearing about the things that god did even 2000 years ago he said well that's an old story it's not to me it's not 2 000 years old to me it's a present reality i know that the blood of jesus christ cleanses me from all sin i know that's working today i know he's doing that on a daily basis he didn't just do that once on calvary he's doing that today brother branham saw that vision of jesus as he was standing there he said it was like a bumper his blood was like a bumper and he said the sin would hit him and he would wince and he said that must be the sins of the world he said no that's your sins that's just your sense oh my aren't you glad he's still doing that today he's still an advocate today that ought to be enough to make us excited if it doesn't we should get something that we can be excited about i mean in whatever way you get excited maybe excited to some of you is just getting a hand up but it means something to you he said i can prove to you by science anything doesn't move is dead now we don't have to move in any certain way but it better move right he said you know if a baby's born and it don't cry it don't squall it don't do nothing he said that baby's dead that's what's the matter with the church today we've got too many stillborn babies they come in and assimilate with the church as part of the church and and they enjoy the worship and they enjoy the songs they come in and they're there for a while maybe they're there for years and they have children grandchildren and they're part of the church they they assimilate they believe oh brother branham was the prophet all these things but they were stillborn and and the problem is that if it's stillborn it doesn't have any life in it to produce a manifestation of the word and so he says he said uh that's right he said if a baby's born if you don't cry don't squall it don't do nothing that baby's dead that's what's the matter with the church today we've got too many stillborn babies he said you know what the doctor usually does pick him up by the heels what's he got to do make the baby uncomfortable always bothered me doctor hitting around on the baby you know they rough him up i remember when peter was born he wasn't breathing like he should be and they roughed him up he wasn't making noise and then he started screaming and it's like oh we want to stop him stop him screaming they said no that's what he's supposed to be doing that's what we want him to do sometimes god's got to rough us up a little bit he's got to get us moving a little bit because he wants right he wants us to be able to live and so in order to do that he's got to make it a little bit uncomfortable for us you bring something to your mind you'll bring conviction on you and you think lord i'm a good christian why do i have to deal with this he's making you just a little bit uncomfortable he's allowing you to be a little uncomfortable so that maybe you could go to an altar maybe you could you could cry out to god at home in your closet maybe you could talk to somebody about it making you uncomfortable enough getting out of your comfort zone so that you could become what god wants you to be he wants you to live he don't want you to be dead is that right and a dead church is not just a church with no emotion although that's part of it but it's a church that doesn't have any manifestation of the spirit in it right a manifestation of the spirit is a manifestation of the word because the spirit of the word are the same that's right now look and so we need that we need something to stir us up that's what the doctor does gives him a little posterior protoplasm stimulation he said that fixes him up just right and what the church needs today is a good old-time stimulation of the power of the holy ghost to come into the church so he's talking about no wonder caleb could stand there and say give me my mountain because he'd been drinking on the wine that was made from the grapes amen that they got there and been drinking on it for 45 years he was stimulated hallelujah what the church needs today it's a good old time of stimulation the power don't you want that in your life don't you want that in the church a good old-time stimulation of the power of the holy ghost to come into the church tear us up and shake us stir up the nest and blow out the loose feathers pentecost needs a stirring he said blow out the loose feathers we've got too much doubt among his superstitions could it be so would it be so certainly it's so do we believe that tonight certainly if so god's word said it so not because i feel like it not because we can get excited about the word even when we don't feel like it even when it feels like everything's against us even when it feels like things get weaker and weaker every day why do we get excited because we know god said so god's word said it's so eagle's food proves it's so you say everybody's doing what they shouldn't be doing but he said this end time bride will not fall thank you for giving me my freedom this afternoon i appreciate you being here but this is we ought to be able to be excited about the word amen he says god's word says it so eagles food proves it so sure it is eagle jehovah comes in and stirs up the nest and the church he said is getting too stagnated he said better come in and stir it up will you say brother branham i've already got the holy ghost he said yeah but it's got some loose feathers in there see he don't work on those that are not his sons he he reproves his sons he corrects his children he stirs up his children he blows those winds across the children's nest hallelujah because the nest listen to me it's only a temporary place it's not meant to be for eternity but he wants you to be soaring in the skies he don't want you to be in the nest all the rest of your life he don't want you to just be and sit back in comfort at ease in zion he wants you to fly hallelujah into the heavenlies look he says i've already got the holy ghost yeah but it gets some loose feathers in there amen now what is the result of that what happens when you stir the nest well the eagles learn how to fly brother brown said the old mother eagles determined that they won't get adjusted to that nest too much and you sit there and i know how we do i've done it lord i was just getting comfortable i've done that i didn't long ago i was pretty comfortable i'm an associate pastor you know the associate pastor is the most popular person in the church like the backup quarterback you rarely have to go in and and the pastor takes all the flack i was doing pretty good for myself i had a decent job i thought i'm doing pretty good god started stirring the nest god's determined that we won't get too adjusted he's determined that a newborn babe isn't going to get too adjusted to this world he said that's right he don't want us to get adjusted here he's going to take us get going to get ready to take us on a flight oh do you believe he's getting you ready today i believe god is stirring the nest today we've seen him stir the nest of this message what has he done we've been stirred we see spiritual death all around us in the land we see every denominational system falling we see we see church become just a rock concert or some kind of a some kind of a show we see a hollywood showmanship we see the failure of denominational systems we see a great falling away even among the message we see a great falling away we see people that fall away from truth they once held and they don't just fall away from a prophet but they fall away from the bible they fall away from the standards of the word why do they fall that far because it's a great falling away spiritual death and it stirs the nest we've been stirred we're stirred by false brethren let me just talk to you for a moment before we close we're stirred by false brethren in the message anointed false ones if you'd like to put it a different way but the brown said false anointed ones but they they're not the anointing is not false so they can preach under the anointing but we've been stirred by false brethren we've been stirred by men who make themselves the message you look at it shakes you up when you see the results of it it becomes cold dead formal because a man only preaches himself instead of the message we get stirred sometimes by egregiously false doctrine and you sit there and you wonder how in the world could somebody believe that and say they're a believer if you're going to believe that why claim to believe in a prophet because brother browner said the opposite of that but it stirs us when we see it stirs us to read the bible and get and hear the message we've been stirred by a pandemic church is closed we'd never dealt with that before we'd never have to we never had to deal with not being able to work not being able to have church not being able to go anywhere huh what what a stirring that that caused how it caused us in our spirits to to try to find out lord what are you doing what what time do we live in we see churches that were closed some still closed today people immobilized by fear unable to move some of them still today somebody put a picture of a church dinner that we had the other day just a few people there and somebody from outside from another place not a message believer nobody like that but somebody from another place saw the picture and commented and said how terrible it was that people could be having church dinners it's been almost two years people are still immobilized by fear and i'm not saying we shouldn't be careful but look but it stirs us we've been stirred by the loss of loved ones yet we know that there's a certain amount of them that have to go that way just lost by the bobby bivens there's been others that have gone on we see that older generation leaving us i i'm scared sometimes when i see look around the message i see an older generation of pastors many of them getting older beginning to get sickness in their bodies and things and then getting older and some of them even passing away we've been stirred by that it stirs our hearts because we see a generational change we wonder is the new generation up to the challenge but in that time we've also been stirred positively we've been stirred by revelation i can't tell you a time when the revelation of the word was more clear in my heart in my life than it is right now and i hope it's more tomorrow you understand i hope you can say the same thing it's more clear today than it's ever been but it'll be clearer tomorrow i i we've been stirred by revelation maybe we didn't understand like we should have before but now we see what where we're at and the time that we live in that we're living in that time of the rapture we see it we've been stirred when is the word been this clear it's never been this clear to us before even though it was already there we've been stirred by a move of the spirit and we've seen it among the young people and some of you young people have participated in that and you see it at the youth camps and things you see a stir among the people is it all is it all true probably not there's probably some of it is just fake but you realize that some of the people sitting on the like a bump on a log that's fake sometimes too right so it goes both ways but we've been stirred by it and i think of what brother branham taught us and what we see in the scripture about the pool of bethesda and how that the angel of a certain season would come down and he would stir the waters and brother adam talked about that a lot because it was a healing revival it was a healing a ministry that took place there that angel that came down and brother branham's praying he says god how happy we would be he said if just now he said i know you've already done the healing he said if you could just give them a little extra push tonight sometimes that's what we need just a little extra push we believe but we need a little extra push he says as it was just push them into the pool while it's troubled lord and so these things that we talked about all these things work god allows him to happen so that we could be stirred to be pushed into that troubled water pushed him into the pool while it's troubled lord he said granted and maybe that same angel that whirled down from the skies and troubled that water maybe that's the same one that comes night after night he said i do not know thou knowest but the bible said it was an angel i believe it and i pray father the while the waters will be stored stirred tonight troubled choppy people raising up here looking at that screaming out he said may everyone the angel of god just spread his great wings as it were around this building tonight and push everyone right into the pool hallelujah don't you want to be pushed into the pool today lord push me into the pool that's where the water's troubled don't let me be complacent don't let me get to a point where i can't be stirred anymore but let me be pushed into the pool he said may that angel of god spread his great wings and push everyone right into the pool and may there come a perfect healing tonight healing of soul and body through this building may there not be a people one left we've been stirred but what stirs the bride today what stirs the bride said well all these things stir us that's true but what really stirs us that's right the word stirs us look at isaac and rebecca isaac and rebecca rebecca is down there and eliezer goes to find her and she's she comes at the right moment in the evening time and eliezer is sitting there by the well and she comes and something strangely stirs her to do something now watch she brother brown said she made her decisions quick he said watch her real quick then in the meeting he said quickly if they're ordained to eternal life they'll know it how many times did brother branham he would say she missed it or he missed it because they didn't respond quickly enough that's the way it is in church too listen if you sit back on your heels forgive me for men in baseball there's an idea that if the pitcher works slowly that the defense will sit on their heels right they're taken back and so they're more likely to commit errors because the pitcher is working slowly he's just kind of moping around out there he wants to be taken out he's ready to go he's tired it's a hot day whatever the game doesn't matter he's ready to go and so the defense gets back on his heels that's the way we get in church sometimes and sometimes when the ball does get hit to us the word comes right straight down our alley right there right straight down we don't know what to do with it we dropped the ball because it's kind of like you know you get somebody that catches one balls all the time in football they'll catch it but if you get somebody that never catches the ball he's not used to it the first time he catches it the first time he gets targeted he always drops the ball why does he drop the ball because he's not prepared for it said coach they never used me before but we got to be ready because god wants to give gifts to us he wants to help us he wants to provide for us he wants to speak to our hearts and we got to be ready to hear it we sit back on our heels we'll com we'll end up not taking advantage of the blessing that it would be listen he said she meant quickly if they're ordained to eternal life they'll know it there's something in the message that stirs them he said that's what stirred rebecca oh my the message stirred her hallelujah if we're going to be excited let's be excited about the message of the hour that's my message the message stirred her the angel was leading her he said oh can't you see the picture the angel the lord leading her then she was stirred hallelujah he said and immediately when she watered the camel the gift went on her notice what she was stirred to do to water camels somehow eliezer's message stirred her to water camels now look he said he began to take out the earrings which means faith cometh by hearing he put the bracelets on the works of your hands he got her ready and as soon as she begin to water give the waters of life testify tell others get the message out tell them what has happened to you say brother amen but i want to preach in church i want to be a preacher will you be a preacher in your home even a woman can be a preacher to her children you won't stop a preacher from preaching a preacher will preach and then if a man is called to preach behind the pulpit he'll find a pulpit to preach behind if you've got to stand on a soapbox i tried to quit one time as a teenager i tried to quit preaching i said i'm not gonna preach because everything wasn't perfect in the church i was in i said i'm done i'm not gonna preach anymore and i felt like jeremiah he said it was a fire in my bones i couldn't stop and i actually backslid on god and i had to promise god i would preach i've never done that again because i'm afraid to because i couldn't feel the the presence of god like i used to i had to promise god i would preach but you got to preach wherever wherever there's an opportunity to preach you got to preach you got to water amen give out the waters of life testify tell others get the message out tell them what has happened to you he said and then there was another great decision had to be made after she was given and the parents said well i would just let her stay around about 10 days he said let her hang around the revival to really feel whether she's decided to do it or not he said i haven't got much confidence in a person making a decision to wait even until tomorrow but the message that stirred rebecca she was satisfied the message was from god when you know it's god go do it go tell it go testify of it and if you don't know don't go i'll get on the back side of the desert until you know look she said so the parent said let her stick around for a while she'll get over it it's just a little excitement she was over to that revival you know but oh then the true servant said don't worry us don't hinder me he said a lot of the servants of god has been hindered by put off decisions right people hear the word but they don't do it so the servants of god are hindered by put off decisions oh i'm preaching to somebody right now maybe it's somebody away from here you never know but i'm preaching to somebody you take it personally if it fits he said don't don't he said a lot of servants of god has been hindered by put off decisions don't hinder me seeing that the lord has sent me seeing that he's been good to me don't hinder me he said let her make her own decision that's where you stand tonight make your own decision then they called rebecca and said will you go with this man or do you want to stay around a little while to see whether you really want to do it she said i'll go she was ready her decision was quickly made she knew there was something been leading her she knew that something had happened to her and she knew that it was god and she was satisfied she wanted to go quickly she put on her garment she got all the gifts that was sent to her by the father to meet the son he said oh god if the church could only make that decision right quick put on all of her gifts and she climbed up on the camel and took out and it was in the evening time when isaac had wandered from the tent out in the into the fields to meditate when he seen the camels coming rebecca looked at him and then it was love at the first sight she had to believe it before she went faith cometh by hearing she didn't know what the man looked like it didn't make no difference it was god making the decisions he said i don't care whether he's bigger little what color he is that makes me no difference he's my lord i love him when i see him because he's god's gift to me and you what was she stirred by the message she was stirred by eliezer's message to water the very power that would carry her back home you and i have been disturbed by the message of the hour are you hearing me i'm closing tonight church but are you hearing me we've been stirred by the message of the hour that's why we have these sunday afternoon services that's why we're trying to do everything we can try to be in revival as much as we can why because we've been stirred by the message of the hour amen we've been stirred and that's when you receive the gifts that make a difference in your life is when you're stirred to water the camels to water the holy spirit have you been stirred by the message tonight what did the message stir you to did it stir you to a debate did it stir you just to be a say i believe in a prophet or is there something in your heart that it stirs you every time you hear it it stirs you lord i want to water the camel i want i want to produce the manifestation of the holy ghost in my life i want to praise you i want to worship you that's what it ought to stir us to do that's what how it all disturbs even on a sunday afternoon or on a wednesday night or wherever we might be at home or away it ought to stir us the message of the hour ought to be enough that when we hear it when we listen to it when we read it when we read our the bible because this bible has become a new book and the day that we live in when we read the bible under the revelation of the opening of the word it ought to stir us to action it ought to make us begin to worship god and say god i know i may be in the middle of walmart but i know you're good to me i know you're on your way i know that the rapture process has already begun i know you've begun a good work in me and you're going to finish it have you been stirred have you been stirred well you've been stirred by i've been stirred by the message of the hour i've heard eliezer say come home come home i'm going to present you to isaac come home let me stirred the water the camels if you're stirred that way would you stand with me this afternoon musicians come if you're stirred that way let's just give them give the holy ghost a little bit of water tonight give it a little bit of water water what do you water it with your praise you water it with your worship would you just slip your hands up to him and say lord i've been stirred by the message by the message of the hour not just a certain preacher somewhere but i've been stirred by the message to lift my hands to you and worship you and thank you for the good things that i have in my life i know i'm not worthy lord of my own i know i don't have enough enough in myself i may be tired on a sunday afternoon i may be going through a lot in my life there may be trials all around me lord you may have made the nest so uncomfortable that it seems hard for me to even sit there in the nest it's so sticky and prickly but i know lord you just wanted me to fly oh god if you just help us this afternoon we thank you lord your message has come and stirred us today we've been stirred we've been stirred by the things going around us but
