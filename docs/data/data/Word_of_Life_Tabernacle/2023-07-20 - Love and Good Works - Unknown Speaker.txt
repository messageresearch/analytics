we pray and we ask it in Jesus name [Music] Hebrews chapter 10 verse 19 we're going to read down through verse 25. Hebrews 10 19-25 such a blessing to be in the house of the Lord one of the brothers over the weekend said let's make Church attendance great again and so it is great to be in the house of the Lord amen and so good to see all of you I know some are gone but the Harvey took his wife out for their anniversary and took her somewhere so I thank the Lord for for these deacons and faithful people that we have and all of you you're faithful to the house of the Lord Hebrews 10 19 says having therefore Brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus that means there's nothing off limits to a child of God the very presence the very Shekinah presence of God himself is open to The Believer by a New and Living Way which he hath consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh and having an high priest over the house of God let us draw near with a True Heart in full Assurance of Faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience our bodies washed with pure water let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering or he is faithful that promised and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to Good Works not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another and so much the more as you see the day approaching I pray the Lord with that is blessing to the word you may be seated Paul is speaking to born-again believers saints of God I believe we're preaching to the Saints here tonight on a Wednesday night a people who know God people who have had an experience with God not only an experience with God but who have walked with God people people who have seen a change in their life and and they know what it is to come before God they know you know what it is to approach the grace of God with boldness to come boldly Before the Throne of God you know what it is to make mistakes but you also know what it is to be forgiven and and so you have a boldness about you and you have a high priest that can be touched by the feeling of your infirmity aren't you glad for that tonight our great High priests that can be touched in that way of I I don't want to hold you long tonight but I want to look at these scriptures as they as I was reading them earlier this week it struck my heart that we we are too if we're in this condition if we are the children of God if we have boldness to come before God if we have a high priest he said let us in other words there's something that we're supposed to do after having he's done so much for us he's given us so much and he's blessed us so much can you say Amen to that tonight he we are blessed as brother window preached the other night we are a blessed people he said but let us so the US he's talking about is us saints of God children of God Believers as we would say today of the message of the hour let us that's who he's talking to and so verse 22 he said 22 he said let us draw near huh let us join here and I would say this to you that once you've been born again once you've you've had an experience with God once you you you've believed the message of that or maybe you've been walking that way for years but now is not the time to to go back now is not the time to fall off now is not the time to get lukewarm but now is the time to let us draw near draw near that's something we have to do now God has done so much for us but we've got to draw near it's available to us the way it's open Calvary paid for for our an atonement for us but brother Harold we have to draw near we've got to Kindle that passion as brother window talked about on a Sunday we've got to do that and so we have boldness we we are able to approach the grace of God let us draw near let me just say Amen to that tonight let us draw near with a True Heart or a sincerity brother Brandon when he had that Vision about the Mambo which was the snake and there's a lot to that Vision I preached on it to you before but how that the vision of the snake when he saw it and it was the last serpent that would be defeated he said it was death it represented death and this message is a is a message that causes us to overcome death right we're going home there's we will not all sleep but we shall all be changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye and so there had to be that death had to be defeated and brother Branham not knowing what to do he stood there and he asked the angel he said what shall I do and he said you've got to be more sincere than what you are now he's speaking to a prophet of God who had drawn near with sincerity but he said there's a higher place you can come to there's there's a greater sincerity that you can come to I believe that's true for us church as much as we've heard and as much as we know and as much as we've experienced of the presence of God as much of the goodness of God as we fail over the weekend we can still draw near there's a place for us there's there's a there's a sincerity a level of sincerity that we can come to let us strong here with a true heart with sincerity in full Assurance of faith Hallelujah so our sincerity does not make us question our salvation but in our sincerity we are to have a full Assurance of faith knowing that we have been born again and we live in that age of full assurance this is the age of that brother random said this he said my Ministry is not to personally contact each one it's to bring forth the full Assurance of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus and tell them look and live so in other words he's saying my my Ministry is not just to lay hands on people and heal the sick but it's to cause the people to know but Alan that that Christ has is risen from the dead that he's alive and people miss that many times we miss the uh the forest for the trees we we see all the little doctrines and little things but his ministry was to show us that Jesus Christ is still the same yesterday today and forever to show us that he is there is a resurrected Lord Jesus who's alive today and who's able to take care of what we need today how many believe that today is to bring that full assurance and and so Paul says full Assurance comes from having your heart sprinkled to cleanse from a guilty conscience and that's what it's going to take because all of us could have a guilty conscience tonight but you need your heart sprinkled by the word of God by the blood of God all desire of sin to be gone and though you make mistakes but the desire is to serve God your want to has been changed your bodies have been cleansed Paul says by pure water the washing of water of the word aren't you glad for that today so he said let us draw near now in verse 23 that's we're going to get down to where I what I want to talk about tonight he said let us again all right he's not talking to the Baptist or the Methodist or somebody else down the street or another church he's talking to us let us someone say let us let us hold fast let us put our anchor down let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promise the profession is the confession of our faith let us hold our confession without wavering right in other words I know that God sent a prophet without wavering I know I've been born again without wavering I know I'm a Child of God without wavering let us hold fast no matter what comes or goes no matter what wind blows no matter how many times the devil tries to come and say oh there's nothing to the message of the hour there's nothing to the preaching of the word there's nothing to the move of the spirit let us hold fast let us hold fast it's important for our children that we hold fast it's important for our families that we hold fast let us hold our profession or our confession without wavering for he is faithful the promise he said he would heal me I believe it he said he would save my children I believe it he said there would be a people a bride without spotter wrinkle I believe it let us hold fast our confession without wavering he is faithful that promise so the Amplified version of that says this way so let us seize and hold fast and retain without wavering the hope we cherish and confess and our acknowledgment of it for he who promised is reliable and faithful to his word brother Brown speaking about that that verse he said but when we woke up before God let's not go saying well now I just wonder if everything is all right are you a Christian well I hope I am he said that's no way to come brother believe the story accept it and be born again then walk up with pure faith knowing this that God has promised and God can't lie how many believe that tonight promised and God can't lie God promised me eternal life if I believed on his son Jesus Christ I believed it and he'd give me eternal life he said I made many mistakes I still make them we'll always make them but when I make them the Holy Spirit tells me that's wrong then I Repent right there Lord forgive me didn't mean to do it you helped me now and I walk right on the same thing because just no sooner than it goes from my lips if we confess our sins he is just to forgive them he said is that right Hallelujah the devil say you know what I'll tell you you were supposed to go do a certain thing you didn't do it has ever told you that huh you didn't do it all oh you sinned didn't you say I confessed it well I tell you no don't talk to me I'm not gonna come to before God I'm not going to come before the throne of grace with a wavering confession so he's tell the Devil he's going to talk to me no sir I have perfect faith in he who told me oh do you have perfect faith in him tonight not perfect faith in myself but perfect faith in him and he who told me if I confess my wrongs he would forgive me so I confess it just go on away from me I don't care nothing about you anyhow so just keep moving on right I don't care nothing about the devil he is but Jesus said it this way he has nothing in me yes he has no part with me there is there's no part that the devil has with us he don't want nothing to do with us just tell him to quit talking shut up devil all right just quit talking just confess it hold your confession without wavering walk boldly he said right on into it if death lays there that's all right move right on with it move right on into it with a perfect faith that God has promised he would raise you up at the last days oh isn't that wonderful let us oh this is simple tonight but I just something I wanted to get to I know you're all tired I'm tired from the weekend and y'all work so hard but let us let us take a moment and look at where we're at just examine our own lives let us let us and let's reflect on what we were doing this weekend what were we doing let us let us consider one another all right that's what we were doing considering one another that word consider means to take careful note of each other's spiritual welfare it denotes attentive Continuous Care yeah like the care that you give to a child when they're out on the parking lot and they're running around you know they're there so you're all they're always on your mind and you're always thinking about you want to make sure they didn't cross the across the the street and go off in the woods somewhere you always have to know where they're at if they get too quiet you go looking for them right it's careful a tentative Continuous Care let us consider one another in other words so I should consider I should consider whether brother Peter maybe he's gotten down and or gotten a little bit worried about something I should consider brother Peter and when I do something I want to consider brother Peter make sure that it doesn't harm him right as preachers we should have the same motto that that the doctors have first Do no harm right because we can do a lot of harm so before we go to fix anything let's see let's consider one another before we go to say something to somebody before we go to do what God has called us to do let's consider one another and what I'm doing really helpful is it really helpful to the body oh I was so happy to see so many people working together and and putting their shoulder to the wheel you don't know what that does for me because I see that as real Christianity because as much as I love the shouting and the running and the and all of that that that's part of it we want that we want to move in the spirit but real Christianity is when you see somebody staying late when they didn't have to pick it up after people when they wouldn't have to yeah helping people when they wouldn't have to caring about somebody else who could never care back for them who wouldn't do it for them but they care anyway while you're considering one another let us right so you said we're I'm born again I'm a Child of God let us consider one another it's what I'm doing good for the body let's consider one another take careful note of each other's spiritual welfare that's not just the pastor that's all of us can't tell you whether Harvey's gone tonight so I'll brag on him he don't have internet so I know they're not watching brother Harvey is uh if God can't count how many times that some of you all have walked in and brother Harvey will come tell me but the so-and-so was just a little bit a little bit down today you may want to check on him but so-and-so look they're going through something I talk to them they're going through something that's considering one another now that's his job as a deacon one of one of his many jobs as a deacon that's all of our jobs not just the deacons consider one another and you kind of you have to think about people what would I be in I was trying today I sometimes we can't see from the other person's viewpoint and we're on this mountain and we're looking over at the other mountains saying why are they acting like they're acting we can't see if we could ever go out into the other mountain and we'd look back at us and say well that's why right we can't see and so things look different from somebody else's perspective you may not always understand what the pastor is doing because he many times the pastor stands on his own Mountain you can't he's in an office that you don't have a deacon the same way a trustee the same way you don't always understand what people are doing but it's because you don't have that office you don't see what they see right and many times that's what happens to us as Christians just we look at other churches why do they do things the way they do well maybe it's not right but maybe they we don't see what they see but let us consider one another is that okay let's consider one another let's like take careful note of the spiritual welfare of the people in the body especially in our own church but as other churches as well even even so let's consider one another let us provoke some of you said amen praise the Lord all right oh but it don't stop there let us provoke now that we're provoking the in the in the original is is what it sounds like it's a view to incitement it's to stimulate it's provocation irritation contention right and I can't help but think of of someone who's ever met a person who's real peppy in the mornings and they just they get up and it's just everything's good it had flowers and Daisy whoa it's so wonderful you know and you ever met you ever worked for somebody like that my goodness I'm a morning person but not like that it'll just drive you crazy it's irritant but they're always talking to you but you know what if you watch it after a while you get in a better mood yourself because that person's in a good mood they let everybody know it they're they're irritating something but not to in a bad way the Hebrew derivation of this word is a splinter let us be a splinter hahaha and this is an encouraging splinter yes you get a splinter under your fingernail by The Herald or something you just just always staring you try to get rid of it but this is what he's saying when he says exhort one another to attend church be a splinter under each other's nail if you have to just make sure you're okay all right let us provoke that's like a like a friend who reminds you you're on a diet huh like somebody will remind you you're going to the gym are you with me now let's stir up good works and love so brother random takes it this way he said provoke their means to encourage so it's that constant encouragement let's see it's not in a bad way at all it's that constant encouragement encourage one another into love into good works now watch it's got to be you first have to encourage them to love and then to good works because without love you can't do the good works that that a Christian would do because the good works that a Christian does are not forced on the Christian they're not they're not something a Christian does just because well I should do that that's not what it is at all but it's the fruit of a Christian Life good works to a Christian is just what a Christian is and so it's the night it's a it's the gifts or the fruits of the spirit rather that are operating in the life of the Christian and so he said if you see a brother in the church that's got something against the other brother don't say something to stir that thing up don't say something to stir that thing up but say something that'll bring them together that's a real world application isn't it that was your quote brother Joel I'd say like brother Wendell say that's your opportunity to shout don't say something to stirred up say something that'll bring them together provoke one another into good works and to love is what we must do it's what we must do you say well I I must wear long hair if I'm a woman I must have a dress that covers me I must if I'm a man not cussed and not drinking I smoke but a prophet of God said we must encourage one another we must provoke one another to Good Works into love we it's what we must do it wasn't just written to be nice Paul's not just giving us filler he's not just saying it because it's something to say it means every bit as much as every other part of the Bible provoke one another unto love and good works by your example I believe you did that this weekend you were encouraging other people to work harder encouraging others to do better encourage how are you doing it by doing it yourself oh my I love that I love to see that what is that brother said that's a man that's born again he constantly reminded you can speak in tongues and not have it you you could run the aisles and not have you could shout and not have it but if you ever get to a place where you where the good works of Christ comes out of you out of From the Inside Man not from the outside that's a man that's born again one who provokes to good to love and to Good Works he said if you my my brother tonight don't feel that way when you see your brothers falling out and sharp words between one another if you don't feel like bringing them together let me make it as plain as I can Church he said it's your time to go to the altar if you like the fact that people are at Arts if you if you enjoy people making fun of one another and and laughing at one another and attacking one another now it's your time to go to the altar all right God help us tonight it's easy to do isn't it because people do stupid stuff and it's easy to just pick at them but what we should be doing is trying to bring them together he said that's right there is something happen in your life there is something Oh my he said if you don't feel that way there's something you've been deceived in you haven't the experience that God wants you to have I know that's hard church but it's what a prophet said he said for Jesus when he was reviled he reviled not again and when he was spoken evil of he spoke not back again and when they've done evil to him he turned and did good to them when they persecuted him and nailed him to the Cross we heard about that Saturday morning didn't we he looked down and said father forgive them for they don't know what they're doing he said if that kind of spirit is not in you the Holy Ghost has never entered you yet for that was the Same Spirit was on Christ Jesus the Bible said let it be in you Christ is in his church he said now Brandon Tabernacle you bunch here we don't have any organization don't have any sign cards and so forth the only thing we have here is fellowship he say to you who are fellowshipping in Jesus Christ with us tonight and fellowshipping every night and every time we're always happy to have you here we want you to be here he said you don't have to join us the only thing you have to do is come worship with us amen and we expect every one of you to hold the true mystery of God in your heart without wavering come to the worship and come to the altar he said brother Ben you know I'd be I'd be more comfortable with fewer people but the prophet of God said if you want to fellowship with us come to the worship come to the Altar and so forth and Love One Another Empty pews never inspired me to preach it's true but but I'm fine with it if that's what God wants me to preach to I'll preach to the ceiling if God wants to be preaching silly but I believe it'll do a whole lot more good if there were people here to hear us so he said if you come to the worship come to the Altar and somewhere love one another be in harmony with one another and if you see a brother getting out of the way go to him be reconciled with him if you can that's right he said that's what we got to do and friends if you ever what are you doing if you don't do that you're only making yourself a miserable creature not a Christian well that's hard that's what a prophet said that's right all that you're doing is in vain let us see how serious it is let us consider one another not a suggestion it's what God expects out of us let us consider one another let us provoke one another to love and good works there's got to come a point in time at which we actually become what we say and we actually begin to do what we say and say God help me tonight there's a certain amount of hypocrite in every person you know you're a three-part being there's a certain amount of you that's an unbeliever certain amount of you that's a make-believer but down on the inside there's a real seed of God I believe there is in every one of you tonight a real seed of God you're here on a Wednesday night somewhere there's a seed of God on the inside that begins as it grows whether it says it's like a button a little button of light but adjacent as you as you receive the Holy Spirit that's just a little glow he said of light when you're born again he said as you grow it just gets bigger and it gets bigger and bigger and finally it fills your whole body it's about time that it filled our whole body it's about time it filled our hands to do the work of God it's about time I filled our feet to go where God wants us to go it's about time they filled our tongues and caused us to Bridle our tongue it's about time the message become real instead of just being something we talk about it's something we debate about and something we argue about it's about time it become a reality and it affected us in our jobs it affected us at home it affected us on the street affected the way we think about people right and we know we are not saved by good works and we know that tonight there's a fruit of the tree they're the fruit the show what Vine it is the vine doesn't bear fruit the branches do and the branch shows what the life is in the Vine good works glorify the father Matthew 5 and 16 let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven I'm going to get real basic here for a moment because we live you know we don't live up here we live down here we live with our feet firmly planted on the earth if any of you don't let me know how you do that most of us we live down here and so I found that when it comes to good works for the body many times women are better at that than men it's just the truth and I want to honor you sisters in that and and we're going to go and show how women can be greatly honored in the scripture by doing good works for the body right for the people of God and I know maybe that's a little bit strange but I just it's more noticeable it's some it seems like because women are many times more given to hospitality and and to act do the actual work and I know some of you some of y'all worked really hard this weekend and we want to do everything we can to make it easier for you in the coming years if we do this again when we do it again we want to we want to make it easier on you it's easy as we can but the fact that you worked hard there's a blessing in that because it's it's not because somebody told you to do it it's not because you had to drag yourself to do it it's because you wanted to it was a desire to do it and there was a woman that we don't even know her husband's name and we he was there but we don't even know much about him but she was the shunamite woman you remember the story the Bible says in Second Kings 4 8 that it fell on a day that Elisha passed to shoot him where was a great woman and what that means is she was a rich woman or a woman of substance and she constrained him to eat bread so she invited him to dinner she sees God's Prophet walking along the road and the Bible said she constrained him said you need something to eat like your mama does when you go back home you know how it is you go back home and mama's always got something on the stove at least my mama does that's how I got part of why I got to this size mama's always got some pie mama's always got some cake mama's always got something to eat right you know especially always got something for Joel to eat and so every time he passed by she constrained him come in and eat with us no I'm not going to take no for an answer we're going to fix you a meal see you don't realize it wasn't just the church that we had that was important but actually the meals that we have together is a very biblical thing to do in fact it's the way the early church operated it's a very biblical thing to do and I don't have time tonight to go through it all but I can show you where it was called their love feasts they always ate together when they had church now we can't do it every time we have church but we do when we can because there's something about that you're you're providing a service to the people of God and so it was as often as he passed by he turned him thither to eat bread and she said it to her husband behold now I perceive that this is a holy man of God which passeth by us continually let us make a little chamber I pray thee on the wall let us set for him there a bed now watch how detailed that she is in setting up a man would never think of all of these things woman she thinks of everything she said let's make him a bed at a table and a stool and a Candlestick so she said a political place with a desk in it so he can do his work and it's where he can study and it shall be when he cometh to us that he shall turn in thither and so you all know the story because of this association with a prophet that they actually received a child and then the child died and here's here you say why would God do that but God wasn't done with her yet because she was friends with the prophet and she provided him a place to stay because she asked him to eat with her when the time comes she needed a resurrection the little things don't matter they do matter because she put her shoulder to the wheel and helped the prophet of God all of a sudden oh I can think of something tonight I won't call any names but over my life I can think of many women that have helped me in my Ministry many many and women that have taken an interest and provided a place for us to stay and provided money for us when we didn't have anything people that took an interest men and women both that took an interest in our lives and there will be a blessing in that not just us but every one of you can think of those things amen and so it's she they received a child and the resurrection of that child because she provided a place for a prophet to stay something for him to eat she asked him over to dinner I'm not trying to get asked over for dinner now if you want to do that it's up to you that's not the point of the message you did that this weekend huh see the Bible says some hundreds of years later Jesus said this he that receiveth the prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward he that receiveth the righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward it questions and answers to ask brother random what is a prophet's reward and he said Jesus said whosoever receiveth the prophet yeah he said he receives the prophet's reward our prophet's reward is to be a friend with the prophet I love how simple a prophet was he said whosoever receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man receives a righteous man's reward so it's not just limited to prophets he said if they want to know what a prophet's reward is is to be a friend to the prophet see that's a reward he's your friend you don't know when you might need the body of Christ you don't know when you might need their prayers you don't know when you might need to hear a good message you don't know when you might need somebody to step in and be there for you and so you become friendly with one another because you might need them sometimes might come in handy sometimes he said like the shunamak woman it might come in handy sometimes see it did with her he said Watch God's servants now in the New Testament he said well that's the Old Testament those were prophets look at the New Testament Acts chapter 9 verse 36 is this okay tonight it's for women who made a difference not by stepping out of their role and stepping out into a role of trying to lead the church but by fulfilling what God called them to do and so they become friends to prophets or friends to people in the church in Acts 9 36 there was that Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha which by interpretation is called Dorcas this woman was full of good works and alms Deeds which she did I love the way it puts it she was full of good works she was full of good works and alms Deeds which she did so things were acts of charity verse 37 it came to pass in those days that she was sick and died and when they had washed they later in an upper chamber now when they later in it up her chamber I want you to notice how different her funeral was from someone who's always fought someone who's always fussed someone who's always been cantankerous because many times they have a big funeral but people show up to make sure they're dead hahaha I mean there's some people like that it's just like you know what I'll be honest with you I don't want to standing by my grave brother Joe talking about well he did me wrong here and he did me wrong here and treated me badly here God help me especially if it's true you know if they want to make stuff up that's fine but if it was true and but notice how different this funeral was they later in an upper chamber and immediately they go looking for somebody to pray for she's already dead brother Danny but she was such an important part of the church that they said we don't want to make it without sister Tabitha isn't that the way you want to go we don't want to make it without sister Tabitha she here she's got sick and she's died and it wasn't her time and maybe she died at a younger age we don't want to make it without Tabitha and so what they did it says for as much as lit it was neither Joplin it was uh the one that gotten saved under Paul's Ministry uh seller of purple I believe and the disciples had heard that Peter was there they sent unto him two men Desiring him that he would not delay to come to them and then Peter arose and went with them so they've they've laid her up this whole time to let the man of God have an opportunity to come by and pay his respects or pray for her whatever it is maybe they didn't even didn't even hope to believe that she could be raised from the dead but they just didn't want to see sister Tabitha go that way they just didn't want to see her in to be like that oh that I could be such a child of God that people didn't want to see me go Paul could have such confidence in his own life and Ministry that he said for me to to die is gain and to live is Christ he said now to live is better for you think about that for a moment we want to be the kind of Christian that it's not like well we just got in on the skin of our teeth but for me to live in this world it's better for you well it makes you think don't it sometimes I think I'm worth more dead than alive I know I am financially because of Life Insurance but really it would us continue continuing with the church would it be better for the church I believe every one of you is better that you're alive right it's better that you're alive because you make the church better you showed that this weekend now watch for as much as litter was not a jopping they sent two men Peter Rose went with him when he was come they brought him to the upper chamber all the widows stood by him weeping and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas made when she was with them showing the things that she had given them thought of something but Joe remind me to tell you something later 40 but Peter put them all forth and kneeled down and prayed and turning him to the body said Tabitha arrives I love this they were in no condition to believe but they knew they wanted sister Tabitha to live and so he puts them all out and when he did he said Tabitha arise and she opened her eyes and when she saw Peter she set up I love it and he gave her his hand and lifted her up and when he called the Saints and widows presented her alive and it was thrown throughout all Joppa and many believed in the Lord why was she in that position her friends didn't want to let her just go that's why the man who got healed that was let down through the roof you remember he had four friends that thought so much of him that they said we're not going to let our friend lay here and not be healed because he can't get through the crowd we're going to let him we'll break the roof open and let him down oh that's the way we ought to be if I have a brother or a sister that's hurting let me make a hole in the roof if I have to and let him down so they get to Jesus Marion are you still with me tonight I'm not going as fast as I thought I would but it'll be just a minute longer I thought I'd be done in 30 minutes Mary and Lazarus and Martha were friends of Jesus the Bible says Jesus loved Martha and her sister in Lazarus he loved them now they met because they invited Jesus to dinner in fact Martha did you see the way this is going there's something about inviting Jesus to dinner that results in Resurrection of the Dead you say well I can't do that today you remember the old story The Man Who invited Jesus and he didn't show up and he didn't show up and he said Lord you said you would come but in the meantime there was a beggar and there was a little girl and there was another there was another man come by he fed all of them and he said I was the beggar I was the little girl brother Brandon tells that story why because it's in as much as you've done to the least of these my little ones you've done it unto me he said so here now Martha and met Jesus because our Mary met Jesus Lazarus met Jesus because Martha invited him to dinner came to pass they went he entered in a certain Village and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house she had her sister called Mary which also said that Jesus feet and heard the word but Martha was covered about much serving now you don't know the story she's busy washing pots and pans now we know that there's there's a time for both things right there's a time to hear the word and there's a time to be washing the pots and pans right and we have to be careful that's why we we're trying to do our best to think of ways to lessen the load on individuals because we don't want you to miss the spiritual aspect of the meeting we don't want you to miss the we don't want to get so busy in church that we forget that there's something going on Jesus is speaking but Martha was comfortable with my serving and came to him and said Lord that's not care that my sister has left me to serve alone bitter therefore that she helped me and Jesus answered and said to her Martha Martha Thou Art careful and troubled about many things but one thing is needful in other words he said if all this if we didn't get fed but we heard from Jesus that would be enough that's the one thing that we need but yet the good work of feeding Jesus didn't go unnoticed he said Mary had chosen the good part which shall not be taken away from her but Martha had her reward you remember it was Martha that when Jesus was coming when she heard him coming in John 11 20 she went and met him but Mary said still in the house and then sent Martha unto Jesus Lord if thou has been here my brother had not died but I know that even now whatsoever thou would ask of God God will give it to thee like had he writes she said the right thing why she was she was willing to give she was willing to invite Jesus in and all of this happened because she constrained Jesus to come eat dinner Matthew 10 42 he said whosoever shall give one to drink give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple that's what I am today that's what you are apparently I say unto you he shall in no wise lose his reward that woman said I the woman that seen God in Elijah the shoot of my woman she said I think it's nice enough we do something for the servant of God God will respect it while she was just a few hundred years ahead of time Jesus said if you give one of my disciples a cup of cold water it's a judgment it won't be forgotten he said we failed to see the power that God has placed in his people God has been his people how many believe that today he said you believe that God was with his people one time when he walked on the Earth but now God is in his people a little while in the world sees me no more you'll see me for I will be with you and in you to the end of the world he said God dwells moves Works in mankind God don't work through orders he doesn't work through organizations he works through individuals God works in man God doesn't do the work today everybody's sitting around waiting for God to move and in the same quote I didn't bring it but brother Branham said that he said David duplessis said he said that there's this he said these Pentecostals are lazy he said they're sitting around waiting on God to do something he said and brother Brandon Falls set up he said God doesn't do the work today he energizes a projection Spirit into men to do so he said I am the vine the vine don't bear fruit you are the branches Look what Jesus says in Revelation 2 when he begins to talk speak to the churches the church ages verse two he said I know that works the labor and thy patience he said the works don't matter but he said they did how thou can it's not bear them with your evil and now it's tried them would say they are Apostles and are not has found them Liars it's born as patients from a namesake that's labored and that's not fainted I was worried about that this weekend I'll be honest with you I got to a point Sunday afternoon I was I was done and I still had a couple of dinners I knew and some hosting to do and so I I've never done this before I went home and somehow everything survived without me about three o'clock Sunday afternoon I went home I drove off the side of the road going home I'm about wrecked my truck but it's just you know but it's worth it it's worth it all of you I know how tired you were for my name's sake you said you labored and he said I know I see it but you've not fainted brother Branham says this he said how beautifully the Savior praises and commends his children he takes full account of their fine spiritual attitude and behavior he knows that there is weakness among them but as yet he does not crowd against it isn't that just like the Lord he knows how to encourage Us in the right matters discourage Us in the wrong matters he said we could all learn a good lesson right here in running the church and our families let her steal we could all learn a good lesson in that God deals with each one of us in exactly this way he doesn't just come and beat you over the head with what you did wrong he says I see your Works your Works won't save you but I see your works are you with me now we could all learn a good lesson here he said don't ever be discouraged saying of God for God is not ungracious I'm closing if the musicians want to come he said God is not ungracious to forget your labor of love whatever we do even giving a cup of cold water to someone has a reward and a blessing from the Lord I think of a little story brother Branham told about the little girl and the King I've told it here recently the little girl wants to go out and honor the king a little school girl she's standing by the side of the parade route she got a little flag in her hand and the king is coming through there in Canada where they would the English king the British king would not come very often but under that constitutional monarchy they still honored the king and here he come and he was he was driving by him and she weighed but she was little she was lost in the crowd and she was crying afterwards and the and the people said her teacher said why why are you crying didn't she wave your flag said yes didn't you clap for the king yes but he didn't see me I said didn't you see him yes but he didn't see me but brother Branham tells us he always tells that story and he follows it up and he says but he said Christ sees every Sparrow do we really believe that today he said he sees every sparrow that falls to the ground he said he sees your good works he knows what you're going through he knows how it hurts he knows how tired you are but he sees what you do he sees that you do it anyway and he's going to reward you for every single one of them you know how much God appreciates you doing good things for his children he's going to give people eternal life because they stopped on the side of the road and changed the tire there's going to be people in heaven because they bought your dinner and they didn't even know you that's how much you cares about his children how much more brother Joe would he do to a child of God who did something for another child of God a Tabitha who made clothes for the people of God I assume to my woman who made a little room for the man of God people who work for the children of the people of God people who do things and and if I start calling names I'll be in trouble but Logan and his dad stood out there for hours out in the out in the sun cooking hamburgers the other day God sees that he sees that he sees the cleaning and he sees the he sees the people that were there he sees what you did I'm not trying to just make you feel good tonight but I want you to know you might be tired but God sees it let us continue let us provoke to love and good works let us continue to do what we're doing keep keep moving on because there's coming a day you'll be rewarded for what you did a day's coming I'm so glad for that I said but brother Ben I've made mistakes let us come boldly to the throne of grace not confessing our mistakes those are already confessed I trust they are tonight but confessing our confessing Our God confessing the blood confessing his cover of every sin and once we come that way let us provoke into love and good works let us consider one another I believe Paul's words are good don't you I believe they matter power hits together every one of you took time out of your day or your week [Music] time to come to the house of God you did that tonight so I didn't get nothing out of it but you encouraged as a preacher we underestimate the power of a cup of cold water in a desert a place like Israel a cup of cold water is a big deal [Music] a place like laodicea and encouraging words a big deal sweeping the floor is a big deal telling somebody you love them is a big deal [Music] in a desert where people have lost their ability to love and care for one another when people have lost their ability to to reach out let's be different let us consider one another let us provoke to love and good works let us do better I know it's hard sometimes some of you guys work when you when you can't you give when you can't God sees that he knows that Jesus looked at the little widow woman and put her two mites in and he said he said he wouldn't stop her brother Brandon with how do you write when Hattie Wright came and he had twenty dollars in his pocket because he knew he said to take her all year to earn that did you hear that twenty dollars in his pocket to give back to her but the Lord said no don't do it what was he doing but while he was there because she was friendly and she she did something for the prophet of God for the church put it in the building fine while he was there God did something Supernatural and she become like a preview of The Rapture when she spoke the word and and her sons come back one day the bride will speak the word and we'll see our loved ones again [Music] don't underestimate the power I'm doing something for the people of God means something church I want to thank you for that Heavenly Father oh we love you tonight Lord how could we not love your people after after seeing the things that we saw this weekend the younger ones the older ones Lord everybody pitching in
