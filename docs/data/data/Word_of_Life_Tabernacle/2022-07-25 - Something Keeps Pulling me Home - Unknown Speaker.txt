========================================

[Music] so many are taking vacations looking for a new place to go [Music] the stress and the strength has proven insane at the end of the day they've been lost they've said to themselves if i can just get away to a quiet place all alone and while they're looking for a way to get out of town something keeps pulling me home when push comes to shove and hate conquers love that a man and the crowd stands alone while they're barely getting by on a natural high keeps pulling me home some live their lives in the fast lane others make life such a drag [Music] some say it's a game where they lose everything some's got it all in the back but i've heard when you're born you start dying that day and they fear that the next graves they're on i can't worry about pushing up daisies that way something keeps pulling me home when push comes to shove and hate conquers love that a man in a crowd stands alone while they're barely getting by on a natural high something keeps pulling me home when push comes to shock and hate conquers love that a man something keeps pulling me on hallelujah
