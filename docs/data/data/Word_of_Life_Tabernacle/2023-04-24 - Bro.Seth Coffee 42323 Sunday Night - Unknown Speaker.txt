take too much time the brother Seth will still be preaching afterwards but I'd like you to welcome brother Solomon Huffman with us this evening as he comes and greets the people if you're happy to have him here and they just take your time buddy you need you need one hahaha amen you love the Lord tonight amen can you agree with that song and say truly all the time God's been faithful amen we're sure happy to be here and I thoroughly enjoyed the word this morning and uh just have such a welcoming Spirit here and just feel right at home and feel like the family and so I tell you you learn to really appreciate that there's some places you go you don't feel that welcome but uh just our whole trip here we've definitely felt very welcome and we appreciate that and you know I believe that that's the spirit of this message I believe it causes a unity and the bride and it just causes us all to feel like family and so we just greet you tonight in the name of the Lord and some of you that do know me and brother Solomon Huffman and fellowship over by the Josh Bennett's assembly in North Carolina and he would sure want to send his greetings to the church here and I guess in Ministry you know a word gets out quite a good bit of different churches and works to get started and we've always heard such a positive report of other men and we certainly appreciate that and I appreciate his stand on the word of God and I was just thinking you know if there was anything that I could admonish a church would be to stay with the word amen stay with the message of the hour I I believe it's God God's ordained Ark to bring us to the Rapture and tell you if you ever get a true revelation of what this message is is Jesus Christ all the way through and we thank the Lord that we have the revelation of this message and so we certainly appreciate the Believers here and we just certainly enjoyed being here with you and I just wanted to share something small before but the Seth came out and I I don't plan to be one of those brothers that would take an hour or two to do that but I did I did just want to speak something small to you in Hebrews the second chapter there's a verse of scripture here and uh just some things that I've been studying on for quite some time and preaching around and I think this scripture is a beautiful scripture in Hebrews the second chapter in the first verse the Bible tells us here therefore we ought to give the more Earnest heed to the things which we have heard now we can all agree we've heard a lot of sermons and a lot of preaching but the Bible says to give an Earnest heed so so put in action the things that we've heard amen give them more Ernest heed and I I think that scripture is telling us we ought to take this word serious amen we should take our opportunity that God gives us as a serious opportunity lest at any time we should let them slip and uh just on on that little scripture there there's a story that brother Wayne tells him the message and I'm sure many of you familiar with it but he talks about this man that had a death sentence and this man went to to appeal his trial that was going to take place and the brother Wayne mentions in several places but God projected in his love he talks about this man that receives a part and I think it's such a a beautiful story brother when him tells us and this man was here with a death sentence and all of us was born with that same sentence of death is that right and uh they came to the president brother William says here was Abraham Lincoln and tell him the story and he said and the president being in a hurry picked up a small piece of paper and wrote on it I pardoned this man and then signed his name Abraham Lincoln and the carrier brought the piece of paper to the sale and said to the man you are free I want you to notice this and as the man looked at it he said well it doesn't seem official to me in other words he couldn't believe that something so simple would be his opportunity for freedom and it would be his opportunity to to not have a death sentence on him he said it doesn't seem official to me I just don't believe it and I'll not leave here and he rejected it because it was on a small piece of paper and not a great later not a great letterhead and that man later on would actually be killed with his death sentence and you know I thought that was such a powerful story because this man had a free pardon from the president and signed it himself and it was an opportunity to go completely free and to have a complete freedom and I thought you know that just ties to that scripture he didn't give a heed to his opportunity amen God gave that man a day of Grace and he rejected it that day of Grace and turn down his freedom and you know I believe as man that God has allowed us to have a time allotted on Earth and God has all given us an opportunity is that right we all have an opportunity that God has given us and that man refused the opportunity that he had and you know just thinking on that you think of every Church age and every dispensation of Praise all all the there's been many message believeth for you and I and they all have their opportunity with the word they all had their opportunity on what they're going to do with the word and you know we can look back at ones that have failed and that have went away from the word but I believe we've got to keep our eyes on the word and we got to take our opportunity you know we can't help what people before us have done and as young people here you can't help what other young people do we can all help what we do with our opportunity I don't know about you as for me I want to take my opportunity amen the Bible tells us in the Book of James life is just but a vapor and this small period of time we have to live on the face of the earth I want to take advantage of every opportunity every time I can receive something from God I want to seize that opportunity and seize that moment and take advantage of it and you know Luther of course they had their opportunity with the word and Wesley and Pentecost at Azusa Street all of them had their opportunity but they're not here no more amen this is our opportunity this is our time you can't look on on the day gone by this is our hour this is our season of opportunity and I believe that there's been a pardon I'll be I believe there's been a Grace to spend allotted to this generation I I believe that a prophet preached to us that this is the time of Jubilee this is the opportunity of Jubilee this is the opportunity we don't have to be a slave to sin I think there's such a powerful quote whether I'm said to to you that's on tape until it is and to the visible audience he said that the day of sin is over we don't have to be a slave to any spirit we don't have to be a slave to the devil and I just want to admonish you in this this is the opportunity to get anything you need from God and I just pray that that God will always help us to to seize our opportunity and don't don't Harden your hearts but don't refuse him that speaketh but but take every opportunity and I I tell you I think it's such a shame that man that brother Branham tells he he was so close to his freedom but yet amen he denied it he was so close to to not have the death sentence but he denied his opportunity I say God help us help us to take the opportunity and to realize this moment in time amen that we're not promised tomorrow we're not promised another week but I think tonight God has given us an opportunity in this service and his brother Seth will get ready to come I I believe that God has laid something on his heart for us and I believe that if you'll pull that God can minister to every need and I tell you we should cherish every opportunity God gives us and we just say God bless you and I I just hope that that would maybe maybe break somebody's heart that the day of sin is over and this is your opportunity to live a free life and I just say God bless you and we sure appreciate you here and that'll be all I've got to say [Applause] thank you [Music] as brother Seth comes you ready for the word of the Lord tonight I appreciate that brother Solomon amen just want to dig into the word of the Lord and take full advantage of every opportunity we have here tonight so his brother Seth comes oh I worship you God [Music] that is [Music] foreign [Music] or there is none like you almighty God it's not like you father that Lord I know many of our testimonies father Lord we we looked out at the world father we tried to find peace in the world and we couldn't find it Lord we tried to find joy out there God lord even within our own families Lord we tried to find stuff Lord that that would fill us Lord God but when we got the end of the road Lord we found one almighty God and Lord that met each and every one of our hearts desires Lord father how we're here to thank you tonight father Lord because there is none like you Lord where else would we turn to tonight father but we know tonight almighty God lord as I think of that scripture Lord no matter what we're going through Lord feeling this evening when we have a high priest or that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities almighty God lord lord your Prophet would say would always amaze me about God was how this God that created all the heavens and the Earth could become so simple Lord that you would come Lord and be born father in a Manger Lord God just to understand how we feel and what we're going through Lord Lord we can look at our neighbor father and they might not know what we're going through but Lord You're the high priest that can be touched tonight father Lord because you know what it's like to be a man father you know what it's like to be a human being Lord and Lord you know everything about us Lord and I could even say this you know the things about us that we don't even know almighty god father you know us inside and out father and Lord tonight father we're just pray and Lord God over this service Lord because father I don't know what this church needs but father you know what it needs Lord you know what each and every heart needs tonight father Lord you knew before the foundation of the world Lord the things that would be said in sermon more that I don't even know that's coming almighty god father you know us inside and our father and you know what we have need of tonight Lord in the Cry of each and every heart Lord is just come by our way almighty god father tonight we're just saying our hearts are open before you Lord God whatever you want to say whatever you want to do whatever you want to accomplish Lord will be like Mary tonight Lord will say it be it unto me according to Thy word oh God whatever you want to do tonight father move with Liberty almighty God moving your spirit father moving truth tonight father as we accept you tonight whatever you want to say whatever you want to do Lord whatever you want to accomplish Lord be it unto me Father be it unto me Father whatever that you would have that you would want to say tonight father Lord I pray that you would bless this little congregation father forgive us of every shortcoming ever sin and every iniquity Lord father bless your children tonight we love you we praise you in Jesus name amen amen that'll be all for the music it's so good to see you again it's been a few months since we've been here we always appreciate the opportunity to come and speak to you I love to speak to the people that love the Lord Jesus Christ you know it's a it's a humbling experience to be here because you know you realize we can look at Jesus sometimes we look at ourselves and we don't value ourselves that much you know we see all our mistakes we see all our shortcomings we see all our failures but do you realize within yourself and who you are you are the purchase of the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ so when Jesus would take an evaluation on his life and his own blood he said that we were worth it so how how humble it makes me to stand before the purchase of the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ that's how much he thinks about you you know what makes me want to be more sincere and and you know I was just driving down the road and then and I was uh I had I thought I knew what I was going to preach and when me and brother Solomon were pulling in the Lord just kind of changed directions on me so uh yeah I kind of feel like you you probably know as much as I know what's going to get preached tonight but but we're just going to trust in the Lord you know I've learned one thing if you can just get out of the way and let the Lord speak there's something for the people to hear is that right if you have your Bibles tonight uh we're gonna if you can turn to Romans 8 28 a very uh familiar scripture and and um I think I want to uh title this unseparable love and we'll read that as well but and I have another title for it too is God will get to you and uh but let's uh let's look at this here in Romans 8 28 and we're just trusting the Lord you know me and brother Solomon we're uh we're real good buddies we're always picking on each other going back and forth and and everything and you know we we talk about you know the the it's great when you find the Lord Brother Ben but when you miss the Lord it really hurts I'm sure over yeah I think he's been preaching since he was 12 years old so he knows what I'm talking about when you when you think you just want to preach what you want to preach and and what you think would go well but the Lord ain't in it you want to find the biggest rock that you can crawl up under and and never come back out of and you know but but we know if we trust the Lord then he can speak to our hearts and and that's what we want because you didn't you didn't want Seth coffee to come speak to you tonight and I didn't either but we want the Lord Jesus to speak tonight so Romans 8 28 and it says we know that all things somebody say all things work together for good to them that love God do you love God tonight I believe you do because you're here to them who are called according to his purpose amen so let's drop down to 35 there and it said who shall separate us from the love of God shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or Peril or sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter nay and all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us okay so it's about his love towards us tonight it says Ryan persuade that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able doesn't say that it won't try church but it says it's other creatures shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord and then you know this you don't have to turn here but in John 6 it says all that the father hath given me shall come to me see church this ain't a maybe this ain't it might be but he says all that the father giveth me shall come to me and him that cometh me I will in otherwise cast out how many is thankful to know tonight there's a lot of people that you might turn to and they might not want you but Jesus said I'm not going to cast you out I'm not going to turn you down but he said before I came from Heaven not to do my own will but to do the will of him that sent me and this is my father's will when just sent me that all which he has given me I should lose nothing he won't lose a one it's an unseparable love he he can't do without you yeah glory amen amen but should raise it up again in the last days amen you may be seated if we could pray one more time Heavenly Father Lord we just want to say thank you Lord for this word Lord that we've read Lord surely Lord we could close just now Lord saying father knowing that the love of God and how it's unseparable Lord and how you care for us Lord God and no matter what we're going through Lord distress Peril whatever it might be Lord there's nothing in life there's nothing in death that could separate us from your love Lord and we thank you for that father we just pray that you would bless the service Lord get each and every one out of the way now father in Jesus name amen well I just want to say thank you uh uh to brother Alan and brother Stewart for uh taking me uh taking me and brother Solomon out hunting and you know we there was just something special about being out there in in the woods I tell you you when you get up there in the woods and you get away from the world I believe you get closer to God I believe that's why the the prophet always took time to go out there and do those things but you know one thing that just struck my heart there was a couple little things that happen out there that that really meant a lot to me and you know God cares about the little things God cares about the things that we're going through and and you know we we went out here and and I felt a pull in my heart to come out this way and anytime I feel a pull in my heart to come out this way I try to spend some time with family while I'm out here and we went out there and went uh went a turkey hunting and and you know there was just something that struck my heart when we were we woke up the second morning to to go out and hunt and I was sitting there thinking you know Lord just pressed on my heart and before we ever left the camp he said why don't you pray why don't you talk to me before before y'all ever just start your day out why don't you just pray a little bit and you know I said Brothers do you mind if we pray and you know absolutely so we get together and we begin to pray and you know as I'm praying you know the Lord presses something on my heart he said well why don't you just ask me for what you want ask me for what you and I said well Lord we would you know we would love to get a couple turkeys and then you know from what I understand getting a a public land anything is a very very challenging task because anybody can go do it you don't have your own private land or anything like that so anybody can come and do it and I said Lord would you just bless us Lord let us be successful in our hunt this morning Lord and give us some turkeys and you know we woke up that morning and Alan and and Solomon go walk in one way and me and Stuart go walking another way and and and we're we're all uh he's going to make fun of me because he's going to say he did the walk and me and Stuart just drove somewhere but but we me and Stuart we went and we drove to a place and got out and started to walk and Solomon and Alan walked six miles down into a hill somewhere I don't know where they end up going but you know we said that prayer before we departed and and you know I'm sitting there me and Stuart walking through the woods and I hear this turkey gobble off way off in the distance and then I hear this turkey gobble right in front of me I'm going oh my you know this is getting excited and we go out there and we're sitting there and and and you know as I'm sitting there I'm thinking man one of us might actually get a turkey today that's awesome and I'm sitting there and this turkey's coming in and and uh he's coming in to us and you know he gets on some other side of logs and he stands 25 yards from us on the other side of some logs and I can't see him for nothing and I'm sitting here going man I'd really like to get this turkey and about that time I hear a fake gunshot shot off in the distance and and I'm sitting there going man I wonder if that's Allen in them I you know just you just don't expect it because you're on public land and we end up shooting that bird and I'm sitting there and I'm giving thanks to God going God you didn't have to do that you you really answered our prayer there just by even giving us game out here you didn't have to do that and then as I'm as I say I say Lord you know bless Alan and Solomon let them get a bird too then I get a text on my phone and within 20 minutes within 30 min probably 35 minutes of that prayer maybe 45 minutes of that prayer of us walking out of there we both had her two turkeys on the ground and I was sitting there thinking God you're so mindful of our needs and just you know I think so many times God is just saying just ask me whatever you have need of just to ask me and I'm there for you know another thing that happened was I was going to study for this out there and and I was these guys went off to just go doing a little bit more walking and and uh and I stayed back at camp and I was going to study a little bit while I was there and and something said go pray up on that hill and I was like well all right you know and as I'm beginning you know I'm just feeling so pressed to go and begin to pray over a need and I don't even know what the need is and I began to walk towards that mountain and a brother that I don't know how he got my phone number I I I've never had him in my phone he calls me and he says Hey I just want you to know go pray for so and so and I'm sitting there thinking how marvelous is God that that you know it's the things that God is always in control that that here's a man in the middle of Arkansas in the middle of a national forest from what I understand as a hundred thousand acres and the God says go pray on that hill and I'm sitting there going I don't know what I'm going to pray about but I'll pray so God gives a prayer request he's working on one end to another and God sends a prayer request for a brother that's going on a hill to pray and I think it's a marvelous how mindful that God is and I've thoroughly enjoyed myself but you know when I when I begin to think of that unseparable love of God and and I was telling brother Solomon as we climbed up on the top of this mountain and and you know we were up there on the the first day and and we were we climb up on this mountain I believe it's the the big big river of Buffalo or whatever it is and it was going through there and I'm sitting there going Ma this is one of the most beautiful views that I've ever seen and I began to sit there and I'm looking at a cross and I go God I don't know how this could get any more beautiful and I'm sitting there thinking how marvelous her God is and how wonderful he is and then and then as I'm looking at I'm going God how can this get any more beautiful about that time an eagle begins to fly up the creek all coming up to me and I'm sitting there going I said to Alan y'all got Eagles out here y'all have Eagles out here he said yeah we got Eagles wow sick as I'm looking right at one man we don't have those back home like y'all got them here and and it's flying up to me and I'm sitting there thinking like I'm just I got there at this point at this time and God's just wanting to say I love your son and I see that eagle come up in perch right there and these guys don't understand it but I've been you know talking to God communion back and forth I told him I said I'm about to cry right here boys and they said I mean you probably look at me a big or whatever but but I began to think of that and begin to look at at all that God had created you know I was looking at all that and we were having fun hunting but when I got away to myself and and I began to look around at everything and I begin to think oh God how how marvelous you are and how wonderful you are and how great you are God that you created all this but then something spoke to my heart he said but I didn't want it without you you realize God could have it all but he didn't want to have it unless he had us with it I'm beginning to think glory to God how how can I look at this wonderful mountain and I can look at this this beautiful view in this eagle flying but we look at that and we begin to think how wonderful how beautiful how marvelous but you see God's not even looking at that and thinking those things but he's looking at us and he's going how beautiful how marvelous how wonderful is my bride and it seems we take it for granted so much but but I want to say this there's not a place you can be that the love of God will not be able to reach you that's right you know I begin to think about that out of the love of God you know when you're really in love with somebody and I have a wife and two beautiful children and you know as much as I love to be here with you there's something that's been on my mind the whole time there's something that's been on my mind in my heart the whole time I want to get back to my loving wife I want to get back to my beautiful children I can't help it why because they're a part of me there's something there that that I have to get back to them and you know even though we're miles apart today there's an unseverable love on the inside of me that no matter what the distance no matter where I am or where they are or where they might be right now or what they're even doing right now there is a love in my heart that still beats for them and you know I began to think of that you know I I remember when my daughter was born and and I held her in my arms for the first time and and even though there was a love that came over me that I could not explain there was something that came over me that that there was such a love that developed inside of my heart as soon as my daughter was born it was so instinctive that I never really I never you know she never did anything for me she never she never she never had to do anything for me she was a part of me and I remember the first time I held her in my arms I looked at her and I said Jolie no matter what you ever do I will always love you I could not help but love her and you know I pray to God that that God will keep her and and she'll live the most holy Christian Life that there ever will be on the face of this Earth that'll put my life to shame and everybody else's life to shame but I'll tell you this and God forbid that it ever happened just laying something out there but if she ever did go into something if she ever ran off into something and did something that she wasn't supposed to do let me tell you wherever she is and wherever ever she does I will always still love that little girl you know why because she's my daughter and tonight you need to know that you're the Sons and Daughters of the most high God and wherever you are let me tell you something I don't know how my daughter's feeling right now she might not be feeling the best she might be sad but guess what that doesn't change the fact that right here in Arkansas there is a man there is a father that loves her right now and wherever you are right now whatever you're going through no matter how you're feeling no matter how situations have played out there's a man right now right here that cares for you and his name is Jesus Christ you say well I've done a lot of things wrong and I've done a lot of things that I shouldn't have done what shall be able to separate you from the love of God I'm going through a lot right now I've got a lot of problems but you see it's still not able you realize what Satan is always trying to do to you is to get you to doubt yourself to degrade your value to make you think you're not good enough but as I told you you're not just anybody but you are the purchase of the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ God cared more about you he cared more about you than every strap on his back he cared about you more than anything a Roman soldier could say about him he cared about you more than carrying that cross he cared more about you than being nailed to that cross but you see Satan would like to tell you you're nothing God doesn't care about you he's not concerned with the things that you're going through listen church God is always concerned do you realize that one time that you say well I'm not sure if he's just concerned about my situation let me tell you because you go I'm one person do you realize what God will do for one person do you realize one time he was having a meeting with five thousand men not counting the children was having the greatest Revival service this world has ever seen some little boy brought him some Loaves and fish and next thing you know he's feeding 5 000 men not counting the families not counting the children he's sitting there feeding everybody but you know what the whole time this is going on in the back part of his mind he can I gotta let this go this preacher restrictor here but but do the whole time that he's there there's one on his mind yes sir somebody's coming up and saying brother Jesus that is the most fabulous service I have ever heard now I don't think I'm taking away deity out of Jesus Christ I'm just saying somebody might not known who he was yet but they're sitting there saying Master what a wonderful service yeah you've done this and that and he wasn't going man that was a pretty good service but the whole time he's got one in his mind even though this person just seen a miracle and this person just seen this we don't know what happened there that day all we know is that he he he turned some some fish and and some loaves into a into an all-night you could eat it all you want by favor that's all we know but we don't know how many people got healed there just because it wasn't wrote down don't mean it didn't happen and I'm not saying it did or it didn't but you got to think about this and they weren't going he well you know somebody might have walked by and said man my leg was just healed I have had a a a weird walk my whole life but God that that I'm the master just healed me right there but the whole time in the back side of his mind he goes there's one that I need to get to right go ahead he crossed the sea and the disciples have been very weary he had stilled the sea for them crossed all the way over where there was a maniac whether it was a maniac God's leaving a Revival to get to somebody that we wouldn't hardly even let in the church God's leaving a Revival to get to somebody that's messed our life up Beyond repair well there was a maniac taking a chance of crossing the stormy sea when the Devils of the sea swore they would drown him that night but he went over there at the Cry of one person and if I could add another title tonight one person is valuable one person is valuable you see what God is doing in the churches you see what God is doing for this one and what that one and sometimes we begin to get this thought God have you forgot about me no God has not forgot about you God's thinking about you during the Revival meeting God's thinking about what you're going through but he wanted to cry for one person War One poor Maniac lost his mind perhaps a good man one time walked up right before God but probably got in the wrong crowd maybe maybe he started drinking or something lost his mind he lived out in the tombs where the demons lived put him in Chains and he had Supernatural Powers he would break those chains jump on men and beat them up and kill them if he could when they come by and the poor fellow maybe he had an old gray-headed mother somewhere praying for him Jesus crossed the sea all the way over to give Mercy to one man I want to say this tonight it doesn't matter where you are Jesus will get to you it doesn't matter what you're going through Jesus will get to you when I was coming down the road right here and had to make the final left turn he said to me say it God will get to you and I don't know who it's for tonight but God will get to you wherever you are whatever you're going through you might feel like that Maniac you might have picked up a lot of things you shouldn't have picked up right you might have a lot of chains that have you bound yeah you might have picked up that Spirit of cutting yourself you might have done a lot of things that you thought in your life you would never do you looked around as a young Christian and you said I'll never get to that point I'll never do those things you fall into something and it keeps worn on your mind you did that now you can never be saved you did that you've made too many mistakes young people you failed too many times and God will never love you again but I'm here to tell you what can separate you from the love of God what can separate you can the problems at work no sir can the family problems no sir you said but I've made so many mistakes let me tell you something as long as in your God didn't love you because you were perfect God loved you because he's making you perfect he's all listen if God I'm just going to say it as plain as I can brother if if it will why was there a Calvary because God already knew you wouldn't be good enough God already knew you were going to make mistakes that's why he came in Perfection and died in the place for you so that you don't look at yourself no more I'm not resting in me I'm resting in him I know this is going to be broke up but you I'm just going to obey the will of the Lord he do he said I'm going to read that again but the cry but he went over there at the Cry of one person one poor Maniac lost his mind perhaps a good man one time walked up right before God but probably gotten the wrong crowd might be started drinking or something lost his mind and he lived out in the tombs where the demons lived put in Chains and he had Supernatural Powers he would break those chains and jump on men and beat them and kill them if he could when they come by this ain't the kind of person I'm gonna have on my heart and have on my mind but that's the kind of Jesus we serve that's the kind of God we serve see God wasn't looking at the problem God was looking at the man God wasn't looking at his mistakes God was looking at his heart God was looking you know what's a shame that in this Bible I don't want to say it that way because uh you understand what I'm saying when I say this I say it's a shame that that when the disciples would write they would call them Legion they would call them a maniac he wasn't a legion of devils he wasn't a maniac he was a son of God you see that even in the the oh even when when they would begin to write in the scriptures they couldn't even see that that was a Son of God but Jesus did and many times we look at people and we see mistakes in their lives and different things and we don't understand and we'll write them as just some thief or a murderer or or all these different things but God says that's a son that's a daughter and that poor fellow maybe had an old gray-headed mother somewhere praying for him Jesus crossed the sea all the way to give Mercy to one man but listen church this is what should excite you he said he do the same tonight yes where one humble soul is calling to him he crossed Seas or leave the Heavens to answer that prayer it's the same Jesus yesterday today and forever right do you realize we have a Bible today because people were in situations that looked hopeless do you realize in almost every single text that we draw out of the Bible is somebody that's in trouble that God brings them out of that trouble do you realize that today every single sermon that we preach is because somebody needed help so why do you think God couldn't help you why do you think you're beyond Redemption why do you think God can't help you you ain't got no problem saying God can help Seth's need we ain't got no problem saying God can help brother Ben's need we ain't got no problem saying God can can get to brother Solomon but what about you why is it so hard to understand that the one that created the heavens and the Earth his hand Ain't Too Short why is it so hard to understand that no matter where you are God can get to you right you say well I feel worthless you know I bet Rahab felt worthless one time more she did why would anybody want me why would anybody care for me Rahab the prostitute Rahab the prostitute not only that is she a prostitute but she's walled in by all of her problems in a city called Jericho and everywhere she walks in the street people are belittling her making fun of her put her down call her names do this to her do that to her yes sir that's right she's even given herself away throwing herself away but in her heart there's a desire I never wanted to be this way don't you ever judge someone's situation until you know what they've been through the Branham goes in and says you know that little girl maybe she had some parents that cast her out on the street at a young age she got into some stuff that she wasn't supposed to and it was the only way that she knew how to live she thought this is who I am because somebody told her that's who she was she began to listen All the Other Voices that said you're no good you'll never be you will never get out of this Jericho you will never get out of this no one can get to you here no one can help you here imagine her own little mind she goes why would anybody want me why would anyone even care for me then here comes some spies in there and she begins to see in her heart hey I'm nobody but if I could just help them out she begins to try to do the right thing for them and you know the story about how and you know it doesn't even make sense can you imagine her at that time they say just take a Scarlet rope tied together yeah throw it out the window and many times we think we need the greatest evangelist we need the greatest preacher we need to pray all night long we need something Supernatural to come and a man in the way of a vision or a prophecy or something else in God's hand just cast all your cares on me she I can imagine she's sitting there and everybody's going why are you tying all that together why are you doing all that why because I'm you know sometimes in this carnal mind the word don't make sense in the carnal mind I don't understand how I come let's just be honest I don't care I don't understand how I come to this building and I began to sing some songs and I and in my flesh I hear somebody preach this gospel and even though I felt like a loser maybe when I came in when I walk out I feel charged I don't understand how that happens up here but down here something's going on yeah and she began there's something going on down here in rahab's heart and she and the devil's saying you're worthless you're you're no good look at the mistakes you've made look at the things you've done look how far you've got from God but she's still just lying ready to throw out that window and when she does that even though the Judgment strikes around you know what she she she's realizing her a moment that she's in this place and she's thinking nobody cares about me nobody loves me I'm worthless I'm good for nothing why would anybody even want me yeah yeah there's a God you realize there was a captain that met Joshua out there and he was eyeing that one building where Rahab was in that house right there and he was thinking that's rahab's house that's a daughter of God in there there's a dollar in there and you know even though nobody else could get to her even though everybody else was blocked on the outside God would send somebody in there just to get her just as Savior see the world didn't care about her right the people of Jericho didn't care about her but there was a god of Israel there was a God that before the foundation of the world he was thinking about Rahab all glory well no one else would give her the time of day sitting there why what could separate me from the love that I have for Rahab could Jericho could the men of the city could the soldiers could the Chariots that run around the walls could all the false idols separate Rahab from my love he's going no as I told you there's a little family back home I'm thinking about and God's going there's a little woman in there that I'm thinking about and he sends the invitation right to our house and she throws down that skull oh Hallelujah you gotta realize you might not understand how God's gonna do it come on you gotta realize you don't have to understand how God's math adds up but when he tells you believe just believe only believe all things are possible they say why are you throwing that out the window I don't really know he just told me to [Music] I don't really know they told me to throw it out the window sitting there she's looking at all of Jericho everything that hates her everything that's bound of how she would love to break out of those things how there's people can I say this today there's people trapped in their own jerichos inside of their minds Satan sit there inside of your head saying you're not good enough you'll never be good enough God doesn't love you God doesn't want you the spirit of God has left you God don't care about you God won't fellowship with you the way he used to you can never have that back but God's going what can separate you from my love what can separate you from my love what can nothing can separate you from this love and everything she even gets to look around and looking around at everything and though she feels trapped inside of that place inside of that Jericho she followed the word of the Lord and listen you might be in a Jericho but God will get to you one day listen you say I didn't get my Deliverance on the first day when they started walking around that Jericho don't you worry about it yeah God makes all things beautiful in his time it looked like a Harley what was a harlot but not in the eyes of God they begin to walk around on the first day nothing happened second day nothing happened and she's sitting there going and her mind she's having mind battles that I make a mistake should I really have followed the message it seems like it just keeps going on and on day after day and they keep going around that Jericho day after day but on the seventh day she is a trumpet she hears a message come through Rahab she hears something come through I said you were never a daughter of Jericho in the first place that's not who you are Ahab you're not who they told you you were see here's a trumpet she sees the far Corner go down she sees another house go down she sees another house go down she sees a wall ball she sees problems over your fall she sees the things that are bound behind her Begin to Fall yeah everything's fallen and Satan says you're next you're next I told you if you gave your heart to the Lord you were just going to follow your face and not be anything and everything around her is falling down can you imagine you imagine the people on the outside of Jericho that day they looked and they said why is that one outstanding [Music] because let me tell you Jericho couldn't separate the love that God had for Rahab and no matter what you're going through Jericho didn't change I don't know why I can't get off Rahab I don't know why I can't get off this story maybe we need some jerichos to come down tonight I've got plenty of other stuff to listen you feel trapped in that mine sit there and Satan's constantly battling you past mistakes different things you've done wrong in your life now if you could just go back as in and fix it like it never happened in the first place but let me tell you what can I invite you to do it you say what do you mean because let me tell you something when you take that and you put that under that blood of the Lord Jesus Christ it don't just cover it up for a season it don't just hide it brother Branham said it's like that bleach you can come before the father you can give them for him and say father I've made mistakes I've let Jericho's build up in my life I've done things I never should have done God you can come to it and he'll take that pen from his side it was Solomon said and he'll write on their pardon yeah he can take every single one of those problems every single one of those mistakes every single one of those Chance cast in The Sea of God's Great forgiveness as far as the East is from the West never to be found anymore Hallelujah people can say I don't doubt people kept talking about Rahab but you know the beautiful thing about Rahab Rahab thought she was worthless rayab thought she was no good but God used the very vessel of Rahab to be the lineage of Jesus Christ the very lineage of Jesus Christ came through somebody that thought they were no good that they were an outcast because it couldn't separate the love of God will get to you wherever you are Brandon tells a story of blind Bartimaeus old church I began to think of blind Bartimaeus because I feel like we've all felt like blind Bartimaeus before get to a point you know what I realized about blind bar to Vegas blind Bartimaeus couldn't get to Jesus find barimaeus couldn't go by Samaria when he was visiting the well fine Bartimaeus couldn't go to the pool of Bethesda that day yeah yeah fine Baltimore's can't do anything flying Bartimaeus needs someone to come to him that's right right that's true he can't just act like us and get in our car and drive to the nearest Revival to try to get the fill up he can't do like us and and go to the church somewhere and pray he is and gets listen he's a blind beggar nobody cares for him but it can't separate that love now Jesus was on his road to Calvary every Bible believer knows that and Jesus was God in flesh king of all Prophets and being with the spirit he knew that he was facing what he was facing that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer under the hands of wicked people and his own children crucify him and he must die at Gethsemane Gethsemane was facing him I can imagine him seeing his cool Stern face setting as a breeze come down walking ahead of the crowd like that going towards Calvary the way of the Redemption of the world The Healing Ministry that we have into the world today rest on his soldiers the healing of Congressman Upshaw rested on his shoulders the healing of my blinded blinded eyes rest on his shoulders the sins of my life and your life rested on his shoulders and the sins of every Mortal die on the face of the Earth rested on his shoulders How concerned he walked he didn't hear the howling mob you realize he's on his way to die for the sins of the world he's got the most important mission that mankind has ever seen what a man needs somebody to get to him blind water Mayas need somebody to get to him because he can't get to God yeah it's good and the creator of the world is coming to save his people because of Seth coffee sins because of all our mistakes and all the things that we've done wrong But Blind barter mess has nobody to get to him well I thought Emmaus can't save himself God Bartimaeus doesn't even know hardly where he's at everybody looks at bloodborne Emmaus and he looks worthless to the world but it couldn't separate part of mans from love yes oh God what kind of Savior do we serve tonight yes How concerned he walked he didn't hear the howling mob some of them laughing making fun of him probably throwing rotten apples at him or something as he went along the others hollering Hosanna Hosanna what a mixed screaming multitude carrying how could he hear the poor beggar way out against the wall but he had Faith as he walked along he cried out thou son of David have mercy probably a hundred or more crying the same at the same time different things it wasn't I doubt Jesus even heard his voice oh Church you know we go back to that maniac sitting there crying in the Tomb he didn't hear it with the physical ear but there was a love on the inside of Jesus that could not be separated [Music] the faith of that one man him in that condition he was poor Outcast blind a beggar stopped him in the middle of his robe the faith of one beggar stopped him all that facing him stopped he's got Gethsemane that he's walking in listen he's the lamb slain before the foundation of the world he already knows everything he's walking into but there's Bartimaeus he's got the weight of the world in his shoulders he's got to think about every beating he's going to get every time he's going to get spit in his faith he's got to think about how he he can't get off that cross he has to lay his life down as the lamb he has to be the perfect sacrifice but then something's pulling him it's a love God's got to get to him it's an unseparable love even though he's got something that's important he can't be separated he was poor Out cast blind Beggars top in the middle of the road faith of one beggar stopped him all that facing him stopped he looked around to see who it was he felt that tug of Faith pull him Hallelujah and he said he's the same tonight one person's faith in the building can turn him and stop the heavens see Satan is always trying to tell you that God doesn't care about you anymore when you have a need the love of God Is So constrained do you realize no one cared about Bartimaeus Allen nobody cared what he was going through nobody cared how he failed nobody cared he's blind and he's crawling through the street maybe the kids coming by making fun of him gig no one cared yeah but Jesus and this wasn't a leisurely day when Jesus didn't have nothing to do you sit there and you go I think God's just too busy for me I think God's got too much going on for my need brother Ben I think God has forgotten about what I'm going through I thank God just doesn't care God has not forgot about you whether you're back in a cave somewhere yeah whether you're in Jericho the love of God is still beating in his heartbeat is so strong that it can break down every wall and every barrier because he's already saying you're going I'm past Redemption I can't be saved I've done too much wrong but he's already saying I won't lose a one yes sir I can't lose you I won't lose you nobody cared about Bartimaeus Jesus did you say this is simple listen you say this is simple it's the most profound thing you ever heard you say how is that because you go through the same trials yeah you go through the same battle you say that's simple I always say if it's so simple simply accept it simply accept that you're a son and daughter of the most high God would you like to why don't you just accept it tonight stop you know what why is it so easy to accept everything that Satan says yeah why is it so easy to accept it when he says you're no good right why is it so easy to accept it when he says you'll never make it why is it so easy to accept it when he says you'll always be this way when he ain't never done nothing but lie kill steal destroy but God says I'm the resurrection I'm the truth I'm the life and he says you're a son he says you're the perfect sinless spotless bride but we don't want to accept it listen we can't look past ourselves and see the love we got to look past ourselves and see I'll read this and I come to a close as the musicians come back he makes it all beautiful in his time to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose so remember whatever you're going through there's a purpose to every purpose under the heaven a time to be born a time to die time to plant a time to pluck up which is plenty of time to kill a time to heal time to break down a time to build up a time to weep and a time to laugh a time to mourn a time to dance you see church but all this has a purpose a time to Cast Away stones and a time to gather Stones together a time to embrace a time to refrain from embracing a time to get and a time to lose a time to keep a time to Cast Away a time to run a time to sow a time to keep silence and a time to speak a time to love and a time to hate a time of war and a time of peace what prophets hath he that worketh and wherein he labereth I have seen the travail which God given to the sons of men to be exercised in it but he says he hath made everything beautiful in his time you see what that's saying wherever you identify in this season whatever season that you're in whatever season that you're going through you can sit there and say well I feel like God's A Million Miles Away but there's a purpose for it you say well I my family's out in the world and they're running around and they're doing stuff they ought not to be doing but don't worry use that see that's not the end going through a hardest time because I just lost a family member I don't understand this it was a time to die and it hurt you see all these seasons in our lives and the things that we're going through when the presence of God feels so far away don't worry God is the greatest Sculptor this world has ever seen you see when I when an artist begins to work on something and he has this giant piece of marble Granite whatever it is and he begins to chip away at it and maybe you walk by and you see that artist and he's chipping something and chipping something away and the next day you walk back by and there's just a big chunk out of the left side of it you're going my what an ugly sculpture and you come back the next day and there's a chunk out of the right side of it and you go this guy just don't know what he's doing and you come back the next day and there's just cuts and slashes and everything in it but then you go on a little vacation you go somewhere and you come back a week later and you go ma who made this who made this beautiful sculpture do you realize that's what God's doing in your life don't get mad when when there's something that needs to come off of you but it takes some time the sculpture begins to knock that off of you but don't worry he's not done with the sculpture he's making something beautiful in his time say I feel worthless let him finish the sculpture you say well what if I make it what if I make a mistake behold I make all things new you see there's coming I hope you realize tonight we're winners no matter what no matter what happens to us in this life there's a beautiful outcome for us because God makes all things beautiful in his time now church I realized this was a beat up busted up message tonight but you know I'm one of those preachers I care more about your needs in a good sermon and and I pray that it was a blessing to those that needed it but just something in my heart when I was coming down the road you tell my children I'm going to get to them because listen no matter where you are and what you're going through how you're feeling how good how normal or how bad it cannot separate you from the love of God in with this as I go back to it I've got a little girl and a little boy you know that little girl is totally different from that little boy acts different does stuff different they're different they look at things different they talk different they enjoy things differently but I love them both the same [Music] you don't have to judge yourself off of somebody else [Music] you don't have to judge yourself off this brother or this sister or try to live up to their ex listen nobody loved Rahab but there was only one Rahab that God wanted you nobody cared for blind bardoms see like blind bar Ms wasn't like everybody else but the love of God still beat it s heart for blind Barbie mess I hope you understand what I'm saying tonight God loves you for you [Music] God loves you because you're his children [Music] God loves you because you're his sons and daughters [Music] this Earth that are my kids and let me ask you this you that have kids you know how much you love that child you know what that child means to you let me ask you this if you're a son and daughter of God how much does he love you you see that little kid getting to something that shouldn't get in you correct it or stop loving [Music] wherever you ever you are dearest children and God loves you maybe you need to make things right with them it's never fun when you got to come to your mama or your daddy tell them I made a mistake but I promise you this there's never a time that you'll come to a true mommy or daddy that won't go yeah they might correct you it might hurt never stop that love it'll never stop that I want to say that the love of God will never stop his mercies are new every day so we were leaving for Arkansas I heard Brotherhood Solomon asked me the prayer of the tree he said Lord we're thankful that your mercies are new today knowing that whatever we face today there will be Mercy allotted for it so wherever you are and whatever you're going through there's a mercy for it let's bow our his Heavenly Father Lord I know this was beat up and broke up father but Lord I know in my heart father I can rest Lord know and Lord Lord I said what you wanted to say father Lord just just try not Lord not to share my heart father but to share your heart to the people nor did you just learn to tell them Father that you love him almighty God through all the things they're going through through all the mistakes and all the failures Lord and that your love was unseparable oh God and Lord I thought you wanted to tell them Father no matter where they are or what they're facing your love will get to them almighty God [Music] very present help in a time of trouble Lord for the one that feels bound to something father Lord I pray that they would know there's one ear that'll break it almighty God the one that's been worried Lord about this and the other and anxiety over things Lord and just so stressed to the point father that Lord they just don't even seem to know where to turn I pray Lord that they would know almighty God or that there's one here almighty god father many times I thank Lord if they would just realize father you're the one that put the very heartbeat in their chest almighty God lord lord you're the one that took care of them every day of their life and you're not going to stop doing it now oh my God Lord I just pray that they would realize Lord that they have a father Lord that loves them and knows them by name Lord that'll never leave them nor forsake them almighty God whatever they're going through whatever they face lord they're still your children Lord and you won't deny your children you'll never turn your children down almighty God the Lord your love is inseparable do children learn father I pray that you would touch each and every heart bless each and every need Lord we love you Lord in Jesus foreign [Music] sometimes it takes a mountain [Music] oh sometimes sometimes [Music] people to get a whole night please so much stronger yes [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] yeah sometimes it takes place [Music] me [Music] times it takes trust you man ly you know but Branham tells The Story of Lazarus and he said you know sometimes you look at things that are going wrong in your life and you don't realize it but it's actually a blessing in disguise he said it looked like the worst thing in the world when Mary and Martha were sitting there in the very one yeah that they had put their trust in their faith in to come and he didn't seem like he was anywhere near didn't seem like he was going to show up and then he comes after their brother had already died and the situation looked hopeless but remember sculptors making all things beautiful so no matter what you're going through even if you feel like you're Lord is four days late and you're going through things you don't understand you can't comprehend it you don't know why it ever turned out this way God is still making all things beautiful in his time cause you know the story I said I know it's funny how Martha would say I know that one day he'll rise again see we're always putting it off to something else or another day or an extra Revival or the next church service the next time I feel the presence of God but Jesus is sitting there telling her I am I am that Resurrection I am the one that can fix your pride I am the one that can change it you know the story the man that was dead corruption had already set in and everybody already wrote it off as an ugly story everybody had already wrote it off as not the truth everybody wrote it off as there's no way that this could ever turn into something beautiful it's past Redemption it can't be made right when Jesus walks in whether it's a mountain whether it's a troubled sea church I want to say this if it wasn't for the bad things if it wasn't for The Story of Lazarus if Lazarus would have never died today we would never have we would never be preaching on The Story of Lazarus but see what they were in in the moment looked horrible it looked gross and look it looked like something that they would never recover from but God was making a beautiful sculpture and on that day when it looked hopelessly you might feel so hopeless like you could never get out but all it takes is the voice of Resurrection to come in and say brother sister come forth Lazarus come forth and even though you felt dead in your sin even though you felt like you were the biggest mistake Lucy and let him go that's the kind of God we serve and he loves us and he cares for us God bless you in Jesus [Music] let's stand together and sing it for just oh sometimes it takes it down [Music] oh to trust you in and believe sing it one more time oh sometimes foreign [Music] more than whatever troubles me sometimes it takes a mountain [Music] to trust you man believe you thought I was worth saving so you came and changed my life you thought I was worth keeping so you clean me up inside you thought I was to die for so you sacrificed your life so I could be free and I could be whole and I could tell everyone
