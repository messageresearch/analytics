the hospital and we know god has a reason for everything but that family's really been through it but paul's been recently in the hospital and just got out and with something different we believe god's a healer that's why we're here today we believe he's a healer and so we know that he's able to do that and we're just going to claim that this morning for our sisters before we turn to the word heavenly father or jesus as a church body father we we can't go and and be there where she is and i see you in isolation lord god we know that you're there and i pray father she's able to listen to this this morning paul's able to listen i pray god that somehow you would reach down where they're at lord we know that you're not limited by walls you're not just limited to a building but you're i'm not present and so we thank you for being there with them and i pray god that you'd move down and that you'd move in a mighty way this morning and that your spirit would be with them lord jesus we believe that you're a healer we we don't come lord on our own worthiness or anything else lord but we stand upon the blood of jesus christ we believe lord that you are a healer that you're the same yesterday today and forever lord we've seen in our day that you come with healing in your wings and healing revivals lord to show us that you are still a healer you are still god we believe and we claim that you're the same today as you were back then lord we know that you are we claim healing for our sister and we pray that you bless her lord for this service this morning lord every every spirit lord that would come against your word may it be stilled lord this morning may there be peace among us father may there may there be strength come from your word lord where we need correction correct us lord where we need inspiration inspire us father lord that we know we don't want to believe here the same as when we came in we want to be better we don't want to leave having rejected the word we want to receive your word today i pray that it would be so bless each one thank you for all that you've done for us we pray in jesus name amen amen god bless you this morning turn with me to judges chapter 16 and verse 23 judges 16 23 we'll read down through verse 30. it's good to have all of you here this morning and our visitors it's good to see brother ron this morning and god bless you it's brother joel's father-in-law and uh each one of you i know that they're expecting a baby soon so i'm sure that's what he's here for not not just here to see joel but it's good to have all of you back and and uh those that have been sick and able to come back with us but jp good to see you this morning and brother glenn's with us again this morning some that couldn't be here and are listening this morning and brother sam believing for healing for him as well in his body and different ones that are sick we believe that that god is able to have who he needs to be here here at the right time we also believe he's able to heal and to touch beyond these walls and so we thank god for that and still praying for sister vicky as well um we uh that fall festival is next saturday don't forget that next saturday at one o'clock and so and if you can help us with that i know some of you many of you are and if you can help us with that then that would be a blessing and i'm sure they'll be setting things up on saturday morning and then um we've got on november 8th i want to try to have communion that's not this weekend this coming weekend but the next we're going to try to have communion so remember that and we'll have foot washing if we can i'll talk to the brothers about that and we'll decide uh what we can do in that way but we want to do what we can for the kingdom of the lord and and to do what we're supposed to do he said do this until i come and and so we'll do what we can and then um i mentioned to you brother andrew glover will be in december the second and then we're planning some meetings with him next year and we're going to try to go ahead and set that in stone by faith and believing that all this will have passed and we'll be able to have some meetings in the spring or early summer of next year amen do you love the lord this morning amen judges chapter 16 and verse 23 you pray for me as we approach this subject and i'll try to take my time and and go through this i get in a hurry i let time limit me sometimes too much but i won't hold you all day but i just want to really dig into this and and realize where we're at today and what god can do for us judges 16 23 then the lords of the philistines gathered them together for to offer a great sacrifice and to dagging their god and to rejoice for they said our god hath delivered samson our enemy into our hand when the people saw him they praised their god they said our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy and the destroyer of our country which slew many of us came to pass when their hearts were married that they said call for samson he may make a sport and called for samson out of the prison house he made them sport and they set in between the pillars and samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand suffer me that i may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth that i may lean upon them now the house was full of men and women and all the lords of the philistines were there they were upon the roof of about three thousand men and women that beheld while samson made sport samson called unto the lord and said o lord god remember me i pray thee and strengthen me i pray thee only this once oh god that i may be at once avenged of the philistines for my two eyes and samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood and on which it was born up of the one with his right hand the other with his left and samson said let me die with the philistines and he bowed himself with all his might the house fell upon the lords and upon all the people that were therein so the dead which he slew at his death were more than they which flew in his life i'd like to talk to you this morning about revival once again and conditions for revival pray the lord would add his blessing to the word you may be seated this morning i want us to think about revival as being life coming back into the individual or to the church not as as being a meeting or as brother branham called it a protracted meeting or just a set of services but revival being life coming back into the church because without the life of the vine nothing now what jesus said he said without me you can do nothing and so the revival is life in the church now the philistines and we talked about it last sunday how that they did three things to samson they put out his eyes they bound him with fetters with fetters of brass and but isaac had pointed out to me on last week that that spoke of judgment and it does that it was fetters of brass and then they made him work for them he was grinding corn at the meal and this was the condition of the church and i want us to think about this in a denominational realm this was the condition of the church before the message of the hour this was the condition of the church prior to the coming of a message of the hour brother branham taught it said it was the it was the condition of the pentecostal church even though they had emotion they had lots of things even back then when he when he preached i would have enjoyed those services that they had back then but he could see something coming and so you could see that it would be what it is today and so brother random taught us that that cycle of revival and death had never failed so it's something that revival would come and then they they denominated they organized brother members said every time they did it died but now we know that this message broke the death cycle when it comes to i'm talking about the bride as a whole the church as a whole the message broke that and the reason why i say that is because there won't be another message come to bring revival right there can't be there can't be another another message to bring revival there will be another luther another wesley another prophet of the hour and the age this this is it so this one has to go up right and we'll talk about it more in a moment but that bride that come when when brother brandon saw the preview of the bride and he sees it how that it come around the first time and then he saw the church and all that it was going down into hell and then he sees the bride again the alpha and the omega bride that the bride had to be the same where did she go she went up she can't go down because this is it right this is it now the the message broke that death cycle but yet we we in ourselves we go through those cycles of revival and death even in our own hearts and our own churches but the age doesn't the age goes up and so there's something that we can be a part of today that is life the life is back in the vine it may not look like it because of the age that we're living in it's the very end time it's the time when the seed is coming to its maturity so you may not see it like it was when it was coming up out of the ground it may not grow as quickly but there's life there the life has left the shock we've seen that the life is entirely in the seed are you with me so far so now the age doesn't get a revival they're going down and that's why we know that no matter what happens in this coming election let me god when it's over but no matter what happens there won't be a revival to this age it won't be a revival to this land because this this country has turned down god many years ago so there's there's no revival but now we have a message that broke that death cycle that will never be bound by denominational feathers and there's no need of a restoration to what has already been restored but we have to be restored to that are you with me now so i put it this way a few weeks ago that we have to participate in our revival let me say that clearly where you can understand it we must participate in our revival now you and i personally deal with this cycle and brother branham says it this way in spiritual amnesia he said now look i want to ask you something he said what if he does come tonight he said oh say he isn't coming i don't know whether he is or not he said this is the last sign he said remember thus saith the lord did you ever hear me say that but what it was true you are seeing your last sign that scriptural he said you've seen your last sign pentecost don't get mixed up now with what he promised israel after the rapture that ain't you he said you're done then he said see now is your day now get this now is your day now it's your time don't reject it don't do it he said you better come he said you believe me to be god's servant remember he's in birmingham alabama he said birmingham i've never met nicer people you're the nicest people i would want to meet in my life but you need a revival well i thought he said this was their last sign but they had to be revived to it they weren't catching it i wonder today are we catching the inspiration of it can we see the possibility of it is there something inside of us calling out to that is there something that allows us to participate in that bride revival he said you're he said you're the nicest people i would want to meet in my life but you need a revival you're dying you're taking spiritual amnesia you're dying don't do that revive that what you've got bring it up again quickly before jesus comes so now you say well what's the difference well the difference is we're not waiting on a shaking revival the revival is here and i've always tied it back in and forgive me for repeating myself but it's such a clear type when jesus walks down to the man at the pool of bethesda and here is thousands of people waiting on the moving of the water the angel would come down in a certain season and move the water and they had to wait on that and as they were waiting they were waiting on that revival to come the welsh revival the pentecost were all these revivals they waited until that moment when the revival would come and then they would wait and as they waited then all of a sudden here was the angel trouble in the water and the first one in got healed right but jesus walked down there one day and he began to walk among those those people those multitudes that were laying there and he walked them home and he comes to one man and he comes to that one soul that was predestined by god and when he comes to him he said will you be made well do you want to be well and he said yes i do but there's no one to take me to the water he said but but take your bed and walk and he walked away and jesus left and from that day till this there's never been a time in history that the water moved again why because the angel that moved the water was present are you with me now that's the hour that we live in the angel that moved the water is here and brother branham didn't come to show us himself he come to show us that christ was here and then if he's here he's a healer if he's here he's a savior if he's here he can bring revival if he's here it's just right there but we got to participate in it so the man he come to the man he's come to us today he showed us the message of the hour but he says do you want to be well huh do you want to participate in the bride's revival will you be a part of it and then you if you're the bride you've got to say yes there's something inside of you that says yes that's for me now brother branham and works as faith expressed speaks of a dream that he had he said i had a dream the other morning i don't dream very often i'm not a dreamer but i dreamed that i seen a man a young fellow in shackles and he was trying to get out and i said somebody told me said those are horrible people don't have nothing to do with them he said i've seen this young fellow getting out of his shackle so i just let him alone i thought i'll just see what he does so when he got out he was a nice fellow he said and seen others trying to get out now see the people in those shackles they were acting horribly but they brother branham didn't know what kind of people they were if they would be released and he saw a young man that got out while he was a nice fellow he was just bound right and so many times we prejudge people based on when they're bound but if you can hear the voice of the word today you can see that you can be free from that but you've got to acknowledge that the word is true and say lord help me and and listen for the sound of freedom and now so brother branham said now this is only a dream he said i walked over this way i seen a brother roy borders a very good friend of mine lives in california he said look like there's something wrong his eyes was half closed and great big maybe cancer or something over his eyes he said and someone was trying to pull me away from him i screamed brother borders in the name of the lord jesus step out of that and he could just barely could speak saying brother branham it'll have to take something more than this i just can't grasp it brother random i just can't grasp it and i said over the borders he said i love him and someone pulled me away and i looked and was a lady standing over there that when i was a little boy i used to haul groceries from the grocery store to the people and her name was mrs finton she lives in jeffersonville you had a personal friend of the wife and i she said brother branham deliver us from this and said this is a house of hell and said you've been misunderstood and you misunderstood these people too said these are fine people said well i looked over there like a great big cellar big walls down beneath a great big cave great iron bars eight or ten inches thick people out of their mind isn't that the condition people are in today people out of their mind twisted arms and legs beating their head like that and she was crying saying deliver the people brother branham said help us we're in trouble she herself i know her she belongs to i believe he said the christian church called church of the brethren he said i looked around i said i wish i could go on looking around my little bitty body and them great big iron bars those poor people in there you couldn't get to them them iron bars was sitting close together now look they were beating their head like they were out of their mind and i've seen some lights flickering around in there oh my and i looked up and there stood the lord jesus with the lights of a rainbow around him he was looking right straight to me and said deliver those people and he went away and i thought well how could i deliver them i haven't got strength enough in my arms to break those bars so i said oh i love this house of hell give way to the name of jesus christ now you've heard this preached on before and maybe used it heard it many times but i want you to take notice of what's going on here was these people in bondage and a prophet of god cried out house of hell give way now brother man i'm saying all the creaking and popping and rocks rolling and bars falling and people running screaming delivered screaming at the top of their voice and was all delivered he said i was screaming then brother borders where are you now the point i want to get to is here is a prophet of god who cried house of hell give way to the name of jesus christ we've heard that cry in our day we have heard that cry a message has come forth the midnight cry and he cried house of hell give way and all the creaking and the popping and the rocks rolling and bars falling who was that that was us but notice immediately brother branham begins to look for brother borders because he knew brother borders was in that condition too and he loved the border so he began to look for an individual and he was screaming then brother roy borders where are you where are you god is delivering his people where are you brother borders he said i've wondered about that could i tell you today from my heart i believe without a doubt that the message has uttered forth in this age house of hell give way but where are you brother borders i don't know by the borders or what happened with him but i know this i would say this to those who are back said where are you i'll say this to those who just can't seem to have enough faith to live for god where are you so that's the revival of our day it's it's not that the house of hell is not broken loose it's not that there's no deliverance there is deliverance there is deliverance we've heard the message we've heard that voice we we we know that the voice of god in this day not the voice of a man but the voice of god uh it was a voice behind the voice we could say it that way not that not the literal voice of brother brown but the voice of god spoke said house of hell break loose but where are we at today where are you word of life tabernacle where are you do you have the ability to take god at his word and begin to run out and scream i'm delivered do we have the ability to stand there and say i'm delivered can you take god at his word and say i'm going to live the word i'm going to do what's right i'm going to stand for god i believe that i'm saved i believe that i'm delivered i believe that this message was effective to my family i believe this message is effective to my church i believe it's effective to my community i believe it'll make me a better christian i believe it'll put me in revival house of hell break loose we've heard that we're not waiting on somebody to come along and scream it we've heard it but now where are you let me brothers that can preach ought to take that sometime where are you where are you brother borders where are you at this morning maybe you're listening this morning and and it's just hard to even get the faith to to come to the house of god where are you are you participating in the bride's revival every one of us ought to ought to examine ourselves like samson did as he stood there that day where are you the promise has already been made the the blessings are there the promises are there i don't have to create them i don't have to make it happen i don't have to make it up but where are you this morning oh if we could just recognize the power of god that there's there's a possibility that you can be delivered that you could be free where are you backsider where are you who lives in a way that you know is wrong the power is here to release you the word has already been spoken you know better but there's power here to release you from that bondage as i said brother branham saw the preview of the bride and he talked about how that she'd come by and he said he said that talk speaking of that last breath he said i have to watch her she'll get out of step with that word and if i don't watch and i'm just paraphrasing he said when she's passing by if she gets by he says maybe it'll be my time after i'm finished and he said that he said these girls were walking through there and they were trying their best and was getting back to get in line because they was looking out somewhere else he said they were looking out somewhere else watching about that church that just went out into chaos so here is a group of of the bride who needed to participate and in order to do that they had to stay in tune with the word stay in step with the word so we find a voice calling out to them saying get back in line so out here we have a voice crying out house of hell let loose and here come all of the uh all of the ones that needed to be delivered were delivered but here's a prophet crying out get back in line because they begin to get their eyesight on other things instead of on the word of god instead of on the message of the hour they begin to look at politics so they begin to look at at the world they begin to look at the condition of the age they begin to look at their own condition instead of looking at the promise instead of looking at the possibility of what god could do you don't have to live under condemnation why place yourself back under that bondage don't walk you back inside that prison don't walk buddy you've been let loose the door's open the bars have fallen don't walk back in there on your own accord don't get out of step and that's what we do so many times by the day as we begin to look we see that church out there going down into hell and we begin to we just get out of step because we're watching what they're doing instead of watching what the word is doing how many times have i seen pastors get out of step because they're watching what some other church is doing instead of what they're supposed to be doing right here god help me to watch and see lord what would you have for us you're watching what that other church is doing yes they're doing wrong they're going down into hell but let's let's keep in line ourselves let's hear the voice of a prophet crying get back in line now he said it looked like they were trying to get back in line doesn't that give you hope but they had to participate in it samson had to participate in the revival his hair had already grown back but there were conditions that had to be men for him to be in revival the first thing he had to have faith in the promise of the hour most people that have a problem with not being able to live the gospel in our day because of a lack of faith it's also the key to most false doctrine because the promise is too simple it's hard to believe so you get off on something else that's easier to explain right and so people come up with man's ideas because of that and they can't live right because well that's good i believe god's a healer but not for me i i believe god can keep you from all these things but but me i've got a condition i'm different but see that's that's not what god does that's not what god says he says coming to me that are weary and heavy laden i will give you rest take my yoke on me my yoke is easy my my burden is light he cries i can i can share you i can be that burden bearer that helen talked about a couple weeks ago i i'll be that for you and he's crying out to us to do that and to be that now but before samson could be revived and we talked about this a little bit last week but i want to go in depth this morning before he could be revived he had to recognize the possibility of revival see he couldn't preach a negative gospel that well there's no possibility whether if there's no possibility god failed if there's no possibility of you having rapturing faith god failed when the rapture comes there's got to be somebody who has rapturing faith and it may not be a lot of people but there's going to be somebody right and god don't fail we know that but if there's no possibility then god failed you see the promise was still there samson stood there he'd been defeated he'd been stripped down by a woman he'd been he'd done everything wrong but he was standing there there's a possibility and you've got to recognize and grab hold of that possibility no matter what you've done and where you've been and what's happened in your life what's happened to a church what's happened to the message of the whole you look at that and say well there's a possibility because the promise is still the same i can participate in this revival now brother brown said it this way and oh lord just once more he said what time is it that's an interesting way to put it samson is standing there saying what time is it his hair's back huh but the word has been restored so now it's time for him to begin to defeat his enemy what time is it is there a possibility samson stood there and said what time see you've got to recognize the day that you're living in and that's why it's so dangerous to to put it off on another time you say well something will happen after the rapture right before the rapture and then we'll all be caught up no what time is it what time it is is there a possibility and he said what time just is there a possibility sampson happened to think that great god he's omnipresent he's an everlasting god i see my mistake i'm going to repent and he cried out he said there is a possibility that we could do the same thing day of that day he said if this they don't see the vision like samson if we could only see the vision of a possibility he said start right here right now a possibility see how could moses go down to egypt with a with a mule his wife on a mule with a baby on her hip he had a vision of a possibility people look and say the people are in bondage and people are never going to their bunch of hard heads anyway they'll never listen and they hardly ever did but there was a possibility he believed he saw the vision of a possibility revealed to him by a pillar of fire and so he went up there to take over take over egypt and the people thought he was foolish but there was a possibility people think you're foolish when you begin to really really get down to business with god but listen there's a possibility you're living in the day of possibility now samson's vision of possibility was rooted in the word that the angel brought when he was a boy that his mother taught him what the angel said you're no ordinary boy and faith cometh by hearing brother says as long as god sees those seven locks he sees his promise he said samson could reach back there and feel that and as long as god sees those seven locks he sees his promise hallelujah he said they shaved them off one time but they growed back when old samson stood there and seen them seven logs he knew god could look down and see his promise he was under obligation to his word do you see when people don't see when people say well it's never going to happen there's never going to be a church on fire there again there's never going to be a place i see a vision of a possibility there's the promise is still the same and you're believers so if you're believers and the promise is still there there's a possibility that god will keep his word hallelujah he said when old samson stood there and seen him seven logs he knew god could look down and see his promise he was under obligation to his word he said i say tonight that every man and woman here that'll take jesus christ sister healer trader as their savior and accept the word of god when god sees his promise he will keep it hallelujah those of you watching today at home remember that he will keep his word hallelujah he said and i don't care how much the devils beat you down with sickness or you hear it in church i don't care how much the devil's beat you down with sickness with leukemia with cancer with tuberculosis or crippled or whatever he's done you just take that promise of god the word of god and say i believe it hallelujah faith cometh by hearing hearing the word of god he said for god looks down and sees that promise applied by the blood of jesus christ something's going to happen samson was down there grinding he was blind and he reached up he couldn't feel it yet he said someday it'll be there and one day he reached up and said there it is hallelujah amen first he had to say he'll be there to be there when they reach up there it is that's the age we're living in we're living in that time what time is it the locks are there we're standing there the devil may look like he'd won but we're standing there at that time with a possibility of participating in this bride's revival hallelujah amen he said he reached up he couldn't fill yet someday it'll be there yes sir when they reached up and said there it is there it is god will see my seven locks again yes sir when god sees my seven locks he will see his promise to me amen what has happened in our day when god sees a fall restoration of the word when he sees a church that his hearts have been turned back to the promise of the pentecostal fathers when he sees that that's our day elijah came and did that are you with me now elijah came and did that then if he did that then when god sees my seven locks again he will see his promise of me when god sees you except his word and he's bringing it down individually when god sees you accept his word one thing for the pastor to accept it for a deacon to accept it but you when god sees you accept his word you watching this morning you sitting here in the pew when god sees you accept his word brother jt that you means me and it means you when god sees you accept his word unadulterated that's what it is see i can't live the word i have to have his help but i have to accept the word mary couldn't make a baby she couldn't produce a baby are you with me she'd never been with a man she couldn't produce a baby but the virgin mary was found with child of the holy ghost why without sensation without the handling of a man why did she do that because she said it's your word lord i accept the word of god i accept it unadulterated from my condition no matter what condition i find myself in that's the word i recognize it's true and because it's true you will keep your promise lord i don't have to rely on some story of a story of a story that i heard somewhere well maybe this is right maybe that's right no i know god keeps his word and no matter what condition i come in if i'll come back according to the word he will receive that it's your word lord then god will see his promise when he said whatsoever things you desire when you pray believe you receive it you shall have it it'll be granted to you he said brother god will keep his word do we believe that today our vision must be rooted in the word joel 2 25 and i will restore to you the years that the locusts have eaten the cake worm and the caterpillar and the palmer where my great army which i sent among you you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the lord your god that has dealt wondrously with you my people shall never be ashamed listen joel 2 25 has come to pass what about joe 26 you'll eat him plenty and be satisfied that's where you're living amen we can be in a restored condition as i've said before we don't have to repeat the sins of our fathers i mean any anyone that has come before us we don't have to repeat the sins of those that have come on i might by dna i'm a certain thing but i don't have to be that i can be different why because house of hell has been let loose those bonds those those bondages that i've had on my life those things in my dna and my nature that have corrupted me that have kept me down can be released by what by the word of god i hope you hear me this morning see was the word of god that spoke in the beginning said let there be light brother bill when that word spoke what happened it came to pass he spoke and all of a sudden it began to grow it began to come up what was it let there be light and there it was so it's light and when that same word speaks to my life there may be chaos but out of that chaos he begins to create order out of those very things that would have brought weaknesses whatever things in my life that weren't right god can actually make those strengths in my life he can create order out of the disordered dna that's in my life out of the disordered thoughts in my head are you with me now god can create order and you'll find yourself eating and planting and being satisfied why the restoration has come the word has come amen but you say well look at the condition of this age you're looking at the symptoms not at the promise yes the age is terrible i agree with you that it's awful out there but we don't have to be i know the word hurts sometimes sometimes it hurts me but it's that word that brings life we don't have that word we don't have anything i'd love to be able to just just go along with whatever anybody says but the word is it that's all we can go by we're bound to that because that's where deliverance is it's in the word and so we don't have to repeat those sins because the house of hell has been torn down deliverance is here listen jeremiah 17 and 5 this is the promise of the word he said thus saith the lord cursed be the man that trusteth in man make his flesh his arm whose heart departeth from the lord you say well if i could be in brother so-and-so's church or i could if i could have been here maybe even when the prophet was here if i could have done those things you trust in a man and he said cursed be the man that trusteth in man make his flesh his arm whose heart departeth from the lord for he shall be like the heath that's a tumbleweed in the desert he shall be like the heath in the desert shall not see where good cometh but shall inhabit the parts places in the wilderness in the salt land and not inhabited but verse 7 blessed is the man that trusteth in the lord whose hope the lord is what is he his word he is the word blessed is the man that trusteth in the lord whose hope the lord is for he shall be as a tree planted by the waters and then spreadeth out her roots by the river and you say well there's there's trouble coming there's trouble there's communism coming there's there's a catholic church rising up there's different things happening but listen what he says he shall not see when he cometh but her leaf shall be green and shall not be careful in the year of drought what does that mean it means it won't take in any less water in the drought than it did in the in the good times it won't be any less revive in revival than it was in the drought why or in the good times why because it will not be careful in the year of drought neither shall cease from yielding fruit why it's a tree planted by the waters hallelujah as a continual source of life brother branham in recognizing your day in this message he said the bride will come and to preach you again here he talks about he said here the bride come behind her the very same looking bride that passed at the beginning can we see that possibility today the very same looking bride that passed at the beginning he said then my heart jumped for joy to know that there will be a bride and she will be made of the same thing and clothed in the same thing that the one was at the beginning he said she is to be called he said and i know that is the truth listen to this striking statement he said if that isn't true then every vision that i've had in the back has been wrong he said and anyone knows that not one thing has ever told us but what was the truth pretty bad why so many times he traveled the country and he would speak maybe to 10 or 15 people to him your name is this this is what's wrong with you this is where you come from sometimes tell them 10 12 15 different things about their own lives he's showing us he god keeps his word his word is true he was here he showed himself as the son of man in our day what was it what was it it was god proving to us that he keeps his word are you with me now and he said if this is wrong then every one of those things would have to be wrong if there's no bride listen to me if you become a defeatist and again whether it's a pastor or a preacher or myself or anybody else because i get down sometimes sometimes you stand up here you know you feel like fighting you know and sometimes you get like paul he said i fought beasts at ephesus fought the wild beast you know and sometimes you get to the place where you feel you're wore out from the battle you get up here under the anointing you can face anything say anything that's why brother brown said don't come to the platform with hidden something hidden in your heart hidden sin he said because god will speak it god will reveal it and sometimes even in the house of god i don't even know what's going on and it could be any other ministry you've seen it over the years god will speak not because we have the gift of brother branham but because the word is the discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart god speaks and we don't go back and redo that discernment because to do that would be wrong for me to even approximate that in a public show would be wrong it'd make me a janice and jamers but the word itself is sharper than a two-edged sword and so if the word is here today it's able to come and speak directly to our lives and able to tell us exactly what's going on how we ought to come to the house of god and say lord i'm an open book whatever you want to speak lord i'm not hiding anything see but that if they hit something in their heart he would see it but he said if this is wrong then that's wrong now he said she is to be called he said i know that is the truth if that isn't true then every vision i've had in the back has been wrong and anyone knows that one thing he ever told us was the truth that come to pass and here it is the rising of the sun he said there has been churches churches brides brides churches brides brides but there's got to come one hallelujah there's got to it has to come a real bride there must come one that's not only got the mechanics but the dynamics of it makes that church live move in the power of his resurrection there's got to come one what did samson realize i'm the man i'm the one so no matter what i failed to do in the past i know i'm the one that's called to do this and so i'm going to do it i'm going to do and that applies to every one of our lives now he had to recognize so samson had to believe in the possibility and the second thing is he had to recognize his current state he couldn't lie about it he couldn't stand up there and say i'm not blind i'm not bound he had to realize he was bound he would realize he was blind being led around by a little boy he had to realize that when they made fun of him that they had good points they did he couldn't defend himself they're right they're right but they're not right about god whatever you say about me you know you could say oh you're just a horrible low down kind of person that's probably true without the grace of god whatever you say about me might be true but not what you say about him and samson said i was called i was elected before i was born to defeat this this enemy the philistines and if i was elected to do it then there's a possibility amen if i could recognize what i'm doing where i'm at then i could be restored look he said notice he thought of all his victories and then this must have been through his mind how that he had failed god's people now i don't want you to take this wrong because my heart is open to you i'm not living in sin but how many times do i walk in the church in the pulpit and say i failed god's people how many times i walk i can't tell how many times i walk back there and say i failed god's people you just feel helpless sometimes he and he said samson felt that way and samson had failed but brother branham very specifically tells us how he failed he said now notice he thought he of all his victories and then his mind must went through his mind how they'd fail god's people go that next quote he said it ought to be a shame to a minister that will sit and read this bible then walk out before his people he said the world is full of lots now many times when i think that i failed god's peoples because i think well maybe i've been too hard i've been too hard but that's what brother branham says he says the world is full of lots the bible said the sins of sodom vexed his righteous soul but he didn't have the courage to stand up and rebuke that sin and he said there's many men today and i say this with reverence only with love but just to say truth he said we may never meet again the next side said there's many men that reads this same bible that we read sits in his office preparing his message and run upon these truths of god and have to bypass them he said he would be afraid to preach against the women cutting their hair his organization would turn him out about them wearing immoral clothes and committing spiritual adultery he said about the men that takes a sociable drink on christmas and gets out and has a little clean american fun tells dirty jokes still maintains his office as a deacon they know them things are wrong he said but there as it was in the days of lot we're back to that sinful place again i'm not talking about these deacons here it's just a quote but you understand that look he said we're back to that sinful place again where a man's afraid to say anything oh god god help us today we're afraid some people are afraid even in their own homes to stand up and say something if it's wrong and over the years i think we've become because there's so much legalism that's going on and people worry about the length of your sleeves and and measuring how far you dress this from the floor and things like that and you begin to it's just legalism it's just a man's idea it's all it is if it's not in the word but at times you kind of get to the point where you just don't say anything about anything and people can do things that's just wrong and everybody knows it's wrong and everybody's afraid to say anything but look somebody's got to say something somebody got to say something and brother brandon says oh he said how samson must have been reminded by the holy spirit how he had failed god's people and it failed god himself and now he's a prisoner of the very thing that god raised him up and give him power to destroy he had to recognize he'd failed god's people by not standing for the word and the second thing he had to recognize that he was blind he said well that ought to be easy to see yes but the laodicean church didn't know they were blind they were blinded didn't know it and brother brown says that the enemy can only blind your eyes from the real thing of god you'll walk right over the top of it and not know it no matter what god does and vindicates it by his scripture and proves it by his power if your eyes are not open to the things of god you'll walk right over it as blind as you can be don't you see why satan allows even sometimes good men but satan will get and try to mess up the ministry because if he can get the ministry to a place where people have no confidence in it then what happens is every time someone comes that is right there's a scarecrow that comes up huh i know what i'm talking about from my own life from my own life from my from from growing up and i know how the devil can come to you and work on you and try to make you think nobody's right huh but what is it he's blinding your eyes to the fact that god keeps his word amen he said no matter what god does and vindicates it by scripture of it proves it by his power if your eyes are not open to the things of god you'll walk right over it as blind as you can be and he said again and once more he said now jezebel knew or not jezebel but delilah knew if she could ever punch his eyes out that was it he said and that's exactly what delilah of this last day is done to the church punched his eyes out to god's promise and sold you some great big intellectual denomination everybody likes to say i belong to the first church i belong down there see as long as the devil can put your eyes out to the word of god and the promise of god no matter how foolish it sounds it's god's promise so instead of having your confidence being in your own walk with god and in the al your own the the clarity and the communion that you have with god your confidence comes from what church you belong to what group you're a part of who you listen to on sunday what is satan blind in your eyes as long as the devil can put your eyes out to the word of god in the promise of god no matter how foolish it comes or it sounds it's god's promise so what did samson cry lord avenge my eyes the third thing the condition he had to have the faith to believe it was a possibility he had to recognize his condition and he had to allow death to come to himself he had to be willing to die samson said let me die with the philistines but branham deals with that extensively in these sermons just one more time lord just once more lord he preaches this several times he said they're not willing to pay the price samson prayed right what did he pray he said in closing i might say this lord let me die with the enemy that's the trouble they don't want to pay the price of dying you've got your own self worked up into a community into a bunch of people that you associate with and play cards stay home and watch programs eat tater chips and drink cokes if you ever saw 20 20. sit at home and excuse me if you're eating tater chips out there this morning i can't see through there it's not two-way screen they sit at home and watch programs and eat tater chips at least you're watching church amen we said the church sits empty make you sign a card you'll come six months out of the year to sunday school he said such a man made enthusiasm what you need is the holy ghost or you say i got it he said you sure don't act like it he said let the preacher preach an hour or something another like that are you ready to call the trustee board and throw him out about ready to throw myself out when i preach over an hour he said that's right it's the truth not willing he said oh he said you want to eat your cake and keep it too he said you can't do that no sir you got to surrender yourself you got a price to pay do we believe that today we got a cleaning up to do do you want to participate in this bride revival you got a cleaning up to do he said i tell you the whole world church world needs a cleaning all the way from the pulpit to the janitor's room said that's right it's the truth he said not willing to pay but simpson prayed right when he said lord let me die with these philistines he had failed but let me die he said you must be ready to die to the enemy that got this victory over you oh church see as long as you're alive the enemy can make fun of you as long as you're alive the enemy can keep you in bondage as long as you're alive as long as you're not willing to die the enemy's got you shackled but when you're willing to die you can be delivered amen amen he said you must be ready to die to the enemy it's got this victory over you you must be willing to surrender your own ideas samson was willing to pay the price to get the power of god again he said i wonder if you women are willing to let your hair grow out i wonder if you men has got enough courage to tell her that you're supposed to be the head of the house she's the next she turns you he said that's contrary you think a shaking revival would ever take these women out of these public offices policemen on the streets and things she ought to be in the kitchen and you know i know these things are tough for us to hear in 2020. i know that and look and we're looking at it was easy for him to say it then because th the world many of the worldly churches even believe this but it's hard to hear today now i looked at that and i thought i'll just take that part out and i got convicted i can't do that are you with me now it's still the word of god he said i'm not trying to control your lives i just want us to think about where we're at are we willing to die he said you think you'd ever be able to get back to that again no sir he said she'll never do it unless she gets saved and she'll do it you won't have to tell her nothing about it she'll find her place that spoke to me i said god because i it grieved my heart i thought lord i don't have to tell people that it's wrong to do certain things that are just obvious i don't mean over the pulpit i just but just sometimes things come up and it's like we know that these things are wrong you you know that the wrong people come and know that they're wrong but it's like you got to tell people that it's wrong brother brown said you won't have to tell her nothing about it she'll find her place the holy ghost will lead her to her place but say the holy ghost is leading me to that contrary to the word he said don't call that the holy ghost how many times some people come and say well brother ben i'm praying about this well you can't pray about something that's a denial of the word if you're allowed to do it it'd be like end up like balaam i'm sorry i know i'm getting repetitive i hate myself for turning into a pastor sometimes i do but you know we've got somebody's got to say it he said don't call that the holy ghost he said you fathers you mothers this spoke to me in my heart and my family are you ready to establish an altar in your house you notice how he says he said your father's your mother he said well he won't do it well who does that leave to do it somebody's got to do it are you ready to establish an altar in your house take that television out are you ready to take that deck of cards off the table i know people take that and say well if i don't have a tv i'm clear i'm clean no you got a tv on your phone don't have mine with me almost everybody does huh but are you willing to lay that down if that's what it takes for you to die well i don't have tv but you binge watched 36 episodes of your favorite show on netflix last night and you show up at church dazed and confused i said brother ben you've never done that we won't go there i've tried to do right with my family but we listen we live in this age this is the age that we live in huh are we ready to establish an altar in our house he said are you ready to take the deck of cards off the table in comic books your children's reading preparing the little minds for a blast that the devil's going to give them and again you can take these as a legalistic set of things and then everything that you think is wrong is stuck in 1963 but there's things that are still wrong and some things that we shouldn't be spending our time in even today maybe that brother didn't exist in brother branham's time but it's still the truth and david said it this way a long time ago he said i'll set no evil thing before my eyes he said are you ready to establish the old family altar again or do you just want to continue on the way you are you want to continue on you're not in that condition of coming yet i can't we can't force that samson had to get in a condition where he recognized his need he said but i pray that you're like samson you see the price and you're ready lord let me die with them you knew if god answered this prayer what was going to cost he said many people i've seen him right since i've been here come up to the altar and the holy spirit come to them and they don't want to die how many times have i seen that i've been in youth meetings i've been in revival services i've been in different places they come right up to the altar and they pray and they cry but they're not willing to die see you don't come to an altar to get anything you come to an altar to give up things if you're coming for that for that purpose you say well i need salvation well if you come to the altar you're not coming to the altar because this is a place where salvation is and you'll just get it when you come up no it's your obedience to god's word and the fact that you're willing to die and for some people that requires making a fool out of themselves you ever seen god really bless you ever noticed it's the time when something you didn't want to do that's the way it works with me maybe not with everybody but when when i really don't want to do something when there's a sermon i really don't want to preach and god bless us when you feel like you well you people around you say well i really don't want to do that i i don't want to go to the altar i don't want to but listen that's the time when you make that commitment when you do that thing that god is showing you leading you to do what happens then all of a sudden you break through you break through people are willing to do a lot but are you willing to obey god are you willing to die to yourself he said they want to stay alive in the world you can't serve two gods at the same time are you ready to forsake everything to serve god listen to him cry lord only this once more there's things that you could do that would be fine but when you put it in front of god i don't care what it is are you ready to forsake that to serve god to participate in this bride's revival he said is the pentecostal church the general counsel the assemblies of god the church of god all the rest of you willing to pay the price are you willing to say once more lord here i stand i didn't have the audacity the very christian spirit to shake hands with my oneness brother or my trinitarian brother i didn't have the audacity to do it i didn't have the grace to do it when i see where it's got me to god was ever speaking to people with us today didn't have the audacity to cross the street and preachers i and you know i get if i'm not careful getting a bad attitude about it because you say you know preachers do everything they can to schedule something opposite to try to keep you from from people fellowshipping but you know what we got to be bigger than that you want fellowship i'll fellowship brother peregrine said something years ago and i didn't agree with everything barry green said but this was good he said i learned he said after being in tucson where all the people were fighting and fussing that we couldn't even agree on how to have communion he said and i learned after a while he said that utopia didn't depend on them he said it depended on me he said i could be love everybody and be at peace with everybody you know and people can only be so successful with that we're human but but that's true it only depends on us what are we willing to do do you have the audacity to have the grace to he said you see where it got me to broke up in organizations disfellowshipping with the congregation so poisoned against one another that they hardly speak to each other on the street when we're molded into one clay by the holy ghost i don't say we're that way i thank god that we're a close group we're a small group but we're close i thank god for that but don't let that poison come in among you we're molded into one clay by the holy ghost do you believe that today are you willing to have the audacity to die to yourself say lord i'm willing to fellowship with my brother he said are you willing to cry once more lord let it happen if you are god will sure hear your prayer he said watch when that man with all that fiber standing there is great regime he said but he was still blind he knew the price he knew the possibility amen and he said once more lord i know i'm reading a lot but but you just bear with me this is what the prophet said to our day you you're looking for a prophet to come back and say house of hell break loose or you're looking for some other man to come and say that he said it this is it it's the word of a prophet in our day to open up a book and show us what was there to make it live make it real in our day to show us that christ was here he said listen every fiber of his body begin to tighten up amen he said the spirit began to come on those muscles oh he said if amen if we could have the spirit that spirit that come on our wednesday night prayer meeting on our sunday school amen well that's my prayer today these kids gather and then they do little things in color and things like that but oh that that spirit could come on our wednesday night prayer meeting on our sunday school amen he said that we on our sunday school to feel the fibers or the muscles of god's power tightening up where the holy spirit can come in not on a mockery but in a genuine spirit to reveal the secret of the heart to straighten up the sin that's in there cast out the evil as this fibers begin to tighten he said let me die with them i was born to destroy them let me die with them and his fibers his muscles tightened up his great huge muscles received strength the holy spirit began to move upon him and he twisted that rock with his mighty power and down she went he said all we need is a sincere prayer once more lord once more lord word of life tabernacle can you hear me this morning do you believe it can happen i'm closing the musicians would come i i noticed that brother brandon never had an altar call after he preached this sermon he had a discernment line or called people out in the audience why because the main thing that he could get to the people is that the possibility was here are you hearing me today we can't do that again as i said that was
