they've fallen asleep but Lord I I know that you're the God who is not bound by walls and or though we would not be able to touch them physically tonight and lay our hands on them but Lord you're there and may your angels go down where they're at Lord And heal them this evening Lord different ones in the church Lord It's struggling with sickness and I know it's Lord It's just things that come through and and test us but Lord I pray that you'd bless them tonight and Lord may they realize that you're the Healer Lord and that you've bless them in this in this situation Lord I pray for those that are here and those that are watching Lord give us a revelation of your word tonight we realize that a revelation of your word is actually a revelation of us Lord for we are your word not not these bodies but Lord on the inside there's a seed that is your word help us to know who we are and where we belong and what we are and we'll give you all the praise and the glory and the honor let me ask it in Jesus name amen amen God bless you let's turn to Leviticus chapter 23 and verse 9. Leviticus chapter 23 and verse 9. that's the third book of the Bible Genesis Exodus and Leviticus you have to bear with me a little bit tonight I been a little bit under the weather myself but I'm much much better but it's just been a couple days seems like that little sickness comes through and anytime you try to get people together anymore it seems like everybody gets sick but but it's worth it anyway to be around the uh the bride of Christ and to love one another and so we'll just grin and bear it and but it's just the age that we live in the devil fights us that way Leviticus 23-9 I want to speak to you tonight on the wave chief and it is important if you're listening tonight or if you have a chance I know it when you're sick it's hard to listen maybe you can come back later and and catch it because it's kind of an important topic and I just hope I can get through it tonight and and don't you love the word amen the word is always good amen Leviticus 23 9 the Lord spoke to Moses saying speaking to the children of Israel and saying to them when you be coming to the land which I've given to you and shall reap the Harvest thereof then you shall bring a Sheaf of the first fruits of your Harvest and to the priest and he shall wave the Sheaf before the Lord to be accepted for you on the morrow after the Sabbath the priest I'll waive it so this is at a particular time a particular Feast that they would have and there would be a Sheaf waved before the Lord offered to the Lord in that way I pray the Lord when that is blessing to the word you may be seated in 1752 Benjamin Franklin took his son to fly a kite in a thunderstorm and he had a purpose for that I think I've got that Esther on the slide just to keep your attention tonight while I get started and kind of get going but uh that he was finding that electricity could be conducted and controlled he didn't invent electricity electricity is a natural force but he learned how to conduct it how to control it and so him on one end and then 127 years later Thomas Edison invented the light bulb and I think I have a picture of him as well so on one end Benjamin Franklin uh he and he he found that electricity could be controlled on the other end Thomas Edison found a way to bring light into people's homes and what it was is Thomas or Benjamin Franklin rather you could look at him as the wave Chief or the first fruit so wave sheep is just the first fruits of anything it it's the first one to do it if we could put it like that the first one to do it was was Benjamin Franklin and then Thomas Edison comes out it's in a different form but it's still the same thing and so that was the Feast of the wave Chief and then the wave lows which I'll get into in a moment one shows that something can be done and another does it I he rep they replicate it but in a mass scale in business it's called scaling and so that's the principle of the wave Chief you'll find it in the scripture when David he comes out and and he comes against Goliath and you remember what he did he he didn't just kill him but he went and cut his head off with his own sword and then he holds the head up right he takes the head kind of a Grizzly picture isn't it he takes the head and holds it up and shows it to the other people why is he doing that he's doing that because that he's being a wave Chief he's actually being a first fruit he's saying come on boys we can do this we can take it we oh that's what we want to be tonight don't we we want to be the if something needs to be done let's be the first one to do it and say I want to show others it can be done it is possible to live a Christian Life it is possible to to do the things that we need to do and and so you could even take that principle and type it in many different ways but you could take it to people in a church and you could say that brother Danny's generation was a wave Chief to our generation a book in said his generation showed it could be done that people could live in Hardy Arkansas and and have things that happen to him but yet they remain Christians and and then my generation and and and brother Levi and those that are under younger even they can show on the other end that it can come out in a body form and and there'll be even more that'll come out and and so we see that uh what can what what has been shown that could be done we can do so that's the principle of the wave Chief now brother Branham first mentions that in a message titled Feast of the trumpets if you've ever listened to that sermon It's a Wonderful sermon but he just mentions it briefly in relation to the seven Church ages and he kind of gets his words mixed up and he corrects that in questions and answers number one in 1964. and so if you listen to Feast of the trumpets you're going to get your feast days mixed up because brother Branham does when he's there he gets he he carries one thought over into another and so if you go to that next side Esther I think there's a I think I've got a list of the feast days I know you probably can't read the dates but it's not really important I just wanted to get you to see the order of it the first Feast was Passover Passover was in the first month of the year and it's kind of interesting that God said okay the fourth month will be the first month right and that's April he said April will be the first month of the year to you and so God just does what he wants to doesn't he and so he just set that as the first month and so the first month of the 14th day that that's the Passover and then immediately after that as a feast of unleavened bread and and then the first month the day after the Sabbath that's the first fruits which is the wave Chief brother Branham talks about and then it's not just the way of sheath by the way it's a wave offering and there's a principle here see the way of offering is Christ that's the main type but remember what I said that there can always be a wave Chief or something we could type as static Benjamin Franklin right there's always a beginner somebody who started something and so we could type that again even to Elders in the church but but the main type is Christ and so then Pentecost follows 50 days after or seven sabbaths after first fruits and then there's a long period of time in that long period of time it's actually seven months in between Pentecost and the Feast of trumpets which we know was to the Jews in the day of atonement so now as as you continue through that with a random typeset uh 50 days he calls that seven sabbaths calls it the seven Church ages but actually comes back and corrects himself and says it was not that but it was the seven the seven months in between Pentecost and the trumpets so he goes into that and he said you remember there the sheath turns into a loaf of bread after that time Chief turns into a loaf of bread after that time he said he said when the Sheep when one Sheaf goes into one loaf we know there was two loaves but what he's saying is it's the same material that's in the Sheaf it's the same material that's in the loaf he said oh it's a great teaching there he said I didn't touch the edge of it but if you happen to catch that on your tape he said remember look in the Bible and if you have a question about something brother random says it'd be a good thing to look in the Bible so we could all look in our Bible and begin to see and we're going to do that in just a moment and so he said then he said some Minister might pick that up he said and then you'd have it see and so in Leviticus 23 and 12 he said You shall offer that day when you wave this Sheaf a helam without blemish of the first year for a burnt offering unto the Lord and the meat offering thereof shall be two tenth deals the fine flower mingle with oil and offering made by fire unto the Lord for a sweet savor a drink offering there should be of wine the fourth part of a hen and you shall eat neither bread nor Parts corn or green ears until the self same day that you brought an offering unto your God it shall be a statute forever threat or generation generations and all your dwellings so he said this was the very first grain that was brought out of the field in all of Israel would be the first fruits of the wave offering he said You shall count unto you from the morrow after the Sabbath from the day that you brought the Sheaf of the wave offering seven sabbaths shall be complete so now this is we're coming to Pentecost Pentecost means 50. he said even until tomorrow after the seventh Sabbath so you remember 50 days you shall offer a new meat offering unto the Lord you shall bring out of your habitations that's out of your home so now they've gathered in the Harvest they've went out and gotten wave sheeps now they tell me that it takes about three square meters of land to produce one loaf of bread so it takes it takes a whole sheath Maybe of wheat to produce one loaf of bread so now but when you when you take that it there's everything though that's in the grain that's in the in the individual grains in the bread it's just in in a mass form and it's been changed so they've taken that into their homes they've baked it and they've ground it and they've baked it and they've actually produced bread with it he said then you take the bread he said and it'll be two wave lows of two tenth deals it shall be a fine flower they shall be bacon with leaven they're the first fruits unto the Lord so now that were the first fruits that were at the wave sheep and the first fruits at Pentecost now remember that as we go through this tonight is anybody confused yet I know many of you have heard this before but I've actually realized recently that many people some things we should know we don't know or we don't we just don't remember so maybe we need to go back over it so uh let's go back into the it is the rising of the sun because you need to understand the biblical background to this in order to understand what brother branham's saying and it is the rising of the Sun he said if there would be any holy ritual that should come forth on the Sabbath day which was the seventh day of the week which is Saturday he said but did you notice in this Memorial to wave it on the first day of the week he said the Sheaf which was the first of your seed that you planted when it comes up in ripe and you cut down this sheath and take it to the freeze let him take it and wave it before the Lord for your exception that you are accepted you have come with your sheath and he has to wave up before the Lord he said not on the Sabbath the seventh day but on the first day which we call Sunday s-u-n-d-a-y he said of course that's the Roman word which they called it the Sunday for the son God but how it has changed it's not s-u-n anymore it's the s-o-n-v-a-y the Sunday that the corn of wheat God's first one up from the dead aren't you glad he came up from the dead he said God's first one up from the dead is to be waived over the congregation that we are his seed he said and that's the first of the seed of those that slept waved upon the first day of the week so so far the type is very simple it's very simple it's Christ right being raised from the dead as the Sheep is raised up in a waved on in the first fruits Feast he said now I hear is Christ being waived on on Sunday literally on the first day of the week he said he on Sunday he raised up he said wave goodbye send it up on high on the presence of the people he said notice it was the first corn of God's wheat that had been raised from the dead God's first corn of wheat he said by God's quickening power God had quickened his life raised him up from the dead and he was the firstfruits of those that slept the first fruit he was that Chief yes now Paul taught this same Doctrine right you know Paul taught about the wave chief he taught that in First Corinthians 15 and 20. he said Christ is the first fruits now a Jew listening to that would understand he's talking about the wave feast or what we call the wave sheath the Feast of the first fruits Christ is the wave Chief Christ is the first fruits he said now is Christ risen from the dead and become the first fruits of them that slept that word is first fruits the earliest crops of the year and again you could use that in different types it could be even the earliest converts in a district yes and it was used that way the first fruits right but there's got to come wherever there was a first fruits there has to be a Pentecost right so you see a Biblical principle there's a first fruits it's waved it's got to be waved again at Pentecost that's true in your life you will you come to the message you receive Christ into your heart but there's got to be a time when it becomes a loaf it's got to live through your life so what what was done in Christ had to live through the church right now so again the first fruits verse 21 for since my Man Came Death by man came also the resurrection of the Dead for as in Adam all die even so in Christ shall all be made alive someone say all all be made alive who how are we made alive in Christ that's the only way he said but every man in his own order Christ again the first fruits afterwards they that are Christ and it's coming again this is not a common Greek word this is something that the Jews would have understood as being the Feast of the first fruits he said that's why they had to wave that Sheaf again going back to it is the rising of the Sun he said that's why they had to wave that Sheaf for it was the first one to come to maturity and it was waived as a memorial of Thanksgiving to God believing that the rest of them would come it was a sign amen and today because he was the first Son of God to come to full maturity to be in God he was plucked up from the earth and is waived over the people he said oh what a glorious Lesson by the quickening power the first one he said although he had been typed many times as we'll see later that he was tight so he's again he's saying he was typed many times but this was he this was the real type this was this was not the type but the anotype this was the reality of it this was the Fulfillment of it so now he said oh he said but this was really the first fruit of them that slept he was waived over the promised seed that had promise of life now if you go into that sermon brother randleman's then going to take it and I hope I'm not boring you tonight but we're just going to kind of dig in real deep and then we'll we'll get out of it maybe and apply it in some way to our lives but but brother Branham when he preaches this he begins to give a dual fulfillment and begins to talk about it and also begins to talk about the way of loaves that was waved at the day of Pentecost and he goes on in the next fir or the next paragraph and he says he was waived at the day of Pentecost he said when there come a sound from heaven like I'm wave a waving Mighty rushing wind and was waved over the people the Pentecostal people that was up at Pentecost waiting for the blessing to come so now again where does this fit in the type it's Pentecost 50 days after the wave chief the loaves were waived so you could say there were 120 loaves baking in the upper room right and and then the Holy Ghost picked up those loaves and started waving them before the people and said this is that yeah right so you see how simple that is so now that's another type so now he said no now notice brother Brandon says he was waived he was waived at the day of Pentecost not something else was waived he was waived even though it was now in low form it was in church form it was the book of Acts Church it was in the form of Peter and and John and the apostles in 120 but he was waived Christ is the first fruits he's also the bread but that's he's in a different body one loaf one Chief the bread we know is the type of the church because it has leaven in it now again he goes on he said to be waved again he said we realized in the last day according to Luke 17 30 he said in the Sun the Sunday again the son day again he said in the day that the son s-o-n of man will be revealed or waved again over the people so brother Madam takes this now and he's applying it to a different type and he's saying it's going to happen again at the end time but he's saying according to Luke 17 30. so he ties the wave sheath to the coming of the son of man or the revealing of the son of man so he says the son of man will be revealed or waived so Luke 17 30 is if you tie those two together in your Bible Luke 17 30 and Leviticus where we read in Leviticus 21 I believe it was that's those two things tied together so now uh now he said to be waived again over the people now what was brother Branham now when we begin to think about these things because you'll hear a lot of different things but we need to make sure that we are rightly dividing the word brother Branham was a son of man right revealing the son of man right he's not the son of man he's a son of man because again peace son of man is Christ so we could say it like this brother random is a wave Sheaf but he's not the wave chief he can't be the type yeah but he can be a type and and the sin city is a type because he was the first one in our generation to believe the message you realize that brother random had to believe the message too right right he was the one that had to come with it he didn't just automatically he had to believe it yeah and then he had to come and preach it to us and so uh he was the first one of the message and not only did he believe it but he manifested it and he showed us what that could do and the power of the third pole the power of the open book The Power of what God could do in a man and what God could do in a Ministry and so what was it it was a wave sheath but not the wave sheath because then you make him God yeah right a son of man but not these sentiment brother random answers that question they said brother Brown some say you're the son of man I thought the pillar of fire was the son of man he said they needed one word but he said he said it's a good question he said but he said there's a big difference between a son of man and the son of man right and so it's not the son of man it's not v-wave sheath because that is always Christ and again brother Branham immediately follows that up with this he said now who is the son of man he said in the beginning was the word now what's he quoting John chapter 1. right who is the son of man in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us who is the son of man the word was made flesh the son of man is the word made flesh right now and again this is a foundational teaching so I'm taking it slowly tonight on purpose because I'm not a very good teacher so I'm trying to I'm trying to help myself as well just make sure that we really we really understand this because people have always had difficulty with this right when Jesus come he didn't explain it he come to them in John chapter 6 and verse 51 he said I am the living bread which came down from heaven If any man eat of this bread he shall live forever and the bread that I will give is my flesh which I will give for the life of the world the Jews therefore strove among themselves saying how can this man give us his flesh to eat then Jesus said unto them verily verily I said to you except you eat the Flesh of the son of man now watch if they ate his flesh would be cannibals and they knew that they knew it wouldn't it wouldn't work with the law so who is the son of man now think about it the son of man cannot be just the literal flesh of Jesus Christ but it's the word made flesh the son of man is the word because that's what we eat amen so he said how can this man give us his flesh Jesus said except you eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you and brother Brown tells us he never did explain that but there were some who were ordained to life who believed it anyway well I'm so glad that I can believe even what I don't understand aren't you glad for that and then he lets us understand many things but there's some things that we'll never understand in life I'll tell you one you'll never understand you'll never understand the mystery of suffering you'll never figure out why people suffer why some people suffer and other people do not but he said you don't have to understand if you trust me yeah right right and that's what he's telling his disciples if you believe me if you trust me you don't have to understand it but you're going to eat my flesh you're gonna drink my blood so again he made it sound like it was his literal flesh and blood but it wasn't he he made it sound that way on purpose but the brown said he did it that to stumble them but those were named to life believed now again and I've read this many times to you but this is where brother Branham takes this from he said the angel is not the son of man he was the messenger from the son of man the son of man is Christ he is the one that you're feeding on you're not feeding on a man again you're not even feeding on the literal flesh of Christ you're not feeding on a man he said a man his words will fail but you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man yes so you see where brother Brandon takes that from and again go back to the word always go back to the Bible and you'll see that these things have a have a place now if we go back to it is the rising of the Sun brother random continues on talking about this wave chief that is the word the son of man being revealed he said if all the teaching that we have and confirmation of the word of God by word of God by Signs by wonders we see today he said that in the Book of Luke here he said we just quoted from the 17th chapter in the 30th verse and Malachi 4 and the different scriptures that we are acquainted with that the word again is waived over the people that the Dead traditions of man is dead and the Son of God is alive again now watch the Son of God is alive again with the baptism of the Holy Spirit right Among Us and it's giving us life so it wasn't brought even the revealing of the son of man was not just in word only but in power how many believe that tonight I'm not going to hold you real long tonight so just bear with me so he said as Christ was the first one to raise from all the prophets and so forth although type too many places he was the first fruits of those that slept in the bride coming of Christ coming out of the church there will have to be a Sheaf waved again in the last days Oh my he said a waving of the Sheaf what was the sheath the first one that come to mature the first one that proved it it was a wheat that proved it was a Sheaf right the first one that proved electricity could be conducted right so there has to be a wave chief so that somebody can make a light bulb yeah yeah there's got to be someone there had to be a Christ to raise so that we could be raised there had to be someone in this age live under the message and become become the fullness of the word in our day in the sense not in the sense of being the fullness of God but in the sense of of in their place in their position and that was Christ working through a prophet but it was also Christ working through you and I right it is Christ working through you and I to bring us to that maturity amen so again the first one had to come to maturity produce a Sheaf he said Hallelujah I'm sure you see what I'm talking about it was waived over the people and the first time there will come forth for the bride age for a resurrection out of dark denominationalism will be a message amen here's your wife's chief right there's that there's the reality of it it's the message it's the words Christ right that the full maturity of the word has turned back again in its full power someone say full power full power what that means is that whatever however went down that's how it's going to come up however it was waived that's how it's going to be weighed back he said it's turned back again in his full power and being waived over the People by the same signs and wonders that he did back there because I live oh this is so good tonight because not because I'm saying it but just because of what we're reading because I live you live also speaking to his wife oh aren't you glad he wasn't speaking to some denomination somewhere he was speaking to you he was speaking to his wife and you're his wife whether you're sick or in need or struggling or whatever it is that you're going through tonight you're still his wife right amen I want to deal with I don't have time tonight but I want to deal with it at some point you can't go from one group to the other yeah and maybe we will just briefly in our communion service coming up but you can't go from being bride to being the world yeah you can't get out of one group and just become another say well I'll make a mistake and I'll fail and I'll I'll not be bright anymore no he's speaking to his wife because I live you live also because I live you live that takes works out of it that takes everything I can do out of it it's on him right because I live you live off so what a resurrection that that was and what a resurrection this is to be quickened from the dead to be made alive in Christ Jesus by God's quickening power amen now watch he said he was waved to them the word watch how he words it the word which he was waved back to them on the day of Pentecost the word made manifest so now he was waved to them he was waved to them when he raised from the from the dead on Sunday on the first day of the week and now on Pentecost he was waves back right now and as I say it's to be waived again in the last day yes so it was waived it was way back now it's waved again and what's it got to do it's got to be way back right what was waived ingrained for yes must be waived in edible form right and that's what I was talking about I believe it was the week before last when I talked we talked about being red on his table yes said we need to lay in the presence of the sun until we become bread on the stable we become ripe we become mature all the greenness is out of us we get to a place where we can love one another and we can we don't we don't prickle at each other all the time we don't stick each other all the time right we get to a place of maturity where we can have Fellowship one with another why were all the bread we're the bread on this table right right and what do you do when you when you take the Grain and you take it down out of the Sheaf and the Sheaf it abides its little grains but when it comes into bread form it's ground down and pressed together yeah yeah I think that's the age we're living in right in red form the church is ground down and pressed together to be the wave loaf that's way back amen during the 50 days the grain was harvested hauled to the mill and ground up to show that what had what had come out as a wave sheath would come out as bread that just showed that there was something to eat amen there was something that what he promised and what it really was is they were telling God they were saying Lord you made a promise to us and when we come into this land there would be an abundance of food there would be Bread on our table you promised us Lord we would not starve when we come into the land you made certain promises and we're waving the Sheaf to show your promises are true and 50 days later we're going to wave the loaves to show your promises are still true the Sheaf was waived to show his promises were still true the bread was waived to show his promises were still true he was waived to show that The Promise was true the at Pentecost he was waved back to show the promise was true in the end time at the message of the hour he was waived over the people that right right he was waived in discernment he was waived in great meetings coast to coast and that people saw healing meetings he come with healing in his wings he was waived over the people let's be way back are you hearing me now that's us that's not brother Brandon's job now again if you make brother Branham thee wave Chief right then he has to be waived back right if you make him the son of man he has to come back if you make him the wave sheath he has to come back to be the wave loaf right but he don't have to come back because he's a wave chief but just speaking of the wave chief a son of man revealing the son of man because what's coming back is not one man right right but it's a ground up mealed up heated up oh my raised up yeah are you with me now what has now it's become ground up heated up pressed together waved over the people yes in edible form the chief cannot lay on the ground it must be waived before the congregation and I'm here to tell you tonight the bread cannot lay on the ground it must be waived oh my yeah yeah now watch Leviticus 23 20. it tells us how these wave lows were to be waved he says and the priest shall wave them shall wave them with the bread of the first fruit so he went through and he showed and again we're taking a type out of this because there were other things that were waived it was a part of of uh of a goat or an ox or different kinds of things that were sacrificed there but now and he's talking about the lows he said the priest shall wave them with the bread of the first fruits for a wave offering before the Lord with the two lamps now you realize that the Sheaf would not be accepted in its in its form it was in by now it had to be bread because it was a different hour it was a different feast right you can't be in the form it would win down in and be in the form even it came up in but it come down on the day of Pentecost in a different form so now he comes in a different form now he said with the two Lambs they shall be holy to the Lord for the priest and you shall Proclaim on the south same day that it may be a holy convocation unto you so do no servile work therein in other words there won't be any labor done for anybody you're not going to work for your salvation it should be a statute forever in all your dwelling stretches Generations now watch it had to be waived I'm closing I'm warning you I'm about done now look the same priests that waved the sheath waved the loaf yes look here who wants to do it the priest it comes out waves the sheath he comes out 50 days later he waved a loaf what waved Christ what resurrected Christ he said if that same spirit that was in Christ so the spirit that was in him was the if we could say the anointing or the anointed one the priest that was waved him over the people and it was the spirit that fell on the day of Pentecost the Holy Ghost and brother Branham types not only the wave Chief to the word but go look at it as the rising of the Sun and we'll get to it if time permits uh later on in another sermon but he talks about the wave sheep being the Holy Ghost being a type of the Holy Ghost and how could that be because there was actually the anointing that held the word was the priest the anointed one that held the word was the Holy Ghost right the same priests that waved the sheath waved the loaf and we have a priest how many know that tonight the Bible says seeing we have a great high priest let us hold fast our profession that great high priest that has passed into the heavens Jesus the son of God so I will say this tonight church if you can kind of just follow me where we're going let me go through the winnowing let me go to the grindstone let me become bread yes let me go to the baker's oven that's what you're going through in life yeah that's what you're facing in this level of cnh yeah but he wants to pick me up what's going to pick me up that same Spirit right oh my that same quickening power that same high priest it's going to pick me up at the end time he's going to pick me up and wave me before the people he's going to pick you up and wave you before the people here's a young couple that did it right and not only did it right but have the Holy Ghost and and are living according to what God told them to do here's here's a young man who was lost in sin who'd done everything wrong but now he's serving God with all of his heart here's a preacher who's preaching the word of God without changing it here's the Deacon who's doing what he hears a church that's doing what they're supposed to what is it it's the word coming into maturity if they're being picked up and waved not by a program of man not by denominational system yes yes but by the priest by the anointed one he said because I live you live also what is he saying here they are yeah what is brother Brandon trying to tell us in the bride coming of Christ there's got to be another wavy there's got to be another way there's got to be a waving back oh my well here we are resurrected again musicians go ahead and come I warned you I was closing hahaha you listen fast tonight brother Branham after he gets done with it is the rising of the sun he preaches that night does God ever change his mind about his word and he did something that kind of tickled me because I haven't seen it done in a long time but we used to do it back in the hole in his church we just didn't know what we were doing but brother Brandon picks up his handkerchief and he says well it's not a wave chief he said but they took from the body of Paul handkerchiefs and aprons he said so let's wave our handkerchiefs and he gets the people to worship Him and actually pick up their handkerchiefs how many Old-Timers you've probably seen it done back in the old church they'd take your handkerchief when they got real blessed and waved the handkerchiefs and brother Brandon said that was a wave offering oh my that's what God is doing to your life he's picking you up like you pick up the handkerchief and he's waving you over the people and he said here's one he wants the world to notice here's the Bride of Jesus Christ here's one who stood the test here's one who made it here's one who lives for me here's one who has been forgiven of their sins here's The Virtuous sinless bride of Jesus Christ amen do you believe that tonight hey man do you believe you're the wave lows then you've been picked up I won't ask you to pull out your handkerchief because you probably don't have one but if you had one you could wave it tonight you could lift up your hand and say hi I believe I'm the I'm the wave loaf I'm the one that was waved I can be way back I in this hour I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna let him pick me up I'm gonna let him wave me over the people is that your desire tonight Heavenly Father we love you we thank you for or the privilege of preaching your word tonight thank you Lord for this wonderful truth Lord as I was determined not to hold the people at length tonight because it's such a a heavy subject and maybe they'll go home and mull it over and think it over lord I pray that you just reveal it to him or bring it to our minds our remembrance even the things or the parts that we already knew I pray God that you begin to work in our lives make us wave lows they got all the greenness so God may we be read on your table Lord we realize this is not the Feast of of the beginning of the message but this is the Feast of the manifestation Lord then may we make our offering to you if they made a wave offering oh God may we be willing to make our offering to you Lord wave Our Lives Lord take us pick us up in your anointing pick us up by your spirit let us be waved over the people the Lord has it stunned my heart good lately to see Lord some parts of the church that you brought back into position and to see him Lord as they begin to they begin to wave out there in the the world tries to bring them take them back but but they continue to wave and and life is hard but they continue to wave that bread that loaf continues to be waived why because your life is in it I thank you for that Lord I Thank You Lord it doesn't mean good to see that you're still working you're still the same yesterday today and forever may we never forget it Lord may we never lose sight of what we are as we get down into the little details of life and Lord It's hard maybe we struggle at school or we'd struggle at work and we struggle wherever we go oh God may we never forget who we are may we never forget we are the bride we're to be waived by the Holy Spirit over the people I pray you're granted now Lord if there's one here that does not have that quickening power if there's one watching Lord that doesn't have it or that's put it off into another generation or another age they say well there will come a prophet that'll do that help them to remember and to know lord it's their job it's our job Lord to to be that wave loaf to be that that thing that's waved again like it was on the day of Pentecost I pray you granted Lord I pray you'd give us the mechanics and the Dynamics Lord may your spirit Lift us up above the world and wave us before the people Lord as a manifested word of God in our day I pray you granted now we thank you for it in Jesus name amen amen Hallelujah but the Joel sing them your name amen let's Stand Together Lord praises [Music] oh yes for your name is [Music] oh Lord praises to
