he lives this morning amen let's bow our heads together for word of prayer heavenly father we thank you for your many blessings on us today and thankful for your presence here with us especially father we don't know what we would do without you and without you we couldn't make it very far in life i pray god that you would just move in our midst this morning i don't know what to say that would help the people but you do lord and so i ask you father if there's some need that needs to be met that you would just move me in that direction father you're able to direct and to guide and to do the things that only you can do we ask you to come lord and many this morning are streaming the service not able to be here i pray god that you'd move especially for them today and that you'd reach out where they're at and the bill and sister sharon this morning with with back trouble lord that's been chronic for a long time with them i pray god that you would come and that you would heal them today as your word goes forth and different ones lord suffering with coronavirus and different things god we know that you're a healer there's nothing too hard for you and so we ask you to come lord and just touch each and every heart father i pray that you'd move in this building or if there's some where we need to be closer to you i pray you would draw us closer to you father give us a revelation of your word like we've never heard it before not in something novel or new but lord something that would just be recharged in our heart because we can only say what's already been said thank you for all your many blessings to us we ask you to bless this service in this congregation we place them in your hands in jesus name amen amen you may be seated just for a moment before we read the word it's good to be in the house of the lord it's good to have some of you all back with us good to see the magars back there today and and my brother joel is here and and um his family and um my wife had to stay home this morning melody had a little bit of a fever and normally we would disregard that but the times being what they are we wanted to be be careful with that and so they're at home watching this morning my brother sister white camp uh texted me this morning and and they need our prayers their backs are just really bad and they've suffered with that for a while i spoke with or texted several times with brother david this morning and in addition to asking brother joel to sing he's doing much better and yesterday was a little bit of a of a touch and go day in the morning uh early in the morning he had texted me and said that he was very sick and oxygen levels weren't good they were thinking about having to do something additional what they were doing they had him on a full oxygen mast and mask and they were trying to think about doing something additional to that and but during the day i got i began to get people praying i texted and called just about everybody i know to pray and and during the day as we were praying something happened and i believe that he took a turn for the better and it'll all be uphill from here and uh or downhill however you'd prefer that to be he may not be wanting to climb too many hills right now but but we thank the lord for that it could have been much worse but instead it turned for the better better and we thank god i believe it was a miracle we believe god still works miracles you believe that today amen amen and keep praying for sister mary white as well she's um a little bit sick as well and she's at home and and we want to keep her in in our prayers especially missing not being able to be with him they did say brother david will be in the hospital for at least another seven days so we need to remember that family in in our prayers brother gabe's back with us this morning running the sound back at his post of duty and so we appreciate him being here this morning but let's be remembering that family and uh the deacons at the end of the service will have a offering basket back there um for the white family and so if you have something that you want to give to them to help them out during this time of sickness just give that to brother danny at the end of the service and i'm sure that'll be a blessing and then we've got some things coming up uh we're going to have an election to reelect our deacons and trustees and and hopefully add a couple and i'll be talking to you about that but i'll just say for this morning we're going to try to do that on january 17th so if you can be here and those of you that are watching if you can be here try to be here that day and if not i understand that again the times being what they are will we'll make sure that your vote gets counted um we're brother jason demars will be here later this month you may have heard of him he's a minister that's been all over the world and done a great work in the middle east he'll be here on january 24th the lord willing brother ivy's having a watch tonight services this year and i didn't get a chance to tell you earlier but i'm going to try to go and i think but the stewart's going to try to go and so if you get a chance to go over there they'll i think they do that at 8 o'clock on watch night and it's kind of what makes for a long evening but they have a break in the middle so you're sure be welcome to go to that and then brother seth coffey is with us this morning god bless you it's the first time we've met i believe and he's going to speak for us on wednesday night and i've heard that he's a fiery preacher and uh preach the house down so you all be here wednesday night if you can and and i'm sure you'll get a blessing from that amen amen let's stand together i'll remind you of some of these things as we get closer to the date but don't forget the offering at the end of the service for brother david let's turn to job chapter 2 and verse 7. job chapter 2 and verse 7 aren't you glad to be able to be in the house of the lord this morning that's nothing to take for granted is it job chapter 2 and verse 7 it says so went satan forth from the presence of the lord and smote job with sore boils from the soul of his foot unto his crown and he took him a pot sure to scrape himself with all and he sat down among the ashes then said his wife unto him dost thou still retain thine integrity curse god and die he said unto her thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh what shall we receive good at the hand of god shall we not receive evil and all this did not job sin with his lips i'd like to title this this morning the worst year of your life it's kind of a downer isn't it we won't stop there the worst year of your life you may be seated lord that is blessing to the word when i get to heaven i i want to sit down across the table from job and mrs jobe because i believe she made it just my own personal opinion there you can take that for what it's worth i want to talk about life i want to talk to them about what was it like to go through what they went through all of us have been through things but they had a bad year a really bad year i'm sure if we have a memory of the things that that have happened here i don't know that we will in that way but if i'm sure if we do that they will both say that that was the worst year of our lives let's look at what they had to deal with i want to look this morning at job because job didn't do anything to deserve the condition that he found himself in his conduct was absolutely right and there's not a whole lot of men that you could say that about not a whole lot of people today that you could say that about but there was a man job and one there was a man in the land of us and that's actually in northern arabia and and it's interesting as we'll stop there for a minute that all of the afflictions that job suffered would not have been uncommon to that part of the country if you look at what happened the wind and the and the different things that the fire and and the raiders that come through those are all things that would happen but with job they all multiplied they all happened at once and so it was uh it was a time but none of the trials that we have are uncommon to mankind all of them are experienced by someone somewhere else the thing is being a good man being a man who's even trusting in christ and believing god a believer in the message of the hour a believer in the opening of the word you might say a person who who trusts god completely doesn't exclude you from a trial right it doesn't keep you from going through some horrible things you could go through anything anybody else can go through but there's something about the christian you have something to fall back on you may get sick but you have a healer you may have trials but you have a deliverer you may you may go right down to the point of death but you have a god who has overcome death so now all our trials are common to mankind but this man's name was job and it says that man was perfect and upright one that feared god and eschewed evil that perfect and upright is complete as to his mind and heart straight or correct as to his moral department perfect and this doesn't mean he was legally or exactly perfect because we know that jesus christ was the only perfect man but what it means is that and brother branham uh put it this way that that he followed all the commandments of god to the letter that's a pretty good man now but he wasn't maybe legally perfect but but he had a sacrifice that he had made and but his intentions were right his affections his his heart was in the right place he tried to do the right thing at all times and so in his dealings with men he had an unblameable lifestyle he was one who who feared god who who was devoted to god who avoided sin and even the appearance of evil so he was a man who stood before god blameless when it comes to those things and he had the same testimony before god as he did before man in job one and eight it said the lord said unto satan hath thou considered my servant job that there is none like him in the earth all of us like to be nominated for something don't we you imagine when god begins to nominate job for being the most the best man on the earth you don't think that'll make the devil mad you don't think that will make the devil want to attack you when god stands there and begins to brag on you says ha shall consider my servant job there is none like him in the earth a perfect and an upright man one that feareth god and his jewish evil notice his testimony that he had with god was the same testimony that he had with man wasn't different now brother branham said it this way he said god said he's a perfect servant there's none in the earth like him there's nobody like job he's a perfect man he says it like this he said now he's my pride and joy you say it this way job was god's favorite person he's the one he bragged on if god could put it like a man a man with your partiality god doesn't do that but he said he's my pride and joy again brother brown said he said have you considered my servant job he's a perfect man there's nobody in the earth like him god was pleased with that he said oh he just loves to have a servant that he can trust in don't you want that to be your testimony today to be a servant that god can trust because god knows what you're going to do he knows you won't surprise him by any of your conduct and i said lord i want to be one that you can trust today i want to be one that you can trust with your word i want to be one that you can trust with the message of the hour you can trust with the revelation that's been given in this hour and so he loves to have a servant that he can trust in he said there's not another man on earth like him he said he is a perfect man and he said that was before the blood of jesus christ was shed and he said he's a perfect man he's just he's upright there is none like him brother branham tells us as i said that job carried out the commandments of god to the letter and that he was the best man that god had we were given an example of job's conduct before he went through his trial if you go down to job one and two it says they were born unto him seven sons and three daughters and his substance also was seven thousand sheep and three thousand camels five hundred yoke of ox and five hundred she asses in a very great household so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east and his sons went and feasted in their houses every one his day and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them and it was so when the days of their feasting were gone about job sent and sanctified them and rose up early in the morning i love this rose up early in the morning and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all for job said it may be that my sons have sinned and cursed god in their hearts thus did job continually look at the kind of man that he was being a good man brother man said believing in god the only way that he had to come was through the burnt offering he said through the shedding of the blood of the lamb and he had several sons and daughters and when he seen that his sons and daughters he didn't know now him being a man that could afford to buy them things such as young folks would want see that's a double-edged sword the fact that we live in a country we're able to buy things that could be a double-edged sword because there was a reason his children were able to visit each other every day and have feasts there's a reason for that because they had plenty his kids never had to work a day in their life if they didn't want to because job was a rich man but look what it did it made him want to party it made him want to have these feasts and but job being a good man he said now i got to do something about that i got to make sure that they're right with god now he said he didn't know whether they'd sinned or not but he said prayer adventure they might have sinned i'm going to offer a sacrifice for them because that's the only thing i know to do is to present before god the shed blood of the lamb remember his children must have been grown or nearly grown and so he couldn't they were out of his hands there was a real lesson here for parents they were out of his hands he had to be willing to trust god with them but just in case i'm not going to abdicate my responsibility as a parent what am i going to do i'm going to offer a sacrifice i'm going to go before god with them even though they're older even though they're at a place where where they can do their own thing and they can go their own way i'm still going to make sure that my prayer life stays up i'm going to keep praying for them now look he said adventure they might have sinned i don't know what they have but to make sure he said mothers you know i think i've skipped ahead a little bit he said oh if we had more fathers and mothers tonight so interested in their children that would offer the shed blood of the lamb for their child every night at the throne of grace he said we wouldn't have so much carrying on as we have amongst young folks so he said prayer adventure they might have sinned i don't know they have but to make sure he said mothers you know it's a shame today and fathers how uninterested we are in children and the little juveniles he said you let the kids go out just do as they please running out all night long and everything come in seem to be so unconcerned about it he said but there's nothing i can do brother tim timothy pruitt told me a story one time he said he got to an age where he wasn't really serving the lord and he got old enough to drink and his father brother tim told him he said you know he said i can't keep you from drinking if you decide to go down to the bar you can go he said if i promise you this i'll be right beside you he said i'll sit there and pray and that meant a lot to me not just because it was with him although i believed he would do it and timothy told me that he believed he would too but you know there's something to that that that if you just let them go and say well god will take care of them now let me do my part you may go but it's not going to be because i didn't pray it's not going to be because i didn't reach out to god not going to be because i failed to make a sacrifice he said let your girls go out with boys to smoke and drink and go to gambling devices dance all night and come in he said you'd say you're a christians and permit such stuff as that that's not right he said we should take them to the lord and again we say there's nothing we can do but we can take them to the lord there's power in prayer brother david's the witness of that today there's power in prayer amen there's power in the people of god praying there's power in you as a parent praying for your children it says be waiting up for her to come in put your arms around her and say now sweetheart come here let's kneel down and pray mother don't know just where you've been trusting you've been a good girl tonight but prayer adventure that you haven't let's offer the sacrifice of praise to god and give him thanks he said i tell you you'd have a different children today if they did that we'd have more fathers like job see he said the trouble of it is mothers today would go with daughters out in such places and some of them belong to churches too he said that's just a little bit hard but you know that's what does you good he said now so then job said not to make sure that now to make sure of this i'm going to offer the sacrifice of the burnt lamb for each of my children if they have sinned he said that's the only way i can present them is upon the basis of the shed blood that's all we've got that's all we've got we you see each child might say well i've messed up i've i've done things that are wrong all i've got to offer is to shed blood that's all we've got come back to god you say i messed up don't don't leave church so i'll come back when i get better no come back to god now there's a sacrifice for you if you're willing to accept it if you're able to do it there's a blood for you if you're if you're willing to come and put yourself under the auspices of god there's a there's a place for you in the house of god don't quit coming to god we we want to offer a sacrifice for our children now look he said so that's the only way i can present them is upon the basis of the shed blood that's god's only plan of redemption through the lamb so i'm offering him i love this quote listen he said and did you notice when the fires come down and burn up all he had his children was all killed i imagine job thought oh i'm so happy and he wasn't happy that they died we know that because of how he mourned but he thought i i'm so happy because i offered the sacrifice for them oh he felt the loss of his children just as real as any other parent would all of them all 10 of them have won one day you can imagine that kind of a loss and the kind of a day that he had the kind of year that he had he said i'm so happy because i offered the sacrifice for them because i presented them before god through the shed blood of the lamb through god's provided way of redemption for my children they may have not done everything that was right but i offered a sacrifice for them amen are you glad you could still do that today job got in awful condition and it was satan that did it god doesn't bring sickness or those things on people but god allows it we find in job chapter one and verse six now there was a day when the sons of god came to present themselves before the lord and satan came also among them and the lord said to the satan wins cometh down and satan answered the lord and said from going to and fro in the earth and from walking up and down in it the bible says he goes about like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour lord said to the satan has so considered my servant job there's none like him in the earth a perfect and an upright man one that feareth god and it's jewish the evil and if job could talk right now he'd probably say lord why'd you have to brag on me so much but don't you realize the things he said about job he said about you today is the bride you're spotless amen washed in the blood of the lamb go and read what he said about you through a prophet an invisible union of the bride amen you never did it in the first place you've been washed sanctified cleaned up amen washed by the water the bleeding word don't you realize he said you're a perfect people amen you fear god you you stay away from evil you're a perfect people and satan has got gunning for you it's no wonder that he's come after you it's no wonder that he's come after this church it's not a strange thing peter said thinking of strange concerning the fiery trials that you've had to go through it's not strange because the devil's gunning for you why because god bragged on you in this age but he wouldn't have bragged on you unless he knew that you wouldn't give up he wouldn't have bragged on you unless he knew that you wouldn't give in he wouldn't have hey man he wouldn't have bragged on you unless he knew that you were a child of son and daughter of god he wouldn't have bragged on you unless he knew the condition of your heart hallelujah satan answered the lord and said that job fear god for naught has so not made a hedge about him about his house and about all that he has on every side that was blessed the work of his hands and the substances increased in the land listen we ought to thank god every day because like i said these things are normal things that happen cancer is in the land coronavirus all these things are in the land if you have your health today thank god for it if you've overcome thank god for it amen because that's all we can do is overcome because these are this is a condition of this flesh that we're in this flesh never takes a conversion but there's something on the inside he said greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world we believe that today amen now he says he put forth on hand now and touch all that he hath and he will curse thee to thy face and satan's no prophet is he you see satan's words don't have to come to pass are you with me satan's words fail it's a lie the bible says and the father of liars we shouldn't give them so much credibility every time we hear a negative report we we want to repeat it but satan's words fail but god's words are not like satan's then they're not even like yours or mine god's word don't fail amen and so he said put forth your hand touch all that he hath he will curse you to thy face and the lord said unto satan behold all that he hath to send thy power only upon himself but not forth on hand so satan went forth from the presence of the lord and again not only are god's best not immune from trials they're targeted for trials but i want you to notice as well that satan is bound to what god allows him to do he's a creature of permission and you find that a good example of that with the lying spirit in the school of the prophets he come up before god and said and volunteered said i'll be a lying spirit and you get that spirit around church sometimes they always volunteer to tell something tell a lie huh no preachers would get that spirit on them a volunteer to tell a lie and god's children are not to be that way the accuser of the brethren is the devil in case you're we're confused right the accuser of the brethren is the devil that's his job it's already filled you don't need to put in an application for it i don't mean to be harsh but that's the truth we don't need to accuse there is no need for me to accuse my brother no need for you to accuse your brother or your sister why because the devil's already doing that he's already before the throne of god continually day after day he's before the throne of god accusing you but don't you realize don't you realize that everything he says is a lie he's always volunteering to accuse the brother and so discord but even what god allows him to do works to the perfect will of god job loses everything not not in a year at first but in one bad day and you can go read the story but at the end of it in job 1 20. it says then job arose rent his mantle shaved his head and fell down upon the ground and said woe is me now he did some of that later right he did but he just lost everything and his first reaction is to grief and worship so you don't have to be in good shape to worship you don't have to be having the best year of your life you may be having the worst year of your life you may be having the worst day of the worst year of the worst decade but you don't have to be on fire and excited and jubilated to worship but true worship is when everything is wrong and you fall on your face i've lost everything in one day i'm still going to worship god if we'd come to the house of god like that wouldn't our services be different wouldn't our attitude be different if we come to god like that that every day i realize i go through trials i realize there's troubles i realize some of you deal with things i can't imagine how you get through the day some of you have pain and things in your life that i can't even imagine how you deal with it but don't you realize that even that is an opportunity for worship amen and he said naked came out of my mother's womb and naked shall i return thither god loaned me all these things he gave me all these things for a while the lord gave and the lord is taken away blessed be the name of the lord amen the jews it was so wrong for them to curse god that they didn't have a word for it they used a word a play on words and and wrote the word blessed but different punctuation with it where you knew they were it was an irony and because they didn't even want to say that someone cursed god the lord gives and the lord takes away blessed be the name of the lord and all this job sin not nor charged god foolishly there's some time that passes between chapter one and chapter two the jews say it's one whole year because it's at the time when the sons of god present themselves before god and it says in job 21 again there was a day when the sons of god came to present themselves before the lord and satan came also among them to present himself before the lord and the lord said unto satan from whence cometh sound satan answered the lord and said from going to and fro in the earth and from walking up and down in it you can imagine having that conversation if we can put it in our vernacular what you've been doing satan well i've been just around i've been going around the earth a little bit causing a war over here and a little bit of heartache over here trouble over here and sickness over here been just walking to and fro looking around see what i could do and god says well hey when you were down there when you were there did you happen to see my servant job he knew he had and god knew that it burnt the devil up because job had lost everything and the devil told god he'll curse you to his face and all he did was bless god and worship god and that burnt the devil up and so god says hey you've seen job lately he's still in church isn't he he still worships you doesn't he very bad i wonder if god says that about us sometimes they've been through a lot but they still love you don't they amen they can still clap their hands they can still raise their hands they can still worship they can they still read their bible they've been through a lot but they still love me amen amen he said there's none like him in the earth and he says all that he was he said he's still i love this and still amen this is the last sermon now preaching 20 20. let me tell you i think god could say that about us today we've been through 2020 we've seen what the devil can do you say is that the worst the devil can do i don't know i can't promise you the next year will be better we have no promise of that but i do know this if you made it through this year and you still you still serve god you still hold fast your integrity you still believe god you still believe he's a healer you still believe he's a savior let me tell you that's just an indication that no matter what the devil throws at you you're gonna make it all the way it may have been the worst year of your life but you still still worship god you still hold fast your integrity he said although thou movest me against him to destroy him without cause still he continues to hold his testimony and satan answered the lord and said skin for skin you don't give up easy does he yea all that a man hath will he give for his life why does satan say this he just throwing it out there no he knows people and the truth is we care about ourselves now that's just the truth we care how we look we care how we feel there's nothing wrong with that in itself we do care about ourselves we feel our own pain more than others the pain of others and satan knew that he said but put forth on hand now and touch his bone in his flesh and he will curse you to thy face he said make him sick and he won't serve you anymore the lord said unto satan behold he is in thine hand but save his life now i want you to know that there's no indication that job knew that god said save his life right there's no indication of that job doesn't know he's not going to die and you know i don't know some some people have probably never been that sick and i had never been this year was the first time i'd ever been that sick that i had that thought even though i knew it wasn't true but you have that thought i'm gonna die and some of you have been there you think this could take me out i i i might die with this and you get so sick and you know what my blessed heart my dad is going on now but he every time he got sick he wrote out his will and he lay on the couch and and right who was getting what he changed every time it was always a source of amusement to us kids because he just had a cold but then he ended up dying prematurely but but he did that for years and and but you have that thought those thoughts are with you that thought was with job so went satan forth from the presence of the lord and smote job was sore boils from the soul of his foot into his crown now head to toe he's sick in the amplified version that's so satan departed from the presence of the lord and struck job with loathsome boils an agonizingly painful source from the soul of his foot to the crown of his head now i think we tend to underplay the effect of the sickness remember it'd been a year since he lost everything he's still dealing with that but it doesn't really get him until he finds himself sick and he goes and sits on the ashes which is such a poetic picture he sits on the ashes of all the things that have gone wrong around him sits on the ashes of his life if we could put it that way and he's sick from the top of his head to the crown of his feet and he thinks he's going to die now you go and read the book of job job is thinking about death well i tell you what this is a shouting sermon this morning the worst year of your life and the preachers preaching about death but you know what if the lord carries every one of us will die it always stuck with me i read a story a news story about a girl that was in the twin towers on 9 11. and she's standing there and she's on the phone with first responders and they're talking to her kind of trying to keep her calm and at some point she realized she was on a floor that no one was going to get to and the fire was getting hotter and she made this statement she said i'm going to die aren't i and the truth is every one of us are in that condition we just don't know when death is a shadow that follows everyone but see for the christian death is not the end but job doesn't understand the resurrection like we do at that time so he doesn't have a revelation of this and so he's dealing with these thoughts of death now in job seven and one we get a little bit of an insight into job's condition both of his mind and his body he said is there not an appointed time to man upon earth or not his days also like the days of a hireling as a servant earnestly desireth the shadow as a hireling looketh for the reward of his work so am i made to possess months of vanity so it's like you're in quarantine nobody will talk to you nobody be around you right i'm made to possess months of vanity nothing going on where some knights are appointed to me when i lie down i say when shall i arise in the night be gone i'm full of tossings to and fro until the dawning of the day he couldn't sleep he said my flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust my skin is broken and become lowsome my days are swifter than a weaver shuttle and are spent without hope he says later on in job 21 6 he said even when i remember i am afraid i don't even have good memories to dwell on because all i can think of is how i lost my children how i lost all that i had even when i remember i'm afraid and trembling taketh hold my flesh he said i can't take solace in the past modern doctors have studied job's condition over the years most have believed it was a form of leprosy i don't know what it was the bible doesn't tell us but a study recently identified it as something called chronic uremia basically his kidney shut down and that sounds like what it is in this condition job was dying now god knew he wouldn't die because he told satan don't kill him but that don't mean satan didn't try right satan gave him something he could die from but god said he's not going to die he bet job was was dying and i think he probably knew that he was so sick he wanted to die but he was scared to die and i believe that his mental condition contributed to his physical condition and i've looked at this in in kidney disease especially but you look at a lot of different diseases and anxiety and stress actually gives it either causes some diseases or it makes them worse and there i read this article that gold striving stress is linked to kidney function decline in african americans and the idea behind the article is that there are so many of them that can't ever get ahead in life that it causes the prevalence of kidney disease among them because they have this goal and they want to and i know some of you have suffered with that and i'm not saying that's what caused it but this is just food for thought but it's goal striving stress it's it's something that they try to reach for a goal and they're disappointed and the article says this stress related to not achieving one's life's goals was linked with a higher risk for rapid kidney function decline in african americans in an observational study that included 2630 participants from the jackson heart study those reporting high levels of goal striving stress versus low levels we're 60 percent more likely to have a rapid decline in kidney function now we had we've got a lot of medical information in the message of the hour do you ever think about that a lot of it because brother branham diagnoses a lot of illnesses no he wasn't a doctor so in 1951 brother brown says this about that specific condition and again i'm not saying that's what it was but but if it was here's something that could have caused it he said well sister dear he said i want you to accept me now as your brother and as god's servant he said you're suffering for some yes you are suffering with a real nervous condition that's due to a time past of menopause he said also for that you have a kidney trouble that causes a burning in the kidneys that you have that and he says in another another person in the message elijah he said one thing you're all nervous upset about something he said you're suffering with a kidney condition that's in your kidneys that is right isn't it sister he said god bless your heart honey don't worry now there's a prescription huh you went to your doctor and said doctor i'm sick you been going to the hospital i'm sick i can't breathe he writes your prescription said don't worry he said what am i going to do with that well do what it says if he told you go take poison you say here i go if he told you go down put something in you that's going to do more harm than it does good here i go right to the the window get my drugs right and i'm nothing to get upset but listen god said don't worry through his prophet now he said you believe now he said all upset still talking to this woman he said god kidney trouble he said probably what's making her have kidney trouble so i said don't worry because it was the cause of it and brother branham says this just in general about disease he said god don't want you to be frowning god wants you to be happy do we believe that today the human heart was made to be happy worry will cause cancer temper will cause cancer don't never be upset he said brother ben if you always kept that no i have it but let me tell you it'll bring you down if you don't it'll bring you down if you if you have temper all the time if you're angry all the time you gotta let go for you not for that other person you gotta let go of that for you because you're gonna kill yourself and affect people around you you've got to let go of these things because if you hold a grudge you don't affect that person it affects you if you have temper if you have worry they don't affect nothing you don't change a thing how many times have you ever taken a test of some kind a medical test or maybe a a written test of some kind and you worried about it all night the night before what good did the worry do nothing if anything it hurts you i want to look at job's wife for a minute because she gets a little bit of a bad rap but you remember job's wife went through everything job did except for getting sick in his b in her body but we're told that you know satan kept her alive for a reason because god didn't tell him he couldn't touch her but she was a part of job and there's no indication that job ever divorced her or she divorced him we just know they had problems in their marriage because when she should have been his best confidant and his cheerleader you know how your wife is and she'll always tell you my wife always tells me the sermon was good and that's not always true i finally got to where i asked my kids because they'll tell me the truth but your wife is a cheerleader that's part of what she does that's part of who she is and we should be for our wives as well but is why i said in him does that still retain that integrity she said he is in such a bad shape that she's kicked him out on the ash heap she won't even let him stay in the house and said does that still retain that integrity curse god and die the person who was closest to him become an instrument of satan but listen what job says he said unto her thou speakest as one of the foolish woman speaketh what shall we receive good at the hand of god shall we not receive evil and all this did not joke sin with his lips she had seen so much just trying to empathize with job's wife for a moment you say i wouldn't have done that try it sometime well i'd have been like job well i pray that you would i pray that i would but lose 10 kids in one day lose your social status and everything and your husband is sick it looks like he's going to die with a chronic disease and he even smells so bad you can't even have him in the house you can begin to get a little more empathy because she's been through a lot she's seen a lot and the truth is she wasn't called necessarily to go through what job went through god told satan have you considered job he said he didn't say have you considered job and his wife but she was what we might say is collateral damage but she's still job's life sometimes it's hard for us to understand this because we want to make the person bad as well as what they say it's part of what we do especially in politics today we we demonize people right and so if a person says something we want to make that person evil now i i don't want any part in that because personally i've been through that in my life i don't want any part of that just because you may be off a little bit or saying something that's not right there could be a lot of reasons for that you could be out of your head you might come after the service today welcome to me and say brother ben that was the worst job you ever did it wouldn't be out of the question that it was right you might be right about that you might come and say i just can't stand it why are you saying things like that and you know it might hurt me i don't say it wouldn't it might hurt me but i have to consider that it's not you speaking now the truth is sometimes we don't give enough credit to the collateral damage maybe you're going through something you don't realize this is causing damage in your home damaging your life and maybe they aren't anointed in a certain way like you are to deal with that we got to remember that as preachers just us being in the ministry brother allen by the steward but the staff just just being in the ministry causes damage to our families now that's just the truth now we can make that better we can do things that make that better i've had times lately where i've had to put things aside and spend time with my kids spend time with my family because they've had a hard year i can't say this is the worst year of my life a lot of good things have happened to me this year god gave me you wonderful people to preach to and and all the things that have happened we've done good things here at the church and we've held together no one's died praise god for that as far as here that was among us in the local church we've had a wonderful year but remember remember that not everybody experiences life the same way so i have to remember that for them it may not be all that it is for me are you with me now i'm not saying it's not but but stay with me for a moment you've got to consider people that are weaker than you are especially your wife sometimes people are broken joe's life was broken she was done with it doesn't mean she wasn't a child of god it doesn't mean that she wasn't god's she was sure job's wife and he wouldn't be in the kind of man that he was he wouldn't have married someone heathen are you with me she just had it she just wasn't in the category of joe she'd been through it but look how job deals with it he said you speak like a foolish woman he doesn't say you are a foolish woman and i take this brother branham over and over reminds us of that fact and he doesn't elaborate on it but over and over every time he reads this he said he said you speak like a foolish woman he didn't say you are a foolish woman sometimes people are used by satan for god's purpose and sometimes those people are close to us job's three friends are in that category it was they weren't bad people huh they were just being used by the devil to make jobs year worse than it was don't be a tool of the of the enemy today but sometimes people are broken now the sickness of jobs in his manner of grieving and if you if you read the book of job job isn't a good patient right and i think it's it's it's it's hilarious because later in the scripture and i've got it i think later in james he says we consider the patience of job job was patient but he got to a point where he just had to complain he wasn't going to curse god he wasn't going to give up but he just was just about to and he complains a lot and it's hard to live with a complainer that's right my wife knows that says shall we receive good at the hand of god shall we not receive evil and all this did not job sin with his lips he doesn't put her out he doesn't say woman you're not worth nothing to me he says you speak like a foolish woman in job 1907 we know that this had an estrangement caused an estrangement in their marriage because in job 1907 he said my breath is strange to my wife though i entreated her and treated for the children's sake of my own body you know and you know when you bring the children into the argument that it's getting pretty bad for the kid's sake honey love me care for me she said i don't want anything to do with you i'm tired of hearing you moan she may have been a good woman but she just couldn't take it job had to face this alone and some things we have to face alone bruno said joe back under his his great strain he said my everything took away from the devil said let me have him i'll make him curse you to your face and then he broke loose his wife even turned against him set a breath and become strange to him in other words she would have nothing to do with him she didn't seem to love him anymore just pushed him away job you're miserable why don't you just curse god and die he said you talk like a foolish woman oh my again brother brown says then he said don't you take his life and satan had done everything but take his life his children got killed his cattle was killed everything all his risks were lost he lost his health and everything but his life set out there and scraped his boils his wife comes the door and satan got in her and said thou looked out there and said why don't you curse god and die he said you look so miserable he said thou that was speakers like the foolish woman see now he's never said she was foolish said she talked like one i think all of us are guilty of talking like one now and then a foolish woman or a foolish man he said the lord gave and the lord taken away blessed be the name of the lord job never took the part of the devil and accused his wife even though she accused him james 5 11 behold we count them happy which endure he said you have heard of the patience of job maybe some of that's just dealing with his wife brother danny your wife and my wife would never be like that we'd never have to deal with that because they're good godly women but the devil got on this woman caused her to say something it wasn't her it was the devil job had patience now look job had to come to a conclusion i'll bring this down to a close here in a little while give myself plenty of leeway there number one is how could a loving god allow him to suffer such loss he said well this is so uh elementary brother ben why can't you tell us something deeper if you don't get this you won't get nothing you're going to understand all you want to about the seventh seal about the opening of the word and all the things and i love preaching on those things but unless you understand how to deal with loss unless you understand why god doesn't treat you any differently than the world when it comes to that why you can get sick why unless you have an understanding of the of the character of god all this other stuff's not going to get you anywhere we count them happy which endure amen that ought to be us today shouldn't it amen so now job knew so that was the first thing that how could a loving god allow him to suffer such loss when he done everything he was supposed to do and secondly if a man could suffer such loss and tragedy during life if there was no resurrection what good did it do to him and i've dealt with this personally let's think on a big level now i've dealt with this because i've told you before when my dad was dying of cancer and i'm in there and what i wanted to happen at some point you begin to pray god to help him not to suffer because he was suffering so bad and i in my heart i questioned that i said god why does he have to suffer like that i understand him dying i don't know if it's time to go then we'll let go of him lord but why why does he have to suffer like that and the lord spoke to my heart and said if you if he didn't suffer like that you would never appreciate a place where there's no suffering if you'd never seen suffering like that or experienced suffering like that you wouldn't never be able to fully appreciate heaven heaven would seem boring because you've never experienced it but god allows every person to be touched by loss and suffering and tragedy because it helps us to look for a resurrection there's got to be something more than this these there's two scriptures that deal with these questions the first in romans 8 28 he said we know that all things work together for good to them that love god and the way he says it's just so perfect because he said all things work together he didn't say all things were good but all things work together for good amen to them that love god to them where they're called according to his purpose in first corinthians 15 19 when paul says if in this life only we have hope in christ we are of all men most miserable at the end of the day no matter how pretty you make this life and how wonderful and how much faith you have and how much joy and all those things at the end of the day if we only have hope in this life we are more miserable than the person who just says eat drink and be merry but this life isn't it and suffering sometimes makes you realize that there's more to life than just what i experienced yes i can have a happy home yes i can have a a good church that i go to and enjoy the presence of the lord yes i can feel god's presence in my life i know i have joy in my heart but i know there's a better place somewhere i know that beyond the curtain there's a body waiting for me amen thank you lord job knew that god required an atonement we know that because he offered an atonement for his children so he must have offered one for himself that he would accept that god would accept a substitutionary offering and he had absolute confidence in that but there come a time when it had to be more than just putting away your sin but there's got to be something that'll get you to heaven amen and jobs complain if you go and read in the book of job he said if i could find him i'd talk to him i'd have it out with him if i could find him we'd have a case we'd start a court case i'd plead my case if i could talk to him if i could find where he was brother brown said see he held right to what he had now he was a prophet he said i'm not a sinner i have offered the provided sacrifice now who can say that today who's qualified to say that every person who's been born again of the spirit of god every person you say well you don't know what i did if you've been born again you don't go back to those things but you've been born again really born again now look you have a right to say that no matter what the others say were right at the word he said he was right there at the word he was on the word job knew brother brown says in in 1963 job knew he wasn't a sinner he had met exactly every word god required that burnt sacrifice he said that burnt offering was all god asked for god only asked for the burnt offering amen brother branham repeats that you'll find in different places where brother branham says this that god only required to burn offering that's all he required if that's all he required job knew he hadn't sinned you see how simple that is amen and brother brown says god only ask you to believe his word how many believers do we have here today god only asks you to believe his word he didn't ask you to jump through hoops he said believe the word you don't ask all these isms and creeds and everything else he asked for you to believe him he believeth in me amen amen he begins to see there had been an antidote for death oh by something more than just a blood of bulls and goats look at him searching looking wondering is there something beyond death because i hear i see my own death staring me in the face is there something more than this life job 14 7 he said for there is hope of a tree if it be cut down that it will sprout again that the tender branch thereof will not cease though the root there of wax old in the earth and the stock there have die in the ground yet through the sin of water it will bud and bring forth both like a plant remember he didn't have a bible like we do he had to look at nature he looked at it and he said here's this nature that the seed comes up the sin of water but man dieth and wasteth away yay man give us up the ghost and where is he he says the waters fell from the sea and the flood decayeth and dries up so man lies down and riseth not till the heavens be no more they shall not awake don't be raised out of their sleep he said oh that that would has tied me in the grave that would just keep me secret until thy wrath be passed it's only in this time of suffering that he begins to recognize his need for a better life for a life beyond the grave oh that that would have tied me in the grave that thou would have keep me a secret until thy wrath be passed if that was to point me a set time and remember me verse 14 if a man dies shall he live again all the days of my appointed time will i wait till my change come listen to the revelation beginning to come he said thou shalt call and i will answer thee thou would have a desire to the work of thine hands see his loss taught him or something the fact that he missed those things that he had lost those people that he lost he said surely god if you're all-powerful if i've lost these things and i miss them surely if something is lost from the earth a life that you miss that i'm the work of your hands lord oh my it begins to see something job 19 and 18 job he's going through this trial now this is right in the middle of it the worst year of his life he said yeah young children despised me i rose and they spake against me all my inward friends abhorred me they whom i loved are turned against me my bone cleaveth to my skin into my flesh i am escaped with the skin of my teeth what a horrible condition he is in he tells his friends he said have pity upon me have pity upon me oh you my friends for the hand of god hath touched me why do you yet why do you persecute me as god and i'm not satisfied with my flesh or that my words were now written oh that they were printed in the book when did he get this revelation when did he see the vision right in the middle of the suffering he never said i got better and then i saw a redeemer no it's right in the middle of the same chapter where he's talking about how how hard life is for him during that time he said oh that my words were not written know that they were printed in a book that they were graven with an iron pen led in the rock forever for i know that my redeemer liveth you don't see that in prosperity like you do in sickness you don't see that in well in a well body like you do when everything's gone against you and it feels like there's no hope at all and you feel something raising up in you that's when god begins to reveal to you who he is amen he said i know that my redeemer liveth and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth and though after my skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh shall i see god amen remember it was his flesh it was all a bunch of sores encrusted over whatever sickness that it was it had made his flesh so corrupt but he said in my flesh hallelujah it may be i may be losing it may be eaten away by this disease but in my flesh shall i see god amen whom i shall see for myself mine i shall be holding not another though my reigns even my my inward being be consumed within me job wanted answers instead of answering his questions god gave him a vision of a redeemer because knowledge is not an absolute just reading the words doesn't give you an absolute but it's revelation of who he is that gives you a tie post job needed something not to tell him why he went through what he went through not to tell him like we have the hindsight is 20 20 we can look back and see what the inspired writer said about god being in heaven and giving permission to the devil and all those things job probably couldn't see none of that he probably didn't know any of that but he says i know my redeemer lives what did that tell him i know he's my god i know he's my redeemer and if he's my redeemer i'll be able to stand right there with him face to face job wanted answers but god gave him a vision of the redeemer he gave him an absolute and the message in absolute brother branham says christ death wasn't absolute it wasn't absolute it was the end of all fear to them that was scared of death his death is an absolute then but the brown says people fear death even job feared death but when he saw the vision he knew everything was gone his family his children even his wife had turned against him because his stench of his boils listen you may have gone through a hard time in your life but can you see the vision you don't need to get a vision of me you don't need to get a vision of this church you don't need to get a vision of some other church you need to get a vision of christ get a vision of christ the word christ your redeemer you can stay with job i know my redeemer lives i've heard about him but now i see him i have an absolute people fear death he said job feared death but when he saw the vision he knew everything was gone his family his children even his wife had turned against him because the stench of his boils amen he sat out of his house on an ashy scraping his walls and his wife even said why don't you curse god and die to death he said i'll speak it's like a foolish woman see then when elohim talked to him he said some of these days i want to break that name down for you elohim and show you is christ when he had this condition and everything was going against him when he saw the vision of the just one he wanted to find a man who could stand in the breach for him he put his head put his hands on a sinful man of the holy god and stand in the way and god let him see it four thousand years away it was his absolute he raised up and shook himself hallelujah he said when a man is scared of dying raise up and shake yourself amen look into the word see what the vision of god is said he's seen that vision he said i know my redeemer liveth and at the last days he'll stand up on this earth and i am tying myself to it oh don't you know that's what you need to do this morning tie yourself to the vision but i don't know what so-and-so is going to do tie yourself to the vision i don't know if i'll live or die tie yourself to the vision i don't know what's going to happen in the church tie yourself to the vision i don't know what's going to happen what if everybody leaves around the message tie yourself to the vision amen if everybody gives up i'm tied to the vision amen amen when a man is scared of dying raise up and shake yourself look into the word see what the vision of god is he sent that scene that vision he said i know my redeemer lives that the last days he'll stand upon this earth and i'm tying myself to it though the skin worms destroys this body yet in my flesh shall i see god whom i shall see for myself i'm tied to it he said he saw it it was a promise of god i'm closing musicians go ahead and come i've always wondered why job's vision didn't come at the end of the book that's always kind of seemed out of place to me why right in the middle of his complaints does he see a redeemer because you'd think it happened at the end when he right before he got restored you'd like to think that it happened that he saw the redeemer and instantly everything was good his kids he got his kids were giving back to him all his his cattle all of his wealth no that's the end of the story job's only halfway through his trial i can't tell you when the end will be i don't know it could be today maybe like brother david yesterday maybe that'll be the end of the beginning maybe that'll be the time when things turn around for him i trust that it was i believe that it was but look you don't know what tomorrow holds none of us do the healthiest person in here could leave here and die in a car wreck we don't know but we know that our redeemer liveth and in the middle of the book while you're going through the trial when you still don't feel right when you still feel like like life is against you when you still feel like everything's going the wrong way that's the moment when you've got to get a vision of the word and say i know it's one thing for the preacher to know it's one thing for the for the song leader to know it's one thing for the deacons to know but i know i know my redeemer liveth and if i have to stay streaming at home and sick in my body but i know my redeemer liveth if i'm in a hospital i still know my redeemer liveth if i'm at home with my family i still know that my redeemer liveth i know it's a personal revelation to me something that i know myself no one can take that from me jesus disciples got out on a boat left jesus standing on the shore you know the story it went off without him get out in the middle of the sea and john says it this way he says it got dark all our troubles seemed to come in the dark when we can't see our way out it got dark and then the wind grew contrary and the wind started blowing and tossing the ship about it left him on the shore they said oh we wish we could see him we wish we could see we wish we would we could know who he is we wish he was here with us there'd be a toss by the sea all of a sudden they see something walking on the water and what kind of water was he walking on church he wasn't walking on calm water go and read it he was walking on stormy waves maybe they'd see him and he was out there and as he walked they caught a glimpse of him and then he disappeared they kind of what what is it is it a ghost what is it no it's jesus walking in the middle of the storm not waiting for the storm to end but right there in the middle of it they saw a vision of their redeemer amen what did he say brother said what happened just in the hour of their fear just when they were scared they were going to die that's what he did for job just in the hour when he was most afraid by the same that he was going to die what happened just to the hour of their fear a voice came and said fear not it's me amen it's not what he does for us so many times i can't explain to you what your trial is or why you had to go through it or what's going on in your life but i can tell you this if you can catch a vision of the word walking in the middle of the storm amen you can catch a vision that is still there you can catch if you can catch a glimpse of him he can begin to speak to you and say fear not it is i hey man let's bow our heads together maybe you're in the middle of the worst year of your life today if you just play something softly maybe it's the worst year of your life [Music] maybe the worst day of the worst week of the worst year the worst decade of a lifetime [Music] you don't know why that happened and i don't know why that happened it's i don't want to stand up here as a minister and complain this has been a a strange year for preachers [Music] we've seen everything that's went on and struggled to struggle to even get half your congregation in the church at one time and that's not the people's fault it's just the way it happened this year it's hard you want to help people you want to pray for people and i get so frustrated because you're not even able to go and pray but we serve a god he said speak the word he said to him that the centurion said to speak the word only my daughter will be healed my servant will be healed it's been a rough year we're at the end of it but i don't know what next year holds but i know this if you'll look [Music] every time not part of the time because he's the god who never fails every time if you look at the word instead of your circumstances if you look at the word instead of your waves every time don't look at what the people say about you don't look at what the world says but every time if you could catch a glimpse of him through the waves through the coronavirus through the bad news through the heartache through the sickness if you can catch a glimpse of the word walking on the water you can say i know my redeemer lives i'm tying myself to it that's my absolute that's what's going to get me through would you just do that this morning just take a moment catch a glimpse of it you may be worried about what life holds in the future you may not know what next year will be like you may not know what the next hour will be like but i know this that if he takes everything away from me there's something inside of my heart that cries out the lord gives and the lord takes away blessed be the name of the lord though he saves me yet i'll trust him i will not refuse to speak his name but i'll fall down on my face though i'm in mourning though i have rags though i have ashes all fall on my face and i worship him because he's worthy of my praise could you look at him as your redeemer today it's your pericle it is your substitutionary offering job can look at that sacrifice said i know i made a sacrifice for my children i know for myself i know you can see i know he made a sacrifice for me i know that the word came and bled and died was raised again on the third day the death burial and resurrection of christ is my absolute i can tie myself to it heavenly father lord we approach you together lord as a church father we need your peace lord to cover us in every area of our life as we preached wednesday night about peace and it's not just it's not just peace over the whole earth but peace to those you favor oh god we know you said you favored us we didn't claim that for ourselves you said that lord something inside of us reached out there was a seed there oh god may there be peace in our midst lord i pray god that every person here boy girl young old man or woman husbands and wives every person watching today i pray you'd bring peace where they're at they may be hurting but maybe get a glimpse of the word it says i'm the god that heals all your diseases they may have trouble they may be in financial trouble but he said i've never seen the seed of god forsaken never seen him begging bread there may be all kinds of trouble going on but lord there's so many promises in your word if we can just see that you have enforced the word the word is not letter anymore but it's life by your death burial resurrection you enforced it and you come with your redemption claims in this hour to make it real to us through the opening of the word not pray god that you would just reach every one of us where we are tonight help us to see that appear lord through the darkness and the mist show yourself to us lord and we'll tie down to that anchor to that as an absolute god we thank you all that
