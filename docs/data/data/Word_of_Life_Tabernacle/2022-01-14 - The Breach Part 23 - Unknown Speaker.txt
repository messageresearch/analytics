lives this evening amen would you bow your heads with me for a word of prayer heavenly father we thank you for allowing us to be here tonight and we thank you for your word lord that is real to us in an hour of uncertainty in an hour when satan would try to come and make us think lord that we don't know what we're talking about but lord we know your word is always true and we know lord that no matter what happens in the world around us that your word will always be real to our hearts and our lives and i pray that you'd move lord in this service tonight maybe there'd be some needy person

know sister tracy is still not feeling real well but brother paul's here tonight good to see you good to see each and every one of you and and uh we're going to get into the word of god tonight how many love the word amen we love the word we love the word we believe this is the word of god and we believe we have the revealed word light shed on that word by the message of the hour we're going to look into that again tonight matthew chapter 25 and verse 1. i want to speak to you about the wise and foolish virgin but this is not an all in encompassing study tonight we'll have to get back into this at some point i feel like i've got a little bit of a rebound it may be just me you can actually turn these off if you want to i've got the thing in my ear that may help matthew chapter 25 and verse 1 but we won't be able to cover all this tonight so we'll just get a little bit into it as it pertains to the sermon brother branham brought us on the breach it says then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom notice they were all going to meet the bridegroom they were all looking for a rapture we could say it that way and five of them were wise and five were foolish they that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps when the bridegroom tarried or while the bridegroom terry they all slumbered and slept and at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go you out to meet him i believe we've heard that midnight cry for seven then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps and the foolish said unto the wise give us of your oil for our lamps are gone out but the wise answered saying not so lest there be not enough for us and you but go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready i want to be in that group don't you they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut afterward came also the other virgin saying lord lord open to us and he answered and said verily i say unto you i know you not watch therefore for you know not neither the day nor the hour wherein the son of man cometh amen i pray the lord would add his blessing to the word you may be seated we're going to pick up on our study of the breach it's been a few weeks since we've dealt with this but brother branham is dealing with this breach or gap between the church ages and the seals in the book of revelation and he does not yet know when he's preaching this what the mystery behind each individual seal is and that'll be important as we go on here tonight but in paragraph 251 of that sermon brother branham said now in the sevenfold book of seals of redemption that the lamb took within himself was the only one who could do it and he took it from the right hand of him that said upon the throne he said to claim his redemptive to claim his rights to claim for me and you what he redeemed us from two he said see back to everything that adam lost in the garden of eden so we're being restored back further than just to pentecost but back to the garden of eden and that this is important that redemption is already finished he's already redeemed us back right we just haven't gone that gotten back there yet but he has redeemed us back right we're going there he's already done it's a finished work he doesn't have to die again he said now with the lamb with the book in his hands we are ready to ask his grace and mercy upon us to open the seven seal book to us and let us look past the curtain of time just a little bit he said oh my notice when he took the book the title deed sealed he said just get that in your mind now and broke the seals of the mystery to reveal them to bring them to all of his redeemed subjects he said now when we hit this in the seals we're going to go back there and see them souls under the altar crying lord how long how long and here he is as a mediator on the altar just a little longer until there's more has to suffer like you now again when brother branham says this he doesn't yet know that these are the jews and this is a great way if someone comes to you and says well brother branham just repeated a bunch of things he heard well why does he preach it one way before the seal is revealed in a different way after he's not just repeating something he's heard he's receiving revelation from the angel of the lord and that angel brings that breaks that seal to him the day that he preaches it that's very different from the way a theologian or even a pastor would approach the opening of the seals or or revelation of the word we would go and study brother joe and we would we we would feel the pressure of studying but the random did do that but it was up to the lord the lamb opened the book right and gave the mystery of it to the seventh angel here on the earth and so it's very different from the way that i would approach it any other theologian would approach it why he was a prophet that's why we read the things that brother branham said we put them on the screen we don't do that for me right ain't nobody out there collecting my sayings and writing them down put them down maybe if somebody does i mean that's fine but it wouldn't do you a whole lot of good because i'm not a prophet but brother branham was a prophet and he had the the insight of a prophet into these things not only a prophet but the seventh angel that was the one that was to reveal these seals amen now he here he he said he is a mediator on the altar just a little longer until there's more suffer like you he said but now he comes from here at this last seal he's no more mediator he's king now he said what does he do if he's a king he has to have subjects and his subject says them that he is redeemed aren't you glad to be subjects of the king tonight what that means is you're not just american subjects you're not just subjects of of the nation you live in but you're subject of a king and that means that you benefit from being the citizenship of that country amen there's a there's a sermon right there now he says his subject is him that he has redeemed and they cannot come before him until he takes the rights of redemption and now he walks forth from a mediator where death put us in the grave he comes forth with the rights and even those who are alive and remain until it's coming shall not hinder them which are asleep for the trumpet of god shall sound at that last trumpet and i know i'm hurrying through this but we're getting somewhere this this evening he said when the last seal was broken when the seventh angel is giving his message the last trumpet shall sound and the dead in christ shall rise and we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them to meet him in the air he claims he's come forth now to claim his possession again notice he says it as if it's happening right then but once the seals are open we begin to realize it's a process of time and we're living in that process of time today he said watch look at this he said my broke the seals revealed the mysteries revealed them where to the last church age the only one that's living the rest of them is sleeping he said if he comes in the first watch second watch third watch on down to the seventh watch and that's midnight hour the seventh watch in the seventh watch there went out a command or a call behold the bridegroom cometh i'm going to sew down here and we're going to go through this carefully he said and when they did he said the sleeping virgin the nominal churches and there's a lot of of back and forth about who the sleeping virgin are i believe from looking at the message of the hour that brother branham taught that they were the nominal churches or they come from that group i think it would be difficult for us to be foolish virgin because of how much we know right we want to be in the bride i know there's a teaching out there that the foolish virgin has to come from the message of the hour i don't understand that i know that brother branham thought that they come from the nominal churches and i i'll take his word on that now he said you know he said i believe now watch what these nominal churches are doing they're coming and they're saying give us of your oil remember that's what the that's what the sleeping virgin was saying actually the sleeping virgin was all of them they were all asleep but the foolish virgin come and they said give us of your oil we want some we want this holy ghost right now we've been preaching on the holy ghost and this is going to tie right into that now they said you know i believe i'd like to have that holy ghost that's the hour right now he said have you noticed the presbyterians and episcopalians and he goes all the way down i just love the accuracy of the word of god and we'll show you in a minute how accurate it is he said have you noticed the presbyterians and the episcopalians that's the anglican church he said did you hear my message in phoenix to them men who stand up there in the voice that was the businessman's voice which was the paper put out by the full gospel businessman brother demysticarian's group he said well he said what's the matter with this author saying holy father so and so when the bible said call no man father like that he said see they're sleeping with them that's the reason he said but when they come forth and said yeah we believe give us some of that holy ghost boy that's not the hour we live in now i'm going to break from this because brother branham if you go back there he said did you hear my message in phoenix brother branham actually addresses this two nights in a row he's pretty stirred up about it when he preaches uh investments and influence in phoenix in 1962 and he actually said he addresses him directly he says i noticed in your full gospel businessmen he said how you bring in father so and so the presbyterian you bring in father so and so the catholic and all this he said by the way they're not fathers the bible said call no man father on this earth they're ministers he said and i respect them in every respect they can be respected but you're not to call them father he said and you businessmen i hope that editor is here this morning he says what's funny is later on the editor may have actually been there i don't know but he was in one of brother branham's later sermons because brother demas actually actually introduces him to brother branham in one of the later services by name so we actually know the name of the editor but he said i hope that editor is here this morning he said how come you write a declaration on the back of what your creeds are and things like that and be inner denomination he said you better get out of that that's pretty straight warning from a prophet isn't it there's a reason for it again the next night in that was in influence and investments he said what's the matter with you pentecostal people calling these here fellows father he said i see it in your magazine what's the matter with that editor anyhow why i hated the editor a guy squirming in his shoes his seat wherever he's at what's the matter with that editor anyhow thought you were pentecostal get up here and say holy father so and so he said the bible said call no man father like that you got one father that's jesus christ what's the matter he said see what i'm telling you he said the weeds done got you you better cut the thing away right now he said you better listen to what i'm telling you he said you might not want to do it because i'm an ignoramus he said but i'm not as ignorant maybe as you think i am so glad god sent a prophet he said see he said i may be maybe god has to take something ignorant he said see listen to a prophet people say this message isn't accurate i'm going to show you the accuracy of this message as it pertains to this tonight he said i he said by his grace he said i see it coming i see the handwriting on the wall he said straighten up or you're going out and in each of those sermons brother branham goes on to explain about the foolish virgin looking to buy oil now i've got a picture this is actually a screenshot of the full gospel businessman's voice this is actually their latest issue now what was what was the foolish virgin doing they were saying give us of your oil right give us of your oil we want the holy ghost and what the full gospel businessmen were was an organization started by demon shakarian that believed in in the baptism of the holy ghost but they were ecumenical in the sense that they were interdenominational they believed that they wanted to expose the holy ghost to all kinds of different people through businessmen because the preachers all were all divided and things and so that's why there were catholics sitting there brother branham would be preaching it's just an odd thing right you'd have brother branham you'd have a jewish rabbi you'd have a catholic priest you'd have all these because they were all part of this businessmen but what they were was pentecostal and so in their latest issue you can see that they still and i highlighted that there their mission statement is still to help believers to be baptized in the holy spirit that's what they wanted to do and that's what they believe that they got done now this was the precursor or the very beginnings of what we would call the charismatic movement you don't hear as much about it today but it was really big in the 60s 70s and 80s and now now almost all the churches are swallowed up in that and so you don't really call them charismatics anymore although there are still churches that identify like that but they've got all kinds of different names but it's that charismatic movement and it grew out of the pentecostal movement what a charismatic is and forgive me if you're a charismatic here tonight or or if you're watching and you're a charismatic but as far as i can tell what a charismatic is it's a pentecostal with no doctrine right so you believe in the gifts of the spirit you believe in the baptism of the holy ghost but it don't matter if you're oneness or trinity it doesn't matter if you're baptist it doesn't matter if you're catholic it doesn't matter what you are you just say you believe in christ and then you get filled with the spirit and speak in tongues right and that's charismatic so it's no doctrine at all that was useful in its beginnings to brother branham very useful because they didn't come against him as hard as many of the mainline churches did but iran had already been kicked out of many of the mainline churches as far as being a speaker they would never use them at their at their campaigns and things and yet brother randall was able to present this message to people he would have never been able to present it to because of the full gospel businessmen and he had an association with brother demas from 1948 all the way to the very end of his life brother demas was there all through that time you think about that man saw a lot he saw more than anybody else probably outside of maybe brother billy paul did of all the people that were around brother branham he was there that whole time now she demonstration was an interesting man he used his organizational abilities to facilitate evangelistic campaigns in particular working with uh evangelist charles s price and william branham tommy hicks and oral roberts he spent most of his adult life built he was a very wealthy man actually started a dairy and the lord blessed him and he became very wealthy there in california and he spent most of his adult life building the fellowship of this full gospel businessman he also played a key role in working with paul crouch let me know who paul crouch is paul crouch is deceased now paul crouch was the founder of tbn trinity broadcasting network trinity broadcasting network is the best example of what a charismatic church is or charismatic network because that's what they do is they uh they believe in the spirit but there's not much you can hear just about anything on there but as long as the gifts of the spirit that's what they play up the most well demonstration actually helped start that joel osteen how many you've heard of joel osteen god smiles a lot he's the big thing now joel osteen's father was named john osteen the reason john was able to make it as a tent evangelist john osteen was a pentecostal evangelist you couldn't hardly tell that from joel osteen now but john was a pentecostal evangelist and demonstration played a key role in saving his ministry i'm going into this for a reason so just hang with me tonight and and so john was actually removed as a pastor because he believed in pentecost and demus shakarian caught a flight to go see him and convinced him not to quit but to start his own ministry and actually funded the launching of the tent meetings that john so demonstration is directly responsible for joel osteen today because joel osteen just took over his father's church and grew it bigger by having no doctrine right and that's basically how he did it he won't even say if homosexuality is wrong you you can't get anything straight out of him why because that's what they believe we're all god's children we'll all get along you think about this this was the group brother branham was preaching in back then and then to preach some of the things he did makes you think we if he got along with them that well we could get along with one another too you know just on a personal level anyway these guys were against everything he stood for many of them were but yet he got along with him but yet he preached the truth and he could do that because of his gift now democracy and become what he called a facilitator of the holy ghost and the businessmen who attended those meetings were already saved in their denominational church but there were hundreds and thousands of individuals who received the pentecostal infilling of the holy ghost was speaking in tongues and so it introduced this to the people and and i think i put a little piece of this article this is actually from the voice full gospel businessman's voice and yeah and and there was that they introduced the baptism the holy ghost into several areas of fundamental faith where people were not friendly to that type of doctrine or filled with the spirit of god and this is still what is in their newsletter like i said this is the latest issue pray to receive the baptism of the holy spirit they're still saying we want that oil right we want that oil it's been what 50 60 years since brother branham preached this and identified it and they're still saying we want that oil let's get everybody the holy ghost let's have everybody speak in tongues now but they were not friendly that type of doctrine but those kind of people were filled with the spirit of god now and i think i put a little bit of that on the next slide as well uh yeah it says and that's from the from the voice and that's who they were looking for brother branham tells us they didn't get it now think about that they didn't get it look where it led to and we need to watch this because and like i said it's only one part as we're looking at the foolish virgin but you realize there were many people caught up in that movement that maybe we're good people but they're going to be caught up in that and they're going to end up in the tribulation period and look back and say we knew better right we we should have known better and now look where we're at well i don't want to be in that group it's not going to be fun to go through the tribulation period it's not going to be a fun time and they'll have to die the ones that are the true virgins to christ that remain true to the word will have to die during that time but it's our they're they're actually the ones they got what they wanted and brother madam warned them against it and it's actually going to come in a way that it'll force them to take the mark of the beast now look look what it led to about two years after brother branham passed away there was something born called the charismatic catholic movement and it's amazing how quickly it happened there was at that time when brother adam was alive there was no catholic charismatics there was no such thing but in 1967 some students attended a prayer meeting of a charismatic prayer meeting and were filled with the holy ghost and spoke with tongues and so now here i have a picture of pope francis that's actually from a newspaper article from a jesuit newspaper and and that newspaper article that i found on the internet is actually the main the main uh newspaper of the jesuits that's the the order that pope francis belongs to the order of monks or or a priest he belongs to now they said this i want to read you some of that article it says when pope francis joined six thousand people in rome on june 8th for the launch on pentecost eve of a new vatican body to serve the 115 million charismatic catholics around the world now you don't we don't even understand that around here but in different parts of the u.s and especially overseas there are many many charismatic catholics who've received what they call the baptism of the holy ghost spoke in tongues and maintained their catholic faith so they pray to mary in tongues honestly now and it said they made sure to perform his favorite latin american praise song the lord jesus lives and they said this and i put this quote on there i believe it says francis may not pray in tongues the current pope no pope has ever identified as closely with the catholic charismatic renewal nor been so keen to move it front and center in the church the link with the charismatic renewal grew stronger especially between 2006 and 2012 when cardinal at the time he was cardinal bergoglio i don't know if that's exactly how you pronounce that where he attended the gathering of around 7 000 catholics in the evangelicals in argentina and it was among the biggest ecumenical praise meetings at that time anywhere and he was hesitant at first to come up and be prayed over in tongues but he finally allowed the preacher to come and pray over him together with a handful of pentecostal pastors and he was said to have received the baptism of the spirit we have the first pope in history who claims to have been filled with the holy ghost right now just saying you have it is not enough right there's got to be some fruits that follow that right because here you have people laying on hands and and this this cardinal at the time who's now the pope received the baptism of the holy ghost of course in that case he must have spoken tongues because that's how they believe that you receive it now since his election in 2013 he's continued that openness reaching out through the renewal to evangelicals and pentecostals who are quick to recognize in him one of their own now think about that we we know uh we we who know the message it sounds so foreign you think surely they can't actually believe that but they actually count the pope as a person who's been baptized with the holy ghost because of what a prophet warned them against now watch he he has invoked the holy spirit so often and so emphatically constantly emphasizing the new things the spirit is calling forth and the dangers of resisting it through ideology the and the article says he is arguably and i believe i put this on there as well is arguably not history's just history's first jesuit pope but also the first charismatic pope now we heard a few years ago a couple of years ago how that he came in and uh brought this unity with kenneth copeland and you remember this i'm sure there was a video of it they were all praying in tongues and kenneth copeland went there and there's a picture of the pentecostal leaders with pope francis and then on the next slide there's a picture of kenneth copeland praying for the pope and the pope giving a high five to another member and these were actually from kenneth copeland's website they're proud of that they're very proud of the fact that they've been able to make inroads that they have a charismatic pope now just in this last uh couple of years we now have our first catholic charismatic supreme court justice amy coney barrett but it's not limited to catholics you remember what brother branham said about presbyterians presbyterians and then he talked about anglicans presbyterians and anglicans now the church of england now it's not limited to to catholics because the archbishop of canterbury on that next slide the most reverend justin welby says that he prays in tongues every morning well he's got me beat i'll be honest with you hey i have spoken tongues i believe in speaking in tongues i don't pray in tongues every morning the archbishop why is the archbishop of canterbury a charismatic it just this really struck me as i was studying these things why is the pope the current pope a charismatic why is the current archbishop of canterbury a charismatic why do we have a charismatic catholic supreme court justice for the first time in history i believe we're very close to the end we're actually seeing the fruit of what brother branham warned them of back then through that same group and now it's coming out in the head where it's went away from just being a priest you remember there was a priest there when brother branham even spoke in birth pains and and different sermons that he spoke there was a priest there and and he handed him his bible and so forth but now it's not just the the priest but it's the pope himself and it's actually the archbishop of canterbury who says he expects to hear messages and prophecies from god through others he hears the word of knowledge i mean we're talking about people who walk around with gold crosses and pray to mary right and they're speaking in tongues getting words of knowledge why it makes no sense but see it's in this hour and i hope you're staying with me tonight but there's got to come a great falling away in our hour a great falling away and i believe this happens in the church as a whole i do believe there's a parallel even among message people there's got to come a falling away from the truth even even around us many times there's a falling away people fall away from the message or they fall away from the truth of the message but we see it if you look at it in the in the nominal church there's been a great falling away although they call it a great renewal a great pentecostal charismatic renewal and paul says it this way in second thessalonians 2 3 let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there cometh falling away first and that man of sin be revealed the son of perdition who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called god or that is worship so that he has god sitteth in the temple of god showing himself that he is god now you think a few years ago if you went out and preached the pope with antichrist most protestants would have no problem with you at all but you go out now and say the pope the antichrist will be an incarnate pope you'll get almost no support among nominal churches why is that because well if he speaks in tongues he can't be all bad if he wants us all to be friends and all to come together he can't be all bad but see this is where the church oh i'm so glad that there's a ride that cannot be deceived i'm so glad there's a group on the earth today that has been sealed away from these things by the word of the hour i'm so glad there's a prophet that came in and say that told us these things because now here is one who opposes and exalteth about himself above all that is called god and he's worshipped as god he said remember you not when i was yet with you i told you these things and now you know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time he said for the mystery of iniquity doth already work even all the way back there two thousand years ago only he who now led us will it brother brown said that was the holy ghost he who now let us will let or he'll he'll hinder he who now hindereth he's hindering the antichrist from becoming incarnate he who now letteth will let until he be taken out of the way and then shall that wicked be revealed whom the lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming even him whose coming is after the working of satan with all power and signs and lying wonders well he sounds charismatic don't he he's not dead and cold you think about it now i'm going to get to that in a moment we're not deceived the elect will not almost be deceived if you could put it like that the elect can't be deceived but the elect will not almost be deceived by dead and cold that's not even in the running yeah all right if you're dead and cold you just don't have it i hope you're with me now but the the tears in the wheat both receive rain you don't get no rain you're just dried up and dead and some old uh reform a minister some old presbyterian or baptist or something like that and brother branham also mentioned presbyterian right after brother branham's ministry a presbyterian minister by the name of catherine coleman you've heard the name become a faith healer preached faith healing in a charismatic or in a presbyterian church become a leader of the charismatic movement why why did all that happen right after brother branham passed off the scene now notice he said with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish because why because they receive not the love of the truth they might be saved here's a warning for us church they love the miracles and they suffered brother branham because of the miracles they set through but see what we get excited about is not the miracles but the word right we love the miracles and we believe in the miracles but we don't that's not what gets us excited i believe in shouting and speaking in tongues and running the aisles but it's the word that gets us excited not not the miracles because they they put up with brother branham through all these long sermons so that they could see the miracle at the end and they did not receive a love of the truth that they might be saved and for this cause the bible says god shall send them a strong delusion that they should believe a lie that they all might be damned who believe not the truth but had pleasure and unrighteousness listen brother branham says that this way he said all the ages of deceit from the garden of eden all the way down there's never been an age so deceptive as this age false prophets will rise and show signs and wonders if possible to deceive the very elected he said see he said not just he said just the cold formal starchy churches and so forth of man-made theology that wouldn't the elect would never pay no attention to that not even in the running and there's people who try to take us back to that but that's not even in the running we must have the fire of god we must have the baptism of the holy ghost but just because a man's got signs and wonders don't make him right just because a person can make you feel good don't make him right what's he saying what's he got to say what is the word because it's the word that has power in it amen to give us new bodies one of these days aren't you looking forward to that don't you want to be called don't you want to be one of those that he come to claim his subjects be one of his subjects that he's gathering up here at the end that's what he's doing right now he's gathering up his subjects don't you want to be one of those and not one of those who are deceived you aren't we don't go by feelings we go by the word i hope you're with me tonight it's not where i intended to take this but i just want to i just want to kind of cabbage down on a little bit but brother brown said it's up there almost like the real thing just leaving out one word is all you have to do he said promise to the age it's a very great time and christians everywhere take heed to the hour we're living and remember brother branham was not just preaching to the bride he's preaching to those that would become foolish virgin as well go looking for oil he said they won't find it amen they found something but they didn't find the holy ghost they didn't find the true baptism as brother and puts it of the holy ghost right they found an anointing of the holy ghost but not the seal of the holy ghost because if they had they would be bride right so they didn't find it now he says people everywhere christians everywhere take heed to the hour we're living mark down and read and listen close what would god call a people out of this evil age for for his name he said the reason it is is to try her his bride you say oh oh i knew that the bride would be trying but listen what he's trying her for he said when she has made manifest been tried been proven proved to satan hallelujah he don't have to prove to you he don't have to prove to me he don't have to prove to himself he knows who we are hey man i trust that you know who you are tonight but he's got to prove it to satan what's he going to prove amen he said like it was at the beginning so shall it be at the end he said he's going to prove that she will not fall hallelujah amen there was a church that went down there was as i said sunday there was a church that was marching down into hell the church of america amen and it was it was caught up in that economic ecumenical move and even pentecostals and charismatics and all of them together and the pope speaking in tongues and the archbishop of canterbury speaking in tongues all of them headed down but you and i aren't headed down we're headed up why because we heard the truth we received the love of the truth thank you lord amen this is he said like it was at the beginning so shall it be at the end and paul in second thessalonians 2 this way in verse 13 he said but we are bound to give thanks always to god for you brethren beloved of the lord because god hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth do you believe you're chosen today amen then nothing can get in that way hallelujah amen where unto he called you by our gospel he said to the obtaining of the glory of our lord jesus christ brother branham picks that up again in the breach and he said a woman just called up another woman said you know i'm episcopalian again anglican episcopalian is the american version of the anglican church headed up by the archbishop of canterbury prophet was way before his time and from that time till this all these years and now the archbishop himself speaks in tongues every morning and brother brandon speaks about this episcopalian woman said i spoke in tongues the other day i believe i received the holy ghost but don't tell nobody you ever met anybody like that i've had people tell me say well i want to be baptized in private that's not how that works the whole purpose of baptism and it'd be okay if that was the only way you could be baptized it'd be okay god would understand but when you can be baptized in public because the whole purpose of it is a public show show whose side you're on right and that's the reason why you are baptized to let the people know to take sides with christ now look he said they said i i don't tell nobody he said i doubt that very much what a harsh thing to say but this see she hasn't changed who she was still episcopalian don't tell nobody he said you might have spoken tongues i love this but you set a man on fire how's he gonna sit still hallelujah you can't throw enough wet blankets on him and see i don't believe we have to hype everything up and get you all emotional get you all up and going and moving in your pews and i make you stand make you sit and all this stuff i believe if you get on fire you're gonna burn you're gonna burn in church you're going to burn at the supermarket while you're on fire hey man you set a man on fire how's he going to sit still amen that's how john wesley told the methodist people he said that's how you attract people to church he said set the church on fire and people watch it burn amen and he didn't mean literally either amen if there was a fire here at the church the whole town of hardy would come out and watch it burn oh but if there's a holy ghost fire i believe the people will be attracted to that amen amen he said you set a man on fire how is he going to sit still he said that's right he can't do it he said could you imagine peter and james and john and them up in the upper room saying oh we got the holy ghost now but maybe we better just keep still he said brother through windows doors and everything they went out into the street acting like a bunch of drunks he said that's the real holy ghost oh church he said oh we don't have to have that today well brother branham said that's the real holy ghost he's preaching those seals but but we don't put our trust in the emotion of it but that's what it causes you understand that's what it causes we don't put our trust in the emotion of it but that's what it costs he said brother he said he said act like a bunch of drugs that's the real holy ghost but you see he said that sleeping virgin ain't receiving nothing anyhow i feel bad for them they sit there and you can tell that during some of the services they're real quiet they're just waiting brother branham please pray for the sick and missed god calling his bride oh hope we don't miss it today i believe we won't i believe we're the bride right i believe that for all of you but but we don't want to miss it we don't want to miss the through all the fanfare and everything else it's nice to have a good piano and a couple of good piano players or three or four it's nice to have a good organ player and a good organ it's nice to have a good set of drums but that's not where the holy ghost is that's not what makes it come because everybody and their brother's got a good organization if you go out here in a pentecostal churches everybody's got one but what is the difference in what we are and what is out there in the world it's the word the rain falls on the just and the unjust and i'm happy for the rain but it's the word that makes a difference in our lives hey man the sleeping virgin ain't receiving nothing because they didn't they didn't get it they went looking they went to buy amen he said remember he said while they went to try to buy oil remember the scripture doesn't say they got it while they were out trying to buy it how much more can you get it went from in his day just a few seeking it until now it's the very archbishop of canterbury the pope of rome speaking in tongues where are we at while they were out trying to buy it there come a sound what happened all those virgins that slept rose and trimmed their lamps and amen this lamp trimming time went into the supper he said is that right he said and the rest was left for the tribulation period he said right weeping wailing and gnashing of teeth he said that's the church not the bride the church the bride went in amen there's a whole day amen don't you see what he's doing while they went to buy oil we're going in what are we going into and we could preach a whole sermon on this but what was that shout it was the mystery of the seventh seal under the seventh still mystery the mystery of going that he's calling for his subjects you understand the rapture didn't just isn't just an event that's in the future but it's something you're a part of right now hey man you're already walking in can you see yourself there you heard the midnight crying you've got the oil you've trimmed your lamps and you're walking in at the oh my at the same time that the archbishop of canterbury is speaking in tongues at the same time that the pope of rome is speaking in tongues becoming charismatic at that same hour i hope you could hear it today the way that he reveals it to me not as a prophet but just an inspiration of the word i just got to looking at this stuff and i thought oh god can we see the hour that we're living in it's in that hour when she went to buy oil we're seeing the very end of it right now we have our lamps trimmed we got oil in our lamps we're walking in hallelujah sealed away under the mystery of going under the mystery and the opening of the word sealed away and everybody's looking around saying well nothing going on let's go back to 40 years ago no you're going right in where you're supposed to be there's a whole difference he says between the church and the bride i'm so glad there is he said went into the wedding supper he said oh no this boy he clapped his hands together he said the seals was broke why in the last church age to reveal these truths why the lamb broke the seals and revealed them to his church in order i love this in order to collect this word collected me i wasn't collected by music i wasn't collected i love it but i wasn't collected by it i wasn't collected by a pastor somewhere i was collected by the word spoken through a prophet amen that's why we come together we were collected by the word of malachi 4. that's why a pro a pastor may come and go a person might come and go you might see this one rising that one fall but it doesn't bother you you were collected by the king amen the word he sent out his shout and it collected you for his kingdom his bride made a difference between you and the foolish virgin don't you see the foolish virgin was not identified as foolish until the shout came out think about it they didn't even know they were foolish until the shot went out and it identified they did not have the holy ghost they went looking for it oh my he said what is it oh my he wants to bring his subjects to him now what is it out of the dust of the earth out of the bottom of the sea out of the pits out of everywhere well not just us church but all of his bride amen let's die down to the ages out of the regions of the dark out of paradise wherever they may be he'll call and they'll answer that's our hope in this hour you think of your loved ones those that have went on they walked into that mystery of the opening of the word and they went on and you look and say well maybe they didn't understand it all like i do but they went on and they're laying there and when we go in amen when we walk in they raise two he collects them too oh my i'm almost done maybe it don't matter to you i pray that it would maybe it doesn't stir your soul i pray that it would that there would be a fire amen that would be on the inside where no one can put it out what is out of the dust of the earth out of the regions of the dark out of paradise wherever they may be he'll call and they'll answer amen he come to get his subjects how did he do it how does he collect his subjects he revealed his secrets and they saw it hallelujah brother andrew glover stood up here here not long ago and he made the statement he said once you see the opening of the word you can't unsee it once you see why a prophet came and what he came you can't unsee it and so what is it he collected his subjects he revealed his secrets and they saw it oh he couldn't get much more clear than that and time is no more at that time do you know what that means for you means you can't be deceived there's no more time for the devil to deceive you anymore for you time is no more there's no more delay you're there you realize when you receive the word amen you receive the word and the baptism of the holy ghost the true baptism of the holy ghost comes in your life because that's the only way you can see the word is when you receive the true baptism of the holy ghost and when you receive it and you begin to see the word he claims his subject and when he has claimed you you can't be unclaimed you can't be lost time is no more at that time time has run out it's finished hallelujah the world may go on i don't know they may go on 20 more years i don't see how but they could go on 100 more years but you've been collected right people don't when the trash man comes down our street on wednesday morning musicians go ahead and come trash man comes to collect the trash what does he do he goes from house to house and he finds the trash that's been set out that's ready if ours is still in the ditch he don't go down and get it we prove that he only collects what's ready you don't collect nothing that's not in the bin what does he do he collects the bin grabs hold of the bin and he dumps it in he collected but oh god oh my the king came in this hour that's why there was he put his face in the clouds it wasn't just to identify a prophet but he had to identify a prophet to identify himself the king put his face in the cloud why was it it wasn't he said well you well it was just that or the other but it was his face up there why was that why did he do that because the king came to collect his subjects it's time you that are in the bin you that are ready got your lamps trimmed and burning it's going home time time has run out it won't be very much longer amen one of these mornings for the danny people we have known i was talking to brother timothy pritt today and he said there's been so many that have died so many have gone on so many that we knew i'm sure for some of you that are older many more that you knew than what i knew but so many have gone on over the last couple of years but it won't be much longer yeah you see where we're at you'd be walking one day and you just see them come in the door it'll be just like another day they'll just come in the door of the office where you're at they'll walk in the door of the church maybe if you're there they'll come in wherever you're at if you're sleeping they may come in and hit shake you on the shoulder wake up you're going to see them i hope you hear me today you're going to see them and when you see them you're going to say it's going to be so natural to you you'll say that's what i believed there's what i stood for i've already been collected it won't seem strange because you're already there you've already in your soul you've already been sealed away oh don't let the trials of life get in your way don't let that now it's the time to worship god like never before don't let the the troubles and the trials and the worries get in the way get in between you and worshiping god listen the handwriting is on the wall of babylon that's what brother branham said tongues were go read the church age book the smyrna and church age the laodicean church but the random covers it over and over he said the tongues was not a sign of god's blessing he said it was a sign that the handwriting was on the wall and now the pope's speaking in tongues how much bigger handwriting could we get archbishop of canterbury speaking in tongues every morning it's time to go home amen look up your redemption draweth nigh amen heavenly father we love you tonight we thank you lord for the mystery of going thank you for the things that the prophet told us in this hour lord i pray that i didn't venture without authority but some of these things just struck my heart i pray god that you let that which lord is your truth and i believe that it is lord i pray that it would sink down into our hearts may we just get a realization sometimes when we have trouble and trials we just need to hear the voice of the message of the hour speak directly to us not a man's voice but the voice of christ speaking directly to our hearts you've made it you've heard the shout you've got your oil in the lamps there's nothing to hinder you from going in going all the way when that time comes i pray lord that you'd help us give us faith and courage lord to overcome every enemy at the end time let us not be deceived lord may we be that bride that won't fall that preordained predestinated not to fall we thank you
