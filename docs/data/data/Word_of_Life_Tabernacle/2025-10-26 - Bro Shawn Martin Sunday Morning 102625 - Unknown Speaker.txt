Brother Robert, if you don't mind, change it to He's God. He's God. When I come into his presence, when I come into his presence, can we stand together? I humble myself. I lift up both my hands and I begin to worship him. Oh, I worship him when I come into his presence. I humble myself, remembering what he's done. &gt;&gt; All the victory he's won. So I'll praise him. [Music] Oh yes, I'll praise him for all he's done for me. He has redeemed and he set me free and become. Oh, just become [Music] God. Oh, when I come to his presence, I humble myself. I lift up both my hands and I begin to worship him. Can you worship him now? Oh, I worship him. When I come into his praise, I humble myself. Remember, oh, somebody ought to think about what he's done for you this morning. &gt;&gt; Oh, can we praise him now? So, I'll praise him. Oh, let's praise him, church. Oh, yes. I'll praise him for all he's done for me. He has redeemed and he set me free. [Applause] [Music] And because Oh, just because he's not. Sing it again. When I come into his presence, oh when I come into his presence, I humble myself. I lift up. &gt;&gt; I wonder if somebody could just give him praise in the building this morning. again to worship him. Oh yes we do. Oh yes I worship him when I come into his presence. I humble myself remembering what he's done. All the victories he's won. So I'll praise you. Oh yes I will. Oh yes I'll praise. Oh sing it now. Oh all he's done for me. Oh, he has redeemed and he set me free. And because Oh, just because he's God. Sing with all your hearts now. For all he's done. Oh, for all he's done for me. He has redeemed and set me free and because. Oh, just because he's God. Can somebody praise the Lord this morning? I wonder if you can give him a hand clap of praise and just let him know how much you love him. Has he done something for you? If he's done something for you, we ought to be the happiest people on the face of the earth. You know, the angels can't sing that song because they've never been redeemed. But you can sing because you've been so I'll tell you what, you've been so low, but he reached down his hand for you. Aren't you thankful that he did it? If you're redeemed this morning, I wonder if you could put a hand up to him and say, "Thank you, Lord, for redeeming me." I wonder if we can sing that one more time. Amen. As we turn it to our pastor. Amen. Aren't you glad he's done something for you this morning? When you think about what he's done, how can you keep quiet? &gt;&gt; It's like fire shut up in our bones. Why? Because we've been redeemed by the blood of the lamb. And we're so thankful that we can worship this morning. I want to just hear you with all your hearts now as we sing that chorus again. Oh, for all he's done for me. Sing it like you mean it now. He's redeemed and he set me free. And because Oh, just because he's one more time with your hands up to him now. Oh, for all he's done for me. me and set me free. Oh, and because Oh, just because he's God. Oh, do you believe he's God this morning? Give him another hand clap of praise. Oh, thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. We're going to have brother Sean come and deliver the word this morning. Been looking forward to this weekend. And just believing as we relax this morning and hear the word and back the word that every need that we have will just be met. And we've seen God use Brother Shawn Martin before to to help the church to build up our faith and and we know that he's he's got a calling and gift to preach and able to help the body. And then we believe we're the elected children of God, &gt;&gt; sons and daughters of the king. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Then why would we stop short of anything but whatever the fullness is of what he wants us to be and what he wants us to have. Why don't you just press through that today? And if you're sick in your body, there's healing here for you. If you're worried and weary in your mind, there's peace for you this morning. And if you're struggling with something, there's clarity in your life. And I believe the word can do that today. So, we'll turn it to brother Sean from V from Virginia. So glad to have him and his family with us. Brother Judah, if you want to go ahead and and uh set his mic for him to this morning and he's going to preach and maybe sing for us as well, but we just believe the Lord will will have his way in the service this morning. Amen. Let's sing Amazing Grace as brother Sean comes this morning. Aren't you glad for grace? It was amazing grace. How sweet the sound. Oh that say. Why don't you lift your hands to him and tell him about it this morning like me. Oh, I once was but now Oh, praise God. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Oh, praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. One more time. It's amazing grace. It's amazing. Aren't you glad for the grace of God this morning? [Music] Oh, that saves a wrench like me. Oh, I once was lost, but now I'm found. I was blind, but now I see. Amen. Well, we're so thankful for the grace of God. Amen. And men have tried to write songs, done their best to describe. Amen. What grace really means. Great sermons have been preached. Amen. But the human dialect just no language can ever describe truly what the grace of God is to us. Amen. But I'm certainly glad to know that it's touched my life and uh because when we get on the other side, all we can say is just by grace, &gt;&gt; God's amazing grace. Can you say amen? Do you love the Lord? &gt;&gt; Well, it's good to be here in the house of the Lord. I don't think I'm going to sing. Um my brother's the singers, so we'll leave that to them. And u uh but we really just count it an honor uh to be here this morning and to u uh minister the gospel to you and appreciate u your pastor giving us the invitation. really enjoyed it yesterday and uh the food was great and uh my goodness, I uh gained a pound or two just from yesterday. But um uh uh we really had a good time of fellowship and really appreciate the hospitality um there that your pastor and um his wife has shown us. Amen. and good to have my children uh here uh with me and my wife couldn't make it. Uh she really was she was planning on it and uh my daughter is about to have her first baby and uh so she u I think was wanting mama to hang out there with her and so um um mom's back home. But anyway, we're here. So u you got us. Amen. But uh if you have your Bibles, we're going to turn to the book of Deuteronomy or read uh a few scriptures, but Deuteronomy the 29th chapter and then we'll turn to 1 Corinthians 2. Amen. But before we go into the word, may we just bow our hearts and talk to the Lord. Amen. We certainly need him, don't we? &gt;&gt; Amen. Father, Lord, we're certainly thankful for your grace and your touch upon our lives. &gt;&gt; Father, we realize it's an eternal touch and that we'll never be the same again. And father, we're just asking Lord that you would come in your special way here this morning. You know the needs that are present, Father. &gt;&gt; And maybe Lord, you know what we will face next week or in the future. But Father, we're just asking that you would come and that you would touch this morning. &gt;&gt; Father, we're unworthy of you, Lord. But Father, if you would just come and anoint the gift that you placed within me, anoint your people. &gt;&gt; And I pray, Father, that you would bless the pastor here, Brother Ben, and bless the congregation, Lord, as Father, they're pressing the battle here in Hardy, Lord, and making ready for your soon coming. And father may just what words we would have to say would be edifying to the church here. We ask it father in Jesus Christ's name. And the church says &gt;&gt; amen and amen. So we we look at Deuteronomy the 29th chapter and I'm just going to read the 29th verse here but it says the secret things. Everybody say the secret things. belong unto the Lord our God. But those things which are revealed belong to us and to our children forever, that we may do all the words of this law. Amen. Then if you'll turn first Corinthians uh 2. Amen. 1 Corinthians 2 and um we'll start at the the ninth verse. But it says, "But God hath revealed them unto us by his spirit." We could go uh maybe start at the ninth verse. But as it is written, I hath not seen nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man the things, everybody say, the things &gt;&gt; which God hath prepared for them that love him. But God hath revealed them unto us by his spirit. For the Spirit searchth all things, yay, the deep things of God. For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of a man which is in him? Even so, the things of God knoweth no man, but the spirit of God. Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God, that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God. Then if you'll go one more, uh second Corinthians the 4th chapter. Amen. I believe it's the um 2 Corinthians the 4th chapter and we'll start at the 17th verse. But it says, "For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, workketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory. While we look not at the things which are seen, &gt;&gt; thank you, Lord." &gt;&gt; But at the things which are not seen. For those things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we're not looking at the things that are seen. We're looking at the things that are revealed. &gt;&gt; Amen. For they are eternal. You can have your seats this morning. And uh if I were to have a title, it would be uh we look at what is unseen. Amen. And um you know we're we're living in an age uh where there's so much negativity. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And everything is so negative. And uh uh you know I I've tried to encourage my children is if you go get a job, don't be negative about that job. You know, you're the one that went there. You're the one that asked to get hired. So don't run the job down just because you know the boss of sneeze is wrong or something, you know. But there's there's just so much negativity today and and it's it's not just negative about uh one another, but people are negative even about their themselves. and and they have uh we we have people you know people have complexes &gt;&gt; uh you know and and it's easy to have a complex about yourself. It's easy to have a complex about the church or about whatever. But uh uh you know negative thinking and speaking negative words and uh uh actions become negative and and it's easy it's easy to be uh negative uh when we're looking at the negative. Amen. And and there is plenty of negative, amen, to to to look at. Amen. Uh you can look at your wife and see negative. You can look at your husband and see negative. Children can look at the parents and see negative. And and we can bring it into the church. You can look at your pastor and see negative. And he could look at the congregation and see negative. And and everybody's looking at the negative. and and before you know it, we're preaching negative, singing negative, talking negative, thinking negative. Everybody's just negative, you know, and uh so that's just the way it is. But God does not want us looking at the negative. &gt;&gt; Amen. He he does it. And and so uh when we become Christians, uh we're not to be negative people. Amen. We're not to carry them traits of of negativity because the prophet tells us that Christianity has no negativity at all. There is no negativity in Christianity. Amen. So that tells us that we're not of the world. The world is negative, but we're not. Not as Christians. Amen. Because we we are Christians and there's no negativity in Christianity. Now, the Bible tells us that we are hes. Amen. Which means that we have an inheritance. Aren't you glad you're an heir of God? Amen. And and we have an inheritance. And uh uh so an an inheritance is something that is given and and the heir is what receives uh uh that that inheritance. So like in Galatians 3:18 just breaking in Paul says now if the inheritance be of the law it is no more of promise. &gt;&gt; Amen. So it's telling us now that the inheritance that we have been given is not of the law. It's not of dos and don'ts. Amen. It it it's not uh it's not a conditional thing, but it's been given to us by a promise. Can you say amen? See, so God gave it the inheritance to Abraham by promise. Ain't that right? So there is a group of people that God gave his promises to. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? His promises is the inheritance. Amen. uh uh is our inheritance. Amen. Not negativity, not not nothing like that, but God's promises. Now, so Paul is saying that God gave Abraham the inheritance by promise. But now in Galatians 3:16, it says, "Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made." Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. How many believe you're seed of Abraham? See, so it's not just uh the promises given in history. Amen. To a man called Abraham, but now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. Amen. Seed. And so then we find that that the seed if if you if you just study what Paul uh says there in in Romans and in Galatians and uh BUT HE SAYS THE PROMISES WERE MADE TO Abraham and his seed which is Christ. &gt;&gt; Now you just bear with me now. And the prophet says now notice it was one one was the seed singular. He said there's more than one promise and there's more than one person that's in included in the seed of Abraham. He says see there's one seed but many people of this seed. They were not just to Abraham alone or to Isaac alone. IT WAS TO ALL the seed of Abraham. THE PROMISES WAS MADE to each and every individual seed of that seed. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So Galatians 3:29, it says, "If you be Christ, then you are Abraham's seed." Ain't that right? So then, Brother Brandham would call the seed of Abraham the seed of promise, not of the law, but the seed of promise. Now, if we're if we're Abraham's seed, then we we automatically know. Now, you may have a little bit of Jewish blood. I I don't think I do, but but we're we're not seed of Abraham by a natural lineage. It it's not a natural thing that makes us seed of Abraham, but we are seed of promise. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen. The seed of promise. Now, so we we find that even though we're not uh uh of the natural lineage of of Abraham, yet Paul would talk to us as the church in Hebrews 6 and 12. And he says, "Be followers of them." Everybody say, "Be followers." BE FOLLOWERS OF THEM. AMEN. Who through faith and patience inherit the promises. Now, that doesn't mean to be be uh uh followers of a Jewish nation. AMEN. WE'RE NOT FOLLOWERS OF A NATURAL LINEAGE. But actually, the Bible the Bible uh puts a uh in the Old Testament, he he uh God would put people in there just for us who were heirs of the promise. that was not even of a lineage of of the natural lineage. And and that was Rahab the harlot. If you look at Rahab the harlot, see, she is one of those who who WHO THROUGH FAITH AND patience inherited the promise. AND PAUL IS TELLING US GENTILES who are not of the lineage of the Jewish Jewish lineage, the natural seed of Abraham. and and and he's telling us to to follow them who through faith and patience. Now, Rahab the harlot, she she was a gentile. She was a prostitute, a heathen. She was not in the lineage of Abraham. She had no rights to the covenant of Abraham. She had no rights to the blessings of God. She was not considered as one of God's chosen people. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? She was of another PEOPLE. SHE WAS OF ANOTHER NATION. ISRAEL WAS THE CHOSEN nation of God. Amen. See, and so actually Rahab, she was of the lineage of a PEOPLE THAT GOD TOLD JOSHUA TO DESTROY. SO, HERE IS A A a a chosen nation of God coming across that Jordan River TO DESTROY THE CITY OF Jericho and to destroy ALL THEM PEOPLE. FOR THEY were considered the enemy of God. And Raab WAS OF THAT PEOPLE. Raab was of that nation. Can you say amen? Amen. But see, GOD KNEW HER BEFORE THE FOUNDATION of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and so we find that that Rahab, she got in touch with these spies and the two spies that Joshua had sent over. Amen. To spy off the land and and and she um uh she hid them. She took care of them. She made a way for them to escape. But she she told them before she left. They left says, "We we fear you." Amen. We know you're coming and and we shake because of you. NATIONS SHAKE AND AND THEY FEAR because of you. Now, I'm going to ask you something. I want mercy. Amen. I I WANT MERCY UPON MY LIFE. YOU YOU YOU GOT A PROMISE ME. CAN YOU SAY AMEN? AND GOD GAVE HER A PROMISE OUTSIDE THAT COVENANT AND SAID, "IF YOU'LL HOLD THIS STRING," AMEN. OUT THE WINDOW, WHICH WAS A TOKEN, AMEN, when we come, Amen. then then you'll be safe. And she says, "Oh, but I I I don't only want me. I want my family saved." And and they said, "IF YOU CAN GET YOUR FAMILY UNDER THIS TOKEN IN THIS PLACE, they'll be spared." Can you say amen? See, and she became an heir to the promises because she married in a to Israel, the nation of Israel. Amen. We find also, Amen. It was through her line. Amen. That Christ came. Ain't that right? Amen. But then we find that her greatgrandson, Amen. Rahab the harlot's greatgrandson Boaz, Amen, married another little girl, Amen. Well, she had no rights, amen, to Israel. She was not an uh uh of the covenant of Abraham. She wasn't a part of Israel. Actually, she came from a she was a gentile, the prophet said. And she came out of a a nation of incest. Amen. The nation of Moab was born out of incest, which was an evil thing before God. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. See, and so, uh, we find that she had NO COVENANT WITH GOD. SHE WAS NOT PART of the Abrahamic covenant. She had no inheritance with the Jew. her mother-in-law Naomi, right? See, she was the one, the prophet said, who had the inheritance. Amen. Naomi had left the, if you know the story. Amen. Naomi had and her husband had left. Amen. Uh, Israel and went into the uh the lands of the Moabites, I believe. And and uh there, Brother Bram said, the moment they done that, they backslid. Amen. But they left because there was drought in Israel. And and years later uh uh uh God had visited Israel and there was plenteous and so Naomi returned and and and came back to Israel. Now uh Ruth said, "You know what? Uh uh my husband's dead and I'm going to follow you." And and Orpha says, "Well, I'm going to go too." And and the elmy discouraged them both. Says, "No, you you you go back." And Orpha did. She kissed her mother-in-law and and went back. But Ruth says, "No, your people's going to be MY PEOPLE. YOUR GOD'S GOING TO BE MY GOD." AMEN. YOUR your nation is my nation. EVERYTHING THAT YOU ARE, I'M GOING to be. Amen. And she went with Naomi. Amen. And she saw Boaz. Now, Naomi represented uh Israel. The prophet said she lost her first estate and all of her goods had been sold at a public auction. She had been exccommunicated and and had gone away. But when when the elmy came back to her homeland, amen, we find that that she just couldn't come up to to what she had lost. Amen. It had to be redeemed &gt;&gt; unto her. Amen. It had to be redeemed. Well, according to the law of redemption, there had to be a kinsman redeemer. &gt;&gt; Amen. She just couldn't come up there and say, "It's mine." There had to be a kinsman redeemer. Amen. And the price had to be paid. Amen. And so there was a Boaz. Amen. He saw Ruth. Amen. And he loved Ruth and he thought, "MAN, HOW AM I GOING TO GET HER?" WELL, HE COULDN'T GET HER without redeeming uh uh Naomi because uh uh uh Ruth was a part of the the estate of Naomi. Can you say amen? That's what a prophet said. Said Ruth was part of the estate. So he realized if I redeemed Nelie and and I redeemed her estate, I'm going to get Ruth. WELL, THAT'S WHAT JESUS DONE. HE BECAME a redeemer. and he redeemed Israel. But when he REDEEMED ISRAEL, HE GOT A GENTILE BRIDE. AND THAT'S WHERE WE come in. CAN YOU SAY AMEN? SEE, and so we find, Amen. Uh uh uh Ruth became heir to the promise. Amen. And through her lineage came Christ. Amen. See, and so we find Peter 1 Peter 2:9 says, "But you are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood and holy nation, a peculiar people." Ain't that right? That you should show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light, which in time PAST WERE NOT A PEOPLE, but now are the PEOPLE OF GOD. WHICH HAD NOT OBTAINED MERCY, BUT NOW HAS &gt;&gt; OBTAINED MERCY. &gt;&gt; SO THROUGH FAITH and patience, be followers of them who through faith and patience INHERIT THE PROMISE OF GOD. SO NOT EVERYBODY, AMEN, inherited through the generation OR THROUGH THAT LINEAGE OF THE NATURAL SEED. BUT THERE WAS SOME PEOPLE THAT GOD JUST SIMPLY SHOWED GRACE TO AND they became heir of the promise. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Now, Paul's talking to us. Now, there's been a redemption claim or made Christ our Boaz, amen, fell in love with us. And and now Paul is talking to this bride, us, and he says, "In Christ, we also have obtained an inheritance." &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad you've obtained an inheritance? &gt;&gt; Amen. You're not just church members here. &gt;&gt; Oh, good grief. You're not JUST HERE LEARNING ABOUT DR. DOBSON OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. NO, there's been an inheritance given to you. And we've obtained this inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who workketh all things after the counsel of his own will. Now, Brother Brandham says this, "We've obtained an inheritance." Somebody has to leave you something. So, God before the foundation of the world left you something, a name written on the book &gt;&gt; THAT WHEN THE LAMB would be slain, you would be recognized with it. &gt;&gt; Are aren't you glad for that? The lamb was just wasn't slain just for everybody. Amen. But for those names written ON THAT LAMB'S BOOK OF LIFE, the lamb was slain for them. &gt;&gt; Now, another place, the prophet says, "I have an inheritance, an inheritance of eternal life." Now, God sent Jesus to make that inheritance real to me because there was nothing I could do to inherit it. See, it was blank. It was valid. There's nothing I can do. But in the fullness of time, God sent in his own good time Jesus, the lamb slain from the foundation of the world. His blood WAS SHED THAT I MIGHT GO TO my inheritance to be what? What? Inheritance to sunship &gt;&gt; to be a son of God. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; So we are hes &gt;&gt; now. So, so you know uh uh the Bible says in one place we are heir of the world for the world belongs to us. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; The world belongs to us. Now I know the world's got their monetary things and m materialistic things but in all reality the world belongs to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now we don't want this world in the system that it's in. corruption and the murders and the rapes and the wars and the bloodshed. BUT GOD'S PROMISE THAT THIS WORLD belongs to us. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. The Bible says the meek shall inherit the earth. &gt;&gt; But also it says we are heir of all things. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, you may not have a lot of money, but you're heir of all things. &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. THIS IS WHY IT'S NO PROBLEM THAT WHEN WE'RE SICK, we just ask our father for healing and he gives it to us because I'm heir of all things. Amen. Even when I'm needing money, Amen. and my bills are are due and and and I've done all I know to do and and and and I I I'm needing that. Amen. Don't you believe that God can still provide? I've seen God provide many times because I'm heir of all things. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Now, we find also in Romans 8:17, Paul tells us that we are hes of God. &gt;&gt; So, we're not just heirs of the earth. We're not just heirs of all things. We are heir of God. Oh my. Well, how can we BE HEIRS OF GOD? BECAUSE WE'RE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD. WE'RE PART OF GOD. WE'VE GOT HIS GENETICS in us. Can you say amen? We were made in the image of God. So here the prophet says, "Man in the beginning when he was made, a man is a God." He's absolutely a God for he was made in the image of God being a son of God. And then he's of all that God is. &gt;&gt; Now church, that's not a misstatement. HE DIDN'T MEAN TO SAY heir that all that God has. &gt;&gt; He said all heir to all that God is. &gt;&gt; Now, church, THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN BE AN HEIR TO ALL THAT GOD IS IS YOU'RE A SON AND DAUGHTER OF GOD. &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE HIS LIKENESS. YOU HAVE HIS ATTRIBUTES. CAN YOU SAY AMEN? &gt;&gt; AMEN. As God rules, so do you rule. &gt;&gt; AS GOD SPEAKS, SO DO YOU SPEAK. AS GOD THINKS, SO DO YOU THINK. AS GOD'S nature is, so is your nature because it's him. You're heir to everything that God is. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, we make so much times. Amen. The world has made church so different from what God is. &gt;&gt; We just go to church. We're poor little peasants. We're trying and we're barely, Amen. making it. God's up there victorious and we're just down here. I just don't know. Amen. But here come a PROPHET TO TELL YOU, HOLD IT. THIS is what an heir means. IS WHAT GOD IS YOU ARE. YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; IF GOD'S VICTORIOUS, YOU'RE VICTORIOUS. IF GOD HAS NO ENEMIES, YOU HAVE NO ENEMIES. IN OTHER WORDS, IF EVERY ENEMY IS under his feet, they're under your feet. &gt;&gt; If God can overcome, YOU'RE GOING TO OVERCOME. THAT'S WHY JESUS SAYS, "AS I HAVE OVERCOME, SO SHALL YOU OVERCOME." THE SAME GOD THAT WAS IN HIM IS IN YOU. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Do you believe it? &gt;&gt; So, here's a prophet now saying, "The members of the virgin bride will love him and they will have his potentials." &gt;&gt; Now, come on, church. How many believes you got his potentials? &gt;&gt; Oh, come on. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; I know you got a mirror at your home and you're looking at it and everything's starting to sag the older you get. Come on. &gt;&gt; But the prophet said this, the B, Paul says, this is a mirror, too. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Now, in this mirror, I don't see a sinner. &gt;&gt; COME ON. &gt;&gt; COME ON, PRE. &gt;&gt; IN THIS MIRROR, I DON'T SEE MYSELF DEFEATED. &gt;&gt; IN THIS MIRROR, I I DON'T SEE MYSELF A VICTIM. &gt;&gt; In this mirror, I DON'T SEE MYSELF going to hell. &gt;&gt; In this mirror, I'm starting to see the LIKENESS OF JESUS CHRIST. CAN YOU SAY AMEN? FOR I'M an heir to everything that God is. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Now, you know, it's in this day that our inheritance has been shown to us. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; That we are heir to the power of creation. &gt;&gt; You believe that? were heir to the power of creation. Those things that are not. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; That's why Abraham, he looked not at THE THINGS THAT COULD BE SEEN, &gt;&gt; BUT HE COUNTED THOSE THINGS THAT ARE NOT AS THOUGH THEY WERE. &gt;&gt; He was heir TO THE THINGS THAT WERE NOT. &gt;&gt; COME ON, PREACH. &gt;&gt; Come on. Now, you remember a prophet talking about he went to go hunting. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Y'all remember that story? &gt;&gt; Now, he's not just telling it just to tell it now. &gt;&gt; He's telling us exactly what we're heir to. God showing through him what we're heir to. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And and there was no squirrels. &gt;&gt; And God says, "How many squirrels do you want?" &gt;&gt; Well, he just thought he was thinking that up and and and finally came to him. No, this is God Jehovah asking me, &gt;&gt; "How many squirrels do I want?" &gt;&gt; And he said, "Oh, I want three." Right? &gt;&gt; Amen. Speak and you shall have them. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; You You know the story. &gt;&gt; He spoke at one of them one of them times he couldn't he he couldn't find that squirrel. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; And he was going to go home. &gt;&gt; Oh my. And the voice said, "But you said &gt;&gt; holding him to his OWN WORD." &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT WASN'T JUST A WORD OF A MAN. &gt;&gt; COME ON, PREACHER. &gt;&gt; IT WAS A CREATIVE US. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Now, in Hebrews 6:17, &gt;&gt; Paul says that we're heirs of promise. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're heirs of promise. All that God has promised, we're heir to. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; So now, his word is his promise. &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. I I believe God can do anything he wants to, but where my faith is is in this word. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; That's what he's promised. &gt;&gt; And if he promised it, I'M HEIR TO IT. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. SEE, so we're heirs. Every promise that God made is written in the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, the prophet tells us that the Bible is God's thoughts in seed form. And God's thoughts about you are written in the Bible. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; If you want to find out really what you are, it's in the Bible. Not not about you being a sinner and not about you you know painting the town red and all your mistakes. No, no, no. I mean, you were that way through your natural the the natural conception of your parents and things like that. But but we're TALKING ABOUT WHAT GOD THOUGHT OF YOU. &gt;&gt; WELL, see Jeremiah 29:11, God says, "I know the thoughts that I think toward you." &gt;&gt; Thoughts of peace. Everybody say thoughts of peace &gt;&gt; not of evil &gt;&gt; to give you an expected end. &gt;&gt; So I want to just say this. Satan can never inject an evil thought in God's mind toward you. &gt;&gt; Oh my. That's power. &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on. &gt;&gt; No matter how bad and convincing that devil is, he'll never get God to change his mind about you. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Good. &gt;&gt; Well, the prophet said God's thoughts are eternal and they're real. &gt;&gt; AND GOD TELLS US WHAT KIND OF THOUGHTS HE HAD. THEY WERE THOUGHTS OF PEACE. &gt;&gt; NOT THOUGHTS of evil, not thoughts of destruction. &gt;&gt; Thoughts of peace. &gt;&gt; And to bring you to an expected end. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Good. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Now, you know, the Bible says that Satan stood before God accusing us. He's the accuser of the brethren. And and this word accuse, it means to charge with a thought or with a fault and and to blame. And yet THERE IS NO ACCUSATION POWERFUL enough &gt;&gt; to go to get God &gt;&gt; to accuse us. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; I know you already know these things. It's just simple &gt;&gt; but I hope I can get it in your heart. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope you young people can get this &gt;&gt; that no matter how condemned you feel, &gt;&gt; God doesn't condemn you. &gt;&gt; It's the devil that brings condemnation. &gt;&gt; NOW, I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT LIVING A LIE AND doing your own thing, living hypocritical. But I I believe there are people that genuinely want to serve God with all their heart. How many wants to serve God with all your heart? Now, Satan knows this &gt;&gt; and and so he knows THAT IS THE BEST THING, THE best weapon is to bring accusations to us and to let us know how low down we are, how unworthy we are, how misfit we are. AND HERE WE WANT TO SERVE GOD WITH EVERYTHING. AND WE find ourselves believing everything negative about us. &gt;&gt; Come on. But I'm here to talk positive &gt;&gt; and the word OF GOD. IT'S NOT POSITIVE THINKING. IT'S JUST THE PROMISES that you're heir to. &gt;&gt; We're heirs. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We're heirs of promise. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So our final end is written in the word of God. NOW DO YOU KNOW THIS Bible is a mystery? &gt;&gt; It's a mystery book. &gt;&gt; Book of mystery to the world. And did you know yet the prophet said it's a love it's a love letter. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; It's a book of mystery, &gt;&gt; but yet it's a love letter. &gt;&gt; Now, we've had men of men that stand behind pulpits and they take this word and it's a mystery. And so they look at the problems of the people and they think surely &gt;&gt; surely &gt;&gt; God will judge these people. and and and they become like a balum &gt;&gt; and they TAKE THE WORD OF GOD and they use IT AS A JUDGMENT against the PEOPLE &gt;&gt; AND HERE'S A PROPHET WITH THE MIND OF GOD. SO NO, IT'S A LOVE LETTER. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, this book of mystery, it's only revealed to the heirs of promise because that's really who it was written for. Do you believe it? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; See, Luke 10:21, Jesus in his prayer said, "I thank thee, oh Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and the prudent and hast revealed them unto babes." &gt;&gt; How many's glad you're a babe? &gt;&gt; He's revealed them unto BABES SUCH AS WE LEARN. &gt;&gt; COME ON. &gt;&gt; Come on. Good. Now, in this this this class, in this category, I'm glad to be called a babe. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; For those now notice, revealed them unto babes. For father, it seemed good in THY SIGHT. NOW THE PROPHET SAID YOU KNOW THE BIBLE is written the message is not all together right on the letter but it's between the lines &gt;&gt; doesn't mean you have to preach deep mysteries &gt;&gt; IT JUST MEANS THAT'S WHERE THE REVELATION IS &gt;&gt; PREACH &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT'S REVEALING MY INHERITANCE &gt;&gt; WHAT'S IN BETWEEN THE LINE DOESN'T TAKE WHAT'S ON THE line &gt;&gt; can you say amen Amen. &gt;&gt; Prophet said, "See, it's in between the line." Another place, when you try to put the Bible together with an intellectual understanding of it, you can't do that. It's a spirit written word &gt;&gt; and it takes THE HOLY SPIRIT TO PLACE it together. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Remember what we read in the opening scripture. As it is written, I hath not seen, &gt;&gt; nor ear heard, &gt;&gt; neither has it entered into the heart of man, the things that God has prepared for them that love him. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; Now it cannot enter into your heart. &gt;&gt; It it cannot be heard with the ear or seen with the eye unless God reveals it. BUT HE SAYS, "BUT GOD HATH REVEALED THEM unto us by his spirit." Yes. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, I hope this is all right this morning, &gt;&gt; but remember in our opening scripture, the secret things belong to the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He's the one that has the key to the secret things. &gt;&gt; It isn't a preacher. It isn't a pope. It wasn't even a prophet. &gt;&gt; COME ON. &gt;&gt; THE LORD HAS THE SECRET BELS BELONG TO THE LORD. But those things that are revealed belong to us. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad God sent a prophet? &gt;&gt; Because it couldn't be revealed without a prophet. &gt;&gt; DON'T EVER LET THIS MESSAGE GET COMMON TO YOU. &gt;&gt; GOD SENT A PROPHET BECAUSE HE WANTED TO REVEAL an inheritance &gt;&gt; to the heir of promise. I know IT SEEMS STRANGE SOMETIMES. WHAT you hear the prophet say seems strange and out of the this world. It's because the world knows nothing of it. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY THEY AIN'T PREACHING the promises like a prophet preached it. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; No, no matter how educated they are, they can go to seminaries and they can preach the best sermons and yet not preach what a prophet brought out. Because those things which are hidden, the secret things that BELONG TO THE LORD now reveal to a prophet. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; See, down through the years, men have probed out this book. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Trying to understand the secrets of God's mind. Trying to truly understand the meaning of God's word. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come on. Why was it written in the way it was? &gt;&gt; Why did it say certain things? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; I've I we we you know heard a heard a minister one time say that the book of Esther has no place in the Bible. It makes no sense. &gt;&gt; Talking to another man. Amen. Trying to tell me that divine healing there was no such thing as divine healing. He was a minister at a certain certain denomination. And and I I I quoted Hebrews 10 uh uh 13:8 and and Jesus Christ same yesterday, today, and forever. He said, "That ain't even inspired." He said, "Paul said, "Why would Paul put that in there?" He said, "If you read the whole chapter, read the whole chapter, it's like some man just throw that in there." &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; He said, "It doesn't even make sense." &gt;&gt; And I thought, "Oh, blind, blind, blind." But see, in this day, God has revealed it to us. &gt;&gt; We're not looking at these things as misfit, mischaracterized, and all of these things. It's painting a picture from Genesis to Revelation. And I'm seeing myself in the book. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; That's right. See, so we are heirs to what has been revealed. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. You love him. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; So, we find that in this book is where our inheritance lays. It's written out. It's there, but yet it's unseen to the unbeliever. &gt;&gt; Now, it's it's proven fact that something can be seen and yet at the same time, it can't be seen. &gt;&gt; It's proven fact that it can be there and yet not seen. Come on. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; I do that a lot. Just just me. I can look in the refrigerator and say, "Hey, babe." I'm telling off on myself. Where's the mane? Well, it's right there. Well, I can't see it. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; I know y'all don't do that, but I sure do. I can't see it. She'd come all the way downstairs just to show me where that mayonnaise is. Oh, I don't know. I Something just put it there. I guarantee it. But it can be there and yet can't be seen. And and we find that that's in the Bible. Actually, one time uh the enemy had surrounded a city and the prophet Elisha was there with his servant and his servant come out and first and he looked over the wall and saw all these people there. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; In their armor and everything and he starts to panic talking about having anxiety. &gt;&gt; He had it. &gt;&gt; His heart starts failing for fear. and and he starts oh man he just goes in a panic attack and you know and probably like what wrong with you &gt;&gt; and he says well come out and look he says we're surrounded we're &gt;&gt; you know finally Elisha looks out there and says well more are they with us than they are with them &gt;&gt; now you know that servant being the carnal man he's probably thinking man he's lost his marbles cuz I can't see nothing but the enemy. &gt;&gt; Right? But see, Elisha was seeing something and it was there &gt;&gt; but the servant could not see it. &gt;&gt; So, so what Elisha was seeing, &gt;&gt; it was giving him hope. &gt;&gt; What Elisha was seeing WAS GIVING HIM JOY. &gt;&gt; WHAT ELISHA WAS SEEING, HE SAW VICTORY. WHEREAS THE SERVANT, WHAT HE WAS SEEING, HE WAS LOOKING, &gt;&gt; you know, getting ready to write out his last will and testament. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Finally, the prophet began to pray. So, Lord, just open his eyes. &gt;&gt; And when God opened his eyes, Elisha was a or that servant was able to see the same thing that Elisha saw. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Oh my. Aren't Aren't you glad for that? See? &gt;&gt; And and and so we we find Amen. The prophet said, "See, they were there all the time." But the servant just couldn't see them. Can you say amen? Amen. See, now, now the angels were there. God didn't have to bring them down so that the servant could see. &gt;&gt; PREACH. &gt;&gt; THEY WERE THERE. COME ON. &gt;&gt; GOD JUST HAD TO CHANGE THE SEEING OF THAT SERVANT. &gt;&gt; And when he changed his sight, &gt;&gt; HE COULD SEE WHAT WAS THERE &gt;&gt; ALL ALONG. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Thank you, Lord. That's good. &gt;&gt; Now, see, Brother Brham said, see, there was mount there was the mountains full of angels and fire and horses of fire, chariots of fire all around this prophet. He just changed the scene. &gt;&gt; GLORY TO &gt;&gt; THE THING IS ALREADY THERE. &gt;&gt; GLORY TO GOD. &gt;&gt; NOW WHAT DO YOU THINK about us? Now Jesus says I will come to you. &gt;&gt; Right a little while I will come to you. He says in in one place as one down he says at that day brother Bram said this day you shall know you shall know that I'm in my father. He in me, you in me, and I in you. Right. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; You will know. But then he says, "But the world will see me no more." &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; So there IS A PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY SEE HIM &gt;&gt; know him &gt;&gt; and the world's like, "Huh? &gt;&gt; What's going on? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; I don't see a thing." Now, the Bible says men's hearts failing them for fear, looking after those things that are coming. &gt;&gt; What they're looking at is bringing fear. &gt;&gt; What we're looking at &gt;&gt; is bringing a faith. &gt;&gt; We know he's here. &gt;&gt; How many believe he's here? &gt;&gt; He didn't leave with A PROPHET. THE PROPHET'S MINISTRY was to declare his presence here among us. He is here. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to get off for just a moment, but why is he here? &gt;&gt; Well, Jesus gave a promise. &gt;&gt; I'm going to go away. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I'm got to go away. &gt;&gt; But see, I'm going there to prepare a place for you. &gt;&gt; That where I am, you may be there also. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; So, he says, I'm going to come. I'm not going to leave you. I'm going to come again &gt;&gt; and receive YOU UNTO MYSELF. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; NOW, CHURCH, I just happen to believe &gt;&gt; that he's come among us. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; To receive us unto himself. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Revelations 10:1. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; That mighty angel coming down. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; 1 Thessalonians 4:16. FOR THE LORD HIMSELF SHALL DESCEND WITH A SHOUT. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT. Ain't that right? A VOICE AND A TRUMP. AND THEN WHAT'S TO HAPPEN? That we which are alive and remain, the dead in Christ are going to rise first. And we which are alive and remain are going to be caught up together with them to meet the Lord in the air. &gt;&gt; He's here. &gt;&gt; AND YET THE WORLD CAN'T SEEK HIM. YES, &gt;&gt; SIR. Come on, preach. Come on &gt;&gt; here. We've got every excuse to panic. &gt;&gt; Come on. We've got every excuse to fear. &gt;&gt; We've got every reason around us, AMEN, TO FALL APART. &gt;&gt; WE'RE LIVING IN THE SAME WORLD THAT EVERYBODY ELSE is living in, &gt;&gt; but our seeing is different. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; CAN YOU SAY AMEN? I'M NOT HEIR TO TRIBULATION. &gt;&gt; I'm an heir of a rapture. &gt;&gt; I'M HEIR TO A BODY CHANGE. I'M GOING TO BE ONE SITTING AT THAT MARRIAGE SUPPER OF THE LAMB. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; He's here. He's come to get me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You love him. &gt;&gt; The world will no longer see me. This why Jesus said, "Blessed are your eyes, for they see. &gt;&gt; Blessed are yours, for they hear." Ain't that right? See, God changed our seeing. So we could see the unseen. &gt;&gt; G. &gt;&gt; The promises are laying in the book. &gt;&gt; Our inheritance is there. This book, the Bible, is a sacred thing to God. And it's a sacred thing to the heirs of promise. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; And this is why it's such a sacred thing. This is why God pronounces a curse to any man that would try to add to it or take away from it. &gt;&gt; Amen. You ain't ain't we we we we ain't to add. Amen. Because the prophet said when you do all that and you dislocate and misplace and all of these things, then you have the the cow on top of the tree eating grass and the picture's just wacko. Well, God would send a prophet to reveal the word to us to paint the scenery &gt;&gt; to PUT EVERY PIECE OF THE PUZZLE TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; To where I DON'T HAVE TO FEAR THE WHITE THRONE JUDGMENT. &gt;&gt; THAT'S NOT MY PLACE. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. Now in this last day, God has sent the spirit of truth &gt;&gt; to tutor us. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; To lead us to guide us into all truth. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that &gt;&gt; the spirit of truth, the prophet said, is the spirit of the word. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And it is showing us or revealing to us the word, which is our inheritance. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Paul in the book of Ephesians says that this spirit of truth is the spirit of promise. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; The one who gave the promise is here among us to reveal the promise. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; You believe it? &gt;&gt; AND IT WAS THE SPIRIT OF truth that came down. &gt;&gt; Revelations 10:1. &gt;&gt; COME ON. &gt;&gt; ONLY CHRIST IT COULD BE. YES. &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT. &gt;&gt; AND HE DESCENDED &gt;&gt; WITH SOMETHING IN HIS HAND. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. COME ON. COME ON. PREACH. &gt;&gt; It was an open book. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; And remember the prophet said, remember this seventh angel is on earth at the time of this coming. &gt;&gt; Why? The seventh angel is a prophet and the word COMES TO A PROPHET. &gt;&gt; COME ON. COME ON. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; AND THE PROPHET SAID, "WHAT IS A PROPHET?" It's a revealer of the word. &gt;&gt; A PROPHET IS A REVEALER. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, LORD. &gt;&gt; It's not to get you emotionally high. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; It's It's not to get you all excited, which we're glad for that. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're glad for emotions. We're glad for feelings. We're glad for these things. But your feelings will fail. Your emotions will fail. all of these things. But when God sent a prophet, &gt;&gt; G, &gt;&gt; he come to reveal our inheritance. &gt;&gt; He had kept these secret things in his mind. They belong to him. Now he's going to give it to the people. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Now notice and I hope this all right but brother Bram said the first thing that represented that redemption come the lamb that had been slain from the foundation of the world. He took the book. &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on. &gt;&gt; GLORY. OPENED THE BOOK, tore off the seals, sent it down to earth to a seventh angel to reveal it to his people. &gt;&gt; Now, and I'm not going to keep you long. I don't know where I'm at on my hour, &gt;&gt; but okay, you got me. But I want to say this. We're living in the age of adoption. &gt;&gt; How many believes that? &gt;&gt; Now, I I thank God for everything that he's done. Sending us a prophet. We understand why he sent a prophet. &gt;&gt; It wasn't just to work miracles. &gt;&gt; Remember the two pools was to gather us together, attract us. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; They were the attraction. &gt;&gt; But here we are now. Third pool, the opening of the word. Right. Right. &gt;&gt; Third pull, the open of the word. I know ministers have taken this message, dissect it, fought and fussed and divided and all that. That is not what this message is about. &gt;&gt; God opened the seal, SENT THE REVELATION OF THE BOOK, WHAT WAS IN THE BACK PART OF HIS MIND, AND REVEALED IT TO US. [Applause] &gt;&gt; To empower you. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; That's good. Yeah. &gt;&gt; To place you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, we're in this age of adoption. &gt;&gt; Now, remember what brother Bram said about adoption. &gt;&gt; The father has a son. &gt;&gt; And and he's busy with with the kingdom and all that that he has and he's he's got servants here and he's got this over here and he's he's busy operating everything and he ain't got time to tutor the son. So he hires a teacher, a tutor to come in and to teach the son. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's a trusted friend, right? The tutor is a trusted friend. He knows the father in and out and and all of these things. Knows the ways of the father. And so this this this uh uh uh uh what the the point of the tutor teaching the son is the father has the dream and the desire amen to hand over the business to his son &gt;&gt; to to bring him to an adoption &gt;&gt; to where the son now can run the business. Can you say amen? So the child's inheritance is the father's kingdom. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; I I want to just throw this in there. The prophet said the kingdom of God is the word made power. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Not just letter. &gt;&gt; The word made power. &gt;&gt; You speak it. &gt;&gt; You say it. &gt;&gt; You declare it. &gt;&gt; Whatever you say shall happen. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? So the inheritance is the father's kingdom. &gt;&gt; The prophet SAID WHEN THE CHILD WAS born he was a son but his conduct &gt;&gt; come on &gt;&gt; everybody say conduct &gt;&gt; had to do with his character &gt;&gt; or his inheritance &gt;&gt; can you say amen? So this tutor would teach the child. He would teach the child not about himself. &gt;&gt; He would teach the child the ways of the father. &gt;&gt; How the father conducted the business. Amen. He would tell him all about the kingdom that the father had. In other words, I I just just bear with me. I believe that the tutor took that boy and he began to show him his inheritance. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. And he says, "Well, look what this is and look what that is and look how how this is being operated. Look how this is being conducted and look how this has been happening and and all of these things and and he began to give him tests and and and and these things." See, now I uh just to throw this in here, our inheritance has been revealed to us through the message. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Not psychology. &gt;&gt; THROUGH A PROPHET. THANK YOU, LORD. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. So now, IF THE CHILD WAS OBEDIENT, &gt;&gt; notice he starts taking on the ways of his father. &gt;&gt; He starts talking the way his father talked. &gt;&gt; He starts acting the way his FATHER ACTED. &gt;&gt; HE STARTS THINKING THE THOUGHTS THE WAY HIS father would think. CAN YOU SAY AMEN? HE STARTS HANDLING THE THINGS THE WAY HIS FATHER WOULD HANDLE THEM. AMEN. See why? Because he's now showing he's interested. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; He's interested in the father's kingdom. &gt;&gt; How many's interested in the father's kingdom? &gt;&gt; I ain't interested in fighting with you. &gt;&gt; COME ON. &gt;&gt; COME ON. I ain't interested in proving MY POINT. &gt;&gt; COME ON. &gt;&gt; WHERE I'M RIGHT AND you're wrong. &gt;&gt; Preach. Come on. &gt;&gt; I'M INTERESTED IN THE FATHER'S KINGDOM. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. So then the prophet says that the tutor at a certain time would give give report back to the father. &gt;&gt; Oh, buddy. Billy Bob. Billy Bob, you would be so proud of Bob. man, he just handles everything the way you handle it. I tell you what, I give him all kinds of tests and all and he doesn't just go and say, "Well, I'm going to do my own thing." &gt;&gt; Oh, no. I tell him how you handle it and he just does it AND IT WORKS OUT. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; OH, HE'S past his teenage years. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Where he knows more about the father does. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? HE'S PASSED THAT POINT TO WHERE he Well, I know my father's done good, but boy, you just get me in the saddle. I'll do a lot better. Oh, no, no, no. He He's an obedient son. Oh, he's worthy. Can you say amen? And notice the prophet says, "See, that little fell is one of the smartest little chaps I've ever seen. Even though he's youthful, he's a chip off the old block. HE LOVES YOU. HE'S JUST EXACTLY LIKE YOU. HE'S ABOUT YOUR BUSINESS. HE STANDS JUST EXACTLY FIRM on what you say. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; WHAT YOU SAY, HE BELIEVES. &gt;&gt; WHAT YOU SAY, HE SAYS. &gt;&gt; GLORY. &gt;&gt; He just like you. &gt;&gt; See, so then the boy comes to that place. He's learned how to handle the kingdom through all the tests and all the things that he's gone through. He still believes what a father says. Still says what the father says. &gt;&gt; Still handles it the way the father would handle it. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, church. &gt;&gt; Oh, come on. &gt;&gt; He's learned not to listen to the negative. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; HE'S LEARNED NOT TO GO BY FEELINGS. &gt;&gt; He's learned NOT TO DEPEND ON SENSATIONS. HE JUST SIMPLY TAKES YOU AT YOUR WORD. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; That's where the Pentecostals had a problem. &gt;&gt; They went for emotions. &gt;&gt; They went for feelings. &gt;&gt; Well, not all the time are you going to feel like you're saved. &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on. &gt;&gt; Not every time you're going to feel like you're a Christian. &gt;&gt; Not every time you're going to feel like you're going in a rapture. &gt;&gt; BUT THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. THE FATHER SAYS I AM GOING IN A RAPTURE. &gt;&gt; THE FATHER HAS REVEALED THE INHERITANCE. AND I'LL SAY what a f my father says. &gt;&gt; So then what happens? He was placed over the inheritance through adoption given authority. Spoke in the father'sstead. His signature on the check was just as good as the father. Everything was under his command. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Then the son comes into legal possession of his inheritance because he now has the authority to speak and everything obeys him. &gt;&gt; See, so the voice of authority was now in the sun. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Just like it was when Jesus was adopted on Mount Transfiguration, God said, "This is my beloved son. &gt;&gt; Hear ye him." &gt;&gt; You see, being an heir of an inheritance means nothing. If you have no authority. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So this is why Paul says, "Thou art no more a son or a servant, but a son. And if a son than an heir." &gt;&gt; Yeah. Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Now Paul would tell us we were predestinated. Everybody say, "I was predestinated &gt;&gt; to the adoption of sons." &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Abraham was predestinated &gt;&gt; to be adopted. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; BUT HOW COULD GOD PREDESTINATE HIM BEFORE HE ADOPTED HIM? &gt;&gt; OH, COME ON. &gt;&gt; The prophet said God knew what Abraham would do. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; And God knows exactly what you will do. &gt;&gt; He knows you're going to come out of it. YOU MAY BE IN YOUR TRIAL RIGHT NOW, BUT HE knows you're going to come out. &gt;&gt; HE KNOWS THE DEVIL MAY BE WARNING YOU, BUT HE ALREADY KNOWS YOU BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. HE KNOWS YOU AIN'T going to give up. &gt;&gt; He knows you ain't going to give into that unbelieving spirit. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no. He forneew him. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Do you love him? So here, God's great mysteries, what the eternal God had as a mystery now has been unfolded, the prophet said, in Jesus Christ, then given right down to his church. What was once in God's mind is now in the bride of Christ. JESUS MAKING LOVE TO THE CHURCH, his bride, whispering secrets. Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad he's whispering secrets to you? &gt;&gt; Now he says, "You know how you tell your wife things? You know, little girl you're going to marry, you love her so much, you just tell her the secrets. &gt;&gt; You get her up next to you and you and love you and everything. You know how it is." Well, that's what God Christ is doing to the church. He's letting her know the secrets. Just the secrets. &gt;&gt; It ain't to the world. IT'S TO HIS BRIDE. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, LORD. &gt;&gt; DID YOU SAY AMEN? &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "NOT THESE FLIRTERS, I MEAN HIS WIFE." &gt;&gt; AND BY having the revelation of his secret made known to them by his grace, how the grace of God, I hope you don't think this sounds personal. He says to a bunch of people, "But the secret that God is sharing with the whole church, if they would just receive it." &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? And by revealing his secrets to this church, to the elect, he's changing their seeing. &gt;&gt; THIS BOOK IS BECOME A NEW BOOK. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I know how it is. We were raised in the apostolic &gt;&gt; Pentecostal. preacher wanted to put us in hell, he could just preach a fiery sermon, put us in hell, we'd be at an altar. &gt;&gt; We were on a emotional co roller coaster constantly. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Come on. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Because we couldn't see ourselves in the book. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; So, it was the PREACHER THAT POSSESSED THE power over our emotions. Come on. &gt;&gt; IT WAS THE PREACHER THAT POSSESSED THE POWER OVER OUR FEELINGS. &gt;&gt; Over our faith. &gt;&gt; Come on. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; That God is given the inheritance to his elect. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; I hope that's all right. But brother Brandon said, "See, he breaks the seals, reveals, gives us his inheritance to his people. &gt;&gt; He gives the inheritance that he inherited becoming kinsman redeemer and freely gives it out to us. It all belonged to him. He was the one who redeemed. But instead of keeping it to himself, he gives it back to the people." &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; That's his love for us. And what's he doing in this age? Through the prophet's message, teaching us how to think, &gt;&gt; teaching us how to act, &gt;&gt; teaching us how to talk, &gt;&gt; teaching us how to rule &gt;&gt; above our emotions and subdue OUR EMOTIONS AND SUBDUE OUR FEELINGS, &gt;&gt; that when I DON'T FEEL SAVED, I CAN STILL HOLD TO THE WORD OF GOD AND SAY, "I AM SAVED." WHEN EVERYTHING IS JUST GOING WRONG AND CHAOS, I CAN STILL STAND WITH THE WORD OF GOD. &gt;&gt; Can you SAY AMEN? &gt;&gt; WHY? Because God done it in his age. &gt;&gt; In the beginning, there was the world. &gt;&gt; Chaotic, darkness, water covered the earth. And yet, God wanted a world. And instead of God looking at all of this that was down there, he looked at his word. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He believed in that word and he looked at WHAT HE COULD NOT see and said, "Let there be." And there was &gt;&gt; glory to God. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; What's he doing? &gt;&gt; He's putting the word in our mouth. &gt;&gt; Not Oh. I just don't know. &gt;&gt; No, he's changing that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Why? It's a tutor. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Do you love the Lord? &gt;&gt; Now, as I wind it down, the things that were unseen to the world, John saw. &gt;&gt; Did you know when the book was open, he shouted, he screamed, he rejoiced, &gt;&gt; and what did the prophet say? John must have saw his name. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; GLORY. &gt;&gt; WHAT COULD NOT BE SEEN? &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; Now became seen &gt;&gt; and John saw himself in the book. &gt;&gt; He was able to read between the lines and see himself. Can you say amen? AND IN EVERY PROMISE THAT GOD MADE FOR THE BRIDE, I JUST BELIEVE John saw himself. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; He was the one that the promise was made to. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Jesus saw himself in the book, too. &gt;&gt; That's the way he knew the word. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; How many believes that? &gt;&gt; You believe Jesus saw himself in the word? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Now, the prophet said that's how he knew the word. Come on. &gt;&gt; Preach. &gt;&gt; Sure. And that's how he defeated Satan. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; He had power upon power, but he not used not one of them. He took the word. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; He took THE WORD THAT WAS REVEALED TO HIM and he defeated Satan. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Brother Bram said he did it to show that the weakest Christian can defeat Satan anytime, &gt;&gt; anywhere. Amen. &gt;&gt; Under any condition &gt;&gt; by using the word of God. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, how did Jesus defeat Satan? He knew what the word said. Everybody say, "He knew what the word said." &gt;&gt; He believed what the word said. &gt;&gt; He confessed what the word said. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; That's how he defeated Satan. &gt;&gt; He knew what the word said. HE BELIEVED WHAT THE WORD SAID. &gt;&gt; HE CONFESSED WHAT THE WORD SAID. &gt;&gt; NOW, if you know the prophet said Satan knew the word, too. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Ah, &gt;&gt; yeah. &gt;&gt; Well, how am I going to defeat him then if he knows the word? &gt;&gt; Well, here's how it was. He knew the word in the Garden of Eden. &gt;&gt; He knew the word when he tempted Jesus &gt;&gt; and he still knows the word today. &gt;&gt; Now, notice the prophet said Satan know the word. He noted from A to Z. Well, you know what? I imagine he'd have a degree. He'd have enough titles to stretch across four or five pages of paper. Doctor, Reverend, Elder, PH, LL, QD, all the alphabet in every way. His degree would be in that Bible. He knows every word of it. He sure does. &gt;&gt; But Jesus knew the word differently. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Come on. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Jesus knew the word by faith IN THE REVELATION OF GOD'S word in his OWN PREDESTINATED LIFE. &gt;&gt; Anybody can read John 3:16. &gt;&gt; Anyone can know all these other other scriptures. &gt;&gt; But Jesus knew it differently. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Hello. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; See, JESUS BY FAITH COULD PLACE HIMSELF in the word. &gt;&gt; Yes, SIR. &gt;&gt; SO, THE PROPHET SAID JESUS knew who he was. &gt;&gt; Satan was wondering who he was. &gt;&gt; Both knew the word. &gt;&gt; BUT JESUS BY HIS WORD, BY THE WORD knew who he was. &gt;&gt; Satan knew the word and was still wondering who he was. &gt;&gt; Oh, come on. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; SO JESUS BY FAITH, BY REVELATION, COULD PLACE HIMSELF IN THE WORD. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Satan knew the word, but he couldn't place Jesus in the word. &gt;&gt; And I want to say this, Satan knows the word, too, in this age, &gt;&gt; but he can't place you in the word. &gt;&gt; Oh, come on. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? He can't place you in a rapture. HE CAN'T PLACE YOU AT THE MARRIAGE SUPPER OF THE LAMB. HE CAN'T PLACE you in a new body. &gt;&gt; But see, he came, THE LAMB CAME WITH THE BOOK open &gt;&gt; and HE GAVE THE REVELATION TO THE PROPHET TO REVEAL IT TO US. &gt;&gt; NOW WE KNOW THE WORD BETTER THAN THE devil does. &gt;&gt; FOR WE SEE OURSELVES in a rapture. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. We see ourselves as heir to every promise of God. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Well, do you love him? &gt;&gt; Can you lift your hands unto the Lord and worship him? SO GLAD. SO GLAD THAT we're heirs of promise. &gt;&gt; So glad. See, Satan couldn't see Jesus in the word. The religious leaders couldn't see Jesus in the word. &gt;&gt; Most of the people couldn't see him in the word. &gt;&gt; But Jesus saw what they couldn't. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; When Jesus looked at that word, he saw himself in Moses's prophecy. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; HE SAW HIMSELF IN THE prophecy that was given to Eve as the woman's seed. HE SAW HIMSELF IN ISAIAH'S PROPHECY. HE SAW HIMSELF IN DAVID'S songs &gt;&gt; and in his prophecies. &gt;&gt; He saw himself in Solomon's poetry. &gt;&gt; He saw himself in the types and shadows of the Old Testament. That's the way Jesus knew the word. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; He saw the unseen &gt;&gt; and declared what he saw. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; Can you SAY AMEN? THE PROPHETS DECLARED WHAT THEY SAW. &gt;&gt; THEY SAID, "HE'S COMING. He's a will in the middle of the wheel." &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; He's the fourth man in the fire. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. COME ON. &gt;&gt; THEY DECLARED WHAT THEY SAW. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; They said, "He's a He's a prophet." &gt;&gt; Oh, come on. &gt;&gt; He's coming. He's Messiah. He's a woman's seed. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And they began to declare. But when he came, he looked back at everything that they prophesied and said, "I'm that one. I'm that one. I'm that one. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; In such a thing that he would say, "Destroy this temple and within three days I'll raise it up again." &gt;&gt; Did he not say that? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Did you know he made that statement based off the word of God? &gt;&gt; A prophet said, "I'll not suffer my holy one to see corruption or leave HIS SOUL IN HELL." &gt;&gt; JESUS SAW HIMSELF AS THAT HOLY ONE. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, LORD. &gt;&gt; Come on. And that's how he defeated Satan. &gt;&gt; Thank you, &gt;&gt; Lord. &gt;&gt; THE PROPHET SAID JESUS KNEW IT BY EXPERIENCE. He knowed it by revelation. He knowed that he was that son of God that was to come into the world. He knowed his standing. He knowed he was born in this world for that purpose. And that's the reason the word of God could work through him because he knowed what he was. Yes. &gt;&gt; Another place. If Jesus defeated Satan upon the faith, knowing who he was, he was a predestinated creature. He said, "Are you ready? What about the predestinated bride of Jesus Christ?" Now, &gt;&gt; you believe the bride is predestinated. &gt;&gt; The bride, predestinated bride of Christ, now the church, the word seed with everything that God promised to put in the church is in it right now. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Well, do you love him? Amen. &gt;&gt; We could go on and on and on and I just love the word. &gt;&gt; I pray it's been a help to you today. &gt;&gt; But I I I'll tell you this. What do you see? &gt;&gt; What What do you see when you look at the word? &gt;&gt; You know, when you look at the Old Testament saints, Hebrews 11:13, it says, "These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them aar off." &gt;&gt; So, they were looking at things that were not yet there. They were unseen and yet they were persuaded of them &gt;&gt; and embraced them. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; See, they were living under the natural things of types and shadows. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; The natural lamb only spoke of the one true lamb to come. The natural priest only spoke of the true priest to come. The natural tabernacle only spoke of the true tabernacle to come. The natural altar was a type of the true altar to come. The natural scapegoat was only a type of the true one to come. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; And when Jesus saw it, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; He said, "I am he." &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; And did you know? &gt;&gt; The natural arc of the covenant was not the promise. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; It was only a type and shadow.
