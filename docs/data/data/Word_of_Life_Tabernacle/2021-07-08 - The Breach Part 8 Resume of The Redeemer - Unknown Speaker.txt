now that's our hearts desire oh yes please let me be pleasing to you [Music] oh me please [Music] our heads together for word of prayer i spoke with brother timothy pruitt yesterday and sister karen was showing some signs of improvement but she's uh still fighting a battle and so we want to pray with them and i let him know that we're standing with them during this time it's a hard time for that family and for the church but we believe god is going to bring a complete healing and for all of those that are sick among us i believe god is going to bring a complete healing to them as well we don't want as we were talking and discussing that i we don't want just to have a partial healing just keep them around we want a complete healing and that's what we want and be praying especially for brother robert smith and sister gene as well during this time because it's really important and i just want us as a church to be praying for them when you have your prayer time at home let's bow our heads together heavenly father we're so grateful to be in your presence tonight and so thankful for your word lord that is sharper than any two-edged sword able to discern even to the thoughts and the intents of the heart lord we've come maybe all of our thoughts we sometimes think things that are wrong but our intents lord the things that we desire we desire you lord and we know that you see that tonight on a wednesday night you see that motive and that objective and i pray that it would be pleasing in your sight tonight lord i pray for these situations that we've mentioned god you're able to move and we know that you're a prayer answering god and we ask you lord that your perfect will would be done in every situation lord sometimes we don't know what the perfect will of god is we have to step out in faith and believing always believing that it's your will to heal and and to save and to bring about restoration so lord we trust that that will be the case tonight i pray you'd move me out of the way and speak through your people through this service we pray in jesus name amen amen god bless you it's good to be in the house of the lord on a wednesday night and trust that the lord will just really bless you if you're here if you're streaming tonight ruth chapter 3 and verse 8 if you do miss these wednesday night services i i think this is some of the best times we have in the lord and just getting into the words sometimes you're more relaxed on a wednesday night and you can just come and sometimes you're a little tired i know that so i try not to hold you long but we're about to get in some good stuff and so you just hang with us and i believe that god is just as much god on a wednesday night as he is on a sunday morning or on a monday morning or whatever it is that you have need of him i believe that he's there for you ruth chapter 3 and verse 8 we'll continue our subject on the breach tonight it says it came to pass at midnight that the man was afraid and turned himself the lord's kind of startled out of his sleep behold a woman lay at his feet she was laying at the feet of the only man who could do something for her do you ever think about that the only man in the universe that could be her redeemer she was laying at his feet that's where i want to be amen and he said who art thou she answered i am ruth thine handmaid spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid thou art a near kinsmen amen i pray the lord would add his blessing to the word you may be seated we imagine that ruth as she's there she understands because naomi has told her that he is the only one who can do that for her and something about her she just happens amen to fall in love with the only one and she just happens to meet him and to be in his field what's interesting is that she would not have been there had she not went with naomi so it was necessary for her to follow naomi because it's the only way she could her life could ever meet the only person on earth who could be her redeemer because as long as she stayed in moab as long as she remained in that condition she was a widow needing redemption and only one man could provide that to her and that was boaz the only man on earth who could provide that for her and i will tell you tonight and brother branham is going to get into this in the breach but i i'm here to tell you tonight that jesus christ is the only one who can who can meet the requirements of redemption who has met the requirements of redemption who has redeemed our soul and one day will also redeem our bodies and that's also will redeem the earth he's the only one who can qualify aren't you glad for that tonight i mean no wonder brother branham said the message is christ but you see if if she had not met naomi if she'd not come through the law she could have never met him she could have never been brought to him and so the law is a school master to bring us to christ so we could not understand who christ was unless the law had come and prefigured him and shadowed him and showed him in every way now and so you can't come if i could say it that way directly to grace but you come to grace through the law you recognize that you're wrong you recognize you're a sinner but then you come to the only one who can provide you grace now and we believe in grace don't we what would we be without grace we're going to hear about it tonight now brother branham says adam could not meet the requirements of redemption he could not meet the requirements of redemption after he found he lost it he had sinned and he had separated himself from god was on this side of the chasm the wrong side so he could not redeem it here it reminds me here not long ago we were on vacation we went to charleston and when you get to charleston there's an island that you can go on to go to fort moultrie we went to fort moultrie where you can see across the harbor but it's an island there's one bridge going across and coming back we realized that fact because we got stuck in traffic on the way back but there's only one bridge only one way to get there to get back to the highway to get back to charleston to get back to the mainland only one way see we were on the other side of the chasm we were on the wrong side we were on the island separated from god's mercy separated from god's grace and so we were on the wrong side of the chasm and only one man is one mediator between god and man the man christ jesus do we believe that tonight one mediator and i want us to think about this when we think about him being the only one because i thought deeply about this today and through the week and and we're going to get really in depth maybe into this if the lord would let us but sometimes getting in depth is not what we think it is it's it's not in the great things we can't understand because if i present it in a way that you can't understand it it's not it is deep but it's just mysterious it's not a revelation but if we could ever get it simple enough if we could get simple enough just to believe it because there's certain parts of it especially the incarnation of christ and and how great he is that we just have to believe it there's parts of it that we can't really really comprehend yet but but we're going to be learning about it for a long time aren't we we got plenty of time we've got eternity to learn about him so now we find that he could not do it he had sinned and separated himself from god he was on this side of the chasm he could not redeem it he just couldn't do it because he needed redemption himself so he could not do it and so we find then that no man was worthy he said but the law required a kinsmen redeemer the law of god required a kinsmen redeemer he said you want to mark that down he said he'd find it in leviticus 25. now i'm not going to read all of leviticus 25 tonight because we've read it recently in this study but leviticus 25 25 says this if thy brother be wax and poor and sold away some of his possession and if any of his kin notice his kin come to redeem it then shall he redeem that which his brother sold it had to be kin if humans lost it humans would have to get it back it has to be a man if a man lost it a man would have to get it back now watch brother branham says we won't have time to thoroughly search this he said because you know each text would make a night well praise god we got time now right right and so he said each text would make a night and you know i'll stop there and say this that we do not pretend to know more than a prophet right but we should understand what he said better than the people who originally heard it and i say we should because i know it's by revelation but you look at the time that's best passed and the amount of preaching that we've heard and the amount of times that we've heard it that we get the the benefit of having heard it over and over also the benefit of being able to compare it with the scripture being able to compare it with other things that brother branham said we should understand it better today than they ever did back there but he said you know each text would make a night now we've had the benefit of being able to do this now he said but god's law received a substitute he said now what if god had not offered to take a substitute think about that what if he'd not offered to take a substitute amen then that would have been it right it had been like satan's seed god never offered to take a substitute for the angels right there's no redemption for angels god never offered he never did he never said now satan falls and takes the angels with him i'll allow them to make a sacrifice until a perfect sacrifice comes he never did it but it's only among men mankind human beings that god allows them to mess up allows him to go because we're the ones that redemption was going to cho was going to show through and that's why we remain humans we retain our humanity on some level even in glorified bodies and we live on the earth and in some level and i guess i never really realized that like i have over this last few weeks that we've got to retain that because we're the ones that god was going to show redemption through he couldn't show it through an angel and so he's not going to make us angels again right we're going to retain our humanity on some degree and sometimes we blame everything on our humanity but it's actually that that god wants to use he wants to show himself amen he wants to partner with you partner with me amen which is what he did in christ and we'll get to that as we go through this but brother brother said what if god had not offered to take a substitute but love constrained him to do it amen that man was without a way back and there's no way for him to get back he was gone but the grace of god met this kent kinsman redeemer in the person of jesus christ amen that's what makes him different from anybody else the grace of god met this kinsman redeemer in the person of jesus christ and that's why it's still the person of jesus christ today even today in the form of the holy spirit it's the person the literal life of christ coming back on the believer that's still who we worship that's still who we are directed by that's still who has the preeminence in the church is the person of jesus christ amen he don't he don't want no man to have it over an oversight of the church he is the head of the church right and so and so he is the uh the person of jesus christ that's where grace met the kinsman redeemer he said law required it grace met its requirements he said oh he quotes they said oh amazing grace how sweet to sound god's law required an innocent substitute now grace did not just cover the law or say the law is not needed anymore which is an argument you hear all the time anymore right you hear that all the time you see that on the internet you hear it from people well i'm under grace i don't have to dress a certain way or act a certain way i'm under grace no grace did not cover the law grace did not grace did not just say well it's okay but what did grace do grace met the requirements of the law he said think not that i've come to destroy the law or the prophets i'm not come to destroy but to fulfill to bring into reality those things that were shown in shadow in the old testament to bring it into reality he says i'm not come to destroy but to fulfill romans 8 3 it says i love this it's beautiful he said for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh you realize you can take that back to the book of ruth and type it with naomi because she could not produce a child right she could not ever retain even if she was allowed to live in her old home she could never retain a place because she had failed to produce a son right she all her sons were dead her sons had died and so now there was no hope of redemption for naomi amen but she'd had a daughter oh my but look she would reach a place and the bible even says that where she was past childbearing she couldn't so the only hope was marriage the only hope was that she could get married but she couldn't get remarried so the only hope then that she had was that her daughter-in-law would get remarried amen and when that happened then she could she could be redeemed through the marriage because why now listen the marriage only brought redemption because ruth produced an offspring right and think through that for just a moment with me because this message doesn't do us any good unless it produces something right it's not just hearing it redemption is not complete until amen until the baby's born hallelujah one of these days sir we're looking for a promised son amen and christ is being born right now in your heart unless that unless he's born in your heart unless you unless you become that word then it doesn't do you any good to identify with it right because it still wouldn't have produced any offspring but that's why the book of ruth goes all the way through the child once she's had a child it stops why because redemption is complete think about it a moment hey man i realized that that actually a few years ago and i thought oh god see she had to reach a place where she wasn't a widow anymore she didn't think about herself as a widow she was a wife when she become a wife she began to produce she wasn't like these other women that didn't want children brother brandon said they didn't want any of them pentecostal acts 238 children but she had to be one who had a desire amen for the seed and to have a baby hallelujah i'm gonna have to quit doing that or we're gonna be in trouble now notice what the law could not do what naomi could not do because she was weak through the flesh it was weak through the flesh god sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh notice he's in the likeness of flesh but in the image of god there's a difference he looked like flesh but he's in the image of god and he was flesh but he was born of a virgin and so now he says and for sin condemned sin in the flesh now watch that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled again it's meeting the requirements of the law how do we fulfill the righteousness of the law not by going back and trying to live by the law not by trying to make sure everything's just right and we eat the right foods and we drink the right things that's not how we fulfill the righteousness of the law we fulfill the righteousness of the law by not walking after the flesh but after the spirit so brother branham picks it up he said who was innocent every man had been born sexual after sex everyone now he said in the only one that wasn't that would have been adam had forfeit the rights to eternal life and to be king on the earth oh but there's coming a king of kings he'll be king on the earth right but adam gave that up and but that's where we're going back to that sunshine now look he said oh and i think of that scripture for thou hast redeemed us back to god we may reign and be kings and priests upon the earth he said oh my what the kinsman redeemer or what a story we we would have here and he says now he says notice law required a kinsman redeemer to redeem a lost substance if it's lost means it had to be the original owners at some point right it's lost you had to be the original owner for to be lost and you were the lost substance and he said grace met this requirement again he says it in the person of jesus christ right grace met this requirement in the person of jesus christ redemption is complete in him right and it's the only way you can take advantage of redemption is to be a part of that right it's through him that's the only way you can't do it through a messenger you can't do it through a preacher you can't do it through a prophet only in christ now and so he says grace met this requirement in the person of jesus christ a kinsmen must be born of the human race he said now how could we be now this is going to get important as we move along and probably in the next weeks if the lord allows me to do it because he says how brother branham gets into the godhead in the breach and i'm glad he did because it gives me an excuse to to study it and preach on it and do these things and you know i could probably take and i won't but i could take the rest of my ministry and preach this one sermon and you would get fed think about what a message we have what an evening light has come because there's so much there but now he said anybody that couldn't see that it was a sex act there he said well he is totally blind because every man that was born was born of a woman so god it had to be that and think about it if it wasn't that there would be no reason for the virgin birth because god would have ordained that method and said that's okay that would have been in the original right and if that was in the original and that's that tells you as well that it won't be when we go back right and that's what jesus said and that should tell people right there if it's not going to be there if it wasn't in the original it's not going to be there then that must have been the problem but but people don't have the eyes to see but uh but here uh it should tell you that because the virgin birth tells us that there was a problem with the way we were born and now he says because every man was born was born of a woman and god required a kinsmen redeemer so there had to be a man born but it couldn't be through that act right it couldn't be and and we should understand that we should you'd think you know today we're i think we get kind of embarrassed sometimes by the serpent seed but we should understand that and it probably makes sense more to people who don't aren't steeped in some religion you know but if you've been told it's an apple for all these many years and then if someone shakes the boat and says it's not an apple then you think oh it's some weird doctrine right and that's what but like brother branham said if it was an apple that's a powerful apple we need to pass the apples again right that makes you realize that you're naked but god required a kinsmen redeemer he said and he must be human he said oh my what are you going to do now law required a kinsmen redeemer he said now he couldn't take an angel he had to have a man because we're not kin to the angel we're kin to one another angel never fail he is a different kind of being got a different body he never sinned or nothing we're talking about the angels that remained with god he never fell he's never sinned right michael gabriel all these other angels whatever they might wormwood they've never failed they've never sinned but god couldn't redeem in that representation of himself that was part of him they were his attributes but he couldn't redeem through them and they could not be redeemed and listen he says the angel never fell he's a different kind of being got a different body and you'll find that in hebrews he said man was created a little lower than the angels why for the purposes of redemption he never sinned or nothing he's different but the law required a kinsman redeemer and every man on earth was born of sex he said now don't you see this there's where it come from that's where sin started he said so you see where it's at now there he comes your seed of the serpent in he said now notice it required a kinsman redeemer and the redeemer kinsman redeemer must be born of the human race he said here that leaves us on a limb every human that was ever born was born that way brother branham was i was everyone that was ever born the only one that hadn't was adam and he fell he's the one that needed redeemed amen but notice he said that leaves us on a limb but let me sound the trumpet to you the virgin birth produced the product amen the virgin birth produced our kinsmen redeemer now this is amazing because i thought of this as you know what kind of resume would you have to have to get the job of kinsmen redeemer right and you look at boaz what kind of resume did he have you think about it brother branham said that strong angel proclaimed with a loud voice who was worthy he was advertising for a redeemer so he put the ad out there like an ad in the paper that you had advertised for a job put the ad in the paper and and you show it there and say a redeemer you want a redeemer all the ones come up isaiah come up and and jeremiah come up and all the ones down through history they all come up and begin to talk well what kind of resume would you have well i was a prophet i i saw great miracles many signs and wonders well how are you born what about your father and mother every one of them amen by faith they were looking forward to a redeemer but none of them could answer the advertisement for redeemer nobody could fill that job amen until one was born amen that would not be a person born by sex but by a virgin birth and the virgin birth produced he said our kinsmen redeemer now look at that what kind of resume would he have to have well he'd have to be a pretty important man he'd have to be pretty wealthy he'd have to have the power he'd have to have the ability he'd have to he he'd have to be able to do it he'd have to be kin to us he'd have to be human and yet have the power to do all these things to redeem us back have the ability to pay the price amen so notice what he says none other none other we we need to recognize that and i and we'll get into it i don't believe in that he's one like our finger but this idea of two lords or uh that has gone around the message it's just wrong because none other but the almighty god become emmanuel amen none other but the almighty god you could preach on that for a while none other but the almighty god become emmanuel one of us emmanuel the kinsman redeemer was met amen he said you see how god makes the requirement and there's nothing we can do now think about it if you're required to do something and you can't do it what kind of a god is that right but that's true even of our salvation we're required to live in a way that we can't live are you with me we're required to do some things that we can't do just mark 16. go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature these signs shall follow them that believe they'll cast out devils speak in new tongues if they drink any deadly thing it won't harm them i can't do it right i can't do it god made the requirement but she said you see how god makes the requirement and there's nothing we can amen there's nothing we can do but then grace steps in amen you see if god made a requirement if god wants you to be a man you can be a real man because grace steps in if god wants you to have a family a godly family you can have a godly family in laodicea because grace steps in not because you did everything right you say well i failed in the past i failed with my kids but grace has to step in in order to meet the requirement are you with me tonight grace has got to step in maybe i should slow down a little bit maybe we catch it a little bit better but it's got to step in or we cannot we cannot produce that requirement we can't make it happen but god makes a requirement and the god that makes a requirement when there's nothing we can do he said grace steps in and overshadows that law and produces the product hallelujah he said oh when you get over home he said when i get my little cabin down there that brother neville sings about when you all hear something down there one morning seeing amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me you say praise god oh brother branham made it there he is brother branham quotes amazing grace oh that's the story of my life paul said it this way said by the grace of god i am what i am is that your story tonight that's your story by the grace of god grace stepped in when god made a requirement but you couldn't do anything about it grace stepped into your situation amen now look now why would grace step in for you i'll think about it for a moment why would grace step in for you because you're his don't let the devil beat you up and tell you well well you must not be his because you're not the flashiest member of the church you you don't speak in tongues the most you don't dance the most he said grace stepped in if grace has stepped in for you there's a reason for that you said but my body hurts in my my everything about me hurts and i i have a hard time even having faith for a headache but grace stepped in for you and if he stepped in for you there's a reason he stepped in because you were redeemable why didn't you hear the message of the hour because god said i have needs to go by samaria amen why did you catch the revelation of it in the condition that you were in because you had representation on the inside don't let the devil beat you up about that you wouldn't be where you are today unless you unless there was something about you i'm preaching to the elect of god now there's something about you that was redeemable hey man how come ruth ended up in that field how would she ever meet that man how did she find herself ever laying at his feet what gives you a desire to come to the house of god grace steps in amen ruth was just a moabitess but grace stepped in and the story of her life was completely changed because somehow she had a desire when others left she said i'll go with the word i'll go with naomi when everybody else left what put that desire in her heart grace stepped in hallelujah i got to lose some more weight but when we do all that we can do meet all the requirements we can meet grace steps in you think you've done everything that you can you and you've messed up you look at your life and i know how it is sometimes i know how it is for a family a young family you know the things you struggle with many of the things you struggle with some of you will tell me about i you know as a young family maybe as a man you there's certain things you have to do you realize i struggle with those same things when it comes to you know well i should pray more i should i should read my bible more my family don't always behave the way they should but grace steps in grace steps in don't put yourself out or or sit under condemnation all the time because well i'm not what i should be no do everything you can but grace steps in and we ought to that ought to just make build such a love such a fire under us that we would want to run like like she did stay in his field we'd want to lay at his feet we'd want to meet our kinsmen redeemer not because somebody made us but because grace stepped in hallelujah now brother branham after he quotes from amazing grace he said the book of ruth gives a beautiful picture of this how boaz naomi had lost the estate he said you heard me preach on it haven't you raised your hands up if you heard me preach it and that's on the the message kinsman redeemer he preached in 1960 if you haven't heard it in a while go back and listen to it beautiful message he said so you understand see boaz had to become a redeemer i love that and he was the only one that could and he was willing to do it what are the odds amen he was the only one that could he was going to he had to be a kinsman a near kinsman and in redeeming naomi he got ruth hallelujah he's the only one who met all the requirements to redeem naomi and mary ruth he said brother branham said that was jesus boaz typing christ when he redeemed israel he got the gentile bride he said so then you see so very beautiful we have it on tape i'm sure here somewhere you'd like to have it i want to stop there because i've been just a little over 30 minutes and i i want to move on to some things that is important about this redeemer before we move on into some things that brother branham says next week if the lord wills about the godhead and now there's some wonderful things ahead but i want to stop here for just a moment to dwell on this i want us to see how that christ is uniquely qualified to be our redeemer he was uniquely qualified he had to be kin he was human he was born a man he was the god man he had to be worthy and he was worthy he had to be able he didn't want he had to be able to do it and wealthy brother branham says in one place he was able because he was god right so he had to be kin he had to be human but he also had to be able right he had to have the ability to do it he had to have the ability to go and be the mighty conqueror and if not any man could do that every other man that ever went down into the into paradise and stayed there jesus goes down there and unlocks the door and comes back look and he had to be willing i'm so glad he was now in revelation 5 9 it says that they sung a new song saying thou art worthy to take the book now why was he worthy to take the book and to open the seals for you were you were saying right so he was worthy to take the book and open the seals because he was slain because he died on a cross and has redeemed us to god by thy blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation you've redeemed us but so they said you're worthy to take the book because you're slain but he had to be worthy to die for our sins before he was could be worthy to take the book he had to be worthy to die for our sins he had to be born sinless remain sinless and fulfill all that was written in the word and be able to get up and make the claim that in the volume of the book it was written to me now he did that at the same time that he was a human and cried when his friend died think about it for a minute the same time that he he was god and was able to stop a storm he was laying asleep in the boat right the same time that he he his deity was shown by raising lazarus from the dead by speaking to lazarus he cried over his friend's death in the same time that he raised the widow's son he was laying brother branham said they're sitting on a rock with a headache now think about that because many times we think that this somehow this experience that we have of the holy ghost will make us to be perfect in the sense we will never have any problems but god never said that what did it do for him he suffered like no man had ever suffered he could still feel the pain he felt rejected he took it hard when judas left he said you betray the son of man with a kiss it won't make it where you can't feel rejection it won't make it where you can't but what does it do it makes it where you're under control where you respond in the right way the bible says when he was reviled he reviled not again when he he was cursed he threatened not so the holy ghost does not reduce the amount of threatening that comes to you it does not reduce the amount of cursing in fact it increases it because the devil's after you and people can see that you're different they come after you what does the devil do immediately after the the spirit come down on the dove come to the lamb at the river immediately after that he went into the temptation immediately why because that was the that was the devil for trying to make him prove who he was amen and the devil's trying to make you prove who you are but you listen you can stand the same way he did by the word hallelujah and so at the same time that we cannot we cannot think that we're delivered from all the trials of life or even temptation we do believe that we can overcome every one of them are you with me why because the kinsmen did and if that same spirit that was in christ dwelling you will it will also quicken make alive your mortal body so the potential is in you to be that overcomer like he was amen oh and that's why a prophet of god exposes our potentials and shows us what our potentials are in the easter seal and it is the rising of the sun now look he was worthy he had to remain sinless and and we've been taught by the word that we are redeemed right now and and our soul is as redeemed as it will ever be brother branham even makes a statement at future home that we're in that eighth day when it comes to the soul we are we've passed from death into life colossians 1 14 the bible says in whom in whom that's christ we have redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of sins now look let's look at his resume for a moment right you look at boaz's resume he was the only one uniquely qualified he was rich he was right there in the area he was supposed to be in he was rich he was qualified he was willing he was a kinsmen look at the resume of christ if you will tonight and he said brother ben i already know this but listen to me there's a power in your life if you exalt christ in your thinking think about this there's a power have you ever thought about that whenever you exalt sickness sickness takes over whatever you exalt and and this is none of my notes but just just hang with me for a moment whatever you exalt in your thoughts whatever you dwell on is what you become and it's what has power over you so if you exalt sickness listen you've met people like that they exhaust sickness in in their mind they're constantly worried about getting sick and they get sick they've exalted that in their mind if you exalt if you exalt adultery if you exalt whatever it is you'll end up being that if you let it sit there and exalt it in your mind whatever oh my whatever you exalt in your mind i want us to exalt christ for just a moment to make him preeminent in our minds to make him preeminent in our hearts if we can exalt him let's look at his resume see who he is because when we're thinking about him when we're reading about who he is and what he's done what does it do when we exalt him we become him are you with me now it changes our way of thinking notice his resume right up on the top who is the image of the invisible god that's a pretty strong recommendation right there you know i put a lot of things on my resume i won't deny it i put and they're all true but sometimes you don't put all necessarily everything bad right you don't put on there sometimes shows up late during the week you know drinks too much coffee at the office there's things you could put on there that wouldn't be it would look too flattering to you there ain't none of that in him scripture said he's altogether lovely so his resume he could be tell exactly the truth you look at some people and you think they don't match the resume you look at the person and you look at what they've sent and you think that can't be them right because what they've written about themselves can't be them but you look at it sometimes on a resume they'll put some trick questions on there on or on a job application they'll put something on there and say who is your who do you want to emulate who do you want to be like it's on the resume for a kinsmen redeemer the image of the invisible god that's a powerful resume enhancement he is the image he's not trying to be like god hallelujah he's the image of god he's the expression of what god is the fullness of the godhead bodily he's the image of the invisible god he's the firstborn of every creature or creation the firstborn amen now notice paul does not say that christ is an emanation from god or or that he is just something that god used for a while and discarded as someone have you believe even in the message but he is the image of god it's strange to me that people can build their entire career and i'm not preaching in any person or any church but it's a doctrine that's out there that they believe that christ is no different than brother branham and build their entire career on on christ being being lower or being something similar to us in that sense but i've never been able to put that on my resume at least not on my own merit you don't have redemption by my blood or any other anybody else you can't get forgiveness of sins by praying to me i'm i'm i wasn't the image of the invisible god at least not in the flesh you understand i was not the firstborn of every creature but he did not say well christ is is a work of god he said he's god himself image means the exact reproduction amen god reproducing himself pouring all that was in god he poured into christ the exact reproduction he's not one of god's creatures but the highest firstborn of the creation now so it gives him precedence it doesn't refer to time but to position and he says all things were created by him now in verse 16 for by him were all things created so you could get down to the section of the resume that says okay what have you done [Laughter] what did you do you know how you like to if you want to look at your resume you know you look at that and and sometimes on your resume you'll want to put i've had to do several resumes maybe the rest of you haven't had to do this but i have that i've had i've done several i in fact i kept one in case i just got tired of my job or not but i found out too that you got if you if you kept a resume and maybe your bosses don't want to hear this but that if you keep one on hand you never know when the opportunity might come up and you can update it and send it out and and everybody's looking for somebody who's already working so the best time to look for jobs when you already have one right and and but in my resume what did you do well we were the best title company in the region you know i could say that but i could never claim it completely by myself right and some people might be bold enough to do that and say well i was just that or the other but no matter where you were if you were that turtle sitting on a post somebody puts you there right and and so there's always somebody that helps you but by him amen were all things created don't tell me he's just another man although he was a man when he was poured down and come down into in that fleshly body he was a man but don't tell me he was just a man because by him were all things created that are in heaven that are in earth visible and invisible amen you can put on there i've created things you've never seen think about that one for a moment he even created the devil he did i made it the devil cannot claim if the devil was true you realize why the devil couldn't be the redeemer couldn't be the kinsman he couldn't claim to have created anything but this lamb of god who was worthy this one was worthy by him all things were created visible in this invisible whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him you get a pretty good job if you could tell them you created the law of gravity huh you know newton newton could get a good job probably after he realized the apple always fell down got hit in the head by that apple i believe it was isaac newton got hit ahead by that apple enough times he could probably get a good job anywhere hey i'm the guy you know i'm the guy that this one created the tree and the apple and the gravity exalt him in your thoughts tonight don't you realize that if he created the apple and the tree and the gravity he's able to take care of whatever's going on in your life he's able to take care of your children and your grandchildren he's able to take care of your marriage he's able to take care of your situation whatever that it is no matter how dark it may be and like i said i know i hear from people week after week that struggle that really struggle in their lives but remember if you're struggling the one that you serve the one that's in you greater is he than he that's in the world greater is he and he's not somewhere else we're not talking about a god that lived 2 000 years ago we're not talking about somebody sitting on the throne somewhere in heaven we're talking about one who sits on the throne of our hearts amen all things were created by him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist all things consist that word actually means to hold together he holds all things together he got a big job just holding me together but he can hold the church together he can hold your family together why by him all things consist all things are held together by him the universe and the planets and everything they don't go spinning out of control that's why we don't worry too much yes we we're concerned for our friend and our friends and family when a pandemic comes on the earth but by him all things consists he holds all things together he's able listen if it got if it got so bad that no one else had a job you would still god somehow there would be a way that you would be fed you've seen that the one who holds all things together somehow has held you in a workplace somehow it's allowed you to live somehow it's to put enough money in the bank that you'd be able to cover your bills somehow he's covered he's held your life together amen think about how big he must be if he could put on the resume i created all things everything visible and invisible and i also held together the life of ben pruitt i also held together the life amen amen of every person sitting here today every person streaming every person that's ever ever created that that was his he holds them together by him all things consists even allows politics to come and go and things to happen even though the devil we know is in charge of those things but god allows it he holds all things together people laugh at him and curse him make fun of him and by him all things consist they wouldn't even know what it was like to live if it wasn't for him like a brother branham likened it to a pig at the bottom of an apple tree and he never does look up to see where it's coming from and they sit down and curse his name make fun of him call call his people holy rollers and everything else bunch of cults and everything else and they don't realize that by him their very life consists he allows them to live and even look at his look at his enemy see by the way you treat your enemies that's how you know a big man by the way he's he's so not scared listen sometimes we get paranoid i've watched pastors get paranoid of other churches paranoid of everybody else around them and it's a terrible thing because god is not paranoid at all he's so not paranoid that he gives rain to the just and the unjust he's not worried about him getting too powerful he allows satan to operate in satan's eden he's not worried about him getting too powerful because by him all things consist you know the confidence that you have with your little child when they're little mine are getting bigger so i don't have quite as much confidence as i used to but when they're little what do you say i brought you into this world i can take you out you may have never said that but i have and i wouldn't actually do it but you understand i brought them into the world i have a little bit of confidence when it comes to telling them what to do i'm not afraid to i'm not afraid they're going to get too big for me because i bet see by him all things consist the devil can't never get too big for him the world can't spin too far out of control we can't get too deep and labor to see it we can't things can't get so dark you can't be so sick that god jehovah god who created the heavens and the earth and then poured himself and manifested himself in christ the anointed word that that that being cannot take care of your life today hallelujah are you still with me tonight he's before all things by him all things consists and he is the head of the body the church amen who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in how many things all things he might have the preeminence for it pleased the father that in him should all fullness dwell and having made peace to the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things unto himself by him i say whether there be things in earth or things in heaven by him he's going to reconcile and what that means is that we listen we've had this redemption but yet it is his work to bring about a full redemption not anybody else's it's his work amen listen it's not our work to bring about full redemption as his work why because in hebrews 13 8 it tells us jesus christ is the same yesterday and today and forever now look we are redeemed yet we are waiting for redemption listen galatians 3 13 christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law he made a curse for us first peter 1 18 for as much as you know you were not redeemed with corruptable things as silver and gold from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers but with the precious blood of christ you are redeemed right your soul is as redeemed as you'll ever be if there is a future work of redemption you understand you are redeemed you are being redeemed you will be redeemed hang with me for a moment because god's going to claim your body now we're going to get to it in the breach but that's what he's doing see that's what this message is about it was redemption amen it was redemption just like when he come the first time for redemption he come this time in what brother branham called this claiming work now look you say well there's no future redemption what is jesus talking about then when he says lift up your heads your redemption draweth nigh when you see these things begin to come to pass in romans 8 28 8 23 rather not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit we have the holy ghost we are redeemed but even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to win or which is this the redemption of our body ephesians 1 14 speaking of the holy ghost he said it's the earnest of our inheritance i got two minutes left hang with me is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession until the redemption it's a purchased possession but it's going to be fully redeemed amen unto the praise of his glory ephesians 4 30 and this is ephesians placing us and showing us what we are what we will be look ephesians 4 30. grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby you're sealed unto what unto the day of redemption until the day of redemption see he had to redeem israel you know in the old testament is full of redemption but it mostly speaks of israel's redemption it speaks of redemption for a nation and that redemption had to be put on hold but it's his work that did it right but he's cut but he he comes back to the earth after the marriage supper and finishes that work right there's a redemption yet for israel and there's a redemption yet for us which is the change of the body which is him claiming us as the human beings we were meant to be now look maybe you haven't heard it put this way but just think it through and and you'll say yeah that's you know that's what brother branham taught now look now brother random says redemption has two different parts think about this as we close he said come out of and entering into first you have to come out some people wants to bring the world in with them but you've got to come out of the world to enter into christ you have to have both parts you can't have one without the other and that's why we still preach coming out and going in too for most of us we're preaching going in too right because if i preach coming out every service come out of the world come out of the world come out of the world you've already left the world most of you huh but there's children here there's others that will sit among us that need to come out right that's the first part of redemption first you have to come out some people wants to bring the world in with them you've got to come out of the world to enter into christ you have to come out of unbelief to enter into faith he said there cannot be one thing in your way to really have genuine faith you must absolutely leave everything that's contrary to the word of god behind to enter into faith ponder that for a moment you're not going to get that at the baptist church i'm sorry they can tell you what the word says what the king james version meant some of them used the king james version i can tell you what that says but listen what a prophet of god said you're going to have to leave everything behind to enter into faith hallelujah oh where should we be living church that's a message of coming in too look he said that was the book of the ephesians of the old testament joshua he said where moses represented the law could not save no one but grace could and here joshua is the same word like jesus jehovah's savior amen now you go into that you look at the type of joshua you could say joshua is a type of the holy ghost right brother branham also said joshua was was his ministry right he said that he said we'll be like caleb that's what i want to be everybody wants to be the joshua that brings the people in but the message of entering in was already preached it's true the message of entering in and that's why every little excuse expression tom dick and harry that gets up and wants to proclaim themselves the man who's going to be joshua and take you into the deep things of god most of the time all they'll make is a mess because they don't stay with the joshua of the hour the holy spirit always goes back to the message of the hour right it's not going to take you down some some road and i've experienced that in my life most of the places where people thought we have a special revelation what they have is confusion which is even anti-word and i say let's let's come out of that it's time to come out of that and go in to the truth of the message of the hour which has already been preached to us and yet like i said we dig into these things and we understand them in a way that they didn't back there why because we have that opportunity we should use it right and there's revelation i believe that still comes to you personally but we're not going to have another prophet or another word or another preacher come and say well i'm going to take you in we've already had that ministry and we're going in hallelujah i don't know about you i'm not waiting on somebody to come and take me into the land i'm going into the land right now in fact i'm looking around it right now and seeing how good it is and what the grapes look like and everything else i know what it looks like hey man it's been described to me and i know what it looks like and what it is hey man musicians go ahead and come i went three minutes over tonight i'm better than usual look i won't tell you what over what but now look brother branham says it now he said that here joshua the same word like jesus jehovah's savior and now then we find out that we have to come to another ephesians another ephesus now another ephesus now another ephesians where that in our intellectual denominations whether they're message denominations or baptist denominations or pentecostal denominations in our intellectual denominations and so forth and all of our educational programs has come to its jordan amen it can't cross over into the land our intellectual denominations our educational programs has come to its jordan then we must have an ephesians again we must have an exodus to come out and to go into for the rapture we must have an exodus to come out and to go into for the rapture what does brother branham call that the claiming time the lamb has the book in his hand and he comes to claim what he's redeemed now that won't be finished you got to be careful with that because people say well that means mercy's over no he won't be finished with his claiming work until every last seed has been expressed on the earth has come you understand but the remember when that last one comes in but this is that hour and that's why you have to see the opening of the word or you can't go in right you have to see the opening lord you have to understand that the book is open or you can't go in because you'll never you you don't know what to go into you're waiting on somebody else to come and lead you into the land when joshua already went in so you stop at kadesh barnea and fight and fuss and everything else instead of going in we're going in now we've been talking about going in for a long time but you know what it may take a long time but we're going in we may walk each one of us our own path but we're going in look he walks out to claim his subjects that's what the breach is about he walks out to claim his subjects but who does the lamb does the lamb at the end time amen then if he claims us now what has he done and by the message of the hour he's claimed our souls by the message of the hour that's why brother joe how could you leave the message if you've been claimed to buy it right you can't leave it if it's something that has claimed you you didn't claim it you can claim the message and leave it but you can't be claimed by the message of the hour and leave it you might try to run but you can't hide you may fall flat on your face but you got to get back up and i'd rather see somebody that fell flat multiple times and got back up because they've been claimed and somebody just lived out of it right they just lived out of it they they say oh i believe in a prophet i believe oh come out of her my people but did you go in to the claiming work because if you don't see the opening of the word you don't know what to go into and you're waiting on something to happen brother say we must have an exodus to come out and to go into for the rapture and i'm here to tell you that that's what this message is all about aren't you glad that we still have that promise we still have that message today do you believe it tonight amen do you love him is he exalted in your hearts is he exalted in your thoughts he holds everything together and if he's that powerful then if he's continuing his work it didn't stop in 1963 he wasn't done amen the son of man a son of man came to reveal the son of man a son of man went off the face of the earth but the son of man is still here that's why we can say the pillar of fire is still here because the son of man is still here the pillar of fire is still here the word is still here the holy ghost is still here christ came for you amen one day he's going to claim these bodies if he claims your soul by the message of the hour one day he's going to claim your body doesn't that give you confidence doesn't that make you feel like you can run through a troop and jump over a wall because it doesn't matter what's going on he that is in me has already claimed my soul he's already done the work my kinsmen redeemer i'm just going to lay at his feet amen amen do you love him remember alan come and we'll just close tonight you'd be praying for me and brother stewart the lord willing is going to preach sunday morning would you be praying for me as we get into these things and be praying for one another especially brother robert and his mother and the different ones that have a need of healing we believe that if the lamb if he's the same yesterday today and forever he's the same tonight and he's able to take care of anything so if you have a need just just claim it because he's already claimed your soul claim it and and walk into it because i believe that he'll do it for you you have a need whatever it is in your body his word is true and he is the word and the holy ghost in you is able to enforce that word in your life and make it real you believe that tonight amen let's bow our heads heavenly father we thank you lord for bringing us together again on a wednesday night thank you for giving us this confidence lord lord as i end this service my heart leaps for joy not because i did a good job because i didn't lord it's just so much more could be said but because i know lord that if you've begun a good work you're going to finish it what we've committed unto you you're going to do you're going to perform on that day we thank you for that lord but now we see you at the end time actually doing what you promised to do we're so grateful for that lord you come and showed us who you were because you wanted to be partners with man again during this time during the token time lord you want to live right here with us walk in us lord and we want to be your hands and
