serve a great big God and he's alive well this morning I'm going to try to sing a song and I've got some family that's going to help me out and so uh not trying to sing a special that my brother told me to so I have to listen to what the older brother says she loved the Lord this morning I could get uh Esther and Peter up here as well so glad to have family around and in church with us and I know those of you that have family with you in church you're happy to have your family as well and always good to be able to have family but we're the family of God we're all family together but I got thinking about my blessings and how God has just really blessed my life and one of those blessings is family so we're going to try to sing this together I used to sing it and I don't have the voice for it anymore brother Joel's going to sing the versus not I hope it's a blessing to you we've got things to thank him for and and we know how to say thank you we want to do that this morning this morning well I don't know about the future I don't understand something about the past [Music] I don't know why some things happen I don't know why something's end and others last I don't know the Rhymes and reasons I don't understand the words some people pray oh yes but when I see had a mercy Lord protect me from the dangers in my way Island I don't have to say things [Music] through the hours [Music] there are times today when angels stood around me and I couldn't even see oh yes well there were times when I was hurting then you stepped in and took the pain from me holding there were moments when you stopped me Lord so I could smell the roses by the road thank you Lord and though I'm not the wisest person there are some things that be all the doubt I know I know how to say thank

[Music] amen thank the Lord and that's all the music we'll have this morning amen amen don't you love the Lord isn't he good to you in his his word is always true and he always keeps his word and that's what we want to talk about this morning how he's kept his word and and it's a positive thing something that something that actually is true in our lives and we can say yea and amen to the word of God amen amen Genesis chapter 15 and verse 18. Genesis 15 and 18 and then we'll read Joshua 21 43 and 44. you could have each and every one of you with us this morning it's always a blessing and uh to have all of you our visitors this morning and each one and I know there's many many that are out this morning traveling or uh or sick and be praying for them this morning and those that are watching or praying for you as well Genesis 15 18 in the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram saying unto thy seed have I given this land from the river of Egypt to the Great River the river Euphrates and then Joshua 21 43 and the lord gave unto Israel all the land someone say all the land the lord gave unto Israel all the land which he swear to give unto their fathers and they possessed it and dwelt therein and the lord gave them rest round about according to all that he swear unto their fathers and there stood not a man of all their enemies before them the Lord delivered all their enemies into their hand I pray the Lord without his Blessing to the word you may be seated this morning we don't often take time to reflect on what God has done in fact I think many times we tend to dwell on what Satan has done and what he can do and the power that he has and and he does have power but it's only power delegated to him by An Almighty all-sufficient Sovereign God and I think we need to recognize that more we don't need to be like the proverbial pig that was under the tree and and he was eating apples off the ground but he never did look up to see where the apples come from but I mean apples come from somewhere we need to look up and see that God is with us and and that he deserves the praise and the glory because he kept his word and I believe we can say that in the past tense this morning whatever you're going through whatever situation of life you find yourself in whether you're a young person whether you're an elder whether you're sick whether you're well but whatever situation of life that you find yourself in this morning I believe you can look back at your life and say he kept his word I wasn't always faithful but he was always faithful I wasn't always what I should be but he was always what he should be to me he was always my protector he was always my guide he was always my my the one who held me amen when I couldn't hold myself he held me aren't you glad for that today amen he was always there at every moment of my life in the down times in the up times David said wither shall I flee from thy presence where am I going to go to get away from him he said if I flee with the wings of the morning behold you're there if I make my bed in hell behold you're there you're always with me here you're omnipresent everywhere that I go you're there and your goodness follows after me aren't you glad for that today amen so God is all together positive yes yes you ever think about that and I read a a quote last week or the week before about that and it got me thinking on these lines we Trend toward the negative we're geared that way because in our minds we want to protect ourselves and so we're geared even as children too uh not touch the stove because it's hot we learn to be afraid of things but God isn't afraid of anything right you realize that he's not afraid of anything there's nothing he can't overcome nothing's going to take him out there's nothing he only allows the devil to do what he does for the purpose of redemption but he only allows things that make things better and that's hard for us to see looking at it from our level but he said my thoughts are not your thoughts and my waves are not your ways so God is always positive there is no negativity in God right now you know God keeps his word and and when uh Paul in the Corinthians when he was talking to the Corinthian Church about how that they uh he was going to come to them and you find in First Corinthians he's already been there once and then he writes him a letter and he writes a pretty sternly worded letter and then he says he's going to come back but before he comes back a second time he actually begins to talk to the people there in Corinth and and he begins to explain to them that uh he thought it would be better to write a letter and some of them interpreted that as Paul doesn't want to see us Paul doesn't care about us and also Paul doesn't keep his word and so Paul takes that and he turns it around and he says there he says in second Corinthians 1 17 he said when I therefore was thus minded in other words I was intending to come to you he said did I use lightness or the things that I purpose do I purpose according to the flesh that with me there should be yay yay and Nae Nae in other words was it did I just say it to say it to make you feel better he said I really intend to come yes I really intend to come and and so they they say well Paul don't keep this word he said I do keep my word he said because I'm a servant of God right and as God is true our word toward you was not yay and nay it was not negative and positive positive and negative it was all yay in other words it was yes this is what we're going to do this was our intention he said for the Son of God Jesus Christ who was preached among you by us even by me and sylvanus and timotheus was not yay and name but in him was yay so in other words everything about Jesus was a promise was the Fulfillment of a promise there was no negativity he was going to a cross to be crucified he was going to be beaten and to be and to be spit on but there was no negativity in that yeah I hope you can hear me today there was no negativity in Gethsemane there was no negativity yes there was there was hardship yes there was trouble yes there was a struggle but no negativity and if we could just understand that in our life we may be going through some things but it's all yea in God there's no yay and nay but it's all amen it's all yes God intends for it to happen it may be hard right now but God allowed it to happen for my good because the Bible says all things yes all things someone say that this morning all things work together for the good to them that love God who are the called according to his purpose amen so he said our word was not yay and nay and in him was yay he said for all someone say all all the promises of God in him are yet and in him a man or so be it unto the glory of God by us yes yes all are yea everything about him was positive and so we look begin to look at that and I saw some things that brother Brandon said about that he said so what are we worried about what are we stewing about why do we go along with a great big long face said let's look up in grin look up not only grin but laugh not only laugh but raise up holy hands everywhere giving praise and glory to God for his promises is yea and amen not yes and no not yes and no but yes there's no no in it there is no negativity in election you think about that for just a moment God called you and elected you and chose you to be a child of God we know the scriptures bear that out Ephesians chapter 1 in Romans chapter 8 and many other scriptures bear that out John chapter 17. many scriptures bear out the election of the individual when it comes to the things of God and we know in the Old Testament that that was shown in Abraham Abraham was typed election it shows us God called him he wasn't looking for God he wasn't out there oh searching all the different denominations he was happy doing what he did being a pagan but God spoke to Abraham picked him out of all the people on the Earth at that time and said Abraham you're going to be my servant I'm going to bless you I'm going to make you in your name a blessing I'm gonna I'm gonna call through you make the Earth the families of the earth be blessed so and and that was positivity there's no negativity in that amen there's no negativity in election God calls Man by election for knowledge no man can come to me except my father draws him first and all that comes I'll give them eternal life and raise them up at the last day that settles it so I'm so happy this morning to know one thing that Christianity has no negative nothing to it it's everything absolutely positive yes again I know that's hard for some of us to hear because just by Nature we we tend to want to settle in and our woes and and our blues and and think about all the bad things that have happened but even the worst thing that ever happened in your life God allowed it to happen yes for your good right and that's difficult when you face big questions existential questions about life and think about things like the Holocaust how could that be the tender hand of Jehovah how could that be god let's ask a question when I was in the Philippines young people asked me a question said how could a loving God take the children of Jericho and put them to the sword how could that how could you get anything positive out of that but we go back to the nature of God and all the promises of God are yea right they're all amen and you look at those things you begin to wonder how could it possibly be but that's where you got to trust the mind of God and the intent of God in your life you've got to move past a common understanding of life's troubles and say well I must have not done something right or I must have must have been something that happened that may not be it at all Jesus told his disciples they said they said this man was born blind and they said was it his fault or his parents and Jesus said neither he said it was for the glory of God God allowed him to be blind from his birth so that he could show his glory in him so there's not yes and no not yes and no there's no no in it I know that's bad English but there's no no in it are you with me this morning now so now everything is absolutely positive if a man that becomes a child of God has a positive hold on Calvary and Calvary has a positive hold on him with the Assurance brother Peter if you can catch up with me there and I'm moving a little bit fast for him he's a positive hold on him with the Assurance by almighty God by an oath to himself that he will raise him up in the last day and take him to Glory there's not no if or or or and there's not no if or and or nothing it's something that's positive yes now there's a caveat to that in the sense that you have to be born again you have to become a you have to be a child of God so election by itself is not what uh what is not the new birth but it causes you to have the new birth does that make sense it it puts you in a place to be born again and if you are the elected of God you'll be born again but when the word comes across your path but you still have to be born again you have to accept Christ you have to believe you have to come to God you have to give up the world and the things of the world so that's when it becomes all when it's all positive is on his side on our side we've got to get some things up so your life has to compare with the Bible said now you can be mentally worked up or emotionally worked up and just imagine your faith but when your spirit Bears record with his spirit and your life Compares with God's Bible you've got a pretty good conception it's all at peace that's right but if it don't compare with that you better come back again listen if you don't love him with all your heart how many loves him this morning this is how we ought to love God we ought to love him with all our hearts with all our might with all our soul with all our minds that that's the Commandment of God if sin if sin doesn't make you tremble at the thoughts of it you better come back and be sure you need to be born again you might have danced in the spirits you might have spoke with tongues you might have put your name on every Church book in the city you might have been baptized three times forward backward sprinkled I won't have nothing to do with it not one thing you've got to be born again something that takes place a regeneration you become a new creation we still believe in the New Birth around here we still believe in an old-time religion we're a man or a woman or a boy or girl becomes saved by the power of God and becomes different aren't you glad he found you one day you weren't looking for him but he came looking for you and he found you and he changed you that's positive are you with me now yes all things just passed away All Things become new you're you got a new look on everything the birds sing different your enemies that you could once not stand you love them you really love them and Everything's changed then you know you've passed from death to life he said by this show you know all men know that you're my disciples that you love one another yeah that's right he didn't say how much word how much knowledge how much understanding but that you love one another notice Abraham was given the promise that's the first scripture that we read was the promise Joshua saw the Fulfillment of it now we know that everything wasn't perfect and sometimes this morning in the season of Thanksgiving we need to look Beyond uh the uh the little things and and the little problems and the minor issues that we see and look to the Unseen and be able to see a promise fulfilled in spite of the difficulty so here was a promise that was given to Joshua and yet they had not all taken every piece of the land fact Jerusalem wouldn't be taken for many many more years during the time of David so there was land yet to be taken brother Danny but yet he looked at it and said it's all done right it's all taken care of what was he doing he was saying God kept his word and if he kept his word to save me he'll keep his word to heal me if he keeps his word to heal me he'll keep his word to help my children if he keeps his word with that he'll keep his word in the church wherever he kept his word before I can look back and say he kept his work and because he kept his word I can rejoice in that and believe that we'll continue to possess the land we'll continue to make it ours we'll continue to take the promises of the Bible and make those our own or aren't you glad that you can do that this morning so now he kept his word in spite of all the difficulties he did what he promised he would do and this is what I want to say to you this morning as a church can we stand here it's Word of Life Tabernacle in 2022 and say the same thing can we not just say he will keep his word but he kept his word I believe we can yes if you're a Christian today I believe you can say that but we can also as a church I believe we can look back and say he kept his word we didn't always do what was right we didn't always make the right decisions we're human beings we're fallible but he kept his word he did what he promised he would do and that's why we have life this morning that's why we're here that's why we can come together he kept his word amen now let's look at some specifics of how he kept his word to give them the land and kind of bring that to today I imagine when amram and and djokabed had a little baby boy that the promise never looked farther away than it did at that moment because things had gotten worse they had put not only the men but the women to work they had they had made them make bricks without straw they'd caused many difficulties to come into their life they were slaves in a Strange Land and so they were sitting there and the economy was so difficult and life was so difficult everything about what they were doing was so difficult and and yet they had this baby boy now what are we going to do with a baby boy in the midst of all this difficulty what are we going to do with a child even though they believed he was a goodly child they believed he was the promised son that was to come the one to deliver but yet they they couldn't understand how is God going to keep him safe and one of the ways that God kept his word is by protecting Moses during that time now watch here Moses is is going into a great situation that he should have died during that time you remember the Bible says that Moses was born into the lamb and when Pharaoh knew that the promise of the deliverer was coming what did he do he caused the the wicked old witches of that day the the women that have never had any children he made them come down there and and uh and it wasn't it was just women that were just awful and they didn't have any love for children and they come down there and and they uh they they killed the babies they threw them to the crocodiles you know the story the crocodiles got fat off of children developed a taste for them and so they walked down through that time and and hear that the firstborn baby was to be killed so the soldiers were going house to house knocking on the door listening for crying babies it was a despotic situation and we think about how awful it is today when we send our kids to school and we have to when we had we don't know whether to homeschool them or send them to public school if you send them there's all kinds of sharks in the water all kinds of alligators waiting on them but if you keep them at home they've got other issues that you have to deal with at home and really no place is safe because of the internet because of all these things that are around us it seems like every place is just full of crocodiles that are out there to eat them but you realize if God intended your children to be here and to overcome and label to see us that he will keep them safe even though the crocodiles are in the water even though everything looks like it's going against them and so what did they do during a time like that you've got to commit that baby to the water that's what they did to Moses that's what we've got to do to our children commit them to the water so they committed him to the water and they built a a a little Arc out of with tar and pitched it and and they put it in the water in the most dangerous place that there was and it was carried from them them not knowing where it would end up but by the Providence of God there were angels watching over that little baby and the angels held back the alligators and the crocodiles all along the Nile River where I've been there to that River and I've looked and I've seen that and I imagine what it must have been like at that time because now the the pollution has killed off all the crocodiles but back then the crocodiles were there and and they were in the river and they began to I can imagine what that River's not a small stream it's not like the Spring River even it's a great big wide long river they didn't know that he wouldn't have ended up out in the ocean somewhere but they put him in the water anyway because they trusted God if this is the one he's going to make it and we commit our children to the water and so here they come here he comes he's guarded by angels and he actually comes into the home of pharaoh which should have been a death sentence but God gave him favor favor with Pharaoh's daughter so that he could be he could be alive oh my God's able to do that for us do you believe that not only that I've seen him do it huh we see how good God's been to us I think of a story of that was told of an old man back in the South his name was Gabe and he never would go to church hardly go once in a while with his wife but he just he wasn't a Believer he'd never been baptized and he never given his heart to the Lord and he got to be an old man and one day but he was friends with the preacher one day he went hunting with him and they went hunting back then for for game actually to get something to eat unlike us most of us go hunting to spend money now some of y'all get something actually some deer I saw that deer by the chip I my goodness you need to talk to brother Stewart and see tell him how you did it y'all need to get together today but but in that day they would they would get game for actual food they needed it and so they went out and they began to shoot some squirrels and rabbits to some different game that was out there and they'd come back in the evening the sun's setting and old gabies he's walking along there and just loaded down and Gabe was a poor shot he just couldn't hit the broad side of a barn but that day the God had given him he blessed him with food and so he's walking along there and he realizes I've got enough for my family for quite a while some time and as he's walking along he begins to think here I don't attend church regularly I don't do like I should I don't I don't do the things that I should do that I know I should do I've never been baptized and yet God loves me so much that he put these squirrels in the trees and and these rabbits on the ground so that I could kill some are you with me this morning he loved me so much that he took care of me and he and and he told the pastor he said pastor he said tomorrow I want to be a baptized I'm going to give my heart to the Lord he said I want to be baptized in the church he said he said well Gabe he said what sermon was it that I preached that caused you to give your heart to the Lord he said it wasn't that he said I just began to think about the goodness of God to an old sinner like Gabe well I wonder if we could just look at that that ought to be enough for us to turn our attention towards God and just to give our heart to him today just the fact that he's done so so many good things for us even in the natural if we could just look behind our shoulder and see how good God's been to us just see his goodness to the center to see that he's brought you safe thus far he's sitting in your right mind at least some of us look back who's fed you who's clothed you when those breaks were streaking and the car almost rammed you who protected you then every one of you has a story like that when you've been almost at the point of an accident almost at the point of death and God brought you back who did that for you God did that who protected you then who was that hour of sickness when the doctor shook his head and said I don't know no more to do but you're here tonight look back a little piece and see what happened and to you Christian take a look around and see the sinful world look on the internet look in the papers look at the sinful world how it is and to know that God before the foundation of the world chose you by election put your name on the Lamb's Book of Life knocked at your heart and you opened up and let him come in how good he is can you say Amen to that this morning how good he is he knocked on the door of my heart in that moment when I needed him the most amen hey man we are kept by the power of God the Bible tells us that in First Peter chapter 1 and verse 3. he said blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ which according to His abundant Mercy has begotten us again unto a lively Hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead to an inheritance Incorruptible and undefiled that faith not away and served in heaven for you that ought to tell you he chose you because it was reserved in heaven for you that's what the Bible says who are kept by the power of God kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time brother Branham went through a great time of trouble in his life loosen his baby and his wife and children and everything and somebody said to me he said did you keep your religion I said no it kept me see I had an absolute to know that someday I'll see them again I couldn't have made it if I hadn't had an absolute something to grab a hold of it means the difference it made the difference in me when I was tired where I was tied because I knew that I'd see them again oh that ought to be our absolute today I know I'll see them again even death itself can't separate me from the love of God Hallelujah how else did God lead his children how did he bring about the promise how did he keep his word he did it by protecting Moses he did it during the Wilderness after their Deliverance by providing a brass serpent a smitten Rock and the shout of the king I think it's really interesting what the Bible says about Balaam if you go and study Balaam Balaam was a real prophet but he was false in the sense that he gave away he gave into the pressure of influence and money and he gave in to the fact that balak and he taught him how to make Israel sin so he's false in that sense but he had a real prophetic gift and so balak hires Balaam to curse the children of Israel you all know the story how Balaam goes down there and the donkey talks to him you think God don't have a sense of humor he can make a donkey talk you may be hearing from one this morning I'll put it on myself and my brother Joel again but but he can use a donkey and to speak to the prophet he was the most hard-headed animal there is to speak to the prophet and tell the prophet hey you shouldn't be going down here these are God's people that's not mine anointed and so in numbers 23 and 18 you know the story you know the story how he goes anyway and God gives him permission and his permissive will allows him to go and so in numbers 23 and 18 Balaam being an actual prophet he begins to prophesy and he took up his Parable and said rise up balak and here hearken unto me thou son of support God is not a man that he should lie God kept his word neither the son of man that he should repent hath he said and shall he not do it hath he spoken shall he not make it good behold I have received commandment to bless and he hath blessed and I cannot reverse it amen oh my if we could just get a revelation of that what God is blessed man even a prophet cannot cannot reverse it and you'd quit caring so much what other people said about you if you knew that the blessing of God on your life cannot be reversed yes even by a prophet you understand that the South Phoenician woman had a revelation that we need she's sitting there and and Jesus himself spoke to her and said it's not meat for me to take the children's bread and give it to dogs and that didn't stop her she said but it's the dogs the little dogs even eat the crumbs that fall from the master's table oh my I can't reverse what God has blessed God intended for her daughter to be healed and she wouldn't even let Jesus stand in the way of that right understand when he said it but he said it testing her and he responded and he said I've not seen such great faith in Israel oh my what what kind of an attitude ought to we to have to the things of God listen he said what he is blessed I cannot reverse it he hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob and what that means is he refuses to look at it now if you understand imputation in the old and the New Testament when God chooses a people he does not choose them and then just allow them to do bad things but he imputes righteousness to them and Abraham he said his faith was counted for righteousness and what that means that word imputed it literally means not that not that uh not that he just covered it over or forgot about it but he actually filled up the account that's what that word means to fill up the account of righteousness so in Abraham when you go into the New Testament it says he staggered not at the promise of God but if you go in the Old Testament begin to look at his life you begin to realize it was a couple times he was out of the will of God but in the New Testament he said he staggered not why he hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob yes yes oh my oh God we ought to have the attitude that God has sometimes God has not beheld iniquity in Jacob neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel listen when God Saves you when he give you the Holy Ghost he does not go back then and make make and punish you for the things that have gone on in your past he does not look at that and begin to think well now he will correct you he will you things in life just in the natural will bear fruit if you sow bad things you'll get bad things but God himself doesn't even see yes sir right that's what the Bible says he puts it in the sea of his forgetfulness and he put up a sign said no fishing yeah amen there's nobody that can go who who can lay anything that Paul said to the charge of God's elect right it's God that justifies and and we don't condone sin but if you really get a revelation of what God's done for you you'll quit it or you'll love him with all of your heart he hasn't seen perverseness in Israel people do people look at the church and say well you know a bunch of backslid layout of seeing people I know we're affected by that yeah I know we could walk up here I could find something to criticize I heard a preacher say that he said I want to preach good things and the promises of God but it just can't because there's just so much to criticize were you just looking at the wrong thing yeah or you're preaching to the wrong people yeah I'm preaching to the blood Sons and Daughters of God are you with me now I realize not everybody I preached to is going to make it but somebody is or God wouldn't have called me to preach there's got to be somebody out there brother John with Allen brother Stewart got to be somebody out there for us to reach out to or God wouldn't have called us he wouldn't have put a gift in our life if there wasn't somebody that we can reach out to somebody that can hear us so let me preach to them there's got to be something good to say the children of God there's got to be something good to say that sons of The King and I realize sometimes we need correction we need skinned up one side and down the other but sometimes we need to hear who we are and we need to hear the promises of God that the promises are true the devil's doing everything he can to tell you that the promises are not true but the promises of God are all true they're yea and amen not one of them will fall to the ground Hallelujah he's not beheld iniquity in Jacob the Lord his God is with him and the shout of the king is among them God brought them out of Egypt you have this it were the strength of a unicorn surely there is no enchantment against Jacob neither is there any divination against Israel according to this time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel what hath God wrought you see when God gets hold of a man he'll make even his enemies testify but what was Balaam and balak missing now what could they not see in the natural when Balaam went up there in the first place and when he offered his advice to Balaam or to balak the king what what did they not see they couldn't see the providential supply that God had placed in the children of Israel and I believe all of us could look back at our own lives and say God has provided certain things atonements in our life he's provided food when we needed it he's provided pastors when we needed it he's provided he's provided deacons and Sunday school teachers and elders and people we could look up to in the moments when we needed it the most he provided it's a church family when we needed it what did he do he provided those things for us those provisions of Grace that were given to us right right and so Balaam and balak didn't understand that now they were fundamentally sound they offered the same kind of sacrifices that Moses did they had celebrity with him he had the king he had all the Great Men the princes and the eunuch standing with him but there was one standing with Moses that he didn't see that's who stood with Amos speaking of the Old Testament Prophet that too will stand with every person that's here tonight you believe that this morning that's who stands with you that same one he don't see the one standing with you who will stand with every person that's here tonight that'll stand for God in righteousness no matter how much potentates monarchs is there doesn't have one thing to do with it they'll never be able to curse what God is best oh I'm so thankful for that today so many people have tried to say that's the end of that church that's the end of that preacher there's the end of that person so many people we can look back have tried to stand there on the hill and say they've done too many bad things there's too much in the past there's too much that's went on but they don't see a smitten Rock they don't see a brass surfing they don't see healing in the water amen see that what God is blessed you cannot curse if you can kill it God didn't start it right are you with me now they'll never be able to curse what God has blessed why it's a living seed it's a word of God it'll grow to its perfection oh my oh signs of the Living God in the camp he said that looked like that Israel had done wrong down there but they failed to see that smitten Rock and that atonement being made for Israel I tell you church we got a lot to be thankful for yeah and there was a shout of the king in the camp God was with them why he was Healing The Sick and doing great Miracles and signs and wonders a pillar of fire hung over them Moses was following the pillar of fire the children of Israel was following Moses and they were on the road to the promised land and there's nothing going to stop them oh my we're in that same position today don't let the devil tell you oh he stopped us no he hasn't right they wandered in the wilderness for 40 years because their own unbelief but the devil didn't stop them unbelief does not hinder God brother says oh could it not be easily repeated today if God could get somebody in his hand in his control that Pillar of Fire is still alive I come from God it's eternal it's still alive that Pillar of Fire is still alive he's still the same yesterday today and forever the word still is Hallelujah the word still is I'll use one last example here and then we'll close how did he keep them by the leadership of Joshua now think about it kept his word by the leadership of Joshua and so now Moses is dying is going away in Joshua 1 1 after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass that the Lord speaking to Joshua the son of none Moses Minister the servant saying Moses my servant is dead now therefore arise go over this Jordan thou and all these people unto the land which I do give to them even to the children of Israel every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that have I given unto you as I said unto Moses now he wasn't going to take away the fight they were still going to have to fight but he was going to make he was going to tilt the odds completely in their favor right so they would never be defeated as long as they were following the word I'm here to tell you you there's nothing negative in the word of God today as long as you follow that word you cannot be defeated right it's when we get away from the word that's when we get from behind our protection but now he said from the Wilderness in this Lebanon even into the Great River he's restating the promises of Genesis to Abraham he said the river Euphrates all the land of the Hittites unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your Coast what we have iron clad proof in the nation of Israel today that God keeps his word yes right God keeps his word I I may I don't know if I'll be able to get away but if I am I may have an opportunity to go to Israel this year and I'm thinking about going because I want to see that but it's proof it's living proof today that God keeps his word God does what he said he would do do you believe that today God does what he said he would do right he does not ever lie and the fact that there's a nation of Israel today they may be flawed in many different ways but the fact that there is a nation there is proof God said God keeps his word he said there will be Nations surrounding Israel and they'll all hate him but God keeps his word hey man that ought to be a proof to us as the spiritual Seed of Abraham God keeps his wife even over hundreds and thousands of years here Joshua stands 5 years after Abraham was given the promise 500 years later Joshua stood there and God told him again he said here it is and Joshua when he got to the end of his life he said God kept his word amen amen there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life I love this as I was with Moses so I will be with thee will not fail thee nor forsake thee strong and of a good courage under this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance to land which I swear unto their fathers to give them now there's something that people don't understand here because God does change he the method and the way that he works in different ages he but he doesn't change what he does and he doesn't change the fact that he is the one who does it right because there is times that God changes how he works through different dispensations and we know that from the story of Moses and Joshua Joshua he said as I was with Moses I will be with thee and so you would expect a pillar of fire and a pillar of cloud to lead them into the land but when they get to the land there's no Pillar of Fire now think about it there's no pillar of clout but something had happened notice what he says Joshua he said only be thou strong and very courageous the thumb is observe to do according to all the law which Moses and my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or to the left thumb is Prosper with orsoever thou goeth again the pillar of fire was no longer visible when they crossed over but Joshua now he's going to contemplate believing that God keeps his word he's going to contemplate what he's going to do and so he walks up to the walls of Jericho and begins to look at him and I'm sure he looked at him and he said well they're too strong maybe we could build ladders and go up over the top of them because he didn't know exactly what God was going to do but God was fixing to reveal that to him and the way he was going to reveal that to him was through the angel of the host the captain of The Host which was Christ in another form you remember the pillar of fire was Christ the logos that come from God build our fire is not the son of man it's the anointing but it's that part of Christ it indwelt Christ there was no Pillar of Fire when Christ was on the Earth because he was the pillar of fire it was inside of him but when he died the pillar of fire divided itself among those who received the Holy Ghost we have it today right that's the Holy Ghost but now Joshua is seeing the embodiment the pillar of fire becoming flesh right in front of him oh my so he it wasn't above him it wasn't he wasn't like the pillar of fire the pillar of cloud wasn't during the time in the Tabernacle but now he was a man of war he was going to go in with him and he was going to fight for him and Joshua pulled his sword and run to meet him and the man pulled his sword and come to meet Joshua and Joshua raised his hand and said are you for us or for our enemies and he said no I'm not for either I'm the captain of the host of the Lord he said oh my what had happened the pillar of fire had been made flesh standing here a pre-figure of the Lord Jesus Christ the captain of the host of the Lord Joshua 6 2. the Lord said it to Joshua see I have given into thine hand Jericho now this is the captain of the host speaking to Joshua he said I've given into thine hand Jericho and the King thereof and the Mighty Men of Valor who come past the city all you Men of War and go round about the city wants thus shalt thou do six days but in the seventh age I'm going to change my methods watch in the seventh day they're you're not going to go around once you're going to go around seven times seven priests shall bear the Ark of the seven trumpets of Ram's horns bear before the ark seven trumpets of Ram's horns and the seventh day you should come past the city seven times and the priests shall blow with the trumpets and it shall come to pass that when they make a long blast with the Ram's Horn when you hear the sound of the trumpet all the people shall Shout with a great shout notice that the shout was in the mouths of the people that's where the message is today and the wall of the city shall fall down flat and the people shall Ascend up every man straight before him now Jericho was the key to Canaan yeah Jericho was what unlocked or we could say opened up the land of Canaan we could say it this way Jericho was the open book right it was sealed it had walls around it but the walls were fixing to come down and so there was a there had to come the Moses Ministry had to change to a Joshua Ministry so that then they could come to Jericho I hope you're following me this morning they could come to Jericho Huma and the walls could come down now we know when they come around seven times that that was the seventh Church age and I believe that's what we're living in today it was the type of that so we're living now but watch where we're living we're living on the other side of Jericho we're living where I read in Joshua 21 where he said God has kept his word yes yes there's still a few cities to take yes there's some work to be done but God has kept his word we heard a shout and the walls came down are you hearing me today the walls came down and the book came open and we walked into our land we say what came open this book the word become a new Bible to us we've been it was the same Bible but there was a light shown on it we could see what God was doing oh my God and so Joshua being a type of the Holy Ghost and the type of the messenger of this day our type is Caleb how many believe that today that's our type it's Caleb but the Holy Ghost is still eating hey man the pillar of fire never died but the Holy Ghost is still eating today Joshua could look back after going through all that trust struggle he could look back and say God kept his word and if we type that now to the opening of The Seven Seals we begin to look at it as I'm hurrying now to close and we begin to look at it in that light the god of Heaven promised evening time would have evening light in other words we had to have something we had to have an understanding to go in a Rapture because we had to have faith for a rapture and so brother Brandon would stand there with some point in his ministry he would stand there like Joshua he said three years ago this mystery was a prophecy what time is it sir but now it's history yes yes hallelujah it's past the walls that fell down the promise is fulfilled why can't people get through that the promise is fulfilled you won't be looking for something else if you know that the promise has been fulfilled God kept his word what time is it sir and what's this attraction God fulfilling his word he's the same yesterday today and forever how many believe it today God has promised his word how it would be fulfilled and how it would come to pass when he chose his bride how it would be done it's happening right before you in the name of the Lord he said and that's by the original word the evening time message is here the evening promise of the Seven Seals of Revelation 10 Malachi 4 Luke 30 and 10 read Deuteronomy 4 that's Luke 17 30 Deuteronomy 4 1-4 and then the 25th and 26th first now I want to go and read that because he said see what he said about about it for this last day God kept his word do you believe it today Deuteronomy 4 and 1. now therefore hearken o Israel unto the statutes unto the judgments which I teach you to do them that you may live and go in and possess the land which the Lord God of your father has given to you you shall not add unto the word which I command you neither shall you diminish heart from it neither shall you diminish ought from it don't take stuff out and say it's past right I would say in the past you can't do it anymore like healing and miracles and things like that you can't do that you can't take it out can't take preachers out right God still does it today that you may keep the Commandments of the Lord your God which I command you your eyes have seen what the Lord did because of Bell peor all the men that followed belpure the Lord thy God hath destroyed them from among you now watch but ye that did cleave unto the Lord your God oh what a testimony this is this morning I know this is very personal but even for you watching this morning I remember the JT is probably watching this morning if he's able and sister cleteth in different ones that that have been here over the uh through the years have been in the message of the hour and some of you have been in this church for 30 years and so you know you you know there's been battles you know there's been struggles but you can look back and see the scripture and this he said look at this and see what God promised in this day he said but you that did cleave unto the Lord your God you see that word cleave is the same word that's used for a marriage when a man leaves his mother and father and Cleaves to his wife you cleave to God in that way you went to church you took your children to church you love God with all of your heart you cleaved to God and brother Dan you can testify today sister Vicki you can testify you that did cleave unto the Lord your God are alive yeah right and I don't believe he just meant that that they were that they were uh naturally alive but they were alive are you with me now oh my there was others there were many others that fell during the 40 Years of wilderness Journey they were wandering in the wilderness for 40 years because they would not go in and possess the land but there was two Joshua and Caleb who did go in who did possess the land right amen and those that cleave to the Lord their God were alive every one of you this day that's my testimony you can testify of death all you want to you can say the message has gone downhill you can say that there's nothing left but I'll say this we that cleave to the Lord Our God we that loved them with all of our heart all of our soul and our mind we're still here we're still alive we're still kicking and we're not giving up we're not letting the devil drag us back into denomination we're not letting him drag us back into the layout of SIA we believe the word of God has been revealed and you that cleave to the Lord your God are alive every one of you this day oh that ought to be a shouting grounds this morning hey man you that cleave to the Lord your God Stakes but you stuck with it yeah amen but then he said verse 25 and 26 and he gives a warning he said when thou shall beget children and children's children you shall remain long in the land and shall corrupt yourselves make a grave an image of the likeness of anything so do evil inside of the Lord thy God to provoke him to anger I call Heaven and Earth to witness against you this day you shall soon utterly perish from off the land where until you go over Jordan to possess it you shall not prolong your days upon it but shall utterly be destroyed what is it children stay with the word stay with the word I want to testify this morning that those who cleave to God God will keep them that was a just a little boy preaching coming into this area when I was 15 16 17 years old and I come in this area and I've preach to some of you and I preach the word of God the same word I preached today well I've learned a lot I I found a lot of treasures in the in the scripture of God but I'm cleaving to the same word that I cleave to 25 years ago I'm cleaning to that same word and I believe that God has kept me I'm here to testify this morning I'm not just talking about myself you're here to testify today God keeps his word yes sir yes sir or some young couples that can testify God keeps his word in a marriage there's some there's some older couples that can testify God keeps his word with children don't you add one thing he said this was Moses saying to Israel keep every word don't add one thing that Prophet had been up there and seen that word of God it was wrote out to him and Vindicated by God's own handwriting it he said you keep every word don't you add one thing to it or take one thing from it he said if you take if you do God will take you apart from the book of life it shows you wasn't his seed but remember everything someone say everything everything that God has promised us oh that ought to make us excited today that ought to Thrill our hearts the message ought to be the thrill of our hearts today everything that God has promised us everything that God spoke to us everything that's been told to you in the name of the Lord has happened God has never made one promise no but he's kept every promise that he said he has told us has been the truth and he goes on to talk about how for 20 years he preached in Shreveport he said I'd take you to record today women past bearing men children afflictions healing prophecy things that would happen not one of them has ever failed stay away from those denominations they're leading you to death why not not because the people are bad but because denominationalism takes the word the way they their Creed says to take it if you don't agree with it you have to leave but we believe the whole scripture yes we believe the fullness of the word if it's God in God's word we believe it huh it don't matter what I say if you take what I say over the word you're no better than Catholicism right if you take what any other man says over the word it's no better than Catholicism take the word he kept his word let's look at one example of this and we'll close and Joshua gets done with Jericho it's pretty shook up the only ones that survived was Rahab they put everything to the sword and they ports the city put fire put it to fire tore it down the rubble you couldn't even find the rubble they're going back and digging in Jericho today and they find just just little pieces of rock God shook it to pieces tell you what that's coming for this nation it's coming for our world but Joshua told the people he said don't you build them walls yeah cursed be the man before the Lord that rises up and buildeth the City Jericho he shall lay the foundation in his firstborn in his youngest son it's really set up the gates of it so in other words while he's building it his children will die and so he'll name a wall after his one oldest son and a gate at the end after his youngest son oh God don't rebuild the walls we've got freedom to worship god let's not rebuild those walls you finally did that in the days of Ahab in First Kings 16 33 Ahab made a Grove and Ahab did more to provoke the Lord God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel that were before him in his days did Heil the bethelite build Jericho he laid the foundation thereof and I Byram is firstborn set up the gates thereof and his youngest son see God in other words he named him after him because they died according to the word of the Lord would you speak by Joshua the son of none this was hundreds of years later but God keeps his word as the musicians come this morning has he kept his word to us if you'll keep his word let's not rebuild those walls Let's Stay Free could you tell you testify today did you stand with me and testify God kept his word he has kept his word the word of Life Tabernacle he's kept his word to every family represented here I say he has he has kept his word he's kept what he said these signs shall follow them to believe he has kept his

free people let's take the land we bow our heads together Heavenly Father maybe there would be someone here this morning that's not sure Lord that you keep your word I pray your Holy Spirit would go
