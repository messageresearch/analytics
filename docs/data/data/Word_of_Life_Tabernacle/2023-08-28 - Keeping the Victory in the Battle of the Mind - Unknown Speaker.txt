amen [Music] love the presence of the Lord Philippians chapter 4 and verse 6 Philippians 4 6 and 7. appreciable Allen taking the time this afternoon I appreciate you taking the time to sit some of you sit through that and thank you for that and also watch the children and things it could be helpful to us everything we need is in the scriptures and it's based on the scriptures all of our life you say well that my particular situation is different but there's a foundation there that we have if the Holy Spirit if you let the Holy Spirit teach you those things then you can begin to be different we want to be different don't we we want to be different from the world we don't all have to be the same but we sure want to live our lives according to the word amen Philippians 4 6. I want to continue to talk to you about victory in the battle of the Mind talk to you tonight about keeping the victory in the battle of the Mind be careful for nothing in other words don't be anxious about anything but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God and the peace of God which passeth all understanding in other words it'll be there when it shouldn't be there's no reason for the peace of God to be there but it'll be there amen shall keep your hearts notice that word keep so keep your hearts and Minds through Christ Jesus pray the Lord with that is blessing to the word you may be seated we believe in Victory amen we believe that it is possible to have a victory in the battle of the mind you say well I'll always be fighting sure Satan is going to come right back in fact brother Branham tells us uh in that message that we were studying this morning he said but the devil will try to come right back the devil will try to come right back he said if he can get in there at all he's got your army routed right then and so he wants to come back that's his job and and he's good at his job if you look out in the world today nobody's got any peace nobody's got any Joy nobody's got any ability to really really touch uh really have those things at all in their life and just tore up all the time anxious all the time and many times we are too because we fight those same battles but remember Victory Is Possible and the Victory is we found out this morning was not the victory is not necessarily the complete healing but Victory is faith faith is the victory he said faith is the victory over our worry faith is the victory over anxiety faith is the victory over trouble faith is the victory over sickness yeah how many believe that tonight faith is the victory Faith does not bring the victory faith is the victory and so if you think about it's going to be a little bit different tonight maybe but uh just hang with me for a moment if you think about the uh the rings of the Mind The Body Soul and Spirit and you begin to think about those things and you realize that uh that it's like a city as we said this morning there's an outer wall an outer defense and in that defenses five gates that's uh that see a taste feel smelling here and then on the inside is another city and in that City there's five more gates and uh you you have inside of that you've got imagination and reason and affection and memory and all of those things that you don't want to I'm going to switch Mike's here brother Peter all Spirit realm yeah and and so those things I remember at one time you were without any government at all you were you were without any kind of uh any kind of ability to get rid of an anxious thought you you didn't have the ability to have peace in your home you didn't have ability to have peace on the job but now you do now what happened is on the inside so there's an inner wall there's an outer wall but on the inside there's a keep there there's a palace there's a place there's a stronghold and that is the soul and inside of that there's been a new king that's taken up residence on the inside of the inside aren't you glad that you're part of that Kingdom today so if that King is reigning on the inside then it begins to flow out of you if we unstop the flu and and we make sure that all the channels are open Out of You flows love and joy and peace and all those things are you with me so far so you're if you say you're being because that's what Satan is fighting against is you it's a battle for you so your being is a Sovereign Nation not you and your neighbor not you even in your your family but you right you you you're you're a Sovereign Nation and Sovereign Nations cannot keep the peace with an open border policy I'm not talking about politics now but you are you are ruled by the King of Kings is that right right and so you set up borders you uh in these walls that have been built there there's walls of the word that are there to protect you they're not there to bind you they're not there to keep you back but they're going to go to protect you from the things that would come in and destroy your life so you set up walls of the word all around you and but but these gates are still there and I've often thought you know if you've ever watched an old movie that uh they're picking a walled City I've always thought why don't they just do away with the gate well you're tired this afternoon you ever thought about that brother Ben you're stupid what no if you ever thought about that well there's a gate what's the gate for like hello they've got this wall and there's a weak spot and where does the Army the enemy Army always come against the gate why do they do that well the reason the Heather gate is because you need to let in some things right there's some things that have to be let in or the city will serve to death yeah so there has to be a gate and also to let things out right right so there's got to be a gate so when the gates these things are set up for our benefit not to hurt us to even the the senses of our body are not set up to hurt us but they're set up for our benefit but there's gate there there's a gate there yeah yeah and so you've got uh you've got control over it now think about it you've got control over the border of your mind are you with me now all right so now brother Brandon says if you've got your senses see taste feel smelling here they're all right but don't trust them unless they agree with the word all right all right amen they're all right but if they disagree with the word don't you listen to them he said now imaginations conscience memories reasons affections they're all right if they agree with the word but if your affection doesn't agree with the word get rid of it all right yeah you blow flu right quick if your reason disagrees with the word get away from it yeah that's right if your memory if your imagination if your conscience anything disagrees with that what's on the inside get rid of it now so Paul teaches us in second Corinthians 10 5 casting down imaginations and every High thing someone say every where every High thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ so in other words we're going to we're going to arrest our thoughts we're going to stop them at the border we're going to stop them at the gate right now whose job is it to stop it at the gate is it the pastor's job who's the border patrol agent come on now I am you are it's not your job to keep me happy right keep me in the in the life of us my job yeah yeah right are you with me they said well oh you can't do that for yourself no but I can't if the king is there yeah all right the king is there amen right so I'm born again yeah and the answer to all of her problems is not just to keep going back well I must not be born again I failed Build That Wall yeah yes stop them at the gate quit giving in there is Victory the devil's been lying to you the devil's killed you over and over again you can't have victory over that just like he tried to do to brother Branham my Mayo Clinic told him he said you'll never get victory over that we saw that this morning but but God showed him he would have the victory remember he said that squirrel was only six inches long yeah remember there is going to be Victory you can have Victory you can win the battle in the mind you can live with joy you can live with peace there is no reason for there to be church drama all the time there's no reason for the big trouble in your home constantly there's no reason for you to backslide over and over again there's no reason to be in and out and up and down he can have the victory you can stand for something you can be a nation that doesn't just let anything in come on now you got to cast these things down now remember we dropped the atomic bomb of faith you use the 22 rifle all right didn't sneak around with a pop a cap gun or a pellet gun but we dropped an atomic bomb yeah on on on the enemy yeah yeah and that was f-a-i-t-h brother Brandon said faith in the word of God yeah so that atomic bomb is dropped on the enemy and then when he's dropped on the enemy what happens well the enemy just blows all over the place you know well now you've got to keep him out because the truth is he's going to come back now so you've got Victory maybe maybe you you've been baptized you received the Baptist of the Holy Ghost you just stand there and all you're rejoicing you're so happy everything's going good you you just got like feels like you just got back from Camp you know everything's good and young people understand what I'm talking about some of you older people just like you had a good nap hahaha everything's going good everything's just just just fine and and and everything's everything's going well and then all of a sudden you get hit by an attack well I thought I had the victory you do have the victory faith is the picture you your nation is strong enough to overcome any attack that comes against it you have the word of God on your side you've got the presence of God with you he's come he's with you you have the message of the hour so he's come to protect you and to keep you but you've got to decide to stay in it so brother Brown says it it must be accepted in the mind and then it's believed with the heart then the word of God becomes a reality then every sense of soul and body is just scoured out with the Holy Spirit then your sense of God your conscience of God everything that's Godly flows through you there's not a doubt anywhere there's nothing can rise up nothing can come up in the memory and say well I remember Miss Jones tried to trust God Miss so and so miss doe tried to trust God for healing one time and she's fail but if that channel has been cleared out and been purged and been filled on the inside with the Holy Spirit that'll even come in memory no matter about Miss Jones and what she did it's you and God together nobody else but you two yeah there you are there's your battle now watch watch what he says he said kill him at the beginning yeah yeah stop him dead in his tracks it ain't how long you can make the war linger and stop it right now yeah you aren't more spiritual because you don't know if you're a savior you're not right that doesn't make you more spiritual you know you you got to stop him at some point at some point you need to you need to put the hammer down yeah yeah you need to you need to receive the blessing of God and believe God's word and move forward [Music] it's good that's good now he said if you're coming you'll keep them memories and conscious everything think about well I might fail it might not be right he said don't you do that at all you throw aside everything someone say everything everything audience participation night by the way everything amen and when you throw aside everything and open up the channel and say God your word is eternally true and it's for me if the whole church fails if the whole world fails yet I can't fail reality I can't fail because I'm taking your word so you are the border patrol agent now I need you to decide if you're gonna let that thought in or keep it out now the worst thing you can do is just sit there and take it right you you get you do have a decision right you you have a an authority it's given to you yeah that's right if they put somebody down at the border that was afraid to stop anybody he wouldn't do any good he'd lose his job right and so a man that's there he's got a badge he's got a gun he's at the border he's he's securing something he's he's watching over something yeah and what he's watching for is any traveler that would come by that would disrupt the program of the government that's currently in power right so the government that's in power is the government of the word yes the government of God where Christ has the preeminence the message of the hour that's where we live yeah right so so you as a border patrol agent you get to stand there and watch it at the borders of your mind and you get to stand there at those Gates and you and you get to watch and take every thought and and stop it for a moment right slow it down right don't just wave it through well my pastor said my church said no stop it you have a right to stop it right you don't have to put up with nonsense you don't have to put up with stuff to stop the word come on oh so and so said it it must be right you know we've done it this way for 50 years but what does the king say yeah what what kind of government do you have that your government is not a government of you and the pastor and the King this gets hard tonight but it's just the truth that's not the government the government is you and the key your pastor is there to preach the word but he's not there to keep out all the problems all right all the thoughts that come through that's our job all he can do is teach you to do that now you're the border patrol agent and so there's applicants coming by I told you it'd be different tonight people coming by for a Visa you know they come up here you know you know I'm on just a traveler just a tourist you remember when we went to Egypt what we did in Egypt you'll never forget that will you what we did in Egypt is would cross the border remember what they told us they said man it's gonna be so hard brother Wilson sent me videos from YouTube over and over again how hard it's going to be when we got to Egypt and I was scared to death to be honest with you we thought they were gonna we were carrying Contraband material message books I guess I guess it's safe to say it now we were we were sneaking stuff in that that shouldn't have you know shouldn't cross the border that's outlawed there and so we you know we were nervous so we had that one suitcase full of books and and so and we thought we'd seen these videos where if you come in if you're a photographer or something like that they'll take your cameras away I had my iPad with me I was scared to death I was going to lose my iPad I was going to lose all this equipment and things that we had I was gonna you know preacher can't preach anymore without an iPad so I was going to worry about that you know and and all the things that I hadn't and you know what when we got there but we didn't call ourselves preachers we didn't call her so we called ourselves tourists so we come in as tourists and when we come in as tourists say you know they waved Us in basically like it's one of the easiest security we've ever been through remember it was it was like it's nothing all this build up all this fear it's nothing they just let us in why because we come in as a tourist and come to find out they wanted our money yeah they want every American Tourist they can get and so it wasn't really that hard although we've been led to believe it was very difficult now the country itself was very difficult but the across the border was not really that hard at all and so we began to we begin to realize they wanted us we were wanted now there's other people they gave a hard time yeah yeah right those stories are real they gave them a hard time they didn't want them there yeah but they wanted us there well I hope you hear me now that's the way you have to be right you as a Sovereign Nation if I could put it that way uh you you go ahead and pay your taxes that's all right you you pay your taxes to the government all that I'm talking about spiritually you with you and God your government is you and God you go to church you listen to your pastor all those things but your government is you and God so you don't have to let just any thought yeah come on now right right come through your mind it's like this one looks pretty good I'll let him in but not this one but you've got to have some standard to judge that box so we begin to see people come now we're going to apply for a Visa and I put this on the slide so you just see what I'm looking at but now you just the way my mind works so up to the gate of imaginations come a sad little thought just come on Jason come here buddy I gave imagination man be sad just a sad little thought it come up for the border patrol agent oh oh nobody treats you right buddy you got some ID and he hands me his ID and it's nobody loves you first middle and last thing go sit down with Jason it's a sad little thought [Music] it comes they come I think there's more of those than any of them you know you know right oh I don't know if I'm gonna make it I just nobody loves me nobody cares about I'm not making fun of you tonight and how many times that sad little thought come in okay nobody noticed me today and I wore my best clothes I'll just come on Wednesday in my jeans so you would anyway so that's right nobody noticed me everybody kinda you know just kept their distance from me well why don't you just keep that thought out you have a lot less trouble see this little thought is going to come in and cause dissension in the government he's always going to be whispering he's going to be backbiting he's going to be spreading pamphlets all over the place and telling stories and and doing that and he don't belong there right right Hallelujah he don't belong in the government of God so what are you going to do you got to get you got to make a decision got to make a decision now he's got he's got a reason for traveling right yeah and his reason is well it didn't get invited to the party boy getting quiet well they thought of everybody else but me yeah well it looks like a good reason man I he's gonna be nothing but trouble what should we do now you get to make the decision what should we do should we approve the Visa got my stamp you know yes or no yes or no Visa denied why because we have a king and thus saith the king the king says a man that hath friends must show himself friendly and there's a friend that sticketh closer than a brother so if everybody else gives up on you God will never give up on you the king says greater love hath no man than this then a man lay down his life for his friends King says all right so we're starting real good you guys made a good decision let's let's keep going this is all right yeah come on I'm sorry I know it's not the way you do it but you aren't the pastor so gate of conscience all right now here comes here comes another Traveler right and this one's usually a self-righteous Pharisee man he's all the people in church that you ever knew that disapproved of everything you ever did hahaha whether it was in the word or not they they had high opinions of their own opinions yeah right so he's traveled along he he's a self-righteous Pharisee he's going to come through and you aren't really a Christian oh my maybe I'll let him in seems to know what he's talking about but does he agree with the word you you aren't going to make it look look at you you're a sorry you're a sorry for you you look at your family look at look at what the mistakes have been they've made look at the mistakes you've made you're you're a sorry person why why but no wait a minute what what are you gonna do what decision are you going to make come on Church what are we going to do should we stamp it yes or no why thus saith the king yeah yeah save the king repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sin and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and I followed that prescription I swallowed that pill yeah I followed him in baptism I received the baptism of the Holy Ghost he has no right to tell me that I can't make it through [Applause] are you with me so far yeah brother Brandon said listen brother you're never saved by any sign you're never saved by any sensation you're saved when you meet God's condition of his word and nothing else someone say nothing else nothing else so you say bye that's right God's word has made a way you're not safe because you feel like you're safe I'm not I'm not saved because I feel like I'm saved because a lot of times I don't feel that way but I'm saved because God gave the promise God's conditions and upon God's holy word I can defeat Satan seven days in a week and as many nights cause it's God's word I may believe that today either here is my word and believeth on him that sent me hands everlasting life and shall not come to judgment but it's passed from death into life that's what the King of Kings says [Music] thus saith the king kick him out but brother Ben I feel bad I made a mistake first John 2 on my little children these things write unto you that you sin not and if any man sin we have an advocate with the father Jesus Christ the righteous and he is the propitiation for our sins in other words he paid the price for us Hallelujah not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world let's move on I'm not going to hold you long tonight there's this game of memory well it's a tough one keep them thoughts out of the Gate of memory because it comes along like a little old man or a little old woman just walking a little thought I remember when you were younger all the mistakes yeah his identity is sins of the past he's got a reason for traveling huh maybe you saw somebody used to party with everybody's got a past maybe somebody come around that made you uncomfortable yeah because you know what kind of person you were the last time you met that person yeah but you're not that person anymore but he comes through and begins to travel through oh I remember I remember I remember when you were a child and how bad you were in church huh I knew then that you would never be a proper child you would never those are probably the preachers today what are we gonna do about this thought think about it for a minute what are we gonna do about it he's gonna let it well you know I did it did you come on that's you saying it or the word saying I did it what does God have to say about it you say brother Ben this is what you did I say prove it yeah I got video evidence I got photography evidence you can't prove it by the word yeah by the word I've been released from that thing what are we gonna do we're gonna let him in yes or no you're getting good why thus said the king come now and let us reason together saith the Lord though your sins be a Scarlet they should be white as snow though they be red like Crimson they sure be as well he said as far as the East is from the West so far has he removed our transgressions from us Colossians today you are complete in him which is the head of all principality and Power in whom also you are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands and putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ buried with him in baptism wherein also you are risen do you hear the king speaking tonight this is his word this is his manual this is why we're kicking that thought out who has raised him from the dead you being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh have to be quickened together with him having forgiven you all trespassers I love this verse blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us which was contrary to us and took it out of the way nailing it to his cross he just blotted it out Hallelujah you could not read the accusation once it had been blotted out who am I and having spoiled principalities in Paris who made a show of them openly triumphing over them in it but the Branham says you're standing I know you've heard it before but think about it now you know you know this why let that thought in yeah right why is he not getting stopped at the border he said God you never sent it the first place God don't even know nothing it's in the sea of forgetfulness you never did it you were accused of it by the accuser but really from the beginning you were predestinated to be a son and daughter of God you're standing there was your old book of divorcement is put away it's dead absolutely out of existence even in the mind of God sin has been placed in the bleach of the blood of God that he said on Calvary is that what we believe you stand on the sea of glass clear as Crystal brother said it wasn't the sea that was mingled with fire because you'd already been judged and found clean no judgment in it at all the saith the king Hallelujah there's another gate a gate of reason negative reason you know the thing is you you got to be careful because there's certain of these Gates you probably have no problem with but other ones that you do so you got to deal with the ones you have a problem with you need to really watch that one yeah yeah some of you some people believe anything a preacher tells them and the appearance of this thought many times it's like a preacher an angel of Light with reason yeah yeah and his identity is that he offers you surely you won't die it's reason for traveling is a paycheck boy he'll let you know why would you go to a message Church why why bother to do that why why live that way you don't have to live that way and he takes the Bible and he takes history and he takes all these things and he tries to weave it together surely you won't die tell you what that's the fastest one you ought to get out your stamp the Visa denied are you gonna let him in no no why why should you not let him in thus saith the king though we or an angel from heaven come on preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you let him be a curse Satan and Eden when he first come to those these attacks to attack a person but the brother said he knew the children of God was fortified with the word he said Satan attacked the word this is important he never attacked a being you'd say well Satan's attacking me no he attacks the word first he could never get to you if it wasn't for the word getting the word out of the way first so before Satan attacks you physically mentally all those ways he attacks the word in your mind he attacks the word he tries to make you think less of it he tries to make it less special to you he tries to tell you that it don't really matter yeah right that's his job but we have a job kick that sucker out of here I get him out he don't belong in the kingdom of God get rid of it now watch brothers look at that sneaker lizard what he does today first thing he can't lay it on and he said you can't lay it on him well that's not a good person and that's a good person but the only thing he tries to do no matter how good the person is is to get them to deny that word yeah that's just one thing he wants you to do get you to deny that word and the word is what it is church it's not it's not as interpreted by the word is what it is God interprets his own word by bringing it to pass yeah so Satan tried to attack the word of the Garden of Eden so he had to have something now that he could use so the human being would look better than the word he had to have something that would look better to the human being than a word and you know what he used reasoning just what we'd say now listen common sense yeah right I'm gonna get really down where we live for a minute I heard a preacher say well you just have common sense you wouldn't need much of the message that's not what a prophet said common sense what's common sense common sense is like well it makes sense just to do it a certain way just just the way it is it don't make sense to sit in church all day preaching doesn't make sense I know you got to have common sense in your everyday life but don't apply that to the word you can't take your common sense because Common Sense isn't so common anymore you might not have quite as much common sense as you thought you did you're much better off those with common sense looked at Abraham and said there's no way you can ever have a baby but Abraham had more than Common Sense Abraham had a sixth sense [Music] right right Common Sense is a good thing until it goes against the word that's right so brother random said reasoning just what we'd say common sense so that's what he used and he succeeded so that's what he used all along Common Sense yeah yeah reasoning well it don't it's just not reasonable now watch let's let every man's word be alive but God's be true how about that what are we gonna do with him don't let him in see if you don't let him in he can't come in and start doing damage now if I didn't want brother Joel to be in my house I invite brother Joel to my house but he'd eat a lot less if he wasn't in there I know he can take this while I pick on Joe that's the only reason but members all together all the time but see if I never invited him in he couldn't lay back in my chair I couldn't kick his shoes off house would smell better all right all right so so if I never let him in you know if he just but once he's in he can do what he wants but the brander says he'll wreak havoc if he gets in don't let him in it's not how long you fight the battle let's get it over with yeah drop the atomic bomb of faith on it good stop it at the beginning quit entertaining it yeah the problem is you got some of these Travelers coming by your way and you're entertaining them kill the fatted calf for that sad little thought yeah let's have us a pity party me and you tell me more God help me tonight there's a gate of affection this is the last one affection it's appearance pretty you're handsome huh oh it looks good it's identities you deserve this you deserve this it has a reason for traveling boredom frustration well my wife you know she my husband you don't treat me like he should you know well that's an issue but you need to talk to your husband are you with me now yeah because if you're not careful somebody some slick girl come in and talk to you now think spiritually as well but but in a natural sense how many times does that happen you you go out with somebody you want to be around somebody because they smell good I don't know why teenagers would ever like each other then if that was the case well I like the car he drives well that's the way this Slicker comes it's pretty or handsome and for for men today we fight a battle how to battle with our eyes in our mind but you know if you would if you if you'd make a covenant with your eyes you'd have a whole lot better thought life yeah and that's what job said when they accused him of some kind of sin he said I didn't let it in I never committed adultery because I never thought about it and I never thought about it because I made a covenant with my eyes Job 31 1. I made a covenant with my eyes why then should I think upon a mate notice how it goes I made a covenant with my eyeballs I turned my head why then should I think upon a maid Matthew 5 28 Jesus said whosoever looking on a woman to lust After Earth have committed adultery with her already in his heart I don't want some adulterous spirit in my life how am I going to keep it out stop it at the door now he said brother Ben is a long list man getting tired of saying no to people getting tired of stamping that passport rejected rejected well there are some things you can let in do you know that Philippians 4 8 finally Brethren here's your list this is the approved list border patrol officials listen now this is your approved list you let these things in whatsoever things are true not what everything's call themselves true but whatever things are true if it's proven to be true whatever things are honest yeah yeah Hallelujah whatever things are just whatever things are pure whatever things are lovely that's a long list it whatever things are of good report if there be any virtue if there be any praise think on these things so you're standing there at the door for the Jeff and you keep you've kept out adultery you've kept out thoughts you've kept out imagination you've kept out that sad little thought all those things have been kept out but what are you going to let in here comes Faith along I'll let some of that in here comes Joy Here Comes peace I'm going to let some of that in I need a little bit more peace here in the kingdom of God we need a little bit more of that I'm gonna let that in and sometimes it comes through those same Gates yeah I we remember what God did for us and it blesses us oh can you remember what he did for you one day how he saved you how he brought you out can you remember that God is a good god and he's the same yesterday today in favor can you remember same gate but he comes in that gate of memory and you just wave him on why because that's one of the things that's on the list men some praise I'm not gonna stop that why are so many Customs officials in this message stopping at the day to praise what's the point well I'm gonna stop you you might do some damage how people if you if you want to accuse me of loving God too much that's all right yeah because the Bible says that there be any praise the Bible says let everything that hath prayer breath praise the Lord that includes me so let me let that in yeah I'm gonna let these other things out yeah anything with a true or honest identity whatever is just whatever is pure whatever is lovely whatever's of good report virtue praise you're standing there with your Gates all covered you realize what this is you say but I'm working brother man I'm struggling no you got Victory you're living in Victory you're not living in defeat because you got borders all you say about hope I can only be out in the bid out in the world if I could only be known you got Victory now because you're living behind the wall the wall is not your parents the wall is not the church the wall is the word Hallelujah everything's in order like God's Army in the heavens but the parents said what you caught then you got a solar system hallelujah it's God set the stars in order and said hang there till I call you and they stay there nothing's going to move them when God can get a man in his hands till he can get senses conscience everything cleaned out get rid of all them Travelers till it stands with God behind it in the spirit there's not a devil in the world can poke it down in there he'd come around and say you don't feel better your conscience has even gone to that the flu is so clear it shouts Hallelujah the outlet blows a whistle glory to God it shines out certainly just as clean and clear for the word of God to work through the power of God who do you love him tonight I know it's hard sometimes you feels pretty good what that thought in if you let him in he's going to wreck your house I can't tell you the damage that's been done by the wrong thoughts I also could never describe the victories that have been won by people letting in the right thoughts it's that simple just letting in the right thoughts I'll get Melancholy and said but brother Ben I lost a loved one I had trouble but look where they are the same faith for them that you have for yourself look look where they are I mean you don't understand that that sad little thought comes around and it's just it's just so easy to let in because [Music] it's me just the way I am just just I just can't get over it if you can start today enforcing your border your life will change [Music] the thing is some of the propaganda that these Travelers spread you know it isn't true [Music] do you listen to it

thought anything floating around in the kingdom of God say well I gotta let him in the battle's in the mind no you have victory in the mind just let it go [Music] show it the exit take the faith that God has given you and blow that thing out of here don't use psychology don't use all these other things take Faith get rid of it well I'm never going to be well get rid of that thought as we looked at
