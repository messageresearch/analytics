amen amen don't you love him this morning amen turn with us in your Bibles to 2 Corinthians 11 vers verse two want to greet you this morning say it's certainly a privilege and an honor to be here with you this morning and um it's first time I've ever been toward Word of Life Tabernacle and ministered this uh uh ministered here uh we've had brother Ben down our way a couple of times he's been a real blessing to us and uh we certainly appreciate it every time he comes our way and and so we we felt like maybe when he called it was time to time to return that so uh we're here today to to do that but he's been a your pastor has been a blessing to us and a friend and um we just think the world of him in this church here and uh we send you greetings from our little local assembly there at Galina we dismissed some our services this morning so I believe we've got a few of our own Home Folks streaming this morning so I want to say God bless them as well this morning amen so we'll turn our attention right here to the word this morning and uh 2 Corinthians chap 11: 2 we'll read one verse of scripture there then we're going to turn over to Romans chap 11 and we'll begin reading with verse one there but to open let's read here Paul speaking he says for I'm jealous over you with Godly jealousy thank the Lord for I have espoused you to one husband that I may present you as a chased virgin to Christ oh yes amen then Romans chap 11 verse one I say then hath God Cast Away his people God forbid for I also am an Israelite and the Seed of Abraham of The Tribe of Benjamin God hath not Cast Away his people which he fornew oh thank you oh my what ye not what ye not what the scripture saith of Elias how he maketh intercession to God against Israel saying Lord they have killed thy prophets and dig down thine altars and I am left alone and they seek my life but what saith the answer of God unto him I have reserved to myself 7,000 men who have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal even so then at this present time also even so then at this present time also there is a Remnant according to the election of Grace and if by Grace then it is no more of Works otherwise Grace is no more Grace but it but if it be of works then it is no more grace otherwise work is no more work what then Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh but the election have obtained hath obtained it and the rest were blinded God bless you you can have your seats for just a little while this morning I'd like to take a thought if we may this morning if it'd be pleasing to the Lord and I'd like to look at a thought and call it a bride of his own choosing all right a bride of his own choosing now we realize that as we begin to look at this thought and we begin to just lay a little Foundation this morning just a little disclaimer of to the uh to the cameramen back there I'm not much of a Pulpit preacher so you're going to get have your work cut out for you so I apologize for that in advance but uh this morning as we begin to lay a little Foundation we realized that a a that that that a young man we realize that the prophet of God would say he'd say that that God chooses his bride and as a young man would choose his bride amen God also chose His Bride and we realize amen that that that that a young man as he would be amen he would be looking amen for a bride and and he would there would be many different women there would be many different young ladies that would no doubt cross his path amen there would be many no doubt that would would maybe uh uh come across his path but but there would only be one ultimately that would would turn his head amen and and we realize that Christ amen he would he would uh he would uh elect a bride he woulde destinate a bride before the foundation of the world Amen brother Brown said in the invisible Union of the bride of Christ in 1965 he says now that's my message to you Church you that's a union a spiritual union by the word that you're dead to these old husbands and you're born a new don't try to dig him up he's dead if you're born again in Christ that little germ that was predestinated to you it's word coming on word on word on word on Word word and it come into the full stature of Christ that's right so so he can come get his bride he says now we're ready for one thing and that is the coming of the Lord amen we got this one waiting on that one and this one's waiting on this and that and that I'm not waiting on anything other than the coming of the Lord amen you begin to realize amen as we look around the world today amen the world is falling apart amen the world around us amen there there's wars and rumors of wars earthquakes and this and that and the other but look up little bride cuz your Redemption is drawing nigh amen so we realize now that as as we would begin to look we realize amen we we we remember the story that the prophet of God would tell amen of that young lady that and the and the the Rancher's boss how that he would come and he would look for a bride amen and he would come and all of these Brides these young ladies they would be sitting there amen and they would say all the bo the ranchers the the bosses son is coming amen and they would begin to get themselves ready and they would put this on and they would put that on Amen and they would they would stand there in the frill of everything and they would say I'm going to be that one amen that would be elected I'm going to be that one that would be chosen amen and he would walk in and he would begin to see everything that all that them young ladies had done and he would look and it would actually turn his stomach he would say this isn't what I'm looking for amen I'm not looking for the the the the the the the the lights and all of the frill but I'm looking for a genuine honest heart I'm looking for character I'm looking for something that goes much deeper than ski amen so he would begin and it we realize that the prophet of God would say he walked outside and he begin to he seen this young lady walking barefooted and she was washing the dishes come on somebody he was washing the dishes amen and as she was washing the dishes she would be begin to sing a song and something in out side of him identified with something inside of her amen what was it he saw that there was a bride there amen there was something there that was bride materialen so he would come and he would begin to talk to her and he would say he would introduce himself and all my brother Ben she would begin to stutter and she would begin to stumble over herself amen why is the boss's son talking to me I'm not worthy of that I'm not worthy that he would come to my place I'm not worthy that he would talk to me but there was something inside of her that identified with what was inside of him and he come to her and he begin to talk to her and she begin to say I'm not worthy no you're not worthy but he is worthy I don't know where you're at this morning but if you need something from God today is your moment it's your time in the presence of the master amen so he'd begin to talk to her amen and she'd begin to stumble and she would begin to amen she would begin to uh uh uh uh uh uh say what are you doing here why are you talking to me and he'd say I'm not after all of this out here yeah but I'm after something that has character yeah yes sir amen so he would begin to talk to her amen and he would say look he would say I want to tell you something I've seen all of this out there but I'm telling you I'm going back home come on but when you start seeing the the the the the the flow flers out here begin to bud when you start seeing the trees begin to Bud you know that I'm coming back for you you know that after that time when the when the trees begin to bust I'm coming back for you and what was it he said the prophet of God said amen as every day she would begin to as that time would get near and the the trees begin to Bud forth look up little amen amen look what is it see when Israel when that when that fig tree begin to put forth its blood look up your Redemption growing night and you begin to see how that Israel amen where they're at today amen and what they're dealing with what is it it's nothing more than prophecy being fulfilled before you but God has elected you a little bride amen that is ready and willing to take a Rapture oh yeah amen oh my what a happy people we should be today amen knowing that we are a bride of his own choosing amen so he would say whenever that happens amen you just know that I'm on my way back so as that time would begin to come amen she would begin to she would toward the evening time every evening she would put her wedding garment on Amen she would go and she would stand out by the gate and she would watch for this man to come why because he had made a promise to her amen she was she he had made a promise to her he said I'm coming back for you yes sir amen and the prophet of God said this he said that before time began God slipped a wedding band on your finger come on God slipped a wedding band on your finger before ever there was a a flea that batted its high before there was tardust before there was anything God slipped a wedding band on your finger thank you Lord amen how you sitting there this morning I just don't understand preach come on on it's the cold weather got you a little little Frosty come on it's warm in here I'm starting to sweat come on and we ain't even got wound up yet come on Amen now I was torn between several different messages this morning but I ultimately chose this direction am but as that young lady she would at the evening time she would put that wedding garment on and she would stand at the gate and she would watch for this young man to come back why because he had made her a promise that he would do it yeah amen and let me tell you something right now this bride has made herself ready amen and it is the evening time amen and we're standing at the Gate of a Rapture hello we're standing at the Gate of a Rapture amen and our wedding garment is on what is it it is the word yeah amen so we we realized amen that as that would begin to happen amen that that she would stand there and all of a sudden you realize that the the other young ladies they would stand there and they would make fun of her and they would laugh at her and they'd say you're not he was just teasing with you all right you're not really the chosen one he was just he was he was just teasing with you making life amen but nevertheless she had the word of the of her husband amen so they'd stand there and they'd say oh he was just teasing and this and and they would laugh laugh or a scorn yeah amen but nevertheless every evening she would put that wedding garment back on all right onen she would stand there nevertheless looking for the Fulfillment of his word amen and now we're standing on the threshold of Eternity with our wedding garment on dressed in the word of God waiting for the Fulfillment of God's word hallelujah why because God said something about you he said I will have a bride and she'll be without spot she'll be without wrinkle and she will have thus sayith the Lord and when she speaks he speaks when he talks she talk when he walks she walk she's bone of his bone flesh of his flesh life of his life hallelujah what is it it's Christ in you oh yeah come on yes sir amen so now you stand there dressed in the Garment of the word what is it the message of the hour yeah oh come on I wish somebody had start preaching the message amen the way the message was brought I wish somebody would start preaching the way it was brought and not with a man's ideas and a man's and a man Dogma but say what a prophet said I'm just simple enough to believe brother that it will produce a bride I'm simple enough to believe brother that if we'll preach this message that it will produce a bride on problem is is you got too many message theologians all right that's okay you got too many message theologians amen and they got this and they got that and really all it is is them trying to build a kingdom for themselves I'm not interested in building a kingdom for myself but I'm interested in adding to the kingdom of heaven glory to God I'm not interested in in building something for myself it's not about who's the best preacher all right preach come on come on it's not about this or that or the other it's about cry the the the getting the bride together for a Rapture oh thank you Lord amen but the problem is is they've taught a move of God out of our pulpits yeah they T from the pulpit they've taught a move of God out of our fuse rather yeah that's right amen they've taught it out of out of our pews and now we're the Frozen chosen come on somebody we just turn around amen and we we we we we we you can't hardly drag a a man out of them no more why because that'd be too Pentecostal all right now come on come on somebody am okay brother been man it'd be too Pentecostal oh well that that might stir somebody up well I wish somebody get enough Victory to stir hell up I wish somebody get enough victory in the house to do something about it oh but we walk around so defeated so many times now I'm getting pulled off my notes now and that now that's scary come on and man we walk around so defeated so discouraged oh my we can't hardly we can't hardly see well brother how you doing today well bless God I'm just making it preach Bud come sir come on somebody and I'm just making it bless God brother Ben oh brother Ben pray for me okay but why you just making it right come on somebody you ought to be the happiest people all right come on on the face of the Earth that's right this okay or do I need to give you the mic prach buddy come on Amen yes sir but we've taught a move of God out of our churches yeah come on Amen until we wouldn't know what a move of God was if it walked right down the aisle in front of us yeah yes amen why all in the name of all those two Pentecostal yeah come on come on somebody I am a Pentecostal the original yes sir that original experience amen and I'm not talking about jumping and shouting and screaming and dancing but I'm talking about a bride becoming the word of God that when they walk out of the building they can stand there and say Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have such says I have I give it unto you rise up and walk what is it the spoken word becoming manifested incarnate in human human in human flesh thank you Lord amen we got it put off on a prophet yeah come on oh it's all right to keep it on a prophet but but it's not for me let me tell you something there's got to be a fulfillment of the prophet's prophecy yes sir that Prophet didn't come just for for himself he come to call out a bride and there's going to be a people on the Earth that will cause that word to live yes sir us Lord yes hallelujah thank you Lord now back to this he said she would stand there they would make fun of her and they would say he's not coming back for you but it didn't change her opinion of the word all right wonderful it didn't change the opinion of the word and they'll call you a fanatic all right they'll call you a Holy Roller they'll call you a man worshipper come on somebody they'll call you a cult amen but one of these days they'll call you gone why because what is it the word step in down into you and living thank you Lord good yes sir a bride of his own CH choosing in the suon church age now I'm going to get right back onto this in the suban church age uh book we realize amen also in John chapter 6: 37 and 44 it says all that the father hath given me it it shall come to me and him that cometh to me I shall in no wise cast out no man can come to me except the father draw him and I will raise him up at the last day it says in John in in John 1 12: 13 it says but as many as received him to received him to them gave he power now listen to the statement but as many as received him to them gave he power to become sons of of God even to them that believed on his name he said to them that would receive him he gave them power he gave them the ability he gave them everything that they had need of to become sons of God all right oh come on you're not L standing here I'm ill equipped yeah come on but you've been equipped and given everything that you need to become a son and daughter of God he says which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of God Ephesians 1 verse4 and 5 says according as he had chosen Us in him someone say in him in him before when the foundation of the world oh thank you Lord amen that's where the prophet of God would say Amen that he slipped a wedding band on your finger anden before the foundation of the world you were already a bow to one Christ oh thank you Lord thank you Lord it's good you know what that means come on preach that the devil's not got a claim on you all right hello come on the devil ain't got a claim on you why because you've already you're already bearing the mark of your husband come on Amen he says I want to step back up to that according as he has chosen Us in him from before the foundation of the world that we should be AO be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will now without getting too involved in that subject at the sovereignty of God do we let me point out here that according to the verse G to these verses Jesus Christ is choosing his own bride just the same as men choose their Brides today the bride today does not simply decide she is going to take a certain man for a husband no sir it is the groom who decides and chooses a certain ride for his a certain woman to be his bride am me it's not by your choosing that you're sitting here this morning but it's by the sovereignty and the Good Will and the predestination of almighty God that you're standing here today yes sir we think that we have so much to do with it brother Ben we ain't got nothing to do with it and mean he saw you before the foundation of the world thank you Lord and I got news for you he said I'll not lose a one thank Jes sir come on he said it's here it's it it it it is the groom who decides and chooses a certain woman for his bride John 15:16 says ye have not chosen me but I have chosen you than you Lord hallelujah what are you doing brother man I'm just letting you know who you are this morning oh yeah I I'm just letting you know who you are and that you don't have to stand there amen that devil that's been beating on you and beating on you and beating on you take the club out of his hand and turn it around and say I know who I am house the H give way yes sir that complacent sin it's not it's not it's not for you to live with amen but these sign shall follow them that believe good preacher yes sir come on now oh thank you Lord Jesus wonderful you have not chosen me but I have chosen you now according to the word of God the bride was chosen before the foundation of the world yeah oh yeah right it was a foregone conclusion brother Joel come on good he says the bride was chosen before the foundation of the world just ch this choosing of the bride was purposed in himself thank think about that a minute this choosing of the bride was purposed within himself oh yes Ephesians 1:9 says having made known unto us the mystery of according to his good pleasure which H he hath purposed in himself in Romans 9:11 it says that that the purpose of God according to election might stand oh yes do you realize yeah come on come on good he says you can't read it another way the heart purpose the Eternal purpose of God was to take a bride yeah Hallelujah the heart purpose the eternal purpose of God involved you it was to take a bride oh come on wonderful yeah oh my Jes that was the purpose of God was to take you unto himself and to cause you and him to become one oh thank you Jesus wonderful yes oh thank you Lord I'm having a good time sir come on was to take a bride of his own choosing and that purpose was in himself and being Eternal was decreed before the foundation of the world he says watch carefully now and see this before there ever was a speck of Stardust before God was God glory because God is an object of adoration no one was there for to worship him so he was at the time only potentially God and he was known only as as an eternal spirit but the bride was already in his mind thank you Lord the bride was already in vined that's why you can make the statement that you can't die no more than God can die because God Amen if you're a part of God brother Joel you can't [Music] die good come on now I'm just going to get right back up here come on preach just going to get right back up here I'll get in trouble cuz they're watching me at home come on you're all right amen come on I'm trying to behave there was a bride already is mine yes she was she was is existing in his thoughts hallelujah what does that make you it makes you Eternal it makes you Eternal and there's only one thing that is eternal and that is God so that on can I say it that make you God come on there's only one form of Eternity and that's Christ and you were in the mind of God yeah that's good the bride was already in his mind yes she was existing in his thoughts and what about those thoughts of God they are Eternal are they not GL they are Eternal are they not on you're never going to make it you've done too much you've gone too far is God going to lose a thought no sir God never did come on come on yes sir God can't lose one yeah that's right all right oh you're not going to take a Rapture come on brother Allan you gone too far you you're this you're that no no God saw you this is just an Earthly vessel that came in the world speaking lies there you go amen we're subject to those things but that Eternal God come on that make the pope shout as brother Daryl says come on PR huh wonderful yeah it's good wonderful all right then they told me that I had four hours it's what nobody asked you Joel how do you put up with that you're used to it ain't you amen the bride was already in his mind yes she was existing his thoughts what about those thoughts of God they are Eternal are they not the Eternal thoughts of God let me ask you are the thoughts of God Eternal yes sir let me ask you are the thoughts of God Eternal yes sir Glory if you can see this he says you will see many things it's the key that unlocks the door sir thank you Lord God is unchangeable in both Essence and behavior we have studied that and proven that already God is infinite in his ability so therefore he he he as God must be omniscient and if is omn ient then he is not now learning nor is he taking counsel even with himself nor is he at any time adding to his knowledge can I say something here in other words God can't have a new thought or a wrong thought yes sir God didn't make a mistake when he thought of you come on God didn't make a mistake when he thought of you [Music] hallelujah thank you L Jes he can't have another thought he can't have a wrong thought he didn't make a mistake you are not a mistake you're a chosen son and daughter of God now stand up and act like it quit letting the devil do all your talking for you and stand up and say do you know who you're talking to you're addressing the Queen of Heaven that's going to set at the Throne of heaven and stand in the Judgment seat no devil I'm not going to be judged I will will be in the Judgment seat glory to God I said no devil I'm not standing in the Judgment but I'll be standing there judging why because I'm an eternal thought yes sir from the mind sir thank you Lord all right thank you Lord Jesus wonderful oh thank you Jesus hallelujah oh glory to God that's good Jeremiah 29:11 says for I know the thoughts that I think sir toward you sayith the Lord th a beace of not of evil to give you an expected somebody say expected expected now that wasn't worth a hoop somebody say expected end that's better see I'm an audience participation preacher come on preach I kind of require it brother Joel amen yes sir for I know the thoughts that I think toward you sayith the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end if he can add to his knowledge and he is not omniscient but he's the best he could say is that sometime he will be but that is not that's not spiritual he is omniscient he has never had a new thought about anything because all his thought he has always he he has always had and always will have and God knows the end from the beginning because he is God thus thus the thoughts of God are Eternal and they are real they are not simply like a man with a blueprint he has drawn up and which one day will be translated into substance and form but they are already real an eternal part of God yes they are already a real and an eternal part of God oh thank you Lord wonderful see how this works God always had his thoughts for Adam Adam and his thoughts were yet expressed Psalms 13915 and 16 will give you a little idea of this my substance was not hid from thee when I was made in secret and curiously rough in the lowest parts of the earth Thine Eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect and in thy book were all my members written glory to God and in that book were all all my members all my members written which is which in continuance were fashion when as yet there was none of them oh thank you Lord that as I said was not written about Adam but it gives you the idea and the knowledge that the thought was there in his mind and that thought was eternal and it had to be expressed oh yeah all right yes sir it had to be expressed yeah you are an expression Brother David that's right of Christ yes oh thank you Lord that's good about that yes that's good yeah my mind goes just now to to that gold tried in the fire yeah that's right yeah the children of God many times it seems that they are the most beaten yeah that's true yeah come on prach the the the children of God at many times it seems that they are the most beaten amen but the Bible says I challenge you to buy me gold tried oh yeah by the fire yes sir and we realized that as that refiner would begin to take that gold that gold would come out of that fire and he would grab a hold of that chunk of gold brother Ben and he would begin to beat that gold yes sir you say brother been why am I dealing with this and why am I dealing with that look it's just God rting an the image inside of you it's God taking all of the D and all of the nonsense out of you all of your little pet doctrines yeah all right come on oh bless God don't get there me all of your pet doctrines that you ain't got no word for come on somebody I've had a belly full of pet doctrines that there ain't no word for come on I've heard a lot of sermons preached on pet doctrines that there wasn't all a word for come on that okay all right amen I'm home sort of come on yeah preach come on I know him well enough to know where he stands come on prach and man all of these little pet doctrines that's why we've got this flavor and that flavor and that flavor and this flavor over you can find any flavor you want in this message yeah yeah but there's only one flavor all right that's right that's right come on all right and it'll say what a prophet said that's right am man I I get so tired of these men come on come on prach come on I get so tired of men standing up there amen and pounding the pounding the pulpit and preaching an idea preach come on say what a prophet said brother say what he said and say it exactly the way he said it and don't sugar Cod it preach it to me straight you know we're not a hot bed plant that we got to be we got to be coddled and we got to be this and we got to oh bless God I can't say that cuz it might offend somebody let me tell you something if a prophet said it then you and I are entitled to say it and we have an obligation before God to preach it to the people come on prach huh yes sir that's right preachers you'll be held accountable for what you do and do not say that's right right and no it's not comfortable sir it is not comfortable brother Ben sometimes you say things that you would rather take a beaten than say yeah right that's true man I say things sometimes Joel says things sometimes amen that he'd rather take a b beaten than save yeah come on Amen but why do we say him because we love you yeah amen because we're responsible for what we teach that's right yes sir come on it's true amen but back to that gold that gold would take that man that refiner would grab a chunk of that gold and he would pull it out and he would begin to beat that gold that's right but St what would happen as he would beat that gold more of this would come out and more of that would come out yeah come on Amen and and and he would hit it again and something else would come out that complacent devil that just set you on a Pew come on it says you're going to make it you're okay because you accepted the message right right come on because you sit on a message VI you got your ticket punched you're okay on now come on yes sir coming home now you know what I like about the word that comes right to your house you know the word was passing by underneath a sycamore tree one day and there was a little man by the name of zachus that was up in that sycamore tree and he thought he had himself all hid you come in and you think you got yourself hid you looked theart you act AP part you talked apart come on but on Monday you're a come on preach come on come on that's good come on preach He Man there was zakus he thought he was this he thought it was that amen but but he he thought he was hid up there he was hid in his message theology yeah oh my come on is that okay amen but when the word come by the word stopped right under his tree yeah yes sir the word stopped right at his Pew yeah yes it did and it looked right at him on and said zachus I'm coming to your house today yes sir I wonder how many in the building and say God come to my house today yeah all right oh gr it Lord you know sometimes it gets pretty real when he comes to your house yeah all right yeah come on good come on sir that's why we don't invite him often come on now my prach come on huh why because the word is a discerner sir of the thought and the intent of the heart sir I'm leaving that alone come on I know my boundaries come on amen but that refiner would take that gold and he would begin to beat on it my and as he would beat this would come out and that would come out but all he was trying to do was see his own image within that piece of gold that whole time he he beats and he refines and he and he works that gold what's he doing he's looking for an image one liken to his own he's looking for something as he looks in there and he begins to realize amen that that that that as he as as that image becomes clear he's no longer looking at the Gold but he's looking at himself all right amen and when you become amen think it not strange the fiery trial that come to test you and to try you what he doing he's producing a bride yes sir that's good oh yes that okay yeah good he says Adam he says then Adam becomes God's thoughts expressed and those Eternal thoughts were now made manifest down through the centuries we could go we find a Moses a Jeremiah a John the Baptist and each one of these were God's Eternal thoughts expressed in its season yes sir then we come to Jesus the logos he was the perfect and complete thought expressed and he became known as the word that is what he is and forever will be now it says he had chosen Us in him Jesus Oh Thank You Lord wonderful right oh yes come on that means that you've lost your identity that's right yeah yeah that's right that means that you're not I I didn't come from John and Le a beard come on preach what you see came from John and leita beard what you see came from a uh the the the the the the relationship between one and the other yeah right come on right amen but but what but but but that inner man sir come on prach Sir see this is this was born in sin shap iniquity from the Dust came into the dust it'll go yes that's right amen but that Eternal thought that inner man that thought Express what was it it was a it was a thought expression of God yeah yes sir and what is it that that inner man come and he begins to live and he begin to express and he takes control yes oh yes he takes resonance he takes control he takes everything about this outer man and he brings it under subjection to the word wonder my you say you say brother Ben what do you mean by that I mean that that the truth is you didn't want to come here today come on PR come on I don't see any Halos out there come on the truth is I didn't want to come today you might as well just say it it was cold I was tired come on and it would have been a lot easier for me to lay in bed and the church said amen but something inside of you come on grabbed the hold of that old outer man yes sir and said come on use scoundrel get yourself out of bed come on and get yourself to the house of God oh and he started dragging you come on PR it's just the truth because you didn't want to be here but something inside of you desired the things of God so bad my until it overcame this outer man and it pulled him under subjection to the word glory to God it pulled him under subjection to that word and said come on you're going to church yes sir on you say brother been I just want to quit I want to give up I'm never going to church again I'm never doing this I'm never doing that but there's something inside of you that will allow you to stop there's something inside of you that keeps you pressing every day you say I'm not going to church no more I'm not going to I'm not going to read the message I'm not going to do this I'm not going to do that but Jeremiah said it was like a fire shut up in my bones he said I'm not going to prophesy the name of the Lord no more but it was like a fire shut up in my bones and I couldn't help but begin to speak oh come on I'm not going to go do this I'm not going to live right no more but it's like a fire shut up in your bones and it causes you to come under subjection to the word oh thank you Lord what is it oh come on God's expressed thought yes sir being manifested yeah in you come on oh thank you Jesus yeah it's good wonderful amen good preaching yes oh yes now I read a lot and the reason I read a lot is because my words will fail that's right come on yes sir but his words will never fail right amen I'd rather tell you what he said yeah all right amen that's what he didn't say yeah come on prach he has chosen Us in him Jesus before the foundation of the world that means that we were right with him in the mind and the thoughts of God before the foundation of the world that gives an eternal quality to the elect I'm going to read that again he said that gives an eternal quality that's good to the elect sir yeah yes sir I'm telling you do we know who we are oh help us Lord I'm on good come on now you know who you are on now oh come on I preached this long and I preached it hard at home and I've been on it I've been on it for a while why because I believe if you watch the prophet's Ministry right toward the ending of his ministry he started pointing toward a bride yeah that's right come on somebody you say well he pointed toward Christ and yes he did but when he pointed to a bride he was pointing toward Christ yes sir come on somebody and he be to if you watch the ending of The Prophet's Ministry he took and he he took a a magnifying glass as it were and he began to say this is you that I'm talking about he be to say this is you this is the one that God was trying to get to yes you watch the ending of that prophet's Ministry brother and it what was it it was an emphasis on Christ in you all right why because they had already tried to make him God yeah come on they had already tried to make him God they had already said that he was God they'd baptize in his name they'd do this in his name but he would say I'm not God he wouldn't receive Worship in any Angel you realize when that angel came to John John got down the bow before him and he said get up John yeah why cuz he wouldn't receive worship right that's right is that what it said that's right amen and and they and they they get so hung up now look I believe amen that in a prophet and I believe in that message but there's much more to it than God sent a prophet there's a fulfillment of the scripture and the prophecy yes yes sir yes and the the best that I can tell he said that the bride would have thus sayeth the Lord that's what he said yeah come on so where I ask you does the word of the Lord lay yeah yeah come on I'm not preaching to you anything that's foreign I'm just reminding you yes sir you've heard these things you know these things amen but sometimes it does good to come around and focus that's good if I was preaching to you something new then you ought to be scared yeah yeah come on yeah true huh good preach he said that gives an eternal quality to the elect you can't get away from that let me inject a little thought here even our natural birth is based on Election the female ovaries producing many eggs but why is it that a at a certain time a certain egg come down and not another one and then amongst the male sperm so for for for no for no known reason a certain germ attaches itself to an egg While others could have have just as easily attached them themselves or had a better opportunity to do it so to do so did not do so and perish there is there is an intelligence behind all of this otherwise what determines whether the baby is boy or girl blonde or Bernette light or dark type eyes Etc with these thoughts in mind think about Joshua and Caleb did not Jesus say in in in John chapter 6:49 your fathers did eat mana and the Wilderness are dead those parents that did E that died were NE necessary for the forefathers of the people to whom Jesus was speaking they perished yet were in the election of God naturally and Joshua and Caleb were spiritually Joshua and Caleb were spiritually in the election of God you realize that out of two million strong only two when he yeah yeah that's right yeah come on good they came out of Egypt two million strong amen and only two went in all right come on yeah it's good come on only two receive the word right yeah that's right do you realize how small the elected group of God is going to be hello that's true on Amen but the only two went in all the rest of them have died off amen but two went on to possess the promise yeah but the problem is is so many times we'll stop short of the promise yes yes come on is that okay we'll stop short of the promise brother Allan what do you have me of yeah don't stop short of the promise come on preach it's good you want deliverance from that that devil of depression don't stop short of it yeah come on don't come in and let the devil tell you that it's not for you it's for this one or it's for that one or it's for this one or but not for you no you you don't stop short of it because you're an expression of Christ come on and by very by commission you were commissioned to cast out Devils yeah that's right hello come on you were commissioned brother B to cast out Devils all right we've gotten so afraid yeah oh come on of the power of God in our churches yeah prach now come on you know what I like to see well there's a few things come on I like to see a genuine move of Goden oh yeah now I am not Pentecostal I don't believe I don't believe that we come in here and we and we we we run the aisles and we shout and we do all of these things though there's a place for that come on I mean I'm not talking about an outward emotion but I'm talking about the word coming so alive in our hearts until finally we become that word come on somebody there's going to be an expression of Christ you say brother being what about all of these things that all of the emotion and those things are fine I don't I'm not against those things but you better know what you're shouting about that's right I've seen I've seen the real and I've seen the fanaticism I've seen both that's right come on and I'll tell you what you can have a you can have a shou and service and it be nothing more than an emotional workup come on that's true come on that ain't popular is it come on prach Amen and that is nothing that's a sickness yes sir you sat there and you're grieved and you're Spirit why because because you see all of this but then there is real among that yes there's somebody that's laboring it out at the altar and maybe they're crying maybe they're weeping but they're weeping their way to Christ yes I'm just off on a rabbit Trail right now come on I wish to God somebody had weep their way to Christ yeah come on preach that's good an emotion won't hold you y right a shiver down your spine it won't keep you but an experience with the god of of Heaven A true baptism of the Holy Ghost the problem is that we've stopped short of a baptism of the Holy Ghost in our people all right we've got them under believing come on somebody but we haven't went on into yeah all right oh come on prach come on they'll believe unto it but they've not stepped right on into a baptism of the Holy GH have you received the baptism of the Holy Ghost since you believed that's right come on yes sir we think that because we believe well that's good enough yeah come on that's all it takes no there's a there's another step there there's got to be a fing yeah oh yes yeah and we stop our young people short come on preach why do you think the world pulls them out of the out of the churches yeah yeah come because come on because they're not seeing the real deal at home right come on come on now all right good he do it to me come on ask me how I know I sat back there in my Pew one time and I'm going did he say that yeah he said that but it need its head come on good amen come on come on you sure amen he says go on these elect were not only the Eternal thoughts of God which were the to were to be expressed in flesh in their du seas and but these same elect are called by another name oh my these same elect are called by another name Romans 4:16 says therefore it is of faith that it might be by grace to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed not to not to that only which is of the law but to that which is also the faith of Abraham who is the father of us all Romans 97-113 neither because they are the Seed of Abraham are they all children but in Isaac they shall be thy sh seed shall be called that is what they which are the children of Flesh they are not the children of God but the children of the promise are counted for the seed Oh Glory to God for this is the Word of Promise and this at this time will I come and Sarah uh will shall have a son and not only this but when Rebecca had also conceived by one even by Our Father Isaac for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not the works but God but of him that cth it was said unto her the Elder Shall Serve the younger it is written Jacob have I loved and Esau have I hated why because what was it you would look at you say oh that's so unjust I saw that's so wrong that then was loved and Joel was hated I would be so ain't going to live that down that's good buddy come on am man you understand what I'm saying yes sir you look at that and you would say oh that was unjust that was wrong but God through it why one was there in eternity yes sir one was there with them at the beginning and the other was not right one was an expression of Christ and the other was not right that's right so he would stand there by forn knowledge and he would say Jacob have I loved es now neither boy had done anything that's right neither boy had done anything to to to be worthy of it of eternal life to be worthy of of anything that's right uh Esau hadn't done anything wrong Jacob hadn't done nothing good yeah and really if you look at it amen Esau was a better man than Jacob yeah all right he was come on he simply was Esau would you would come and you would look at Esau and you'd say well Esau's got her all put together amen he's got this he's got the he's the favorite he's got all this and that and the other and Jacob was nothing more than a liance or Planner yeah that's right Jacob was a deceiver so you would look at him Joel and you would say Esau's my man come on you would sir so would I I'd look at it and say you know what Joel I think you're right Esau's my guy amen but it wasn't the way God had it elected come on you might have walked down a path of hell and you might have walked that devil might have took you down every road and every Valley and every back come on somebody every back alley and he might have put a physical mark on you or an emotional Mark or a mental Mark or whatever but let me tell you what it does not matter the road you walk if you're a part of God you said that you will not lose one if you got a child out there that's wward don't give up on the promise because they are elected of God and you have come on you have a promise and you can stand there and you say God it looks awful bad right now but you said you said you said that I could have them right you might have your protocol out there right now and it looks like they're on a road to Hell let them go and let God the problem is you still got them in your hands mama you still got them in your hands daddy let take your hands off of them so God can get to them and talk to them yes sir yes sir come on good buddy come on now come on somebody yes sir yes sir am man they would stand there and and and Jacob looked like he was a hopeless cause he would lie he would walk down a path that it would look so awful it would look like there was no hope for him but yet through the eternities of God he was a chosen vessel oh yes thank you Lord he had a name change coming had a change of name coming Glory this out here is deceiving yeah what you see is deceiving what I look at deceiving but let me tell you something like I said a moment ago I had Esau as the man but Jacob was the one that was with God in the beginning yeah from God he came and to God he'll go yeah come on somebody is that okay yeah it's good that's good stuff thank you Lord what are you doing brother being I'm just taking a great big old Club out of the devil's hand that's right and we're placing it in the hand that it belongs in yes and saying beat him with it yeah come on yeah come on preach come on come on that's good stuff on yes sir Jacob would be a liar Jacob would be a deceiver Esau would no doubt be the better man yeah amen but it did not change the fact that Esau was not in the election of God he was not a part of him amen but because of Jacob I'm going to say this and I hope you take it right but because Jacob was in the election of God Jacob could not oh come on Jacob could not miss eternity right that's the truth come on you say brother Ben that's an awful lot of Grace yes it is is amen but you realize because of who you are it causes you to live in such a way that you would never hurt your husband you would never hurt him but you live in a way hello yes sir you say oh well that gives me gives me a ticket to go out here and do whatever I want to do quite the contrary because why you don't want to do those things that's not in you he said at the beginning of this service remember brother said brother bam said that old husband's dead yes sir that old husband your old husband he's dead he's done away with he's got no claim on you glory to God he's got no claim on you but Christ come down and he redeemed you out of a pawn shop oh yes yes sir oh thank you Jesus he stepped down out of the eternities yeah and the devil had placed you over in a pawn shop when Adam fell you were placed there come on somebody he was placed there in a pawn shot but Christ come down and he walked in and he said that's mine that's mine and that's mine and that's mine and that's mine and that's mine and he redeemed you oh thank you Lord wonderful yes you redeemed Mees good Budd think about that wonderful amen he's so good yes oh yes he he's so good yes wonderful Jacob have I loved and Esau have I hated I'm doing pretty good about staying on my notes today bless amen Galatians 3 chapter 16 says now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made he saith not and to see he he saith not and and to seeds as of many he saith not and to seeds as of many but as one as of one and thy seed which is Christ Galatians 3 and 29 says and if ye be Christ then ye are Abraham's seed and HS according to the promise and if ye be Christ oh yeah then ye are Abraham's seed and HS of according to the promise oh thank you according to Romans 4 16 we find that that God has given a sure promise to all someone say all of Abraham's seed and Paul puts himself and all believers under the this uh this this designation because under that designation because he says Abraham who is the father of us all then he goes on not he goes on to not only narrow down his defin this definition he says but rather to finalize it for in Galatians 3 he's identified the seed singular there'll be a Seed of Abraham with G he says with Jesus encounted the seed of CH the seed children as children of promise and promises and promise of as having as having to do with election or the choosing of God what are we talking about a bride of his own choosing he says the choosing of God and that is exactly what we have been saying there he says these who are the of the royal seed are the elected of God are the predestinated forn of God and were in the mind of God in his thoughts in in very plain language the true bride of Christ was in the mind of God eternally though not expressed until each came forth in the designated decreed season as each member came forth it became expressed and took its place in the body thus the bride is the literal spoken word seed bride thank you Lord thus the Bride come thus the bride BR Ben than thus the bride is the literal spoken word seed bride Glory come on wonderful God have mercy oh thank you Lord It's good well yes sir it might not excite you one iota oh come on but let me tell you right now this Pulpit is getting wet let me tell you right now come on this is who you are good it's who you are this is your identity and when this Revelation sinks down I believe that you're one Revelation from a Rapture come on and I believe this is it I said I believe this is the Revelation that until we get this revelation of who we are until we realize brother Stewart who we are yeah oh come on yeah but once that be that word becomes a reality yeah yes all of a sudden we realize that that we're not an heir amen of of of our fleshly uh uh uh lineage yeah amen that man in the mirror amen it's not what you are that man in the mirror it was nothing more than a it it's it's dying it started dying from the time it took breath out of its mother's womb yeah but that man behind the man in the mirror oh come on it never began and it'll never end yes oh thank you amen it is the literal spoken word seed bride sir yes and though she is feminine in designation she is also called the body of Christ it is a very it is very apparent that the sought to be that that that she s she ought to be called that for called that for she was predestinated in him yeah and came from the saint listen to this she was predestinated in him and came from the same Source I know this ain't I know I know that some of this stuff don't make you just run the aisles but I ain't here to make you run the aisles I'm here to lay the word in good it's good hey man I I believe that there comes a time that you go come on somebody I I believe that there there's a time when it's time to all of those services are good when you can preach the word and and it just it it brings them people up like that but there comes a time whenever you've got to take and you've got to get into the meat of the word and you've got to start preaching the meat of the word why because now you're standing as a mature and elected bride you're not a baby come on somebody you're not a baby down here that had to be bottle fed and milk fed but now you can be sustained Eagle food you can be sustained on something amen when you were born amen you were fed by by milk yeah right that's okay you were fed by milk that that your mother would feed you with milk but as you matured as you grew you be needed something a little bit more sustainable something that would sustain you a little better hey look I believe in all of it you got some that just want to preach you a state that's thick and never want to give you any trimming come on right and then you got some that just wants to give you a b of mash ters yeah now I like ters told the church last weekend I said I like ters brother B I'll tell you what if you don't believe I if you don't know I think I like taters ask my kids because they ask what's for dinner and we'll tell them what's for dinner with potatoes ters with a side of ters man so I believe in all of those things I like those things when you let sit down brother Allen to a meal amen you don't want one thing amen but a minister ought to be able to minister to the needs of each person in the building we're called to minister to the children he said feed my sheep man so you begin to realize brother Joel amen that that it's not about the steak that's this thick yeah amen but it's about all of it together feeding and bringing up her bride into maturity of who she is that okay that's good amen I lost my spot the children of the promise and having to do with the election of of the choosing of God and that is exactly what we've been saying seems like I read that very plain language God in in the mind yeah I'm read that I'm sorry you know these tablets they're great but if you just take your hand and you graze across them it goes and you're sitting there going what do I do he says th the bride is literally spoken word seed bride and though she is feminine in designation I read that too but I'm going to read it again the body she is called the body of Christ it is very apparent that she ought to be called that for she was predestinated in him and came from the same source and was eternal with him and now manifesting God in in a many membered bride in a many membered body excuse me whereas once God was feminine was manifest in one member even our lord Jesus Christ now there now now then here we are coming to the conclusion as the Eternal logos God was manifested the son and in Jesus dwelt all the fullness of the godhead bodily and the Eternal one was the father manifested in the flesh and there thereby gained the title of son even so we Eternal even so we Eternal in his thought in in our turn in in our turn became the many membered spoken word seed manif ested in flesh and those Eternal thoughts now manifested in flesh are the sons of God even as many as we are socalled we did not seed we did not become seed by the rebirth we were seed and therefore were reborn for only the elect can be reborn because we were seed in the re is the reason we could be quickened is non in non seed there is nothing to be quickened he said we were re born we were quickened because why we were seen there was something there to Quicken us to regenerate us to reor bir us but if there is nothing in there to receive life then there is nothing to come to life when the s o in hits it that's why when you came into contact with this message amen something all of a sudden begin to come in and spring up why because you realize that there was something in there and it was a part of you it begin to speak to the same language that you were speaking it be glory to God it be to talk the talk that you were talking and something inside of you came to life and you realize that this is that this is that come on wonder come on now yeah that's good Peter would stand there on the day of Pentecost and he would come out right David and he' come out and he would would run out there and they would be they they was having a meeting brother Ben yeah they they were rolling out of the windows that's right they were rolling out of the doors they come out in there and and and Peter got up on that on on his his little soap box and he begin to preach yeah and he said oh my this is that all of a sudden Peter would stand there and he would begin maybe as Peter was a little little boy sitting on his mother's knee his mother would begin to talk to him and she would read him the stories the Scrolls and and Joel would be she would begin to read the scroll and she would begin to read that how that Joel would say I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and all of a sudden Peter amen as a little boy he would sit there and he would remember what his mother had taught him and all of a sudden when he was sitting there in the upper room he wasn't scared of what he would received he wasn't scared brother joela what he would received but all of a sudden the word was quick to his heart and he realized that this is what the prophet of the Prophet had had had had begin to express and he says this is that all of a sudden the reality came to Peter and he realized all of a sudden I'm the Fulfillment of his prophecy glory to God all of a sudden he realized I was the one that he was talking about all them eons of years ago the one that Joel begin to speak up I'm the one I'm the Fulfillment of the prophecy come on glory to God he'd stand there and all of a sudden he'd stand up and he'd say these aren't drunk on new wine but this is that yes sir I imagine he I would have took off running to realize that I was the one that the prophet was talking about yeah all right and I fulfilling prophecy glory to God oh thank you Lord wonderful he'd stand there and he'd say this is it yeah this is that you've heard about it it's not strange yeah all right prophet of God said that 3,000 would be be added to the we realized that 3,000 Souls were added to the kingdom and the prophet of God said that the devil never rolled out of rolled about out of his bed or something to that effect I don't have that for B but basically never never even moved he said the the devil didn't mind that he said they don't mind you doing a little shouting yeah that's right he don't mind all of those he said he never moved when those 3,000 Souls were out of the Kingdom he said but when Peter and John went down to the gate called Beautiful come on right and they walked up there being and there was that man there sitting there and they be and that man no doubt had had many men come by and give him this and give him that and give him this and give him that but there was only one man that could give him what he had need of all right amen and they just happen to be a carrier of that [Music] yeah amen but he said he said he never battered an eye when those 3,000 Souls were out of the Kingdom he said but when Peter and John come down the gate called beautiful and said Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have I give unto you he said all hell begin to take no said notice why because there was somebody producing the word there was somebody producing the word and they would stand there and all hell begin to realize hey we got a real problem on our hands yeah come on we had it in one but now it's in many sir sir he broke a part of him down a part of him off amen and he began to condence in in the spirit in the in the form of the Holy Ghost and you got some and you got some and you got some man what is it it's a many membered Bri body right he said whenever Peter and John would walk up there and they would say Silver and Gold Have I None rise up to your feet and walk he said all hell begin to take notice why yeah because no longer was somebody just talking about it yes that's right it's good but somebody had yielded themselves enough to it to become it that's it's good we're so scared yeah come on now understand this isn't something that you can just obtain to this isn't something that you just you work up and you do this and you do that no you cannot do that you're a sheep doesn't walk out in the field and say I must bear wool yeah but a sheep just naturally Bears wool but let me tell you something if life Bears on the inside of you of Christ it will produce Christ yes you come out here and you plant an apple tree an apple seed in the ground and that seed is going to produce an apple and let me tell you something that seed will never produce any more apples than what was already in that seed right that's right every Apple that it ever produced it will be in that seed is that not true that's right amen but but what is it see the life of the vine is an Apple so it's going to produce an apple amen and that's why whenever you look at people and they begin to Proclaim one thing amen but their lives are proclaiming another thing yeah that's right you say brother Ben now that's judgmental no that's inspecting fruit yeah that's good I I don't walk out here if there's an apple tree out here I'm not going to walk out here and judge whether it's apples I'm just going to inspect it yeah that's right yeah that's true and if it's got the life of an apple it's going to produce this little red thing that's sweet and not better come on there's such a thing as a sour apple too bless God I ain't going to get on the sour apples today because I don't like them amen but you walk out there and what is it because there's life being produced and man you can look at it and you can see just exactly what it is yeah that's right yeah good we leave that alone I'll tell you what you guys have got so many gadgets up here I'm knocking water off I'm knocking microphones off brother being thinking man get him out of there before he tears my Pulpit down amen I'm quitting he says no for real I am quitting he says now then here we are coming to a conclusion prise the Lord going to slow it down just for a moment and I'm going to read this again he says now then here we are coming down to a conclusion yes sir as the Eternal logos God sir was manifest in the Sun and in Jesus dwelt all the fullness of the godhead bodily and that Eternal one was the father manifested in flesh yes sir and thereby gained the title of son even so we Eternal in his thoughts in our turn became the many membered spoken word seed all right manifested in flesh and those Eternal thoughts now manifested in flesh are the sons of God even as we are so calleded oh yeah we did not become seed by the reir we were seed and therefore were reborn for only the elect can be reborn because we were seed is the reason we could be quick in nonseed there is nothing to be quickened all right Wonder thank you Lord what am I saying I'm saying it is not by chance that you are here today right that's good but it is by the forn knowledge of God yes yes there has been such an attack on this message in the past few years yes and we knew that that would come yeah sure sure but what it is it is it is this it is it is God beginning to REM Jehovah Eagle beginning to remove the feathers from The Nest yeah come on we've got this one walking away and that one walking away and this one walking away I'm going to make a statement here amen and and I hope it it doesn't come across wrong amen but you're never going to walk away away from who you are come on so if you walk away it never was yeah come on there was never a seed there to be regenerated right come on preach come on is that right yeah there was never anything there that could be quickened to life amen so we realize that as they walk away what is it we're at the Harvest time now what is it at Harvest Time everything is producing after its own kind yeah you look at the world today and you begin to see how that everything is it is just a mess amen this is opening up and that's opening up this one's coming out and that one's coming out I'm being very vague this morning amen but you realize that all of hell has been tore off the lid has been tore off of hell but I'm so thankful that I that we have a prophet that told us that when all of Hell begin to come up all of Heaven begin to come down amen but there's somebody that'll stand there amen and they'll live this word and they're standing there and you look at this one for manifesting and that one's manifesting and this one's manifesting but at the same time that the devil's doing something God is doing something there is a bride on this side also that is coming to full maturity of who she is and she begin to stand up in the full maturity of what she was always called to be the devil's come on somebody the devil's manifesting who he is but now we're seeing a many membered bride body begin to produce Christ again what is it when the devil's doing something God's doing something oh yeah wonderful we to spend so much time looking at what the devil's doing and we miss what God's doing yeah H that's right we look and we see all that the devil's doing brother being and we we spend so much time doing that amen but we miss what God doing when all of Hell amen when the lid gets tore off of Hell amen all of Heaven comes down too amen what is it at the Harvest Time all seeds will produce after their own kind oh my that's right and this bride seed is producing Christ than Wonder producing the word all right wonderful again you realize that we're at a time brother Joel that that all of a sudden we're beginning to see God move in our churches like never before all right amen amen and it's not necessarily not necessarily amen that that that there's there's so much of a an emotional move though I believe in that and that's good and I believe we should have it but it's a it's a Revival of the word amen they say well the Revival's over you're never going to have a Revival no no no that's not what he said he said the Revival was over but he wasn't talking about you yeah on he was talking about the world Cosmos am man he was walking about this out here but my Prophet said that the Revival the bride hadn't even had her Revival yet he said there's such a thing about as a bride's Revival yes sir amen so we walk around and we say well bless God brother be the Revival's over not for me it's not I'm in the middle of a Revival and what is it it's a Revival of the coming of the son of man right it's a Revival of the word thank you Lord yes sir that's good yes sir the word coming out in such a way amen until finally it becomes the raw unadulterated pure word yeah oh thank you Lord very good glory to God Amen what is it it's manifesting time yes yes sir it
