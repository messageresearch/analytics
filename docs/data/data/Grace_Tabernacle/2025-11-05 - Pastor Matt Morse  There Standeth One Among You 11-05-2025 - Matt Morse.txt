You deserve the glory. &gt;&gt; [music] [snorts] &gt;&gt; A quick testimony before [music] I sing this song. Um, this past week it's been kind of hard. I've been having some struggles in my body, [music] just pain and stuff. And uh, last night it was really getting to me and I was sitting on the couch [music] just talking to the Lord about it, you know, just wondering where to take it to, you know, when doctors hit their end. That's where the word starts as brother Brown said and uh I just [music] I didn't know what to pray because I feel like I've prayed everything and I just I just sitting on the couch and I just whispered his name. I just said Jesus [music] and such a sweet spirit came over me in that living room. And this this song's just been stuck in my head all day. So I hope it blesses somebody as much as it blesses me. Just like a king would send his name to free a prisoner. [singing] He is [music] just the same. [singing] Just whisper his name. He's our deliverer. There's no power that can hold you when his name is [singing] applied. He can break those [music] prison chains. Use his [singing] name. Oh, [music] use his name. [singing] Oh, his name moves mountains. [singing] Use that name. [singing] His name opens fountains. Use his name and your words [singing] become [music] the words of the king. [singing] If there's a mountain [music] you want moving, if there's a giant [singing] in your way, if you're in [music] prison, here's your escape. Use that name. [music] Now as they stood and they [singing] sadly watched as he ascended. Oh Lord please stay for our needs. We're dependent. [singing] [music] Oh but Jesus left them with a weapon [singing] a sure way of defense. [music] Speak [singing] with faith. The Lord did say, "Use my name." Oh, use his name. [singing] Cuz his name moves mountain. [music] [singing] Oh, use that name. His name [singing] opens [music] fountain. Use his name [music and singing] and your words become the words of a king. [singing] If there's a mountain you want moving. [singing] If there's a giant, it's in your way. If you're [music and singing] in prison, this is your escape. Use that name. [singing] Oh, cuz he's the same [singing] God who spoke to that woman at that well. He's [music] the same God whose wonders are too many [singing] to [music] tell. He's the same God that parted the raging Red Sea. He's the same God that's living [singing] in me. Oh, he's [singing] the same God that spoke to [music] the woman at the well. The same God whose [singing] wonders are too many to tell. He's the same [singing] God who parted that raing red sea. He's the same God that's living in me. [singing] So I use his name. That name [singing and music] opens fountain. Oh, use that name. [music] Oh, [singing] that name it moves every mountain. Use his name. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; The words become the words [singing] of a king. [music] If there's a mountain you want moving, if there's a giant [singing] standing in the way, if you're [music] in prison, he's your escape. [singing] Use that name. Oh, [music] I was [singing] in prison, but I escaped cuz I used that name. [singing and music] Thankful. You have a weapon tonight. [music] Let's all stand invite our pastor. Aren't you thankful when he comes by? Amen. [music] &gt;&gt; Is like you Lord in all the earthless [music] love and beauty [singing] endless world. Nothing in this [singing] world will satisfy.

All treasure of my heart, treasure of my heart [singing] and of my soul. In weakness, you are [singing] merciful. Redeemer of my [music and singing] past and present wrong. Oh, and holder of my future days to come. [music] Lord, your presence is heaven to me. [music] Oh, your presence [music] is still to me. I'll sing that first verse again [music] now. Oh, who is like your Lord [music] in all the earth? Oh, matchless love and [music] beauty endless world. Nothing in [music and singing] this world will satisfy. [music] Lord Jesus, you're the cup that won't run dry. Yes, your presence [music] is heaven to me. [music] Oh Lord, your presence is here to be. Oh, sing that treasure of my heart now.

Aba Father, you're worthy [singing] of [music] all praise. You are lives we raise. You are awesome in this place. might. Amen. Would you say that this evening? Amen. He's certainly wonderful worthy [music] of all the praise that we could utter out of these mortal limbs. Amen. Amen. Certainly, God is a wonderful God worthy to be praised. Amen. We just love the Lord this morning. Sure appreciate all that God does for us. just really enjoyed the service Sunday with Andrew and just allowing the Lord to use him. I've been feeding on that all week. I just really enjoy I enjoy good gospel preaching. So, Amen. So, we always wait to to lift us up and encourage us, establish us, and I believe that's what end time evangelism is. It's to [music] shape the stone. So, we we like to be shaped. Amen. It don't always feel [music] good being shaped. you know, but it's just the way it is. So, we just let the Lord work on us. Amen. We just want to remember this this evening in prayer has a request. Please pray for Tammy Ree. Also, Leah and John Scott remember them in prayer. Also a prayer for Ruth Anne's brother Terry Green needs prayer for his family and don't know them but I believe that certainly God does and knows the need that they have. So maybe if you have a need on your heart tonight want you to just lift your hand to the Lord and maybe you just pray with me over these needs tonight before we approach the word of God. Gracious heavenly father Lord I just thank you for being in our presence here tonight. Lord, I thank you for the word that you've given us to be able to speak, Lord, knowing that it brings [music] life to the hearer. Lord, I just ask you, Lord, tonight that you would touch each one. And God, you know those that need healing in their body. And Lord, we just ask that you would go to where they are. Lord, you know the need of every person, Lord. And Lord, we just rely upon you, Lord, to be able to touch, to lift, to heal, and those that are brokenhearted. Lord, may you touch them, Lord, that [music] just needed healing in their body, Lord. I pray that you would heal them tonight, Lord. May your word go forth, Lord, and be [music] edifying to the body of Christ, Lord, that we would leave this place knowing that we've been in your presence. And Lord, we'll give you the glory for all you do. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you tonight. We just want to invite you right to the scripture and in the book of second Timothy the third chapter and we'll read out of the 16th verse and then we'll also read out of Amos the third chapter. So 2 Timothy 3:16 for the sake of time we'll just get right in there and we'll just give a report on Clarabel. She's got weighed a little bit more yesterday and so they said she had to be in the little box for a few days to get her body temperature stay regulated. So we're just trusting the Lord in a few days they'll be able to bring her home. So sure appreciate all your prayers for her as well. uh second Timothy the 3 chapter the 16th verse and the Bible says uh all scripture is given by inspiration of God and it is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction and righteousness. How many say amen to that? &gt;&gt; That the man of God may be perfect and thy furnished unto all good works. So because Timothy says all scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for doctrine and for reprove and for correction. I love this part. It says for the man of God. That man that's not just speaking of men. That come from the Greek word anthropos which is speaking of mankind. So we're all included. So all of us are it is good for all of mankind uh the men and people of God to be made perfect furnished unto all good works. So I would like to take another scripture, Amos the third chapter in the seventh verse because all scriptures are inspired by God. How many believe this next one we're about to read is? Amen. So Amos 3 and 7, the Bible says, "Surely the Lord God will do nothing but he revealth his secret unto his servants, the prophets." Amen. How many believes that was an inspired scripture by God? Amen. Certainly if you're a Bible believer, uh you can't help but believe that. So may you take your seats tonight and I would like to speak on this subject. there standeth one among you. &gt;&gt; I really believe this tonight. I believe that our uh that the church I believe we're a part of that great universal body of Christ. And uh it's not just our own assembly, but around the world there's assemblies that gather uh that are a part of this wonderful body or the bride of Jesus Christ. And uh I I count it a privilege to be a part of that and to be able to do our our part as believers. And you know, each one of us that God called us, some to sing, some to preach, some to pray, uh some to worship, some to prophesy, some to testify. We all uh have been given uh gifts of God to be used in the body. And I really think that ought to be our our desire in our life is for God to be able to use the gifts that he's placed uh uh placed among us. And you know, I think about the church today. Uh how many knows that the church that God's church is a prophetic church? Amen. Uh we're a prophetic class of people. We live by prophecy. We believe by prophecy. The the book that we believe to be the word of God is a book of prophecy. And in fact, the the Bible was written by the prophets of old that were that were moved upon by the Holy Ghost. And you know, I was thinking of that this week and thinking of how [snorts] that it seems like the world today or the church world today uh that they that they have changed from being a Christian people following after God and uh the order of which God brings his word to now that they're uh they still have the names of Christianity and still uh uh promote Christianity in some form. But they've gotten away from the order of the way that God directs his church, the way he speaks to his church. And of course, I I don't believe that anything God would ever do would be out of order. I believe if God's in it, then uh God will have it in order. And so, uh there's an order of the church. There's an order of the way that God, uh has an assembly the way that God has his church universally. And uh and you know, it just seems like that today that it has been replaced. They've replaced it with following uh after a church. They follow after committees of men. The doctrines are voted on. Would you think of that? that men actually sit around in rooms and they vote on the doctrines of the church and like it's a political thing to figure out that this is the way we're going to stand or what direction we're going to take with with homosexuality and what direction we're going to take with the uh with the with holiness and what direction we'll take with uh uh with speaking in tongues and they just sit around in in rooms and by committees uh determine what the church's doctrine is going to be and the doctrines over time they've changed they've went from uh uh uh from from one thing to a little loose or too fundamental or or they're constantly changing. It just seems like the world is unsettled uh in what Christianity really is. There's so many interpretations and trying uh uh to find out what a real true word believer ought to be in this age. And uh but but they changed the fundamental beliefs of the church has changed. I don't have time tonight, but if you took through history and you looked at every church and a wonderful people through the whether it be a Methodist or a Baptist church or Pentecostal Church of God or Assembly of God and you went back in the history of the church and uh 50 years ago, a hundred years ago, you'll find that the fundamental doctrines of the church have changed. They changed the way uh they preach about uh uh holiness and standards of the church and the way the church believes. And and I just I just happen to be a believer when God said he was he wasn't going to change and he and he's an unchanging God with unchanging ways. I just happen to believe that God wouldn't come down in this last age and allow us to change the way you know I had a lady tell me one time she said well it's all changed because society has changed what the standard is. I thought my when did we allow society to change the standards of the gospel of Jesus Christ? But but we're not going by a society standard but we're going by a gospel standard. And I believe that God has given it to us and he gave it to us 2,000 years ago, thousands of years that God has brought his word and uh and we're not looking to change it, but uh but we're looking to build upon God's word and to be able to establish upon a foundation that God has already established. And you know, I think about churches today. They become builders. And you know, they're uh they're building for different reasons. Some build for money, some build for a following, some build for uh for fame, they build for prestige. And I'm just laying a foundation for something. I may preach on it for a few weeks, but I want to establish it tonight. But they build for all different reasons. They and they build followings unto themselves or they'll build and uh and force people to follow them and force people to live after them. One goes too far with grace and one goes too far with legalism. And it just seems like we're always looking for the middle the middle of the road and what God really wants out of a church. And I believe that ought to be what we should look for. We we ought to look for the desire of God. And you know, I thought it don't matter if you go too far with grace, it's still wrong. But if you go too far with legal legalism, it's still wrong. &gt;&gt; I thought about how that it is today. It seems that people they they force people to be in a religion and it don't matter where where you go. I've studied a lot of religions and they they have a guideline to live by, a law to live by, and they bring people in and they they sure try to make them fit the law really well. So that's what's going to make you a believer. And and you know, I think that the reality is is that whenever uh whenever you try to force people to live one way or force people to act away or force people to dress a certain way, what you miss is what really matters. And that's a true converted heart and a heart that is surrendered to Jesus Christ. I I believe that that's what God called us to is a true surrendered heart. It ain't it ain't to force people to look like I do or force people to to dress like my wife or look like the way I think that people ought to look. And but that's not what it is. Really the reality is is that we ought to have a surrendered heart and we ought to bring people to what really matters and and that's to be converted. That's to have a true conversion and a pouring out of the old nature and a feeling of the spirit of God. And I can just say this, this ain't just coming from me, but Jesus actually warned of it. When he talked of those Jews and he said that you would travel across seas to make one procelite, he said, "And when you've done it, you've made them a two-fold child of hell." You know what he was talking about? you'd go over to that pagan religion and they're all on their way to hell because they didn't accept Christ. He said, "And then you would go over there and procelite them right to Judaism." And and you know what a proelite, that's not a bad word. I know people today have misused it and and made it a bad word. But a procelite means a new convert. That means you've converted from Hinduism to Christianity. That's a procelite of Christianity or or converted from Muslim to Christianity. That'd be a procelite of Christianity. But what Jesus said, he said, "What made him a twofold child of hell is because you you brought him from paganism and then you brought him to Judaism, but you never brought them to God." He said, "So you prolighted them to the wrong thing." So we don't want to be that kind of person. We don't want to travel across the world and travel across seas and to bring people into our church and try to uh to make them forced to live one way or forced to dress one way or or forced to look one way. All you're doing is putting your religion on them and trying to get them to wear your religion and express your religion. But the reality is they never got anywhere with God. I I I preached this this evening as a warning because when that becomes our focus, suddenly we accept a person that would put on a dress. We accept that they've moved closer to God. In reality, they might put on a dress and never get anywhere with God. So, we don't ever want that to be our standard that whenever we would look at somebody and say, "Well, if I can get them to dress like me and to look like me and to sound like me and to talk like me, well, then they're okay with God. So, I'll stop praying for them. I'll stop testifying to them. I don't have to preach to them anymore because they got where they needed to be." But the reality is that what we see outwardly is is just a but that ain't the real work. The real work is what's being done on the inside. And then what's done on the outside is expressed from a real work that's done on the inside. That's an inward work. &gt;&gt; And a real gifted person, you know what they can do? They can see an inward work that's being done. So, we're not looking. You know, it's easy to look at somebody on the outside and say, "Well, they're not growing real fast and they're not really getting where they need to be." And, you know, it's easy to get judgmental. But a real gift could look on the inside and say, "I noticed they're not the person that they used to be, and God's dealing with their heart." I'm I'm just going to lay this out here because I know how the devil does when you start preaching along this, but we are a church that believes in holiness. I believe that men ought to be men and women ought to be women. I believe women ought to dress according to the scripture of holiness. I don't believe a woman ought to put on garments that pertain to a man. We don't believe that a man ought to put on garments that pertain to a woman. I I I believe in holiness. I believe that men and women ought to conduct themselves as Christians. I I believe they ought to be separate from the world. I I believe that our testimony ought to be worthy of the name of Christianity. I don't think it ought to be a mockery. I don't think that grace ought to be made a disgrace. But I also believe that our main focus ought to be that all of that that takes place in your life that it actually came from a personal relationship with Jesus Christ and not because of a law that men has put over other men. I believe that what that what the prophet said in Isaiah, he said, "Heaven is my throne and the earth is my foottool and what house have you built me?" Sayeth the Lord. That God is looking for a house to dwell in. He said, "Will it be a house that I am pleased to dwell? Will it be a house that that is a sanctified house &gt;&gt; that God is looking for a place to dwell in? &gt;&gt; Let me tell you this. Sanctification is not an outward work. It's an inward work. I know many has put this out there today that that it's an outward work. Sanctification takes place on the outside. But the but all the works of grace are done on the inside. &gt;&gt; Sanctification is an inward work. Brother Ram said, notice he said sanctification the second stage of grace. He said it cleanses the mind and sets the heart, the mind of the heart in the order of holiness. So what good would the body in the order of holiness do if the heart wasn't in the order of holiness? He said see sanctification sets the mind of the heart in the order of holiness. So it's an inward work. He said and a man can repent of his sins and he'll still think. He said if he's an immoral man, every immoral man when he looks at a woman, he finds it. He said in every immoral looking woman he finds, he recognizes that that's still there. Maybe he's a drunk. Every time he smells alcohol, he sees that it's still there. He said, see, but when he gets sanctified, it cleanses that desire out of him and it takes the want of it away. He can still be tempted, but it takes the want of it away, but still yet he's not right. it. Then it would have to take him through the process that he himself, the Holy Spirit himself, the son of God, could dwell in the human heart, &gt;&gt; it has to go through that before he can come into it. &gt;&gt; Before he can come to a place that God could use him, he would have to go through these stages of grace. And I really believe this. Sometimes people get it out of order. And you say, "Brother Matt, why would you get into that a after reading the scriptures that you read?" But it's because the way that churches is built, it's because that what we're we're building, if you build it the wrong way, it will fall apart. If you build it upon legalism, it ain't ever going to stand. You can make everybody live a certain way because you say it. I don't care how loud you say it, how forceful you say it, how quiet you say it, how pretty you say it, how ugly it is. I I if it's legalism, it's legalism. And it has to be an inward work that's done in the heart. You have to put a desire in somebody that they could come to an altar and find God and be and have a heart that is sanctified to the presence of God and be filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost so that the desire of the world would leave their flesh and they would have nothing else but a desire to please God. &gt;&gt; That's what we really want as a church. &gt;&gt; We want to bring people to that. We want to build the right way. And you know, it reminds me of a story of the builder that went forth to build. you know, and they got out there and he done all the work and went out into the into the quaries and he picked the finest of marble to bring and to build this great building that he was building. And he maybe went out into the other countries and he found gold and precious silver and he found all of these great commodities that he could build. And as he would bring all of this back and start to build it, the people would come and and gather around and see that there's never been something that was built that was so beautiful. It it was the greatest structure that there ever was. It was lined with fine uh gold. It was the curtains were of fine linen. The glass was of of fine glass of rubies and emeralds and carved into glass. And maybe they would come and say, "What are you building? Is this a house that is uh it's it's for a man of great prestige?" No, no doubt. Maybe it's a it's for a man of great wealth that would live in a house like this. Or maybe you're building a great business where it would be the headquarters of something that would uh that would be around the world or maybe uh some great church or something. I mean to to put that much effort into it and that much beauty into it. What is it that you're building? But the man goes on and he gets the building built and it's so perfect that everybody around it could go by and look at its beauty and they they say my how marvelous that it is and boy it sure looks good on the outside. And and then at the end when they're watching to see maybe who's going to move in and what and they're watching to see maybe a caravan would come by and bring a king and in order to live in it. But as they're waiting to see all of a sudden to all their surprise here would come a a procession of a funeral and and they're carrying a body and one's carrying a coffin and the other, you know, playing the instruments of of death and and the incense of death. and they open up the building and inside the building they would lay a coffin and they and maybe lay another and this would be the family burial place or the burial place of some family or something and and see it would be so odd to those around us to see something so beautiful that would be used for something like that. But this is exactly what Jesus tells to the Pharisees in Matthew the 23rd chapter. He said, "Woe unto you scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites, for you are like whited supplers, which indeed appear beautiful on the outside, but on the inside you're filled with dead men's bones and of all uncleanness." You see, what he lays as a foundation that it don't matter what you do on the outside. The first thing you must do is make sure there's life on the inside and then let the outside reflect the life that is living on the inside of every one of us. Friends, don't ever think that it's okay to put on a garment or or or that you're far enough with God that if you can look a certain way or feel a certain way or or act a certain way, but but get a life on the inside of you that that has changed that would take the desire of sin and the world and the flesh out of you. Then there don't have to be nobody that correct the way you live and follow you around and tell you how to act and tell you you shouldn't go that way and tell you cuz you got a something on the inside of you. It ain't somebody behind you. It ain't somebody over you. It ain't somebody in front of you, but it's somebody down on the inside of your heart that says, "Don't do that. Don't go there. You shouldn't put that on. You shouldn't act that way." That ought to be where every Christian gets to. That's what would make you a real believer. He said, "Even so outwardly you appear righteous unto men." I'm not preaching against preaching holiness. I'm just telling you the order of it. He said, "Even it ought to be outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within you are full of hypocrisy and iniquity. God forbid that anybody would come into church that would be a hypocrite and look one way on the outside and be another way on the inside. Friend, I don't want nobody to be that way. I want your life to be right with God. I want your the spirit of holiness to be living on the inside of your heart that you could express outwardly from a sanctified life. Something that God got a hold of you on an altar somewhere when you repented and gave your heart to God that your life could express something that God has done on the inside of you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said, "You hypocrites that would garnish the tombs of the prophets and the supplers of the righteous, but say, if it had been in the days of our fathers, we would have not been partakers of them that had the blood of the prophets on their hands." He said, "We you are witnesses unto yourself that you are the children of them which killed the prophets." Fill you up then the measure of your fathers, you serpents or generation of vipers. How can you escape the damnation of hell? Here we would tell them because of their outward and all their lawkeeping. Notice I'm building something here. &gt;&gt; All of their lawkeeping. He said, "But you've killed what matters. &gt;&gt; You can put all this Christianity you want. You can go all the the the church services you want. You can post it all of how much of a Christian you become, but you've killed what matters." This is Jesus's word. He said, "You serpents and generation of vipers, how can you escape the damnation of hell?" I thought what a question to ask in this generation is how can you escape the damnation of hell? What is our way of escape? Don't you realize that God has always provided his people a way of escape? That there's a pattern that God I can I just establish a pattern in the days of Noah, it was God that sent that that that sent the instruction to build an ark that when judgment came in the days of Noah that his people would be able to to be carried across judgment. In the days of of Nineveh, it was Jonah that that came to Nineveh that brought a message of repentance. It was Moses in the days of Egypt when the children of Israel were in Egypt and and that he would go down and and bring a pillar of fire and give them away of deliverance out of the land of Egypt. It was Jesus that came into that spiritual in that spiritual Egypt that would bring them out of that spiritualism and spiritual bondage into the baptism of the Holy Ghost. So you realize that God has always provided a way of escape. Jesus said, "How can you escape the damnation of hell?" I thought, "What a question." But did you catch what the way of escape really was? Because many when when we read that, we say, "Well, it was the ark or it was the pillar of fire or it was deliverance or or or what was it?" But notice what it really was. But when it was a ark, it was the ark that was built by a man named Noah. When it was repentance, it was repentance that came through a man named Jonah. When it was deliverance, it was deliverance that came from a man named Moses. When it was the Holy Ghost, it came from a man named Jesus. So you say, "How can you escape the damnation of hell?" He said, "Notice what it is." He said, "Wherefore, behold, I send unto you prophets &gt;&gt; and wise men and scribes." &gt;&gt; So God's way of escape, notice what Jesus lays out that God's way of escape, he said, "I send unto you prophets. I'm going to provide you a way of escape." He said, "I will send unto you prophets and wise men and scribes." He says, "So his way of escape would always be brought through the mouth of prophets. Not all would receive them." Because watch what Jesus said. He said, "But some of them you shall kill and crucify, and some of them shall you discourage in your synagogues and persecute them from city to city." So here he said, "But I will send prophets. I will send wise men, which was if you study the Old Testament, which was called sages, but or I will send scribes." It was right books. And so all the way through the the Bible, we find this to be a theme that God uses as a way of escape. Jesus said, "I will send unto you prophets." I I was reading in the in the in the Old Testament and reading how uh that God has always sent this. It's always been a part of the scripture and and Jesus would say this. And so uh how many how many is familiar with the word a sage? You know what a sage is? A sage was in in in the Bible, it was a it was a a wise person or someone uh who who possessed or imparted wisdom to others. &gt;&gt; So the Old Testament is full of of people that were sages. They were wise men. They were individuals in society that would uh that people would seek after for counsel or for direction because they were wise men. Even today in Judaism, there's a need for sages because people certainly are looking for wisdom. But but there was a difference. The difference between a prophet and a sage is a sage was a person that could look into the past and things that had happened and and maybe you could show them things that had happened in your life and because of their wisdom then they could they could say well you know this was kind of what happened with your father and you know this is the direction your ways and that's why you feel the way you feel because of because of what you expressed to me about your dad and your mom and you know that's where that came from and and they could give them some good instruction on their life uh because of the things that had happened in their past. But the difference between a sage and a prophet is a prophet by vision or by by dream that God would deal with them and they could actually see things that would take place in your future. So it wasn't regardless of what took place in your past, but a prophet could see things that was going to happen. So it's something that you couldn't tell them. You couldn't uh you would have no way of knowing. And and so the sage would look into the past and the there's more to it, but just to but just to to get an understanding, they could look into the past, but a prophet uh could look into the uh uh uh to the future. So a true sage, but I want to lay this out tonight, but a true sage uh was a was always a godly man. Because a if a sage was a person of wisdom, then we realize according to the scripture that wisdom only come from God. So if it was a real sage of God or someone that could be called that according to the scripture uh to be wise it would have to come from God. For the Bible says the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge but fools despise wisdom and or wisdom and discipline. So it shows us that true wisdom only comes from reverence to God. &gt;&gt; So so even even the Bible would say in first kings that God gave Solomon wisdom exceedingly deep insight and understanding beyond measure like like the sand on the seashore. Solomon's wisdom was greater than all of the men of the east. greater than all of the wisdom of wisdom of Egypt. So as a wise man, we would look back and say, well, he could be called a sage because he was a wise man. Brother Bam would even call Simeon. He said Simeon, he was an old sage about 80 years old. So when you hear that word, that's what he's referring to. An old sage about 80 years old, hundreds of years since even there had been a prophet on the earth when he went walking around. But the Holy Ghost spoke to him and said, "You will see the Lord's Christ or the salvation of the Lord." So, so we realize that that they're here that Jesus said there's going to come wise men or sages. I'll give I'll send wise men. I'll send prophets. I'll send scribes. Some of them you're going to kill and persecute. So, so we can see according to scripture that a prophet could be called a sage because a prophet was certainly a wise man. But not just because you was called a sage don't mean you was a prophet. So just because he was a wise man and could give instruction or direction uh that don't mean that it was a prophet. And uh but but whenever you when you start reading about the prophets of the Old Testament, do you realize that upon the earth according uh uh down to today that there have been hundreds even thousands of prophets upon the earth. How many knows that there's not just been a few. There have been thousands of prophets that God has used upon the earth uh throughout history. Not more than any of us could ever count. and and maybe some God used one time and some God used several times or you know it used to trouble me thinking that uh that that that there there couldn't be any other prophet there there was only one prophet but but but I want you to I'm going to show you the difference here in a minute so you don't turn you don't turn the live stream off just yet but but there's been thousands of prophets brother brother said there was tens of hundreds of prophets uh that God has used but but we realize that all the prophets are not the same see God sent different prophets to different ages to direct his church his children with what was taking place right in the age that they lived in. This has been all the way through the scripture. And they would pro prophesy of things that would come to pass to give the church vision and direction. So a prophet's purpose would come to lead the church. It would be to give the church vision. You know what would happen if the church didn't have vision? Remember what Proverbs 29:18 which was a wise old sage that wrote that without vision the people would perish. So there had to be vision. And so here God sends prophets in order to give vision and direction to the church. &gt;&gt; Now in the Old Testament, we find this when you start reading your Bible. Your Bible in the Old Testament actually shows it differentiates between minor and major prophets. Now as you're studying reading the Bible, and I'm just going to kind of I'll use this service as a foundation, but when you're reading through the Old Testament, and I'm going to go through some of it over a few services, but uh you'll find they break it up. One place it'll say the 12 minor prophets. Now uh and you they're they're listed in the order that they appear in the Bible through uh Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Naam, Habac, Zephani, Haggi, Zachariah, Malachi. There are the 12 uh minor prophets that are in the Bible. But I don't want you to to read that and misunderstand what a minor prophet is. Because if you would if you most time when we use the word minor, we' say it was a lesser or or not or or it didn't have as much value. But a minor prophet was not a less valued prophet. It was just a smaller book. That's why we call it minor. It was a smaller letter. It may have been a chapter or two chapters or their ministry wasn't as long. It was a it was a shorter or God didn't use them for as much as he did Isaiah who would be considered a major prophet. So, it's not to belittle the prophet, but it was a the minor prophet was just it was a smaller or lesser or lesser term uh that that that he was used in his ministry. But then when you read of the major prophets, they were um when you read as the Bible was laid out, they call the major prophets, five major prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Lamentations, Daniel, and Ezekiel, which we realize that that is not actually all the major prophets that that God had sent in the Old Testament, but that's actually speaking of the prophetic books. So, so Isaiah, Jeremiah, when Lamentations of Jeremiah, Daniel, and Ezekiel, those are five major uh prophetic books. But we realize that according uh to the scripture and and that that a Abraham was certainly a major prophet of God. Enoch was a prophet of God, a major prophet. Noah was a major prophet. Moses was a major prophet. Elijah, Elisha, there was many great prophets of God that we read about in the Old Testament, some that didn't have a book at all. But when the Bible first starts, when you open the Bible, from the very beginning, and I'm establishing this on purpose, and hopefully it's being recorded, but from the very beginning of the Bible, the very first chapter, the very first words that are written in your Bible was written by a prophet of God. &gt;&gt; And the very last words that are written in your Bible in the book of Revelation was also written by a prophet of God. For from Genesis under Revelation, it was written, it was led by God through the the God leading men by prophetic gifts. And so all the way through the Bible, it don't matter what part of it you read, you can't get away from God using a prophet, &gt;&gt; Abraham, Enoch, and brother said, but I want to notice this that there's never been an age where God gave his people, two major prophets at one time. &gt;&gt; So this is a good answer to a question. So some say, well, there's prophets here and prophets there. And they may and they may be and they may prophesy something and it may really happen. They may see a dream and and it may rain tomorrow and and it may really be. He said, "But there'll never be two major prophets at one time." He gave Enoch alone, Noah alone, Moses alone, although others had prophesied. He said, "But only Moses had the word for his age." Did you ever notice that? There was never two at once. You say, "Well, what about Elijah and Elisha?" Elisha didn't start his ministry until Elijah was gone. They were on the earth at the same time. Elisha walked with Elijah, but it was after Elijah ascended, then then Elisha's ministry began. All of the Old Testaments, the prophets, the letters, all of their purpose. You notice it was all to the same thing. Joshua when he when he followed after Moses, that Joshua's ministry, it didn't begin until Moses ministries ended. Remember Moses, my servant, is dead. But now I'm giving unto you Joshua commission. So although he was on the earth at the same time, but there was no two major prophets, but shows us there was no two major prophets on the earth at one time. says, "See, but I want to catch this that all of these Old Testament prophets, all all of the letters, every every every uh uh scripture that you read, every book that you read, it was all pointing to one place and that was Jesus Christ." &gt;&gt; How many knows that when you read about all the Old Testament, it don't matter what they write and symbol or what's written of Israel. You realize that the old, this is a Bible study tonight, but you realize that the Old Testament is actually the book or the story of Israel and how it came about. the first five books of the Bible that were they weren't written by Abraham. They were about Abraham, but they weren't written by Abraham. They were written by Moses, a prophet of God when he when he got along with God. And God be to show him what happened in the beginning and how that the world was created. Although Adam certainly a man that God dealt dealt with face to face, but it wasn't written by Adam. It was written by Moses, a prophet of God. And so, we see that this was uh how this uh nation was established. And God would write this in the Old Testament Bible and it would show how they began and where they came from and the troubles they would go through and and in and out of bondage and and from Egypt into Babylon in and out of trouble following and and it would go all the way through this captivity into the exile and Babylon this Babylonian captivity once and twice and and how the kingdom would be restored the the the uh I'm I'm making a fast work of it but how the temple would be built and tore down and built and tore down and built again but it was all pointing to where the the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; and then in in the in the middle of the Bible there's 400 or so years that were there was no prophet on the scene. &gt;&gt; There was no word that was written in that period there was you it was a period a lot of things happened in history but it was not recorded in the Bible. So but then it comes to this new place to where what it's pointing to. I just think this is so powerful because the Old Testament it ends with a prophet &gt;&gt; and the New Testament begins with a prophet. &gt;&gt; But the Bible says that here that when you open up the New Testament, it was John the Baptist. He was the first one that came in the New Testament. But notice that when although John and Jesus was on the earth at the same time, but John's ministry, his public ministry started before Jesus's did. And matter of fact, it took Jesus coming down to where John was and John saying, "I I must decrease that Christ might increase." He he his commission was to introduce Christ to his generation. So he had such a I think about John the Baptist. He had such a ministry as a prophet of God that people actually thought John the Baptist was the Messiah. He was a prophet. Somebody say prophet. I'm just establishing it because I may as well fight the devil that tries to take that out of the church. Isn't it just like the devil today that he wants to take that and remove it and separate the church of God today from God's prophets? I thought, I'm just going to give the devil a black eye tonight because you can't open your Bible without reading about God's prophets. I don't care what your dad tells you. I don't care what your mom tells you. I don't care what your uncle or whatever book you read. You can't read this book without reading about God's prophet &gt;&gt; and what God does with his people through his prophets. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Said, see, so John the Baptist, his commission was to introduce Christ. I thought here it would goes from one it goes from from from Malachi. He would he would speak of the coming of the Lord and and then here John the Baptist he would introduce it him and his ministry was such a great ministry that it actually attracted people by the thousands by the thousands that came to John the Baptist in so much that they asked him are you the Messiah? the works that he done and the miracles that was that was done the the work that was done in his life. They would they would come among them and say there's never been a prophet the like John the Baptist. His ministry was so great. Even Jesus said it. He said there's never been a man that was born of a woman that that has that that is risen that is greater than John the Baptist. &gt;&gt; His ministry was so great that they thought he was the Messiah. But John when they came to him they even asked are you the Messiah? He said no. He said this is of whom I spake. He that cometh after me is preferred before me, for he was before me. &gt;&gt; I thought, notice what he's establishing here as all the prophets of old have been talking about this coming of this Messiah, this this this great one. He would be a God prophet. Like Moses said, he was coming a a prophet. They they prophesied of him. And but John said, "He that cometh after me, he's preferred before me, for he was before me." In other words, he's an eternal God. He he he's coming after me. But I'm telling you, a long time before I ever walked upon this earth, he was already here. He He knew me before I was born. He knew me. He the the mother I'd be born to. He knew the what I would be. He knew the river I'd be standing on. He knew how many would be baptized today. He said, he's coming after me. But he was certainly before me. He said, "And of his fullness have we all received in grace of grace. For grace," he said, "for the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ. And no man has seen God at any time. The only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father. He hath declared him. And then the Bible, it tells us when the Jews sent the priests and the Levites to Jerusalem, they asked John the Baptist, "Who art thou? Are you the Messiah? Are you the Are you the Christ?" His ministry, I want you to catch this. His ministry was so great that they thought he was God. &gt;&gt; They thought he was the Messiah. He was the anointed one. Who art thou? And John the Baptist, he confessed. He said, "Denied not." He said, "I am not the Christ." They said, 'Well, what then? Are you Elias? Are you the prophet?' He said, 'N no.' They said, 'Well, who art thou that they may give answer to them that sent us?' He said, 'I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Isaiah. He was such a man of God that he wouldn't even take he wouldn't even take it upon himself to be identified as anything. I I thought, isn't that a defining characteristic of a true prophet of God? I ain't trying to be somebody. I'm not trying to bring people to myself. I I'm not trying to build a ministry. I'm not trying to draw people to me, but look at the one that that God sent me. Make straight the pathway. He said, he sent me. I'm the one that said, "Make straight the way of the Lord." As the prophet said, "Oh, friends, don't you see?" They come and they said, "Well, why would you baptize if you're not the Christ and you're not Elias and not that prophet?" He said, "I'll tell you why. Because I only baptize with water. But the one that that is standing, he said the one there that is standing, there is standing one among you that whom you know not. He it is who cometh after me and he has preferred before me whose shoes I am not even worthy to unloose. No matter how great his gift was, no matter how great his ministry was, no matter how great they tried to make him a God and tried to make him a Messiah and tried to make him the Christ the anointed one, he said unto them, he said, "There standeth one among you who you know not, and I'm not even worthy to unlatch his shoes." Friends, let me tell you, John the Baptist's ministry was to make known Jesus Christ. He said he's not he's not just a prophet, but he's more than a prophet. He's Christ. He's the son of the living God. He's the Messiah. He's the anointed one. He's the one that Moses spoke of when he said, "There's coming one after me." I say, "Prepare you the way of the Lord." Make your heart ready to receive him. I MUST DECREASE THAT CHRIST MIGHT INCREASE. &gt;&gt; He's more than a prophet. &gt;&gt; He's a God prophet. &gt;&gt; But Rem said he was all God and he was all man. The one said he was man, he said they were right. One said he was God, he said they were right. &gt;&gt; Said, "See, if you would look at the man, you wouldn't even see much." &gt;&gt; You know this, brother Ram said, "See, because Jesus didn't even heal people." &gt;&gt; That's a hard one to think of. &gt;&gt; Jesus didn't heal anybody. He said he only healed as God showed him to heal. &gt;&gt; That's what the Bible says. He says, "Surely the son can do nothing but what he sees the father doing." He said, "So when he stood before the people, he could tell them that's the reason he knowed he was the son of God. They noted he was a son of God. He was a prophet that Moses spoke of because he was a God prophet." He said, "What do you mean a God prophet?" Said, "There's a difference. Not all prophets are the same." &gt;&gt; Said, "See, Jesus was a man. He was just a man. He's a virgin-born man." That's right. He was the son of God. His father was Jehovah, God Almighty. And then Jehovah built him a house. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. which was his son &gt;&gt; to represent himself to the world and God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself. Ain't that wonderful? Jehovah built himself a house that he could come and dwell in that Jehovah God. He said he could reconcile the world to himself. He said that was God in Christ reconciling the world into himself. He said but now we have that same spirit by measure that he had without measure. for the fullness of the Godhead bodily dwelt within the Son of God. He himself, he was a man, but the spirit that was in him was God. He said, "You're a man. These are men. We are men. I'm a man." He said, "But the spirit in us is God, but we only have it by measure." &gt;&gt; I love this illustration because he shows the difference between us and between the man Jesus, &gt;&gt; who was a God prophet. He said because Jesus as a God prophet a as a man the son of God the dwelling place of God. He said it would be as if the whole ocean was in was in one person. He said and because he had the whole ocean in him. He said then that was the fullness of God that was in that one man. Jesus said, "But then you could go out in that ocean and you could take a spoon of that ocean and you could give Brother Mark a drink of it and Brother Carter a drink of it and Brother Emanuel a drink and brother Noah a drink and and you give Brother Joe a drink and and each one could h have a drink of that same ocean and then you could take that water and and you could take it down and have it analyzed and Brother Connor give you a drink and I don't want to leave you out buddy but but but you could take that and have it analyzed and and when it was analyzed, you'd find out the same thing that was in the ocean is the same thing that was in the spoonful. Do you notice when a scientist does a test on water, they're not going to go down if they're trying to have some problem with a creek or a stream and they're trying to figure out what's causing it. Maybe there's some algae or something that's growing in it and they're trying to figure out what is causing it. They don't go get the whole river and bring it into the lab to see what's in it, but they go get a little test tube and they scoop up a little of it and they take it in the laboratory and they dump it in the petri dish and they run tests on it to find out what is in it and what bacteria is growing in it. But do you realize that that little part is a sample of what's in the hole? &gt;&gt; But remember, that's how he explains the the the spirit of God. He said, "And just like Jesus had the whole ocean." He said, "But every one of us," he said, "you have a spoonful. You have a spoonful. She has a spoonful. She has a spoonful. He said, "Then when they go to the lab and test, they find out it's the same chemical that Jesus had. It's the same ocean that he had." He said, "But we just got a spoonful of the ocean, but it's the same kind of chemical." He said, "That's the way the Holy Ghost is." He said, "With your spoonful and my spoonful and their spoonful and you put all of it together, then we can do things for God. If we'll just let it flow together, it'll bring in the presence of God. I thought, my no wonder our licks of fire joined together can bring the presence of God. He said, but if you can bring your spoonful, you can bring your spoonful and you can bring your spoonful. Brother Mark, you take a few believers that could bring that spoonful of their little part of the ocean. THERE'S A RIVER OF LIFE that's flowing out of the church of the living God THAT STILL GIVES LIFE TO THE UNBELIEVER THAT STILL BRINGS HEALING to the SICK THAT OR THE SICK AND BRINGS SALVATION TO THOSE THAT ARE LOST. &gt;&gt; He said, "But oh man, listen, it'll bring the presence of God if we could bring our spoonfuls together." &gt;&gt; Oh my, it can bring our spoonfuls together. He said, "It'll cause it to flow together." MY IS THAT YOU GET ENOUGH enough water in one place, it can't stay there for long. It's going to look for a place to flow because it wants to move. &gt;&gt; You bring it together, it'll bring the presence of God. &gt;&gt; He said, "But no man at any time &gt;&gt; from Adam until Jesus comes again will ever be able to perform miracles at his own disposal." &gt;&gt; He never did. Even the son of God or no prophet, speaking of Jesus, it was always by divine vision that showed him what to do. The Bible said so. So don't let no man That's why the Bible would say don't be don't be fooled when somebody says come over here there's a prophet over here come over here's Jesus over here and and performing miracles to draw people and I'll do this miracle to draw people he said because no man according to the scripture can perform a miracle on his own or at his own disposal it's only what he would see the father do &gt;&gt; by vision can so so notice what happens here in this age when I run out of time y'all tell me I I'll I'll come back next time. &gt;&gt; But as long as y'all still listening, I'll keep preaching. &gt;&gt; But notice what happens. Jesus says in Luke's or in the Luke 16th chapter says, "The law and the prophets were until John." Now, I bring this out because I'm going to I'm going to I want to show you a false teaching that that is among the denominational churches today. The law and the prophets is until John. They took that scripture and because of the spirit of error that that they don't read the whole thing because the Bible actually says the law and the prophets was until John. But since that time, the kingdom of God is preached and every man pressth into it. That's the whole scripture. Says, see, but they think the law and the prophets was until John. In other words, and so they'll go and say, well, no longer no longer is there any no longer is there any prophets because the law and the prophets was only until John. &gt;&gt; But Jesus actually speaking, he says, but since that time, the kingdom of God is preached. In other words, no longer that the kingdom of God is coming, but the kingdom of God is here. So the purpose purpose of him saying that was the law and the prophets were prophesying of the coming of something. &gt;&gt; He says so all the way until John was the law and the prophets. He said but now since that time the kingdom of God is preached which is exactly what John the Baptist said. He said repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. It was John the Baptist's ministry. So the law and the prophets was bringing us unto this place and to where the kingdom of God would become present into the earth. He said, "But now every man presseth into it." In other words, it was the presence of a spiritual kingdom. That's what the Bible said. In those days came John the Baptist preaching saying, "Repent for the kingdom of heaven." Notice what he was doing. He was introducing a spiritual kingdom. It was no in no way what he was he trying to do away with the prophets. &gt;&gt; It had nothing to do with prophets. It wasn't he wasn't even talking about prophets. He was talking about the kingdom of heaven being introduced into this world. In no way was he speaking of doing away with the prophets. &gt;&gt; But the church world today, many hundreds of times that I've spoke to people that would quote that scripture to me when you talk about a prophet and say, "But brother, the law and the prophets was only until John." &gt;&gt; Like, well, you I like how you threw that word only in there and kind of change the meaning of it, but that ain't the meaning of it at all. Matter of fact, I want to show you this. I don't just want to tell you, I want to show you because I want you to have it. And it's it's recorded so you can go back and look. But but but since the time if that's a true statement, the law and the prophets was until John. I don't know what time it is. Y'all have to tell me. But but if that's if that's a if you would take that and say, "Well, there's no prophets after John." Well, then then then all the scriptures that came after John would be false scriptures if they talked about a prophet, right? So if there's no prophets until John, can we just put this the can I just put this on trial? I'm I'm just gonna bed down right here just a minute. I'm gonna put it on trial because it's false and and people use it every day to to to discourage the the people of God. &gt;&gt; So So I want you to notice Acts 13th chapter. The Bible says, "Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers." &gt;&gt; Now this was long after John the Baptist. &gt;&gt; The church at Antioch is in the church there was pro certain prophets and teachers. Barnabas and Simeon and Lucius and Mania. They were all prophets and teachers that were these men. They were identified as prophets of God. Even it kind of ruffle some folks. But even Philillip the evangelist, the Bible said Philip had four daughters and all four of them were prophets. &gt;&gt; And they were Philip he was an evangelist. Acts the 21st chapter but Abraham said and they prophesied. &gt;&gt; They were prophets. It say so you don't you Acts 21st chapter and as we tried there many days there came down from Judea a certain prophet named Agabus. Acts 21 and10. So if there was no prophet after John, then what was Agabus? And why why would they write and say there after we terried many days and there came down from Judea a certain prophet by the name of Agabus? And when he was come unto us, he took Paul's girdle and he bound it with his own hands and feet. And he said, "Thus sayeth the Holy Ghost, so shall the Jews of Jerusalem bind the man that owns this girdle and shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles." And you know what happened when Paul went down? It it was a warning for him. The very thing that would happen, it was prophesied by the Holy Ghost, by a God-gus. &gt;&gt; Agabus, he wasn't no church age messenger. &gt;&gt; He may not been no, he may not been a a a major prophet, but he was a prophet of God. &gt;&gt; So, the the prophets didn't end with John the Baptist. How could you believe How could you believe that lie that the prophets ended with John the Baptist after John the Baptist? God don't use prophets. Will friends, I'm I'm just going to lay one more out there. This is a little one. But what about Paul? &gt;&gt; There was a messenger to the Ephesian church. But said Peter was granted the authority to open the doors of the Gentiles, but it was given to Paul to be their apostle and prophet. He was the prophet messenger to the Gentiles, his prophetic office by which he received the full revelation of the word for the Gentiles, authenticated him as their apostolic messenger. And to this even the other apostles at Jerusalem agreed. Remember what Paul said, Romans 11, he said, "I speak to you Gentiles in so much as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office." &gt;&gt; You said, "Well, does that make a Paul a prophet?" Well, let's just let's just read it. Acts 20th chapter, Paul said, "Take heed unto yourselves, and all the flock which is of the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers. Feed the church of God." It's a warning to the shepherds. Feed the church of God which he hath purchased with his own blood. that the Holy Ghost has made you overseers of God's flock. Paul said, "For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock. And after your ownelves shall men arise, speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after them." Can I ask you a question? When Paul said, "For I know this, this is going to happen after I'm gone." How did he know that? &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Somebody tell me, how did he know what was going to take place after he was gone? Let me tell you, how would he know the future? How would he know what would take place? What would cause Paul when he was sitting in the in the prison cell that day? And the Bible, remember when the Bible says they were down there praising and all and praying and all of a sudden the earth did shake and and and the and the prison bars opened up and in the darkness of the night that the prison guard sitting there thought in his heart that he was going to be in trouble cuz the prisoners would escape. But while he thought in his heart, he heard the voice of Apostle Paul say, "Don't worry, jailer, but we're all still here." Can I ask you friends, in the middle of the darkness, there was no lie. HE DIDN'T SAY IT. HE TAUGHT IT IN HIS HEART. BUT WHAT WOULD CAUSE A MAN BY THE NAME OF PAUL to know WHAT A JAILER WAS THINKING in his heart? Don't worry, BUT WE'RE ALL STILL HERE. &gt;&gt; We have not escaped or not in trouble. And the Bible says because of Paul expressing in front of him that that jailer gave his heart to the Lord. He went out and he fixed their wounds. He gave his heart, his family, they were saved BECAUSE HE SEEN THE SUPERNATURAL TAKE PLACE in his life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus said they will be made known, &gt;&gt; but you'll kill them. You'll slay them. Many of them you'll mock. You'll persecute them. But not all persecuted them. Paul the prophet in Ephesians the fourth chapter he said he gave some apostles he gave some prophets. Can I ask you this? Who gave and when did he give them? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who gave and when did he give them? &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; He gave some prophets apostles. Can I just read it? &gt;&gt; He said but unto you unto you every one of us is given the grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ. Wherefore he saith, when he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and he gave gifts unto men. Now that he ascended, who's he? &gt;&gt; Christ. &gt;&gt; Who else ascended? &gt;&gt; Now that he ascended, what is it? But he that also descended first into the lower parts of the earth. &gt;&gt; He said, but now the same that has descended has ascended up far above the heavens, that he might feel all things. This is the he we're talking about, Jesus. He said, "And he gave some apostles and some prophets." &gt;&gt; This same Jesus. This is after John. John introduced Jesus. He said, "But he descended. Then he ascended." He said, "And after he ascended that he might fill all things, and he gave some apostles and some prophets and evangelists and pastors and teachers, speaking of the gifts that would come to men." He said, "For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, and for the edifying of the body of Christ." Amen. &gt;&gt; Just what Jesus said, "Behold, I send unto you prophets." Paul came right around and said he gave unto you apostles and prophets. The very thing Jesus said he would do, Paul said that he did. Until we all come, you say, "Well, when's it going to end?" And Paul says, "Until we all come into the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, under the measure of the stature of the fullness fullness of Christ, that we henceforth may be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the slight of men and cunning craftedness, whereby they lie and wait to deceit." So when God sent a five-fold ministry, he sent it for our perfection. I wonder how many say this tonight. He sent it for my perfection. Somebody say, "My perfection." So that means when he sent an apostle, he sent it for what? For my perfection. Can you accept that? When he sent a prophet, he sent it for what? For my perfection. When he sent a pastor, he sent it for what? For my perfection. When he sent a teacher, he sent it for what? For my perfection. When he sent an evangelist, an apostle, he sent it for what? He sent it for my perfection. &gt;&gt; And God hasn't changed. &gt;&gt; See, there's always, you realize there's always been a prophet messenger in every age from the time of Paul until now. Not just prophets, but brother Mark, from the time of Paul, there's been a word prophet, a prophet messenger. Brother B, I'm going to end with this tonight because it's going to get into way too much that I can get to, but he says, "Now, I do not deny that people will prophesy in this last age, and their ministries can and will be correct. I do not deny that there will be prophets, even as in the days of Paul, when there was one like Agabus, a prophet who prophesied of a famine. I agree that it is so. But I deny upon the infallible evidence of the word that there is more than one major prophet messenger who will reveal the mysteries as contained in the word and who has the ministry to turn the hearts of the children to the fathers. That's thus sayeth the Lord. By his unfailing word it stands and he shall stand and be vindicated. There is one prophet messenger unto this age. &gt;&gt; It don't mean that there ain't prophets. It's easy to look. Isn't there a prophet here? Didn't somebody say this guy was a prophet? Didn't shouldn't this one be? He said, "I don't deny that there's prophets and I don't deny that God don't use them. And I don't deny that it ain't correct, but there's only one prophet messenger to every age. &gt;&gt; There's only one. And in this day that God would the Bible said in this day, let me show you in the scripture just to be something to feed on till we come back. In this day, God would send the spirit of Elijah." Malachi 4:5. And that same spirit that was on John the Baptist, remember what he said? Behold the lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world. He said, what did he do? He was declaring his presence. In other words, he was making him known. Friends, can I tell you something tonight in closing? That's the only way God can ever do anything for you is for you to recognize he's here. What good would a God be if he was Jehovah Gyra or Jehovah Rafi or Jehovah Nissi, a healer, a banner, a provider? If he was your peace, if he was your shepherd, what good WOULD ALL OF IT DO IF HE WASN'T HERE among us? It's no wonder that Ezekiel when he whenever he would talk about the the the city of Jerusalem, he said it was beautiful on the east, it was beautiful on the west and there was a great name written and the name of this tribe was written here. AND HE'S BEGIN TO DEFINE how beautiful and how perfectly it was built. BUT THE VERY LAST WORDS THAT EZEKIEL EVER SAID, HE SAID, "BUT THE NAME UPON THE CITY shall be that the Lord is there." IT'S JEHOVAH SHAMA. WHAT GOOD WOULD ALL of it be if he wasn't here? &gt;&gt; He said, "The Lord is here." here. I thought what a declaration it is. The Bible said he's the same yesterday as the music players want to come. He said he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. How many believes that? He said that means then how would he act today? He would act today just like he did yesterday. Isn't that right? So where is he at tonight? He's sitting on the right hand of the majesty, his body. But the spirit is here in the building to make him known. &gt;&gt; Is here in the building just to make him known. I thought what a declaration. You know why that people don't see him? Because they don't look for him in the right way. &gt;&gt; They're looking by prophecy. They're looking for the hour when he would come. Remember what they asked that one day? The Greeks came and they said we would see Jesus. And as Jesus look, look at his answer. He said, "The hour has come the son of man should be glorified." He said, "I say unto you, except a corner of wheat would fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone. But if it die, it'll bring forth much fruit. speaking of his own death and burial and resurrection testifying of his purpose said but for this cause I came unto this hour father glorify thy name and then out of heaven he heard a voice said I have both glorified it but I will glorify it again in other words this wasn't the end of this ministry this isn't the end of it he's I have glorified it [music] I will glorify it again you have seen it &gt;&gt; but you will see it again &gt;&gt; watch closely did you notice it was a Greek. Wasn't the Samaritan. It wasn't the Jew. They both saw those Messiah signs. But a Greek wanted to see it. And Jesus knew now wasn't the time. That was the Gentile. Now wasn't the time for you to see it. But there's coming a time. See, they looked by prophecy. That's why they could recognize him. It was prophesied that he would come. For hundreds of years, it was prophesied he would come. But do you realize that today that as the gentile people begin to look for the coming of Christ that we don't look to see him with the same prophecy that the Jew or the Samaritan and look to see him? See their prophecy was from the prophet Micah out of Bethlehem. There will come a ruler of Israel. That was the Jews prophecy. A virgin shall conceive. You realize that's not your prophecy. &gt;&gt; She already did. &gt;&gt; Amen. He was wounded for our transgressions. [music] The chastisement of his peace was it was a prophecy, but he already [music] did. &gt;&gt; A star will announce his birth. &gt;&gt; That was a prophecy, but it's not ours. &gt;&gt; He'll be born in a manger. That was a Bible prophecy, but it's not ours. &gt;&gt; David said he'll say, "My God, why has thou forsaken me?" But that's not ours. We're not looking for Jesus to come and say, "Why has thou forsaken me?" We're not looking for him to die on a cross. Our prophecy isn't the same one. You see why so many failed to see him? Why is it hard to see Christ today? Because they take the prophecy that was meant to the Jew and to the Samaritan and try to apply that to today and say, "That's how I'm going to see Jesus." [music] But the Greeks said, "I would see Jesus." Look at how he said, "Here's the answer." He said, "I have both glorified him and I will again." Man, there's coming an age. There's coming a time. Well, he will be made known. &gt;&gt; See, you're if you're still looking to see him in that way, you'll never see him. You said, "Brother Matt, well, how can I see him today?" Well, you got to get the right prophecy. &gt;&gt; Let's go back and read our prophecy. Malachi Malachi 4 and5. Behold, I will send unto you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Luke 17 and30. That's our that's our prophecy that's speaking to this age. Revelations 10:7, the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God would be finished. &gt;&gt; See, we're not looking for nail scarred hands. &gt;&gt; Brother Mark, we're not looking for we're not looking for a a crown of thorns to be placed upon his head, but we're looking for the word of God to be manifested &gt;&gt; in human flesh. &gt;&gt; We're looking for a ministry that would come in this age that would fulfill Malachi 4 and5. Just like the Bible said, in the beginning was the [music] word. The word was with God and the word was God. It was made flesh. It dwelt among us. Then that seed went into the ground just like Jesus said. It came back in the form of the Holy Ghost and now the same works that Jesus done is being done in the church. &gt;&gt; And it looked like it died one day in those dark ages. But brother said all that happened. He said it had to go into the ground just like every seed in order to bring forth. It had to go in the ground to bring forth. He said the church had to do the same thing. Whenever c whenever the spirit of God fell upon the church, he said even the bride had to go through the dark ages and to be buried that it could be brought forth in this age. &gt;&gt; He said in any grain that goes in the ground, it must die. He said that great church on the day of Pentecost by the sending of the Holy Ghost had to suffer martyrdom, go into the dirt into the earth to bring forth again in the age of Luther and come out in the full stature of the bride of Jesus Christ for this last day. Therefore, the bride and the rapture will come forth and there it's all pre-planned by God and all backed up. &gt;&gt; Ain't that powerful? &gt;&gt; God can't even lose it. &gt;&gt; He ain't like that. He ain't like that guy that lost his Bitcoin, put it on a drive and it's buried out in a dumpster somewhere and now he can't find it. God ain't like that. When he puts something valuable, he backs it up &gt;&gt; to make sure it happened. He said God put it there and he backed it up with his word. Then he performed it. here in this age that we would see that same gift of God. And how many how many knows that whenever that we would see him here? I I thought about John the Baptist. You realize as a as a fulfillment of of Elijah, the the spirit of Elijah that was upon him that only one time that John the Baptist stand in the presence of Jesus and declare him to be here. &gt;&gt; One time he he stood in his presence. He said, "Behold the lamb of God." But you know that brother Brandham hundreds of times would stand in an audience of people not just once but hundreds of times and declare he is here. &gt;&gt; The very same thing that John the Baptist declared once time after time after time he would stand and declare it. &gt;&gt; He said that's if you want to stand to your feet. He said that's right. He is here now. I'm not going to read them all. He said I believe we'll see him. Don't you? He said he's here now. His power is moving. He said, "Now look for him. He's here." He said, "But he'll only reveal himself to those who believe him." &gt;&gt; He's here. He's here to make you well. He's here to heal. He's here to do all things. He said, "Let's say, praise be to God, for he's here and he's ready and he's willing. &gt;&gt; He's here to bless you. He's here. Jesus Christ, the son of God. &gt;&gt; He's in the building." &gt;&gt; You say, "How do you see him?" You got to look for him the right way. Stop looking for nail scarred hands and crown of thorns and and some robed flesh to walk in among you. He said, "He's here. Jesus Christ, the son of God. He's in the building." I love this. This young man, he would come to the prayer line and brother began to speak to him. He said, "What do you think about all this? All this he's here declaring him people's lives being discerned. What do you think about all this?" He said, "Do you believe the Lord Jesus Christ to be the son of God? That he's raised from the dead?" He said, "Yes, sir." He said, "Do you believe that he's here now and that his works that it's his works and not ours?" "Yes, it's his works. It's not mine." See here what he was looking for a man to believe that he was here. He was a gentile boy. He was looking to see the sign, the sign of the Messiah. I want to know that he's here. He said, "Do you believe that he's here?" now and that it's his works. It's not my works. It's his. Do you believe that? He said, "Yes, I believe it to be his." He said, "Well, you've got heart trouble and rheumatic fever." And let me tell you, young man, you didn't just get that. You got it when you was in the Navy. You was a sailor, wasn't you? He said, "When you was in the Navy, you picked up that rheumatic fever." He said, "That's where you got it." Isn't that right? Yes. He said, "But tonight, right here at this altar is where you're going to leave it. &gt;&gt; You got it in the Navy, but you're going to leave it right here at Calvary." I thought, my what was it? It was that same Messiah standing in the presence in the presence of a man. Brother Mark, it was a a man, a flesh man that was mistakes just like you and I. But in the heart of that man, in the life of that man stepped in the angel of the Lord and begin to declare and use his lips, &gt;&gt; a prophet that being used by that that that same angel of the Lord that would say that you're a sailor. What else could tell a man that he was a sailor and his fever came from a from from his uh stint in the Navy? He not only could he tell him where he got it, but he told him where he was going to leave it. &gt;&gt; This is where the spirit got on you. But today, this is where the spirit leaves. If you can just believe that he is here &gt;&gt; and that it's not my works, that it's his works. It was the order of recognizing a prophet and the true purpose of a prophet, friends. Not just any prophet. It was a prophet. He was displaying a messiah sign, a messenger of this age. He wasn't just some ordinary man. He didn't just have a dream one day and have a vision one day and say something that came to pass. I'm talking about a prophet that was like an unos, the angel of the Lord being manifested in human flesh. just a man that God sent prophets and evangelists and teachers and pastors. I don't neglect the gift that God puts in this age. And so, what was the purpose of it? To give vision to the church. I wonder how many can say this tonight. I got I got a good series ahead of me. And how many can say this tonight that I can declare that he is here? &gt;&gt; That you've recognized that sign as not being the sign that a man I I I just can't I just can't bring myself to it, brother. I can't bring myself to giving a man enough credit to have that kind of ability for people to say that that's just a man and you're all man followers. For people to say that or giving more credit to a man than I could ever give because I can't look at that and say that a man could have that ability. I don't believe that a man could have that kind of ability. But it could only be a God in a man that could do that. I couldn't look at you and tell you where you're from, but I know what the Bible said. The Bible says the Holy Ghost is a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of our heart. And that same Holy Ghost that was there in the in the upper room is the same Holy Ghost that was standing on that platform that said it was romatic fever and it came from the Navy. That's where you picked it up. And friends, I'm going to tell you that same Holy Ghost is here. And he discerns the thoughts and the intents of our heart. He don't cause us to stand up here and try to copy brother Brandham's gift and try to be him. There ain't going to be another one of them. There was only one. But I'll say this tonight that that same Holy Ghost still discerns the thoughts and intents of our heart. And by the preaching of the word of God, he directs us. He leads us. He guides us as a body of believers. And one of these days, that same Holy Ghost will lead us right into the rapture of the church. Friends, don't you turn loose of it.
