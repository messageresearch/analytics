blood well nothing the blood of J amen we certainly believe that tonight don't we amen if there's anybody that knows about it I believe amen we're looking at a group of people that understand that that it's nothing but the blood of Jesus I think often of the Lord when he was praying In The Garden of Gethsemane amen he died a death before he died amen the scripture said he prayed there at Gethsemane which means wine press or which oil press which is a place where they would press the oils and it was there he said Lord father if it's possible let this cup pass from me and it wasn't possible because it wasn't anything else could do it amen and I believe if he knew there that in the garden he knows that there tonight that there's nothing there's nothing but the blood amen you love the Lord tonight amen isn't it good to be in the house of the Lord and amen we put this T up and amen and made a place amen made a place for him uh isn't it amazing that atmosphere can be created right out in the middle of a field somewhere but we wasn't the first ones had this thought God gave this to Moses years ago and when God wanted to place to meet with people in an atmosphere where things could bud and yield Moses made God a place place and we've made a place here tonight to come together to fellowship with him and amen under this great great tent tonight and amen it's good to

Lord Jesus we want to thank you tonight Lord for your mercy upon us now father as we have invited you we want to give you the floor we want to yield to you Lord and give you the right away in these

meeting we ask you to take control bless your children father in the the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen and God bless you if you have your Bibles tonight we want to just take a few minutes in the scripture here in the book of Corinthians uh 1 Corinthians 2 and14 and we're also going to be looking at Hebrews 5 and 14 1 Corinthians 2 and 14 brother 1 Corinthians 2 and4 but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God for they are foolishness unto him and neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned in Hebrews chapter 5 and verse 14 but strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil may God bless you tonight as you be seated I want to speak to you for just the next little bit here and I want to talk to you about the Battle of perspective the Battle of perspective amen uh uh and let me Define the word perspective uh it's a way of thinking about and understanding something it's a way of thinking about or understanding something and that's exactly where the battle really lays tonight upon each one of us is the Battle of understanding uh and I could say it to you like this the challenge of the age is discernment that is the challenge uh this this age that we're living in is in an age of fruit and all the trees are bringing forth fruit in the season so there must be a discernment of what kind that we are partaking of now one thing that we know for certain if God then would cause us uh a a need to have discernment and would command that we would be Discerning he also then would have to supply the discernment he would he would have to give it now somebody says well God don't give discernment but yet he does God does give discernment because when you look in the scriptures you'll find out that he gave discernment but yet even in the animals now brother ramam said his first Bible of course was is the nature and so when we look into nature itself we can see that the animals themselves have discernment and I I think it's funny as you look into into the into the nature and you can see how that brother Bram talks about over there in India before they'd have a big earthquake he said the all the mules and he said the The Oxen and I've been there and saw the fields and how they're full and it gets real hot in the summer and there ain't hardly any trees in some of those places and they pick all the Rocks up out of the field and they build fences some of y'all know about that brother Roy just build an old rock fence you know and amen must have been like the hills Arkansas enough Rock but but you you can see them them fences what he talks about over there and when the animals in the heat of the day they get up against those fences to get some shade but brother Bram said it wasn't the other day he said they were watching how them animals started scattering back from them fences and and the everybody was saying what's wrong or what's going on and he said there was an earthquake about to hit and he said they uh that god-given instinct was causing them to get away from the wall before it fell see because God gives discernment to animals he gives them an ability to uh perceive something that before it happens or there there's something that happens brother Ram said before earthquakes comes and before things happen little birds find their shelters and and they and they find these things because see God gives it and it's surely if God would give a fish a discernment how much more would he give his children if God would give a discernment to a duck all the way up there in Canada in a certain time of year about this time of year they start changing their mind on them being North and a little bit later they start their they flying south amen but something has to cause them to get ready to go they're just engineered with something amen C you they sell a lot of merchandise in the duck world Amen relying on the nature that's within the duck the Ducks are going to come every year they're going to come and they're going to fly a certain path and I know we all think we probably could pick a better path for them but you know when God picks a path it's the best path and and they don't have GPS and they don't have man-made Technologies and and they don't have to pack up a bunch of things to take with them they just hear the call and they begin to move because their perception is that if we don't move we're going to die if something don't happen there's going to be something different and and so God gives that to even animals and you can see it when the Bible talks about Noah building an ark amen something made them uh them animals know that it was time to get on that Ark now there's one place brother B kind of talks about how when Noah got that Ark finished that he just stood up and hollered Hallelujah a few times and here they come and got on the ark you know because God gave them something to know what what could we say tonight about how they all got on that Ark you couldn't really explain it other than to say that God gave them a perception that something's about to happen and we've got to make a change and and God was supplying that change what could you say about an old aome that that would carry its babies in the point of death and right in the middle of the day against its own nature would would walk right out into the human world and lose its fear of humanity you know since Noah's time the Bible said that the fear of man was upon animals amen and there was a natural fear for an animal but there was a perception amen something happens to this little old pum that decides I got to get down to a certain house now now the prophet said I seen that pum and it passed three houses before it come to and was something made that little fell know that it wasn't in that first house and it wasn't in justification or something made it know it wasn't in them houses and made it kept going brother B said till it turned the corner amen and that little fell turned the corner and went down there at the prophet's house you know brother B said that that that little possum laid out there in the Sun and there was some shade just over there but it laid out there in that sun knowing amen that there was a a ripening that was needed in the presence of God and and that little that little Pome knew that and I I believe if God can give that kind of discernment to an animal why couldn't he give that kind of discernment or that kind of perception Amen to a person if they would only listen to God there something that God has given to every man woman or child amen that that something that lets you know that that there's something wrong with this or there's something right about this that's that's what God gives and you knowy I hate to say it but sometimes animals got more discernment than human beings sometimes animals has got more discernment than human beings I got scripture on that by the way that was a man b b balum one time somebody tried to hire him to curse God's children and he and he got on a donkey and be to ride down there against the will of God and you know the Bible tells us that that old donkey gave up on him three times and three times that donkey tried to tell him we are going the wrong direction but the third time balum got off and began to beat that mule amen and told him he said well I I just kill you and can you imagine when that donkey turned over and looked at its master and said ain't I your donkey haven't you owned me all these years and when have I ever failed to carry you brother I tell you I'd have done a check up right there amen when your animals start talking to you amen let me tell you what amen and all of a sudden Baum's eyes opened up and saw what that donkey had been seeing the whole time a angel of the Lord was standing standing there with a drawn sword and said if if the MU hadn't stopped I would have killed you already amen but God Amen had let that mule G that donkey have a little bit amen of discernment and it saved the life of bam and that's when bam finally said amen to the angel of the Lord he said well if you see that my way is evil you forgive me and I will change my direction and the angel said no bam don't don't change your direction just keep going amen but you only say down there what it is I had put in your lips and amen I tell you what a powerful story tonight if you're going to talk about if you're going to talk about perception how could you talk about perception and not talk about the difference in the way the people view the children of Israel when I think about balam and his story with Bic now we all know Bic and and we know the country of Moab and of course Moab was a was a an incestuous uh son of lot that he'd had with his daughter and they had started this Kingdom Moab and when when the children of Israel needed to go through that land cuz lot was Ken to Abraham right and they needed to go through that land on their way through there amen the Bible tells us that they didn't want that kind of Revival in that country so Bayo decided I'll hire me some preachers to preach against that move so that we will might be able to stop it because they knew they couldn't stop it on their own right because God fought for Israel amen so the only way to stop it was to get something Supernatural involved amen but you find out this amen that amen there wasn't enough money to pay balum to be able to curse God's children CU God done blessed his children amen I I'd love to I'd love to study scripture and I find out here when you're looking at balum and and you're looking at the Revival when they're trying to go through there that that bides the king of Moab decides he said what we're going to do is we're going to stop this and we're going to do it by this this preacher this balum and they bring him in amen and and they and and he says to him he says well I'll tell you what you need to do you need to come right over here now now I'm not going to preach on all these spots but I'll tell you this amen they didn't just say to balam to prophesy against Israel but he changed even the locations that balum stood so when balum looked at the children of Israel amen B said well no no I I know you might be able to curse them from here but let's move over here now the scripture details that there were three different places that Bayo took balum now if you uh if you like to read you'll find out amen that brother bam says it like this he said now when bam looked upon it he said he failed to see a smitten Rock he said he failed to see a blast serpent he failed to see the pillar of fire and he tried to judge them from a moral standpoint and he failed to see the higher calling of God now by grace and election that were the line they were in with God's word and when he wanted to curse them God said don't you do it they are mine leave them alone don't you touch them amen now of course amen that balam should have knew by scripture that he couldn't curse them amen because according to the Bible in Genesis chapter 14 when Abraham amen went out and saved lot who was the Grand was the father of this country when he went and saved him MDC met Abraham on the road back amen I'll tell you thank God for that story of meadii Amen it's when God took on the Flesh and talked with Abraham amen the scripture says in Genesis 14 and when MDC king of Salem brought forth Bread and Wine and he was the most the priest of the most high God now now he brought forth Bread and Wine now you got to ask yourself where he got it where did he get the bread and wine that he brought now I don't have time to teach all these things but I'm just going to say them amen they're about to have communion right there on the road amen so they're going to have a feast and it's called mdc's Feast because it was a communion that Abraham was having with God when God brought his own bread now now y'all know the word is the bread and in this evening time when the church is going to have communion with God it wasn't what the church was bringing it was what God was bringing mdct has returned in this age and he brought the bread for supper brother amen in Revelation chapter 3 he said behold I stand the door and knock and if any man open up and I will come in and S with him brother manam said he'll come and have supper with him amen he'll have communion with him and the bread we're about to eat comes from meadi and thank God he brought the wine with him amen and that wine is a stimulation of the revelation of almighty God when you sat down to have supper with B CID amen you can have a stimulation of the revelation of the word that he brings into the Church of the Living God I don't know about y'all but I don't believe in no dead letters and I don't don't believe in no dead meetings amen I'd like to see the Holy Ghost have power and Liberty when it comes into the Church of God do you see it was the priest of the most high God now that word the most high God actually is in the Hebrew it's called L Elon it's a it's a it's a Hebrew title for God like Jehovah Gyra or Jehovah RFA this is L Elon which it means there is no God higher than this God wo brother let me tell you Amen in other words the big God blessed him that there was nobody above this guy to bless them now look if you're blessed of someone amen and there's somebody over them then they can come by and bless you and the person bigger than them can come by and he can redirect it or he can curse you or he can change it but when Abraham received a blessing from the most high God there's nobody bigger than that God there is no system there is no denomination there is no church there's no Pastor there is no false prophets there is nothing higher than that God that met Abraham and blessed him and I say this tonight the Bible said he blessed Abram of the most high god possessor of Heaven and Earth and blessed him amen which he delivered into the hands of thine enemies and he gave him tithe of all so he was the Blessed now I say that because balam has been hired to curse them when God had already blessed them amen and the Bible said the most high God blessed them in Genesis 12 the Bible said the Lord said to Abram get out of the country and from thy Kindred and from thy father's house and unto a land which I will show thee and I will make thee a great nation and bless the and make he a great name and thou shalt be a blessing and I will bless them that bless thee and I will curse them that curseth thee and in th shall all the families of the earth be blessed now God was going to bless them and there ain't nothing that can curse them listen I thank God tonight to know this folks amen that when God blesses you there ain't nothing that can turn the blessing of God into the curse of God God blesses a person or a people and that is an irreversible blessing that comes from almighty God in Numbers chapter 24 in verse one the Bible said it like this that BAC and balam brought unto him into the high places of Baal that he might must see the utmost parts of the people now one place he took them was the high place of Baal so in other words he took ba took balum he took him by the hand and said come up here on this high place where we worship Baal so that you can see Israel from the Heathen point of view amen and I'll tell you if you can get people looking at the church through the Heathen point of view amen they look pretty rough amen they look like Heretics and crazy people amen so let's take them up here High where we can look at them like this amen do you see the Bible actually says he took them in the field the field of Soo which is there up where he built seven altars and the scripture tells us this is where the Watchers were or the watchtowers so they would take he took balum around let's just put it this way in three different places to see the children of God because see he was trying to give him a perception of what he was looking at he was trying to convince balum that you can curse them because you see this and because this is there and and because this is there you can lay the curse there but I thank God Amen how that balum received of the Lord amen when balum was told to the Lord whatever you do you can't curse this people and he come back and prophesied three times and then all three prophecies you must know how balum B felt when balam began to prophesy because when he looked upon them I love it in in numbers 23 and 19 balam says to them he says listen God is not a man that he should lie neither the son of man that he should repent hath he said and shall not do it or hath he spoken and shall he not make it good now God wanted to remind those people that he wasn't like a man because a man can be persuaded and a man can be influenced this way and that way and this way and that way but see God is not a man can can I say he's an unchanging God and God don't change his mind about his children he don't even you're not going to get up in the morning and God say oh never mind I changed my mind because he's a god and the Bible said he changes not he's not a man that somebody can talk him out of it he's not a man and so fickle amen I thank God tonight to old brother Matt ain't nobody ain't got nothing they can tell God that's going to change his mind about what he thinks about me because he's already declared it in the word of God and the word is sure and steadfast and forever God is not a man that he should lie neither the son of man that he should repent y forgive me I'm going to have to lose this jacket amen but uh uh amen feel pretty good in here tonight don't he somebody shout hallelujah ain't you glad that God's not a man ain't you glad he don't change every morning ain't you glad that nobody can talk him into or talk him out of Amen you know why because the Bible said in the very next verse behold I've received a commandment to bless and he blessed and I can not reverse it well I wish I had the voice of a million Angels when God blesses of people there ain't nothing can reverse it come on we're not playing Uno church we don't have no reverse cards we don't have another part of the story we don't have something else that we can bring up and say oh never mind God made a mistake God don't make mistakes and when God makes a choice that choice is before the foundation of the world Hallelujah before there were time there was eternity and what God done for you and me he done in eternity and there ain't nothing in time that can change what was happening in eternity behold I received a commandment to bless and he has blessed and he cannot reverse it he cannot reverse it I'm glad to know that this is an irreversible blessing in now somebody said well that's just the Old Testament then why did Paul say it in Romans the 8th chapter that I am persuaded this is my perception that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come there is not height or death or any creature that is able to separate me from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord that's why balam would say in numbers 23 and 23 surely there is no enchantment against Jacob neither is there any divination against Israel according to this time it shall be said of Jacob what hath God rought in other words I know we're coming on to I know we're coming on to devil season around here in Halloween and he witches everywhere I don't know why a bunch of Christian people get into a bunch of paganism but anyhow the devils are coming out in just a few days but I got news for the devil before you get to your Halloween I had a day at Cal before you get to your curses and your spells and your black magic God has already blessed me I know what I'm talking about I stood there in India when they tried to cast spells on me but the power of God would put it right back into the face of them because God who is rich in Mercy has the power to bless in the face of the curse you ain't going to change it you ain't going to change it you ain't you ain't going to reverse this amen there ain't no enchantment there's no witchery there's no there's no amount of talking about it to reverse what God had done I'll tell you why because in numbers 23 and 23 21 he says it he hath not beheld the iniquity in Jacob neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel the Lord his God is with him and the shout of the king is is in the camp now what's that mean it means he hath not beheld iniquity now to some that would mean that balam looked them over and didn't find nothing wrong but that's actually opposite to what the prophet said about it he said brother bandam said it like this there was not one thing morally that Israel was not guilty of at that very time but God didn't behold the iniquity in Jacob and he didn't see the pro veress in Israel now now I'll just say it like this I'll take the Greek word behold Heen from the English there it means to look at or to regard it means to pay attention to or to consider it he did not regard the iniquity in Israel it's not that there was an iniquity to see it's just God wouldn't look at it I tell you amen I thank God tonight to know amen that he have favored Israel and he have favored the BL do y'all know that do you know God has favorites sir sir you think what you want to but he does it's kind of like going to school and and there's a y'all y'all ain't I know y'all remember this when was you old enough to remember when they put stars and they put check marks and they put your name if he in trouble Joe you name one on the board and then check there next to it in trouble amen y'all y'all probably remember that and there was always that class favorite in there that they was in the middle of everything we did too but the teach never said nothing about it and it just it just gried me because they done the same thing I did Nisha was always as mean as I was amen did everything I did but there was no iniquity beheld in her y'all know what I'm talking about I have hit Grandpa's status I Now understand that scripture I wonder what what are you whipping on my grandson for he ain't done a thing but mama sees it and daddy sees it but old Papa he'll see a thing that baby does because he don't behold the iniquity amen I'm not saying God is a do old grandpa I'm saying that he has produced a blood that he can look upon the same thing that you're looking upon but he don't see it the way you see it and the battle tonight is how do you look at your life how do you look at your church how do you look at the things of God it's a battle for perception he don't regard it because he didn't see it he did not it the word see here actually is raw raw and it's a Hebrew word which means he did not look at it he did not inspect it he did not perceive it he did not consider it perverseness means the trouble the Mischief the the toil the labor God didn't see it bik seen it balam seen it God didn't see it you see here's the beauty of it balum could be taken by Bic to review to see the problem but God had Moses where he could see the right he could see the blessing he could see the atonement he could see the blast serpent he could see the pillar of fire now there isn't anything that could be done because God didn't conceive the iniquity in Jacob I don't I don't see it can you imagine God refusing to look at it I love that God refusing to look at it now look what he done he he he saw the atonement that he placed there he saw the smitten rock that he put there because see God was high enough to see it from the right right perspective I've heard people say well brother Brandon was wrong on this and brother random was wrong on that and I said well you just ain't got high enough yet you ever get high enough you'll see it the way God sees it and you'll look at it all together different you see because you got to get higher that's what Jesus did when he by the cross see he climbed to the ramp parts of Glory to set upon the throne of God to get there he could only get there by the cross he had to climb to the throne of God by the cross and he climbed high enough oh God he climbed high enough that he got blood in his eyes and when he looked at the people he didn't see it the way it was he saw it the way he destined it to be I'm talking about God tonight I'm talking about a god that is able when now now I I I I I I won't just move through this amen so what what the blessing that came through perception it was David that cried it in Psalms 32 when he said blessed is he whose transgressions is Forgiven blessing right blessed is he the blessing of Abraham the blessing is he who sins is covered now look I don't care what kind of car you drove to this meeting you're blessed amen it really doesn't matter how much money you got in your pocket you're blessed it doesn't matter if you had to crawl in that back more listen if God looks at you and does not behold your iniquities you are blessed you are just blessed of God because he has not marked the iniquity against you Psalms 32 he says that whose sin is covered in the second verses blessed is the man whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity means count don't mean it wasn't there and I I don't have time to preach all these words but just to get it in your mind it means you got $1,000 in your front pocket but your bank says you're overdrawn the bank don't count it till you put it in the bank now you might had all kinds of iniquity but it don't count in heaven because God in the place of sin he put in your account the blood and righteousness of Jesus Christ so my oh God so my account is full of his presence now watch blessed is the man whom the Lord puth not iniquity whose Spirit there is no God I've always been blessed by reading this when I read when I read in the book of of Romans the fourth chapter and and I start reading about Apostle Paul and Paul then begins to talk about Abraham in Romans 4:1 and he says listen what shall we say Abraham Our Father pertaining the flesh have found If Abraham will justif ified by works he was for the glory before God but what saith the scripture Abraham believed God and it was counted unto him for righteousness now listen it was counted unto him for righteousness do you know that the Bible tells us that Abraham didn't even stagger at the promises of God through unbelief now listen how many Bible readers I got in here tonight if you've read the story of Genesis you read where Abraham was talking to the ab to the Angel and he fell down laughing at the Angel's suggestion of having a child in his old age he didn't only stagger mat he fell on the ground amen but the Bible when it was recorded by Apostle Paul he said he never staggered it didn't say he didn't fall it said he never staggered because God wrote a Divine commentary himself he changed the perspective of how you viewed Abraham by the blood I I I know I know that it's a very it's a very uh a very powerful thought amen but that one page between the new and the Old Testament was everything just on one side of that page Abraham was a was a liar amen Abraham fell staggering laughing at God but on the other side of this page in this new covenant the blood rewrote the story and there's not a record of it in the New Testament Hallelujah ain't you glad tonight to know that God is writing a commentary and the commentary he wrote he wrote before the foundations of the world well glory to God it don't mean much until you start looking at who's writing it this is Paul who killed some Christians and was persecuting them he's the Seed of Abraham and now in Romans 4 he's telling them bless blessed is a man blessed is Paul I'm a blessed man because of the Seed of Abraham that God have not counted God had not counted amen now listen God had not counted when David described this Amen in Romans 4:7 Paul says that blessed are these who iniquities are forgiven whose sins are covered and blessed is the man whom the Lord will not impute sin blessed is the man whom the Lord won't count it was a Divine commentary it was God's way brother B said it he said all the mistakes that he made he said but God only saw what he was trying to do now if you say well brother Wayne I got saved I ain't subject to mistakes no more I'm sorry for you brother B says it like that he said the very nature of God is in you but you're still subject to mistakes but God can't see it perception now you see all your mistakes and really we see all one another's mistakes but the Bible through a prophet's vision is saying God don't see it because it's covered by the blood it's not just that it went away God covered it by the blood God on purpose did away with it that he might leave the word upon your life look it's through the blood it's not even imputed God does not impute anything that's done to you because you're under the blood and he don't see it I'm talking about perception now he don't see it when you start looking at this here's a prophet says it like this when I'm praying he just hears my voice through the blood he don't see me he hears my voice well my goodness if you're sitting here tonight and you've been wanting to talk to God but there all these things that you're worried about him seeing amen then get out from under your perception and come under the shed blood of Jesus Christ where you can speak through the blood and the father only hears the voice he does not oh come on church amen amen do you really believe what I'm preaching to you tonight do you really believe that God can't see it some of you been wanting to talk to him some of you been wanting to praise him some of you been wanting to let you You' been wanting to let him know what you really thought about him but sin has condemned you I say tonight to them that are in Christ we are now under no condemnation amen we've got a Liberty tonight to be able to stand under that blood and speak back to God well glory to God the Bible says it in the Book of Micah the 17th 7th verse he will turn again he will have compassion upon us he will subdue our iniquities thou has cast the sins into the depths of the sea when God takes away sin he takes away the guilts of sin and when he takes away sin he takes away the power of sin that made you do it that it may not rule over you no more I'm glad tonight ain't you that he took the power of it that would rule when God did it according to my Bible in Jeremiah chapter 50 in verse 20 the Bible says amen of course I'm sorry I'm in the Book of Micah he said that he actually cast it into the sea he didn't put it on the shore he cast it in the sea you know what that means it means basically that if somebody come by looking for it they can't find it if something mes up the edge when you throw it in later maybe the water goes down and somebody finds it but when he cast it he cast it far enough that with the fluctuating of time amen that God put it in a place that it can no longer be found let me read the Bible to you Jeremiah 50:2 it said in those days and in that time the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for and there shall be none and the Saints signs of sins of Judah and they shall not be found look at this there is going to be people looking for the sins of Israel and they can't find them oh brother when God put your sins in the sea he did something so nobody could find them I love this when I think about it because the Bible said amen that there is none like thee you know the second Samuel said it there is none like thee there is no God like thee there is nobody like thee amen Micah says it who is a god like unto thee now he could have said Des he could have said amen who's the god like thee that creates worlds who's the god like the I can put the stars in the heaven hang the moon in his place and and spread the trees and give life to the pled but that wasn't what he said he said who is a god like the that can pardon the iniquity oh God it takes a God to Pardon a man it takes the most high to Pardon a man you can't just Pard I don't know if you hear me you can't pardon yourself and I can't pardon you somebody bigger than me has to do it my goodness it takes a great big God to Pardon somebody kind of like being over there in the county jail and one jail bird looks over to the other and say hey you're pardoned well whoopy do whoopdee doo amen I tell you what it don't matter what they say there's no pardon because they don't have the power of Pardon but our God has the power to pardon the sins of a man for my Bible said to he that the son sets free he is free [Applause] indeed he said brother Wayne what are you talking about I'm talking about your Eternal destination does not lie on what you see and hear but your Eternal destination lies on how you perceive or discern what you hear and see it's not what you hear and see that determines you it's how you perceive it it's how you receive it amen the pardoning blood of Jesus can either it can either give you Liberty amen or it can take Liberty because it's the power of the blood now when people begin to look on this people can look on you they can look on the message they can look at things and they can discern it but you know people's discernment can be wrong amen people's discernment can be wrong they can look at something and they can say it's good when it's bad and they look at something that's bad and they can say it's good and vice versa can I can I say today we have got multi-millions of people trying to tell us what is good and what is bad let me say this Hollywood is not qualified to tell us what is good and what is bad Hollywood is not qualified church amen they cannot determine to us what is good and what is bad oh I know we got these football stars and everybody worships after them I know they can carry a pig skin across the field but they ain't got character for nothing come on they don't ah well we might as well preach there ain't no character in that and you make a hero out of that Heathen and then he's trying to tell your boy what's good and what's bad and what's good he's not qualified come on Church it takes character to qualify to bring judgment there is a high God that brings judgment let me let me just bring you simple scripture in John chapter 3 my Bible tells me Nicodemus the highest of the religion of that day went to Jesus and they said Master amen Master tell me what can a man do to be born again and he looked at him and he says he said he must enter his mother's or he must be born again and he took it he perceived it as I got to go back in my mother's womb look at the perception that he had of the word of God he was a carnal man with carnal thinking and he was the one making judgments on who Jesus was come on church he was not able to discern the word he was not able to tell the people what was right and wrong he had never had a new birth now hey you hey the Bible says it Jesus said unto them he said a man can't even see the kingdom of God unless he's been born again unless a man has a new birth he's living in this Kingdom of America he's living in the kingdoms of the world and he is judging things from that kind of Kingdom but God's word is his kingdom and may I say to you today we have received the kingdom of God that is not shaken but it remaineth in the face of Hollywood in the face of denomination in the face of trouble God has given us a kingdom his kingdom is his word amen unless a man is born again he can't even see the kingdom of God now sometimes people don't have the right discernment because they're not born again and you're going to let somebody tell you about brother brandham you're going to let some devil on some some YouTube or some deu you're going to let this them tell you about the prophet of God well I tell you what I do if I was you I'd have them ask me a few questions and answer them first who was it that raised the Dead who was it that caused the lame to walk who was it that caused the blind to see who was it who was it that could stand there in those Miracle lines one after the other who could create squirrels who could speak the storms it wasn't the man Willam brother it was a manifestation of the son of man the ministry of Jesus Christ oh you can discern the skies but what about the signs the times look upon this message amen because of unconverted men judging this message there are many men who found influence it's a battle of perception oh brother Wayne he made a mistake but is it one God all Hallelujah well I could preach a while there I'm a message preacher folks look I know where I came from I know where I was when God you most of you people satting here knew me before this message you knew the path I was on you knew where I was headed you know what I would be tonight if I was alive but God rich and mercy put a message in my life and as long as there is breath in my body I will defend this word because it comes from God you go on and follow Some unconverted Devil if you want to the battle's influence who's going to influence who's going to cause your perception come on now now you view Donald Trump a certain way if you watch CNN and a whole bunch of you view him a different way from Fox News same guy same thing Fox News he can't do no wrong CNN if he coughed there's something wrong with that it's perception and they have taken this message under the perception of carnal unborn unconverted devils and I know what life is life ain't sucking a cigarette and a woman running around bars at night somebody said well I can do what I want I'm free you're not free don't you dare tell me you're free and smoking on cigarettes there was a dollar a pack and then there were $3 a pack and you said you would quit before they got five but now they're seven and if they turn a $30 and they cost you lung cancer you'll still do it because you are bound by a devil but you don't have to be bound tonight there is a God that can deliver you by the power of God I know I'm talk oh they said well we're free you ain't free you ain't free pull a pair of pants on I borrow David S hey they can see the pul through it some some woman out there your body showing off like that and the Bible said a man that looks upon her had committed adultery with her brother man said you'll be judged for it if he never even touched you but the denomination can't preach it they can't preach it amen and unconverted men can't preach it because it's in their own homes their wives are wearing makeup they can't preach this message they've got to find something WR with it because the message condemns them oh but if they would just get under the message there is life and there's liberty and it's a covering it's see it's getting under the word now you say preacher what are you saying I I want I'll just be very clearly some people don't have a right to tell us what this message means they got no opinion on it we were just I just listening to matth the other night he brought up a scripture in Act 7 where it said the very same Moses whom you refused is the same very Moses God sent by the hand of an Angel to judge you and the very same Prophet that people are turning down and laughing at is the very God Amen God anointed that man and S him in this age and not only is he a prophet but God made him a God to this generation it's true somebody said well brother Wayne you're really trying to lift up brother B no I ain't God did that well you're trying to make a prophet out of him no I ain't God did that and he's a prophet whether you think he is or not and he has the word of the Lord for this age whether you believe it or not and every devil out of hell can crawl up out of hell and say it ain't true but they know it's true well you said preacher what are you talking about I'm talking about good people following unconverted Men what happened to the Bible principle of not bringing accusation against an elder unless there was two witnesses a good report what happened to that and y'all sitting down and discussing things brother brandom did and didn't do with a bunch of people dope smokers adulterers unconverted and you're going to discuss a word Prophet to try to determine whether you going to believe him or not through the course of an Internet I tell people when I bring them to the message all the time I said now when you go look up brother brandom on your internet you just go ahead and look Jesus up too and if you're going to believe what they say about brother bam just believe what they say about Jesus cuz they call Jesus every dirty name and the reason they do it is because it's the same Ministry well I feel like preaching there's got to be a liberty in the house of God it's got to come from this message it don't come out of my mind or my thought or your mind or your thought it's God rich in [Music] Mercy unconverted men judging the message judging My Worship unconverted men judging My Worship and calling it oh they're just Holy Rollers they ain't such a thing brother B said oh he said if you're going to call me a Holy Roller I'll call you an Unholy roller then what it's perception they said well it's a bunch of emotion brother B said if you're not converted it's emotion he said but if you're God's child it's called spiritual blessings and it's found in Ephesians the first chapter you cannot understand my worship until you get converted and you get saved the way God saved me you don't know God you don't know God till you meet him in the Dark Places until you get so low that you can't go forward and God shows up in the presence of life when there is no hope and there is struggles everywhere but God meets you there then you'll knowing you don't understand me until you have tasted of the lily of the valley and you can't have have that Lily until you get in the valley and you they Jo then they understand the Opium then they understand how and we can lose ourselves in the presence of God because God has showed us another side of the Gospel you know why people call the church crazy because they don't have any discernment I'm reading a direct quote because they don't have discernment it he says people say they don't believe that the baptism of Holy Ghost is for people today he said then I'll have to say that your birth was of the wrong Spirit they said the Holy Ghost said because the promise is unto you and your children he said see people are accepting it by an intellectual conception and they're taking somebody else's word for it but they ain't got no discernment they can't design between right and wrong the Bible said you can't call Jesus the Lord except by the Holy Ghost now what does that mean it means that I can say he's Lord and you can say he's Lord because I said it and you can say what your mom said and you can say what your preacher said but you can't say it until the Holy Ghost reveals it to you that he is Lord and once he has revealed it amen do you see brother I'm just reading him folks he said I know that's that's rough but what we need is discernment we need the Discerning by the word now many are asleep and sickly because of a lack of this discernment brother bam says it he said it was because of this he said it's because of not a Discerning the body of the Lord now he says it's because that he said now that's the last thing that will hit the church in the last day is a spiritual death he said now but watch I want you to know this a long time before death comes vultures come from the skies to pick out your eyeballs what now what does that mean to the church it means it comes to take your vision brother B now brother B ain't no he he ain't no kidding he says it like this the buzzards of Hell amen pick out your eyes to the gospel a long time before physical death ever strikes you takes away the ability to see the gospel now now I I I want to maybe just just bring something to your attention out a rejected King brother Bram brings this up and he said that's what Satan's trying to do is to pluck out your sight but your spiritual sight and in rejected King he brings it up in the book of Samuel it's whenever Samuel is being rejected by Israel and Saul is becoming King now y'all know why Samuel was rejected right it wasn't what Samuel done amen it wasn't Samuel it was his children and the people were rejecting Samuel because of his children but when God spoke he said Samuel they're not rejecting you they're rejecting me but the people wanted a king and that that was a right in this transition in the book of of Samuel you'll find about the 11th chapter that there was a a king who I think his name was Nash here he was the king of Ammon now the reason that's important because Ammon was another son of lot through his youngest daughter so the youngest daughter of lot and the oldest daughter of lot was m Moab and Ammon and this Ammon decides that they're going to take over a part of Israel now what they do is they catch them in in a low spot and brother Joel they went to them and and they saw we're going to be overtaken so they said let's make a let's make a covenant and Ammon said to them I tell you what we'll make a covenant with you but we're going to take out the right eye of all your fighting men now brother bam said that was your spiritual eye that was the ability to discern now what that meant in the days of Israel was they was they actually still was in hand-to-hand combat back then and they had a shield and they had a sword now if you put out the right eye now I'm supposing brother dve Paul most of them was left-handed now or it was right-handed actually because they' hold their sword with the right hand and the shield with the left hand I've kind of often wondered what happened to the left-handed people but there might be some here tonight the God bless you it's supposed to be funny I never was good at jokes everybody's wonder is he joking but they were right-handed so they would take a shield in their left hand and they would hold that Shield over the left eye and half of their face would be covered behind that shield for protection and with the other hand they had a sword so they fought with their offensive with a right eye because their left eye was just in defense now what happens is if you put out that right eye they can't carry a sword no more they don't know what to strike no more so they're always just reacting they're always just trying to keep the blows they're always just reacting but if there a spiritual side in a Believer there is a sword of the Lord that a Believer carries and he don't only have a defensive he has an offensive amen and Satan is trying to take the right eye of the church well I don't know about you but I ain't going to make no deal with the [Music] devil I'm not going to let him take no right eye because if you lose the ability to see that it's a spiritual battle if you lose the spiritual eye look you're in trouble folks because this is not a carnal battle attle and it is not a battle of Flesh and Blood it is a spiritual battle and you've got to see it for what it is you've got to see it for the way things are you've got to have a perception of how things are happening amen I'll go all the way back to Joshua not going to preach on it I want it in your mind go back to Joshua when he goes up to the walls of Jericho and he's going to take the walls of Jericho in a battle and somebody appears to him it's God that appears unto Joshua but he don't know it he says are you for me are you against me and he introduces himself as the captain of the host and when he does oh you talk about perception brother his Battle Ground the great battle that he was in turned into a Holy Ground it turned into a meeting place with God it wasn't a battle no more it was a communion with God it was a time of how to receive the instructions of headship that would destroy every enemy that was in front of them let me say something tonight amen I think when God begins to meet with people and begins to try to show them amen that his word is still true what is it it's God sending before the church that they might get a perception of the battle that they're living in that you might be able to see do you see amen I I I will say this very clearly this message has came to you as a headship of the church we do not have Bishops to rule over our churches we do not have a headquarters somewhere that rules over our churches there is one head and that is the Lord Jesus Christ he is the head of every man in this building come on Church I know there's a head to a church amen but there is a head to the individual and that is Christ and Christ is the head of that body now watch when Christ brings forth his ministry which is this message that it declares his presence upon the church and begins to give direction to the church that's why we don't call up headquarters and ask them well can we preach this or can we preach this or we can pre listen if brother B said it we ought to be able to preach it I I know sometime people well brother Wayne you can't preach that part of the message I have made a determination in my mind I think the next time somebody tells me that I'm going to take a whole series on that point I refuse to let the devil dictate to me what is preach and not preach in the message of the hour it is all preach it is the word of God it's Deliverance to the age we living in now can I say to you very clearly there is a a devil do y'all believe that y'all believe there's a real devil like a real one he's not some just thought or some M he is a real devil and he's your enemy and I'll tell you what that Devil's up to that devil your adversary is here tonight to change your perception of the word of God Satan would like to take away the value and the power of this message because he wants you to be defenseless he wants you to be armorless he does not want you to have weaponry come on he wants you to just take whatever comes but I'm sorry I'm not that kind of a man amen and I don't believe this church is that kind of church we have a message from God we have a value in that message and we know what it's for and what it will do now listen I believe this tonight I I believe I have seen the power of this message now I I've watched it I I'll get some more into this tomorrow night but I'll say this I I have watched the power of this message now now I will I will I will say this whether I have been in the tents in India or whether I had been in the Amazon jungles or whether I had been in the highrises of Europe or whether I had been in Ohio or Arkansas or whether I had been all the way over in New Mexico Plum over to New England states and down to Florida and back up through amen all across this world this message has power over the devil wherever you meet him it does not matter what form he's in it does not matter how he comes to you this message has power to influence lives amen now I know that Satan is just he's just a Tormentor and he's coming to torment you and he's coming to bring he's coming to bring influence and his influence is to do away with the value all right the power of this message to try to somehow say well you know you know that brother bandam I know he said those things but they're really not that important well I ain't found that one yet well I know he was a prophet kind of no not kind of he was all together a prophet the kind of prophet you don't judge the kind of prophet that judges you do you see what it is God has a method of dealing with the devil y'all know what God's method is Satan comes now now brother Dave we know Satan comes because it's his job and and he's good and Satan comes but God has a method of dealing with the devil now some would say well well you deal with him like this and you deal with him like this but God has a method and the method of God is to cast out the devil and how do you cast out the devil you cast him out by preaching the word of God come on church not the word of Luther and not the word of Wesley and not the word of Pentecost I know what I'm talking about I've been I've been to Europe but brother Dave you probably been right there in Belgium where they had that great world war baby David iers and them took us over and we stood right there in Belgium where Germany had in had influenced and come in and tried to take over Belgium in the first world war and you know what them dudes did then they built these big they built these big uh uh channels and dug out these big lines so that they couldn't get over them and the and the Belgium people would would hide in them and they would shoot so they they kept the attack out of Belgium from Germany by these wide ditches amen and when the second world war came they said well it worked last time it'll this time but you know what happened Germany went home and refigured and they made their tanks long enough they could cross them they didn't even last through the first day trying to fight with old Warfare and if you're trying to fight with old Pentecostal ideas you won't last your first day you got some more Baptist theology you won't watch the first day but God has sent a message by a strong Angel to defeat the Devil anywhere any place anytime under any for because he is God rich in Mercy you said brother Wayne I don't have any power yes you do you have the message of the hour it is Atomic Warfare in the mouths of the Believers now listen I I know I'm going to get long so I'm going to just try to close this off now I'll say this to you now now we're living in the greatest and most wicked of all ages and if you're not in a battle you just come out of one and if you're not in in one you're fishing to be in one because it is a battle everywhere it's going on in every direction battles are everywhere but see it is about the perception of the battle it's how you're viewing the battle that you're in makes the difference how you fight in that battle you know I I I I I I love the scriptures and and I and I know you all are Bible readers one thing that I have found through the years is that answers there answers everywhere is in the scriptures and I was I was reading some time ago I had just done a series in the book of Ephesians and I had I had I don't know how many sermon series there is in that but there's a lot amen but but I was over there in Ephesians 5 and I was coming down through Ephesians 5 and I come down to where Paul said that he might have a church that was spotless without without blemish that would be a perfect church and and I I spend a little time talking about the perfect church now how many of you realize that Paul says that he might sanctify and Cleanse This Church by the washing of a water of his word that he might have a spotless blameless church now he said that he might have do you know that William brandom when he looked at the church in invisible union he said you are now the Spotless virtuous bride that what Paul was talking about in the future brother Bram brought the future present and said you are a fulfillment of the vision that Paul was having and you are now the Spotless virtuous blood of Jesus Christ now now in laboring in that I was just looking through that and I was laboring a bit and I I went over to the next chapter Ephesians chapter 6 and I love how Paul says it there in Ephesians 6 and you amen after you've been preaching on about three or four months when you finally get to Ephesians 6 and you say finally my brethren finally my brethren you can see Paul has built up to to tell the church something and then he comes in the last parts of Ephesians and says finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and put on the power of His might remember he starts talking about putting on the whole armor of God now now it struck me that brother Brandon uses this for the greatest battle ever fought and just as brother manam comes out to preach the battle greatest battle in 1962 he says the greatest battle that has ever been fought is about to begin now and I thought wait a minute it wasn't the greatest battle back there and it wasn't the greatest battle here and it wasn't the great why would the prophet now announce the greatest battle now and you get to looking at this and comparing that whenever Paul says the church is perfect the next chapter is spiritual battle and when William brandom begin to announce Perfection upon the church is when the real battle of the church really began the prophet of God said Prov in this word why would God call a bride out of the darkest ages that has ever been he said so God could prove to the devil that this Eve is not like that first Eve that God wanted to prove to the devil now I know maybe you're sitting here tonight and you're going through a great trial in your life and you said brother Wayne why am I going through this is it some mistake I made here or is it some issue I made there have you ever thought that it might be that God called you perfect and that Satan you said Wayne where did you get an idea like this I'll tell you where I got it you go over to the Book of Job and it'll give you a sight into the invisible battle you're facing right now now you might not hear God and the devil talking but in the Book of Job you can and you can see that God is sitting there in heaven and the Devil comes and he says to him hey I've been about in the earth looking and looking I've been I've been looking let me just say it like Peter said it I've been looking for somebody to devour and God said did you try job now now I I love this because God knew job's name God out of all of the millions of people on the Earth brother Roy God knew Job by first name he said did you try job and the devil didn't say he had but he did answer it cuz he said you got him behind of fence he'd been down there checking security system on job's house and he knew this is impregnable there's no way to break into this house but God gave him permission and he said I tell you what you can go down there but don't take his life because you know what that dumb devil had a chance to say he said that your worship I mean job's worship was so cheap that if I take away from him the blessing you gave him he won't Worship You No More he called job he he act like that God bought job's worship and God said I tell you what you do you do anything you want to to him amen but don't take his life because as long as he's got breath I know that man's going to praise the Lord and the attack begin to come upon his life listen church he was not under attack because of some secret sin he wasn't under attack because of some problem in his life life God said he was perfect let me say tonight God looked upon this church and he began to call you perfect and there's going to come a battle sister Destiny there's going to be a battle the minute God says don't take her life you can try her every way you want to amen but the Bible tells us that job amen when everything come against him he fell in the floor and began to worship God yes you say preacher you spent a long time to say this I'm saying change your perception the devil can't kill you he can try you he can pressure you he can push on you but he can't kill you and as long as you got breath in your body you might as well praise the Lord as long as you got life you might as well tell that devil Listen My Worship is not cheap I may be going through the greatest battle I've ever faced in my life but I will praise my God in how there was a there was a meeting going on and a woman said to said to brother Brandon said I felt like brother Brandon when you was preaching she said I felt like jumping up and shouting to the rest of the people and brother man said well then why didn't you she said because every time I started to do that said the devil come by and said I wasn't worthy to do that and brother man said Oh Sister he said that's exactly when you should have jumped up and praise the Lord she said why is that brother vam he said because listen amen it's a sacrifice of pray Praise You Got to Believe God when you can't believe your own body when you can't believe your own feelings listen my praise is not cheap and when I feel good I'm going to praise God but when I feel bad I'm going to praise God and when the world is against me I'm going to praise God because the battle has nothing to do with what you have done change your perception change your perception listen it says in Isaiah 54 there is no weapon that is formed against you shall prosper oh so you know what the devil told you he said if you're having battle that's not your scripture because you got all these problems no look up Prosper it means nothing formed against you will have its success that whatever comes against you oh it's going to come but it won't have final success listen to me there's a another half in the game can I say it like that there's another part of this I can Cindy I can lose the battle but I ain't W lost no war you said well well when I lost the first half but but my goodness God has given you Grace he didn't take your life you can Rise Up from whatever you're in and give your life to God [Applause] Judy I I I mean I I think little things click to me and when God told job he told the devil don't take his life you know what he told him Joseph's Brethren when they beat him and they beat him put him in the pit now he had a vision he was going to rule and when he got put in that pit he heard his brother say Amen we can beat him but don't take his life amen don't take his life you know why because Jonathan he was coming out of that pit amen amen that was nothing they could do to prosper because he was going to a throne let me say tonight there ain't nothing the devil can do to keep this blood out of the Millennium because it can't take our life our life is eternal and whatever you do you can't change what God has already done I I I I've not never been much on football but I got to tell you a football story in closing brother Billy Paul brandham told it one time it's a powerful story I got to tell it for tomorrow night brother Billy Paul brother Billy Paul brandham told the story he said there was a it was a football game a bunch bunch of animals played in his football game and he said that one side of them was there was a elephants and and there was a tortoise and it was a sleuth and there was a kangaroo and on the other side was a leopard and a tiger couple monkeys maybe and now they had a real fast team and one little fella he was kind of at the end of it and he was just a little centipede and they put him on this side they went to play the ball game and they had the first half out there man and that poor little slow team them tigers and leopards and lions and monkeys would run in circles around and they throw a ball and boy intercept it and pass it over to the tiger and run a touchdown I mean after about the fifth touchdown in that first half things were looking really bad they go into the back they have their halftime and they come out of the halftime they come out there and they that that millipede had finally made it out on the field and they started running next thing you know hey man the tiger takes off and he throws a pass and that milliped run up there and jumped off side of the elephant and caught that pass and about three steps crossed the touchdown amen they on the back pass they intercepted he ran straight through run 102 yards touchdown and after he had run about seven or eight touchdowns right in a row they were they were going way up and the crowd was cheering everything was roared and the ball game finally come to an end and you know I don't know who they are maybe ESPN somebody wanted to interview this guy and he comes over and says sir by by all means they have voted you the most valuable player of this game said but everybody's got a question for you where were you at that first half he said well I was back in the back putting on my shoes you said Preacher what's the problem when I say tonight it's time for you to put on your shoes I know there's been trouble but it's time to put on your shoes said preacher what are you talking about no weapon formed against you shall Pro ER you might not have done good the first half can I say it like that you might not have done the first half but put your shoes on listen it's time for the church to move forward in God put your shoes on walk out of that depression come on walk out of that sickness walk out of that trouble walk out of that problem walk out of that issue well somebody said this take off walking it don't matter what they say could you stand to your feet with tonight if our musicians would come y'all forgive me if I'm too long amen I'll tell you this am I have found out something amen that this bride has put her shoes on and no matter what you think about her up to this time just hold on she's going to cross the line for long she's going to cross the line oh I tell you that so and so they're having an awful time change your perspective it might be that God has has said something about them my goodness sister he knew his name can you imagine the devil saying to God I'm looking for somebody and God says have you considered job can I say it to you like this have you considered my second Eve have you have you considered this Roy roners come on brother have you considered the whole world looking at you one way and God looking at you a different way the battle is perspective who's going to influence your view of the message who's going to influence your view of your experience with Christ who's going to give you perception of what God is doing even in this tent meeting tonight [Music] what's your perception what's the what's the perception of what's happening in this room you can you can be aware of the people and you can be aware of the tent you can be aware of all these things but are you aware of the angels are you aware that my Bible says that wherever the children of God gather them that fear the lord that the angels of God are encamped about them and whether you can see them or not the entire premises thank Lord of this building are encamped By Angels if your eyes could open there is rolling licks of fire that's moving through this building the anointing of God is moving through hearts and lives amen there's Angelic beings moving through here listen either brother bam was right or he's wrong and he said that we are the third Throne of God and around the Throne of God was cherubs and seraphim the power of God the Angelic beings that come down to protect that Throne listen folks your perception you think you're just a little nobody just just something that that somebody can just kick to the side and God could go on Amen but he can't forget you he can't just go on and leave you he can't just decide that you're not worth the trouble perception when I think of it tonight I think oh my God change my perception let me see it the way you see it let's just bow our hearts tonight father we thank than you for your word Lord we thank you for your grace in this building tonight Lord here under this tent father we have spoke from our heart the word that you have put Upon Our Heart Lord coming down the road here Lord you spoke these things go this direction and father I know that Lord whenever you give direction that you're there to back it father and I ask you tonight for the children of God that have gathered in this room Lord Lord if the enemy is trying to turn their sight Lord maybe they're looking at their own selves maybe the troubles in their lives and Lord their faith is fading but I pray tonight that you cause them to look up Lord that you cause them to look into your word and gain the perception and the ideas that you have I pray Lord that quit listening to unconverted men to discuss the things of God I pray the Holy Spirit tonight would influence their heart Lord to believe you for all things now father we invite you into this meeting in the name of Jesus Christ we thank you Father amen and amen we so love you tonight amen I I ain't got much of a voice to sing brother Matt won't you to come and help us the

the Lord a hand clap of praise tonight how many say that God spoke to you tonight amen what a call of God in this hour to it's a call that the whole world don't hear but Jesus said that he that hath an ear let him hear and I thank God that I have ears to hear and eyes to see he's worthy of it isn't he isn't he worthy of all the praise that we could give him I I thank God that he would send a man to remind us to look at something through the right perspective a't that a powerful message tonight is it is't that the truth so many can look at the same thing and see something one way but God saw it another and go and they look at you and see something one way but God saw you another I want to look through God's eyes tonight amen just to think of all the things that God's done even beyond our understanding brother Morgan I believe he's worthy of worship you love the Lord tonight can we worship God just for a minute amen that's what we come to have a meeting and just to be able to fellowship and allow the word to come forth and after we've heard the word of the Lord and we've received it in our heart then give worship back to God Amen can you lift your hands and close your eyes

house oh I thank God the Bible says he inhabits the praise of his people and friends I've got news for you there's a praise inside of this old Arkansas boy that there ain't no man that can take out of him and I thank God that one day he came in and he inhabited this life and he took an old dark vessel and he filled it full of the light of God a hopeless case and he brought hope that's our God you know brother Bobby when I get to thinking about him there's something in me just cries out Hallelujah when I get to thinking about him when you get your mind off of the world hello somebody when you get your mind off everything that's going on around us and say but this is a moment that's been dedicated to my God so Satan you ain't got no room tonight I want to put you behind me but I come to this place and I made sacrifice to be in the presence of God that my God could come denight that I might entertain him he's my God and is worthy of my praise put the devil where he belongs and put God where he belongs put Satan behind you and put God in front of you and lift your hands on your voice and praise our creator and say God you are worthy he's worthy makes me want to say hallelujah makes me want to shout makes me want to tell him how much I love him oh don't you realize what Satan's doing he's putting pressure on you to keep you from praising God he puts pressure on you to keep you from I well the Fe of the Lord's here he put pressure on you to keep you from being free to keep you from from from being able to serve God and live for God but I think we ought to put him in his place can't see makes me want to shout hallelujah when I think about my Lord it does something to me I wonder how many how long has it been since you just sit and thought about what God's done for you how long's it been for our mind is so filled with everything that the devil's doing to us but when is the last time you took a moment just to stop and think about what God has done for you ain't that wonderful what he's done for you brother Travis how you saved your family you got two kids that love the Lord they they long to be in the house of God they want to be in Sunday school on Sunday morning they come to church they lift their hands they could be anywhere but there's a desire in your children's heart to praise God didn't God done something for you you know the devil don't put that desire in your children's heart if you got a desire to I want you to lift your hand how many has a desire to serve God just be honest with me let me ask you how many times has the devil ever put the desire to serve God in a person's heart the devil didn't put that there God put it there let me tell you why he put it there because you belong to him and what Satan has done is he's tried to keep you from being what God has called you to be you realize that's what that's what this brother's been preaching tonight I'm going to put my shoes on tonight I'm going to put my shoes on and I'm going to go somewhere with God you realize that's what happened to the children of Israel when they came to be set free it was at the time of their Liberty that the prophet Moses walked down into Pharaoh's house you know what Moses's request was his request was to let the people of Israel go and worship their God and you know what the when you know what Pharaoh said he said they've got too much time on their hands if you've got time to worship God then I'm going to make up something that you can do instead so his reply to them was get you back to your burden and he went and he got around with all his advisors he said what can we do to these people to keep them from having a desire to worship God he said well you can make them make more bricks you can make them stomp more straw you can give them more hours to work and so they came up with a plan that at the time of their desire to worship God I'll put so much on you that you don't have time to think about that no more but you know what God done he said but there's a desire in them people's heart to be free and he made he brought plagues upon Egypt and he made a way that his children wouldn't have to think about that no more and everything that the devil put on them God took off of them hello somebody I love to think about my God and what he's done for me so let me tell you what you do we're going to have a meeting anyhow I
