took a little bit getting here it's my timing is very much off and trying to get things together and you know you go to school and work on the weekends it's kind of hard to to get everything together sometimes but y'all just pray for me you know we'll get through it amen y'all just back the word and we're going to go somewhere tonight amen amen I truly believe that every time you step into the house of God that there's something to be heard there's something to be done there's something to be said amen and every person in the building can get something out of it amen I know sometimes it might be simple but sometimes it might be deep and I know the Lord's in it because I know the source of all life I know the Living Water that's who I know tonight and sometimes I wander away from that but I can always come back to it I can always come get another drink anytime I need it I can go to it amen there ain't no one person in this building needs to be thirsty or dry because the spirit of the Lord is here with us amen how many of you understand that the spirit of the Lord has been with us ever since we started this church he's been here you know there was a lot of doubt and a lot of criticism and a lot of things but I've been here through it all and I know the spirit of the Lord is here amen if you want to just turn to Second [Music] Timothy second Timothy 3 and16 amen it's just a joy to see everybody out tonight and you know there's quite a bit of quite a bit here this evening and going know there's something missing but you get to sometimes you need you need a few missing so you can fit everybody else in a building amen hopefully one day we'll kind of get expanded out and then we're going to have the same problem more people's going to come and people's going to have to lay out so somebody else can come in well let's hope not but you know it it's just surprising right here on this old dirt Gravel Road and you see people coming out here and some of their nice new cars and but they still make the trip come out here to hear the word of the Lord amen it sure is appreciated tonight amen in 2 Timothy 3 and6 through1 17 the Bible says all scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for Doctrine for Repro for correction for instruction and righteousness that the man of God may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works amen if you just want to Bow your head I've got one more scripture I want to read just right after this but Heavenly Father Lord we just thank you for your mercy here tonight Lord we thank you most of all for your presence Lord Lord we come out here and we just know you're here with us and God you you don't there's nothing that says you have to be here but by your word you're here we thank you Lord for that my father I pray that this service would be about you Lord and everything that's spoken would be towards you and that you would get all the praise and all the honor this evening God I pray that the needs of the people would be met father that we would move ourselves out of the way and that you would just speak tonight in Jesus name we pray amen amen you can be seated as uh you don't have to turn here but in Romans 11: 33-36 the Bible says oh the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God how unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past finding out for who hath known the mind of the Lord or who hath been his C counselor or who hath first given to him and it shall be recompensed unto him again for of him and through him and to him are all things to whom be glory forever amen I don't really do this a lot but I want to speak about a source tonight I know that but a source is the place where something begins where it Springs into being and just to kind of lay a foundation when you talk about civilization when you talk about life that that many times that life always begins a near or river because that is the place to where they can be watered they can be fed there are three things that a civilization needed that a people needs in order to kind of get going we know that the basic needs are people are uh are food water and shelter but if you're going to have a group of people people you need three different things you need fertile ground you need fresh water and you need seed and I thank God if you'll just think about that for a minute and you start thinking about how that God comes in this place there's seed laying right here tonight there's seed in this place there's seed in the church there's seed in the message there's seed all over the world and guess what there's also some fertile ground here amen we can take that seed and we can put it into the into the fertile ground and guess what happens next the water begins to come and begins to pour over the seed and in that ground where that seed is planted things start to grow and things start to change it might look a little dark at first but but you just wait just a few minutes just a few days and you'll see as the seed begins to come up and we always talk about the farmer how that he's standing out there and you never see him out in his field you never see him out there trying to coax the seed up he's never out there trying to baby it he's never out there trying to say little seed I wish you would come up I wish you would just come up out of that Darkness I wish you would come up out of that place but the farmer has trust in the Sun the farmer has trust in the power the farmer has trust in the authority of nature the farmer has trust at God that in God that that seed is going to grow and you find yourself in a dark place sometimes and you find yourself wondering where God is at but trust in the Lord trust in the source because the source is fixing to pull you out the energy from the Sun is going to pull you out and I'm not talking about the Su in I'm talking about the over him when that Spirit comes around when it starts changing people's lives when it starts moving across this place when you start feeling a heat of the pillar of fire things begin to change in your life things begin to change and your roots begin to break out and they start going in the places where you didn't know they could go and you need a good foundation you need that seed you need them Roots if you don't have those roots you don't have anything cuz it ain't going to be just a minute and something's going to come along and pull you up and it ain't going to mean a thing come on but you need to be well grounded in the word of God you need to be well suited in the word of God that's why it's so important to take your Bible and to start reading about the source and start following after the source that's why it's so important to gain the foundation that's what that that's why we have Youth and that's why we teach them that's why we we have program or not programs but we have church camps and things that's why we do those things because you need the foundation if you don't have a foundation it ain't going to be just a minute and something's going to happen you might be able to last for a while W with a with a little bit of a shaky Foundation but you let the wind start blowing a little bit you let the trial start coming a little bit and I promise you you're going to be flat on your back and you're going to be going wondering why in the world why am I in the shape I'm in is because the foundation that you're built upon the foundation you haven't got your roots in and many times it takes it takes a little bit of time to dig your roots and it takes a little bit of time to dig down and to get to those places now I begin to think about how that we talk about the civilization calls for ferti ground fresh water and seed and I want you to talk about a source for a minute and y'all I'm trying not to get technical but I don't know any other way of saying it but you look at the Mississippi River and now how the Mississippi River starts running and when men started going up to Mississippi from New Orleans they started moving up to Mississippi they started going places where they couldn't go it was a source of a place where they needed to go and they would start moving up that River now the Mississippi River just it provides life for everybody around here I don't know if you know that or not but if you think about it because it provides food it provides shelter it provides many different things it provides the economy just just uh over in Memphis it provides great things because it is a source of life for many people many people go and they get on the river and they you know they go on the boats and they make their living on the river but the ground outside the Mississippi and I'll tell you something what happened back a few couple hundred years ago back in the 1800s that the the the ground wasn't as fertile as it is now I don't know if you when you go to Memphis you start seeing the fields and you start seeing how many there are when you cross over the Black River brid you start seeing the the Mississippi River delta you start seeing how the growth is there you start seeing all those things but what happened that ground was not like that at first but there was a shaking that took place in the 1800s it was a great earthquake that happened it was such a shaking that the the river the the mighty Mississippi that we all talk about ran backwards for a few days and what happened was that life that was laying in that River The Source went out up onto the banks and it flooded over into the ground that was there and it flooded it started flooding all the ground around it and the nutrients oh Lord I hope you're catching this but the nutrients that were down in that River from all the life and all the I hate to say this but all the Decay and all the stuff that was in the river was nutrients that that that ground needed and it flooded over onto there and it started it started the nutrients from the river started creating a more fertile ground and many men started moving into the into the area that's how we get get the people started moving into Arkansas because they started uh taking away land from the Indians because the ground was so fertile and they saw an opportunity or a chance to take control and that's just your history lesson for the day but but you see that that life and that source that is laying in that river is moving people but what Watch What Happens now watch when you start moving away from that source and you start coming north or south or east or west you start moving this direction and as you cross the the Black River Bridge you start seeing a little bit of uh You Don't See Fields anymore you don't see life anymore you don't see a lot of growth you don't see a lot of food you see a lot of you know a lot of trees and stuff like that but you can't plant anything there see what happened was you moved away from the source and I find that many times people in their lives they start to move away from the source they they they find that this source is what you need this source is what you're living under but you can't bottle The Source up you can't take the source away when you start bottling it up and you start trying to man him handle it and you start trying to take your own theories you start trying to take your own ideas you start trying to take your own Spirit you start trying to take these things away from that Source it's got no life in it when you take this this this water you know I could drink it all day it's got a little bit of life for me in it but it come from a source it come from somewhere it come from a spring right it came from a Wellspring a lifegiving source and it came from such a source that the little animals could walk up to that source and they could begin to drink on it you could ask the source why are you so bubbly and he said you know what I don't really know well why are you so happy Christians why you so happy little bride but but sometimes I don't really understand sometimes I really get a little bit confused I don't really know but there's something inside of me there's something pushing me there's something making me go a little step further there's something made me making me work a little harder I might be down I might be a little out but there's a Wellspring flowing for deep inside of me it starts stirring my heart it starts flowing on Wednesday night it starts flowing on Sunday morning it starts flowing throughout the middle of the day in the middle of the night when you get weary when you get tired that Source begins to Bubble Up and the oh good lord Hallelujah the source begins to move you it moves you over here it moves you over there but don't get away from it don't get up into the ground of Black Rock because you can't amen it's a little hard to live there it's a little hard to live in the Rocks it's a little hard to live in that place and you start finding as you get away from the Life Source you get into a dry desert land and out there that you know the only way you're getting anything out there is a man-made idea the only way they can grow anything oh the only way that they can grow anything out there is through man-made religion that's the only way because once you get out into the desert land there's no longer a connection with a source and man has to take it man has to handle it man has to do something with it and he's got to take the water and he's got to somehow figure out a way to get it over here to the desert but I know a source that if you're dry I know a place I know a man that can I know a Wellspring of Living Water that could take your dry spirit and your dryness and all those things and and even when you're down and out he can just walk walk by he can give you a little bit of water he can give you a little bit from The Source he can give you a little bit from The Fountain and you spring right up and you say hallelujah you say praise be to God you say I don't know what I was thinking but I feel a whole lot better now I feel like dancing a little bit I feel like shouting a little bit I'm feeling something stirring inside of me amen you ever felt that way tonight heyen you felt down and out you felt weary you felt beat up you felt like the world was against you but God said watch this and he gave you a drink of water and your sin sick condition God said watch this I'll take the Harlot and I'll turn their life around I'll take the drug addict I'll turn their life around I'll take that old cranky spirit and I'll turn their life around because there's something I am the Living Water I am everything to them and when God Jesus Christ becomes everything to you it starts turning your life around it starts moving all the crankiness out it starts moving the spirits out it starts moving the depression out it moves it all out because there is a lifegiving source keep near the source live near the source something that's got to move is that great shaking took place sometimes in your life you know you gotten away from the source a little bit then there's a shaking amen God said you got to get back to the source you got to get back over here by the river there's a River of Life you need to get back over here that great earthquake changed the whole world it changed a bunch changed the whole country it changed the whole nation that source of life that was there you realize the Mississippi River is the great has the greatest largest tributary system in the in the world you can't go to any other country and go up there rivers and can hardly get anywhere but that river that source of life goes into places that no man can reach again that river that you all see that is a mile wide in some places I think that little river if you've ever seen a picture I don't know if you ever looked it up in itha or up in uh Minnesota it's a stream it's a little old stream that you could just almost step across sometimes I find that in your life that that that many times you feel like it's just a little stream just just a little stream flowing but you start moving down that River and you start seeing some changes you start seeing it instead instead of the land and the things around it controlling the river the river starts controlling what's going on around it it's Oh Glory The Source begins to change things as it flows as it moved throughout the world and throughout the the life and and throughout eons of time rivers start changing things sources start changing things it starts getting through rock that you couldn't get through and it that water just begins to beat on the Rock and beat on the Rock and beat on the Rock and pretty soon it makes its way around the Rock and the rock is no longer uh the rock is no longer in the way why what is it do it it takes those Stony Stony things takes those old pointy rocks and sometimes you get them in your life there's old pointy pointy rocks you know if how many of y'all ever walked around a creek somewhere and you step on those those pointy rocks somewhere that hurts sometimes our life gets that way sometimes we get those pointy rocks but just let the source start flowing let it start changing you let it start developing a different kind of Life inside of you let it start moving moving he man you got to give it away don't move away from it get moving towards it your life needs it the civilizations they needed that life there they had no way of moving things they had no way of changing things they needed that you need that you need the source you need the source toight you need to go home anytime and pick up the source and find out what it has to say when you can't when you're trying to read something out go pick up the source and see what it has to say go play a tape see what that has to say you want to talk about a source there's two different types of sources in in English there's a primary source and there's a secondary source now sorry for the lessons but a primary source is somebody is a witness that was standing there watching it happen Okay a secondary source is somebody that hear is that person okay but a primary source you've heard about the things of God but I can tell you you had a prophet that stepped out of time he saw Visions he didn't just see from a secondary point of view he saw from a primary point of view and that man opened up the scriptures and he said this is exactly how it is and he started ministering to you he started ministering to the bride I don't want some secondary source I don't want some idea of some man give me the primary source give me somebody that's been there give me a God that stepped out of History I don't want a historical God I want a god of right now and you have seen that God of right now you've seen him step out of History you've seen him heal the blinded ey you've seen him heal cancer you've seen him do these things left and right you've seen him do all that you are a primary source of God's power you are primary source of God's control and what God can do and I would go tell the world you know what I've seen it I've seen God move I've seen the hand of the Lord amen you can tell them you can tell them you know what well you know what I you know I got problems well God said watch this I got issues God says no no no watch this there was one time that the that the that the enemy that there was a a little baby born his name was Jesus and I can just see and I I I can just see up in heaven how that how that you know they're getting ready they know something's coming they know something fix to change and they know that you know the Angels might have been ready they might have been sharpening their swords they might have been getting getting their armor on they might have been strapping up they might have been ready to go to war it's time to defeat the Devil cuz this is the time line this is what's written God said it'll happen Lord everybody's preparing and all of a sudden God stands up just you know what I'll do it on my own I don't need your help lay down your weapons maybe they didn't understand I'm just paraphrasing a little bit maybe they didn't understand that God sent his blood cell down into a little womb of Mary he said that's the source right there he said this is what I'm going to do this is how I'm going to change the world you see because Satan owned the world he knew if he took it any other way he could just take it back but it took a blood sacrifice to change it it took a source to change it and the Very living power the source of all things steep down into a Virgin Mary and he started changing the world and the Very living power is standing here tonight waiting upon you to open up yourself and let him step in and watch him move and watch him change it all and watch him do it too many times we're caught when we got problems and issues and we got all these things laying around and too many times I sit and I try to pick the pieces up and I try to pick the pieces up and I try to put it back over here and I try to put it back together together instead if I would just throw up my hands and say you know what lord I can't do it anymore I need the source of all Heaven I need the source of all life to come down and pick it up and I watched it move hundreds of times over I've seen the hand of God hundreds of times over he came he picked up the pieces he started to putting lies back together he started taking Spears and throwing them out over there and throwing them out over here because that's my God and that's what he does Heen won't you give me a hand clap of praise tonight amen I love my Lord heyen I'm talking about the source tell you what happens when somebody comes in contact with the source you hear people start reasoning reasoning things out they start saying well I can't do it many times they start saying well I'm not qualified I heard this the other day God doesn't call the qualified God qualifies the called amen you may not feel qualified you may feel a little weak you may feel a little down let me tell you something Noah was a drunk Abraham was too old Jacob lied Joseph was abused Moses was a murderer and couldn't talk Gideon was afraid Rahab was a prostitute Jeremiah and Timothy were too young David was a murderer and an adulterer Elijah was depressed Jonah ran from God Naomi was a widow job lost everything John the Baptist lived off of bugs Peter denied Christ the disciples fellow asleep while praying Martha worried Mary Magdalene was demon possessed the Samaritan woman was divorced five times zakus was too small Paul was a murderer and Lazarus was dead so what's your problem tonight hey man what are you come in contact with that our God can't control what do you come in contact with that our God can't say the dead is raised tonight let me tell you about a man that was so messed up in his life that he was outside and he was in God I'm talking about a god tonight they a man so possessed that that that that some some uh uh theories tell us he had 6,666 demons on him 6,000 666 how many of you ever seen that I want to know none of us they don't one of us in here seen anything like that but that man was roaming around and they said you know we're going to chain him up he's crazy he's psycho he's mental there's nothing we can do for him so they chain him up and those Spirits would get over him and they called him Legion because he had so many demons on him and he broke the chains and he stood up and they tried and finally you you know what got him there let me tell you what brother random says he got him there one little light lie he went out drinking with his buddies it was one little thing don't think the devil ain't going to catch you with one little thing I promise you he's waiting on you he's waiting on you to take that one little step he's waiting on you to do that one little thing he's waiting on you to slip up just a little bit and I promise you he's going to take a mile and you might say well you know what it's just a little thing it's just a small thing but it don't mean that's just a small thing that man said that and throughout the times and he went home and you know he went out drinking with his buddies and and he got home and he told his wife some little lie well he got to me so bad in that home that his parent is that his that his wife and kids were scared of him he got to be such a such a such a an evil evil demon such a evil spirit that his own family couldn't even couldn't even have nothing to do with him that they had to get rid of him they had to throw him out until he winds up out there with 6,000 of OD demons on him now he's out there roaming around he's probably talking to himself busting up stuff acting crazy you never know I don't know think I'd want to come in contact with a guy just to be honest with you but there was one day I don't care how bad it gets I don't care how dark it gets I don't care how down in the dubs you think you are I don't care what kind of spirits are on you I don't care what's bad on you I don't care what's war on you I can sit here and name a bunch of them but you just imagine the worst thing you can think of you're out there in the tombs and you don't know where to go you're not even in your right mind you don't know what to say you don't know who to turn to you're so confused and just you know you're all crazy that that one day the source of Life walks up how many of y'all just walk into a graveyard it's not something you want to do but that man seeing a need walked into a graveyard one day and it walks up to this man that is possessed this man that that is probably killed under it's probably killed people you know I don't know we don't hear a lot about him but he comes in contact with the source of all life and he looks at him and you can see you you know if you could just imagine that a little bit of clarity might have come over his eyes because he looked into the eyes of that man he looked into the eyes of the source and he looked and he went what are you doing in there cuz he knew there was something down inside of that man named Jesus that wasn't just a man that he was God standing there in human flesh he was God waiting to do something for him and that devil and those demons and all that was inside of recognized the spirit of Christ he recognized who God was many times when you've been dark and you've been down and out you look up and you see Jesus and you recognize you know what there's Jesus tonight amen he looked at him he said what are you doing in there and he started talking to him that man named Legion the next time we hear of him he wanted to go with Jesus but Jesus needed a testimony of who he was Jesus oh Lord Jesus needed a testimony of his power Jesus needs a testimony of his authority and what are you hey man some of you might have felt like Legion but you're a testimony of who God is you're a testimony of what God's brought you out of you're a testimony how God has moved how he's sped your life how he's taken you from addictions how he's taking you from Pain how he's healed your body how he's delivered you oh Lord I know people I can talk to right now I'm a testimony of the Dead raised hey man I might have said it before but I say it again the devil thought he had me when I was a little baby but here I stand you know what that was laying there I was lifeless I was dead I didn't know what was going on
