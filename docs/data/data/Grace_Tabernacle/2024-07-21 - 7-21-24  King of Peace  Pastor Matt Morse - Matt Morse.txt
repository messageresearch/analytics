and 17 and just want to let the church know that brother Timothy prit will be here on August the 4th speaking for us and just kind of put that down on the calendar also brother Andrew lover will be on August the 25th that weekend so we got a couple of wonderful evangelists that'll come and so we're just looking forward to that but we want to read from Genesis the 14th chapter and the 17th verse and I'll read down to the 20th verse the Bible said in the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of cedor laoma and of the kings that were with him at the valley of Shava which is the King's Dell and MDC the king of Salem brought forth Bread and Wine and he was the priest of the most high God and he blessed him and he said Blessed Be Abram of the most high God the possessor of Heaven and Earth what a blessing for God to put Upon A man the possessor of Heaven and Earth and he blessed be and blessed be the most high God which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand and he gave him tithes of all and we'll just ask the Lord to add his Blessing to the reading of the word I want to speak this morning on the king of peace and just ask the Lord to come and we just certainly just say we love the word of God I I just want to say it's a privilege to be able to come uh to a church with people that love God and love his word and and we come out on a Sunday morning just how many come in expectation receive something from the Lord and I believe that you can take a scripture and read it under an anointing and it'll feed God's children amen and so we don't want to add our own uh thought to it but we just want to allow God uh to take it and and and and use it to uh edify the church this morning so how many say Amen to that I want to just take a a moment this morning we realize that this story many of us had have heard it and been preached on and and uh many times and we realize that this uh this scene in the Bible where MDC is having a meal here with Abraham and and this comes after Abraham had followed the call of God in his life and uh brother Wesley the Bible had told him he said go out and and get thee out of thy country and from thy Kindred and thy father's house and go into this land that I'll show you and and the Bible would tell us that Abraham being a man of Faith he he obeyed the Lord and and he went to allow God to make something great out of his life remember what God promised him I will make of thee a great nation and and so here he heard a promise of God and he was a man that was determined to allow God to take take his life and make something great out of it so he surrendered to the call of God and brother Mark and out he he went and the Bible would say he sojourned and he went out into this place he separated from his family and from lot and he went out and remember lot went up and he took the he took Sodom in the city and Abraham dwell down in the plains and and the Bible would tell us that this now this doesn't happen over a few uh uh days but this went on for many years and for many years that Abraham uh lived in this place that he prospered as he was waiting on the Lord and and then while while Abraham was living in this place there came uh there came uh uh this this great uh uh battle or division in the land that Abraham was living in and and the King uh cedor Lo ler and he gathered he gathered up his men and his allies and they came into this place and he took three other kings with him so these Four Kings they came in and and they conquered all of the Nations that surrounded where Abraham was living and and and and they made them and and this goes on for quite some time matter of fact it was 12 years the Bible would say that they lived in this condition and they lived under the headship of this King this forced headship of cheder lomer and and and and for these for and for this time that he uh that that they dwelt in this place but after a little while some of the Kings got together and they rebelled against cheder and they and and among those kings was the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah the place where lot uh was living and so when they they they would come against him and they would go to battle and they you know there was there was a there was there was something with them that just didn't want to live in this kind of condition and and so they took these these Kings they they would call them many uh Bible uh studiers they would call it the five uh Kings or the five Rebel Kings and they would they would come against this great Authority that had come over this land and and when they would come against it well then they went down and the Bible tells the story of how they went to the Valley of the salt pits and all the kings they were they were destroyed down in this Valley but including in that was the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah they fell the Bible said they fell in the salt pits and so when they fell within the Four Kings of this this new headship and this new uh this new Union that had been created that would take over this this place that was a promised place that was prom you realize that the land that Abraham was on was a place that was promised to him by God but but all around him this great Union begin to take place and all around him this this headship and this kingship uh was established but but but but after a little while they they go in and they as they Rebel they these Four Kings they go and they destroy them and they take all the people captive and they they they they took all their land and they plundered them every everything that they had they stole their possessions they stole their land they stole their children they stole their wives they took their families and they they locked them in Chains and made slaves out of them and they drove them into other lands and they took them out of their own country and they took them as their own possession I thought isn't it something that the enemy would come into a place and take people as his possession it was it wasn't just the land that they wanted it wasn't just the Bible would tell you that because they took the people and they locked them away and They carried them off with them I thought it's just like the devil that he would come in to a place and what his desire is brother Mark is to take the possession of people and and take and to take your your families and your loved ones and your children and the fathers and mothers and and to take them captive and to pull them into this place but you realize that in included in this captivity there just happened to be a man by the name of lot and the Bible would tell us that lot just by chance you can call it if you want to but but but lot just happened to be the the the nephew of a Son of God the very one by the name of Abraham that had received a promise from God and the Bible says when Abram had heard that his brother was taken captive that he armed his trained servants that was born into his house 318 and he pursued them unto death and he divided himself against them he and his servants by night and he smoked them and he persuade and he pursued them unto hobah which is on the left hand of Damascus and he brought back all of the goods and he brought back also his brother lot and all of his goods and he brought back the women also and the people you know why brother Mark because God had ordained him to bring them back I thought you said well how did he go get them because God had given them to him it was a part of the promise that God had given Abraham when he left out of that place and God said you're going to go into to a land but I give that I shall give you let me tell you a secret friends that when God gives you something then it's yours how many how many say that with me when God gives you something it's yours brother Sean preached this yesterday morning about Caleb and going into the the mountain that God had given him he said something different about Caleb that when Caleb came into the mount heon he said give me my Mountain he didn't say give me a mountain give me some Mountain I'll settle for a little bit less I'll take whatever you'll give me but when Caleb stood up on before the mountain that God had given him he said I want my mou and he and he began to lay claim on it and brother Mark whenever he made his claim he didn't back down from it you me tell you what Caleb done he stood up on the promise of God he stood against what other men would come by and tell him that they couldn't have it other people would come by and tell him it was too great of a battle and other other spies you remember how the story went the Bible said that when they went in to the promised land that that Joshua asked the the 12 Spies to go in and to spy out the land that God had promised the children of God and see if it was time that they could go possess it and you know how whenever they came back with the mark they came back and there was 10 spies that said yeah there's Giants in the land and it ain't and there ain't no way we can take it but there was two men that came back with them they didn't go against and say there ain't no Giants they didn't say there ain't going to be a trial they didn't say there ain't going to be a problem they didn't say there's going that it's going to be an easy battle they said yeah the Giants are there but we've got a promise of God that we can take this land we got a promise of God that everything God has given us that we have the right to possess and Caleb stood upon the word of God and the Bible said because Caleb stood when the other man wouldn't that God looked at those men he said I'll say that the land that I swear to your fathers neither shall any of you be able to inherit because you provoke me he said but unto my servant Caleb he said because he had another spirit with him let me tell you friends he was anointed by a different Spirit he said he had another spirit with him and he followed me fully then him will I bring into the land where he went and his seed shall possess it and you know what Caleb done brother Mark he resisted the 10 spies and the lies that they were telling and that theology that that great giant theology that they came back preaching to the church that nobody could could be a part of it and and the days of Miracles has passed and God can't move in a church anymore and God can't take somebody's broken and Men them it's the giant theology that when you go so far that there ain't no way back that that God's done with you and and you can go so far that that the mercy of God's out of your life it's giant theology but let me tell you what a prophet of God said he said you may spurn the mercy of God but you'll never exhaust his grace I thank God this morning for a theology that's greater I thank God for a word that's greater than any giant theology that's been preached over the lives of God's children he said well he he went in there brother Mark you know what he done he said your reports a lie and we can take this land plan because God said we could the word says different how many say this I'm going to take my promise I'll take my promise you said I can't be free but I'll take what the promise of God said you said we can't have no liberty in the house of God but I'll take the promise of God you said God can't save my children but I'll take the promise of God you say he can't fix our problem but I'll take a promise of God over any giant theology that would come into the house of God it may seem like it's too big it may seem unsolvable it may seem un pixable that's giant theology but God said yes I can he said we can come to the house of God let me tell you when God gives you something you can have it this is what happened with Abraham the Bible said he could possess the land because God give it to him but Abraham said when God gave him that land he gave him everything that was on it God gave it to him and lot was a part of that land and Abraham had a right to it he could lay hold on it and claim it he said now God you made the promise that this lamb was and all that was in it was mine you made the promise and now my Kinsman has been taken and he's all but gone see he had a right to go get him and he went to war why the authority of God was upon him he stood toet to Toe with the devil and you realize brother Mah that when the Seed of Abraham came to lay claim on a Son of God that they had been taken captive captive and forced into the the authority of of this evil King that when he came when the Seed of Abraham came the Bible said that the enemy began to flee and and Bible said Abraham he pursued him from Dan in the daylight he pursued after him in the night time he pursued after him he pursued him down to Dan He pursued him down to hoba brother Mark in there he slayed him you know you know you know what that word hoba means it means a hiding place I thought my isn't this so good that there that whenever they when Abraham came after them that they went to hobah they they fled that these Kings and their armies and and all of them that would take the possession of God's child brother Mark but when Abraham took a stand upon the word of God that the enemy fled to what was called a hiding place but it didn't save him it didn't matter where he went to hide it didn't matter what part of hoba that he went into but the Bible said but but Abraham and his trained servants they went down into the land of hobah and he slew him there you know what that tells me that there ain't nowhere that Satan can go that he can hide from a trained servant of God but when God gives you the ability and the authority to be able to take the possession of what belongs to you then Satan can't hide from you let me tell you friends there ain't nowhere in this building that Satan is Sav there ain't nowhere in this world that Satan is safe from a son and daughter of God cuz my Jesus said he said the meat shall inherit the earth this Earth is your possession th this world is your possession this universe belongs to the children of God there ain't nowhere in the world that the devil can hide from a son or daughter of God a trained servant of God it's your possession every promise of God belongs to you brother say see he said the meat shall inherit the earth we are possessors of the earth you say what is a possessor of the Earth the believer said the believer has a title an abstract Deed by Jesus Christ that he shall be possessor of this entire Earth that's right he shall inherit the earth so you know what we do we do the same thing that Abraham done why do we stand in a pull pit with such resolve why why do we why we surrender Our Lives to the Holy Ghost to allow God to move because we had the same promise that Abraham had but Mark he said look what now we can take the promise of Abraham because Abraham done that and because Abraham obeyed the Lord and because Abraham was our example and he by faith went out and he fought and he took what was his now we as Believers today can take that same promise of Abraham and apply it to every problem that we Face apply it to every situation every money problem every family problem every Church problem every every every uh uh marriage problem you can take this promise and apply to every problem that you have you can go to your brother that's sick say the Cancer's got his body you say but Lord here's my brother he's laying there tricking stricken with cancer but you said so and I'll lay a hold of the promise of God it's my possession you told me so he said then you can go after that enemy that devil and you can Slaughter it just the same way that Abraham slaughtered the Kings and brought them back into his possession the promise is to the believer see we've got a right got a right we're trained Servants of God Holy Ghost filled men and women they're trained Servants of God you got to go you got a right to go anywhere to get the people of God to get to get the joy back in your life to get the the promises that God has given you every promise in the Bible it belongs to you it belongs to your family you deserve it but notice what happened at the end of this battle he was coming back from this great Victory and Revival the Bible would say but when he came back he met this man MDC now Paul would write about it in Hebrews the 7th chapter he said for this mzc the king of Salem priest of the most high God who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the Kings and he blessed him to whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all first being by interpretation king of righteousness after that also the king of Salem which is the king of Peace he was without father he was without mother without descent having neither beginning of days nor ending of life but he was made like unto the Son of God and he abideth a priest continually see there's been many thoughts surrounding this life of mecdc brother BR preached the whole message on it on who is this mecdc many would say well this mecdc this man that came to meet Abraham after this battle he was just a myth some would say he was just a priesthood it was a it was a symbolic priesthood many uh take that that school of thought that it was a symbology or it just meant something today but but he said but notice it can't just be that because the Bible would say in the fourth verse of Hebrews he said now consider how great this man was so here Paul would let us know that he said who who who under patriarch Abraham he gave s the SP say see this person was a man brother Mark so in order Paul said him to be a man in order for him to be a man well he had to be a person see he he had to have a personality so he wasn't an order he wasn't just a a priesthood order neither was he a myth but melaz DIC was actually a person somebody say a person but let me tell you something about this person since we found he's a person but he was no ordinary person for the Bible would say that this person he was an eternal person remember what the Bible said he said he had neither father nor mother he had no beginning of days and he had no ending of life in other words he was there he he he didn't come into existence you realize what what what else could it be that have no father and no mother and no beginning and no ending he was a person but he was an eternal person said see so so so if he's Eternal guess what brother Mark it's the best part if he's an eternal person then that same one that met with Abraham that day is still here this morning see he's an eternal person so that very person that walked down and had communion with Abraham that same person is still here this morning he had no beginning of days he had no ending of Li so in 2024 don't think because of the chaos of the world and the wrecked up of politics that all of a sudden that there ain't nowhere to turn and there's nowhere to go and there ain't nothing to to put your faith or your confidence in they said this same person he's still here today day he had no beginning of days he had no ending of Life said see so there only one person it could be if it's an eternal person it would have to be God because God's the only one that is eternal now let me tell you why the church world can't can I just teach it for a minute the the church world can't see this the reason they don't see it is because their teaching of the godhead is off see the church teaches it like this is that that that there was one God in three persons if you would talk to somebody that that would teach you about Trinity they would say well he's one God in three persons you really you realize how how odd that is see because the very word person means an individual so how could it be one God with in three persons it it means individual it means single or separate or independent solitary isolated or one with a personality so God he for him to be one God in three persons see it it wouldn't even it wouldn't even make sense but God he's not one God with three personalities I know we meet a lot of people like that but God ain't like that he God not bipolar he isn't isn't a God that has all kinds of different personalities he it's not a it's not three different persons but he is actually one God in different offices see that's the way that's the only way that God could say it like this in the Bible he said I am the Lord thy God and I change not see so he had to be God he said I am one I am one God there's only one God the Bible would tell us that he said and I change not so if it's God and God don't change he can't be one person today and another person tomorrow and a different person the next day so so it's not the multi-personality God but the reality of it is is that that that God came in the form or in different forms like you would you would take a play and you'd watch an actor that he would come out on a stage and you realize if you go to a big drama somewhere in in New York City or something and and you know that there may be one person and they play many roles in the play so they'll come out and they're dressed a certain way and and they're the they're they're the good guy and my the the princess has fallen in love with the prince and but they didn't have enough actor to to to have the villain and so he goes back behind the curtain and he changes the clothes into the villain and he comes back out as a villain now he's a totally different person but it's really the same actor the whole time so see so what happened is is that that he actually changed his mask or his face and so when we read this about God the Bible would tell us that there's a Greek word that explains God it was the Greek word in morphe that word inor would mean to change your mask and so we see that that that this is written in Mark the 16th chapter you'll find the story of the two men that went on the road to emus you remember when they were walking along these disciples and the Bible said that Jesus when he had came up out of the out of the the grave and he went out and he heard them talking along the way remember they had all that negative talk and how everything was falling apart and their savior was gone and and now they the very thing they put confidence in everything fell apart and I it ain't going to work no more we may as well we may as well go back to the old life but while they were in the middle of all this Tau the Bible said but Jesus put on another form he he appeared to them in another form that same word in the scripture was in morphe he appeared to them in another form in so much that as he walked along with them they never knew who he was they never recognized him they did they didn't recognize where where where he came from or why don't you know are you a stranger around here they asked do you not know what's going on why do you talk this way what manner of communications is these do you not know what's happened they've took our savior and they crucified him they begin to tell Jesus all their problems in the whole time it was the same God in another form the Bible said Mark 16:12 he said he appeared to them in another form unto the two of them but you notice when Paul would pick this up in Philippians 2 he would say it again he said God listen he said said Jesus in Philippians 2:6 being in the form of God thought it in Mor being in morphe of God in the form of God he thought it not robbery be to be equal with God but then he made himself of no reputation and he took upon him the what the form of a servant Im morphe so he said here Jesus that was in the form of God put upon the form of a servant and he was made in the likeness of men so he shows us that after all this it was God the whole time but R says see that's what God did it's the same God all the time it was God in the form of the father God in the form of the spirit the pillar of fire that same God was made flesh and he dwelt Among Us in morphe and he brought out so he could be seen and now that same God is the Holy Ghost it's not three Gods it's three offices or three acts of one God well friends think about this morning what it would do to you if you could ever catch a revelation that the very God of creation the god of Moses that was there and that came in the form of the pillar of fire and the god of the Hebrew children that that that was the fourth man walking in the fire that if you could ever get a revelation that that same God came in the form of the Holy Ghost and the Very creator of Heaven and Earth and the one that walked with Abraham and the one that walked with Moses is standing in this building this morning that has appeared under the church in another form if we could get past the MK of humanity and see the revelation of God and realize that God the Creator he wants to speak to you it's God the Creator he wants to have communion with his children he wants to help you he wants to he wants to encourage you he wants to give you strength he wants to give you life it's the same God in the form of the Holy SP spirit so when he comes in the form of the Holy Ghost but Mark we come to the house of God that's what we come here for we come to worship God we come in there if people come by what are they doing in there why are they why are they making this noise but you realize but we come here to worship God why because God is here I know what I know what the the the people say well I can just worship God anywhere I don't have to go to church well that's that's wonderful for you but there ain't that ain't really true you can't just worship God anywhere I've heard people I've heard preachers say you can worship God anywhere I thought well I I I I used to live a wicked life I know what it's like to be in a bar and I ain't never seen anybody in a bar worshiping God I ain't never seen anybody they may be worshiping but it ain't God they're worshiping I've been to a lot of ball games I ain't never seen anybody at a ball game worshiping God they may have their hands in the air they may be shouting and dancing and moving around but it ain't God that they're worshiping but we come to the house of God we don't come to worship a man we come to worship God in the author Office of the Holy Ghost we come to entertain him in the office of the Holy Ghost here he would come amongst us brother Mar so we come and we come you say well why don't we come to church because it's pleasing to God the Bible said forsake not to assemble yourselves together so our assembly this morning let me show you the importance of what we're doing here cuz I know how the devil just tries to make it not important let me tell you why it's important to have your children in church and and and fathers and mothers be in the house of God because it it is a our assembly here is a scriptural assembly do you realize that us Gathering here this morning is a scriptural assembly it was ordained of God for us to be in this place following the scripture we come and it's not just a ritual the church where would look at us it's a ritual it's just a religious gathering or something like that but the reality is is that the presence of the Holy Ghost separates us from a ritualistic Christianity the presence of the Holy Ghost makes all the difference we're not here just to go through motions we're not here to make a bunch of Racket we don't come just just to make uh just to just to be seen or or or just to work up some move or something try to get people excited so they'll come back and put money in the offering plate that ain't got nothing to do with while we're here we come to entertain the person of the Holy Ghost we come to worship we don't come to worship a pullit or some music we come to entertain the person of the Holy Ghost we give our lives to him we give our voices to him we give our our our hands and our feet and everything that we have and and to entertain the person of the Holy Ghost We Come and sing songs and we create an atmosphere that God could be welcomed in we begin to pray and we pray till we get our hearts right and our spirit clean before God so that God can come in the church and he can minister to his children we we start pulling on the gift of God with sincerity that we could receive some spiritual food many people they come in the house of God and they go home and they're unsatisfied you say well brother Matt what happened well they failed to get a revelation of the order of receiving see they missed the order of receiving then miss the revelation of what it takes to come in the house of God and get something from God they've been caught in a trap because Satan has taken people and he's so focused them on everything that's going on around them that they can't see what God is doing so focused on everything that everybody else is doing that we can't see what God is doing friends if you could peer through the glass this morning and see the hand of God working and see what God is doing with his children and what he's building and what he's working that that it ain't just some man manm made thing but God is doing something Supernatural in our midst you realize every great thing that ever took place that we read about in history and great moves of God but whenever they were taking place I'm certain that those men and women felt like you and I do well we're just trying to We're just trying to do our best to serve the Lord we ain't much but they did what God told them to do and we read about them we testify about the great things that God done in their life Satan gets us focused on everything's going around around and if we're not careful all of a sudden people get to talking they talk about everything every problem you don't go home and fellowship around the word of God what where we ought to be as a family we ought to go home from church and and as a father you say boys wasn't that some good preaching this morning my didn't you catch that why' you'all get out of that service this morning that's what we ought to be talking about but instead people go home and the only thing on their mind is what everybody else was doing but you see the way she was dressed did you say see the way he was acting I can't believe he was talking about I can't believe they were doing this and we're talking about the wrong thing and before long I'm y y'all can kick me out if you want to but it's the gospel truth we get to talking about the wrong thing and before long our children over here the com see you thought I was talking about the kids I'm not talking about the kids I'm talking about their influencers and before long they get getting around their parents and they hear all this negative spe and before long they begin to pick up on it and they and then when they come to church they come to church all out of order and now they're looking at the things that you've drawn attention to who in the world would want their children coming to the house of God with a spirit of C criticism on them who would want their children to come to the house of God with a spirit of division on them why would we preach that to our kids one day they get old enough to do their own thing let me tell you what'll happen all the seeds that you planted will start manifesting in their life the seeds that Satan brought by and he anointed you to speak and he and you planted them in their life and you watered them with your with your testifying of all the negative things that's going on around the world they manifest in that child's life yeah then they become critical they get critical going to church they they develop complexes they quit coming around you say Well they're that's cuz they're unbelievers and you know they left us cuz they ain't no part don't don't sell me that why ain't they around it's cuz they're bad no that ain't it it's because there's so much pressure there's so much pressure you realize what's happening is that here God is dealing with his children and he's pulling upon them and he's and there there's a there's a something in them and it's yearning to serve God and here God is pulling on them they come to the house of God and they feel that that pull they feel the tug of the pressure of God and then the whole time then they got this other thing that's coming on the other side and while God's pulling it's pushing on them and it's putting pressure and it it's criticism and and it it's pushing them away and hear God trying to bring the word and they can't get out of that that critical spirit and look around and making fun at everybody and all this and and all the things that everybody's done so you know what they do they say it's easier if if I just stay home we just we just stay home you know what they'll do at home they'll die from spiritual starvation they're not fed they lay there can you imagine your children laying starving what kind of father wouldn't feed them what kind of mother wouldn't feed them the Bible says that about our Lord he wouldn't give Stones when they were when they needed bread he wouldn't give you something to replace of bread he'll feed your bread s we come we go to church brother Mark why don't we go to church cuz it's pleasing to God we want to keep an atmosphere in the church because it's pleasing to God yall y don't mind if I get off my message a little bit but it's pleasing to God I believe that ought to be the desire of our heart we ought to we we ought to have a desire to please God how many can lift your hands this morning say brother mat that's my desire I want to be pleasing to God let my life be pleasing to God let let everything I do be pleasing to God let me tell you friends there's a reason why this church means more to me than just fulfilling a duty this is a sanctuary of God it's a place that is that is kept holy it's a place that we are that we ought to that we ought to to keep as a holy place we don't we don't run around and and and act silly and do things like that in the house of God it's a sanctuary that's dedicated to God I know that's foreign today I know that churches they they're in gymnasiums and all this stuff and they do they just kind of swap it around and they and and it's never there's a dedicated place but this is a place that is dedicated to God it's dedicated to a to a pull pit that God could come and he can speak to his children that's why when you come in the house of God that we have deacons that sit in the back of the building to to help keep an atmosphere for God that things don't get out of order that's why when you kids come up here and y' and y'all have the choir and y'all sing y'all don't mess around and act Goofy and run around and holler and disrespect the choir director but you come solemnly humbly before God and you practice and you do your work and you back out of the temple of God the place that God has built a sanctuary where he would meet his children I believe there ought to be established some some some government over the house of God I believe it ought to be established in our hearts that this is a place of worship that isn't some place it ain't a lodge it's a place where God can come and meet his children it's a place that when you walk your children through their doors that they walk in with humility CU they know they're going to meet God it's God's house we come in the house of God we don't abuse it we don't walk in we don't we don't scream and make a fuss and and and act foolish and silly in the house of God we walk in reverently because it's a dedicated place for God to meet his children this is God's Sanctuary I know our I know our our our lives is the place where God dwells but don't ever underestimate the place the building that must be dedicated to God the order that must be kept in a place you realize that brother maram said that that a person a child with the wrong attitude just running across can can grieve the the Holy Spirit I don't know we don't want to grieve the spirit of God our number one goal brother Mark is that that the person of God of Jesus Christ the person of the Holy Ghost would be welcome in this place it's our sanctuary and we ought to keep it holy it's the truth we dedicate Our Lives to the church a holy Place said that's what we ought to do he said when Jesus came into the the the house of worship they were buying and selling and and plating ropes you know what Jesus done he drove them out he said we don't want him to do that here so let's just dedicate our lives and our church and our task our service and everything we have to the kingdom of God how many can join with me on that let's dedicate our lives and our church and our task and our services and everything we have to the kingdom of God I made a vow to God when I started pastoring this church I promis God that I would study the word I would spend time in prayer and I would I would surrender my life life and my gift to him that he would use that gift to help his children and then I made a vow to the people here that I would do my best to be a pastor and be truthful and honest and and rightfully divide the word of God and keep this pull pit a holy place and not put men behind it that wasn't filled with the Holy Ghost and that wouldn't preach the truth so made a promise to God I made a promise to people you know but you know but Mark I ain't the only one that had to make a vow every one of us had to make that same vow I wonder how many that today could say brother Matt I want to I want to make that kind of a vow to God we want to make a vow to be real brothers and sisters in Christ we want to make a vow to one another to be to be elders and and to be able to to raise our children and help the families that are in need we make a vow as our deacons I I want our deacons to have a vow before God that they'll be deacons and they'll they'll be an example in the community of what it's like to be a deacon in in the in the in the church to the Living God that is just some that that that just some people put in some office do you realize that these ain't men called officers they're God called officers a pastor ain't a man called office there's too many pull pits filled up with pastors that were put there by men but a pastor according to the scripture is a god called office it's God that raises men and God establishes them in communities and God raises up churches and God anoints them with the word of God to preach to his children and to feed his sheep there's too many menade pastors and not enough God Made Men it's God that makes them to stand on the word of God it's God that calls deacons and we made a vow to God to keep the keep the spirit of God in this place our Sunday school teachers they they they got to make a vow to God to teach our children and to teach them truth and they not teach them some Doctrine that's different than what the than what the word says or or what's being preached in the church they're not trying to take the kids into some other order but they made a vow to your children that they' teach them right and they teach them the truth and they you realize how important it is I I know I'm getting way off you realize how important it is brother Mark for for a Sunday school teacher to teach our children that one of these days here they're teaching them they they go through class after class and then here in just a few days they come to the age of accountability where they have to make a decision brother Mark to give their heart to God and up until the time of that age they're taught in them Sunday School classes the very things that that that will help them that's nurtured in into their life that will help them whenever they come to that place to meet God that they can recognize it's God that they're meeting when they come to that place and they come down to an altar after a move of the spirit of God but brother Wesley because what they've been taught in a little Sunday school room that people think so insignificant but because of what they've been taught they recognize the spirit of God and they can give their heart to God they know the promises of God and they begin to claim them 10 11 12 years old it's important The Vow that we make to God in every office our trustees make a vow to God to be honest handle the church and the funds and the things that come into the church and make sure everything's done in order every office our treasure makes a vow to God isn't it something to think isn't it wonderful to know that you can put offerings in a church and you can that the deacons would take up the offering and they can hand it to a treasure and to the this day there ain't ever been one single penny ever missed and there never will be you know it may seem like a little thing but in the world it's a great big thing to think that a man would have a vow to God to be truthful our ministers made vows to God to preach the truth to live a life that is above reproach to have a to have a standard of living with their families or to be able to be an example to the people and the young people handle situations just like we would handle them if I was gone and and you had to talk to brother Joe or and brother Mark and they help you they'd handle it the same way I would because we're all in unity for the same thing we're not we're not working in different directions we don't we don't have three churches in Grace Tabernacle there's one and we're here for the same purpose that we can grow in the word of God every one of us make a vow janitors the cooks the grounds Keepers the don't matter how big the the the musicians the singers make a vow to God we don't come to to play music to to entertain anybody but we come to worship God I know we got a lot of kids that play music but that's cuz we didn't have nothing else and I think we ought to just train them up and let them do something in the house of God instead of serving the devil their whole life I thank God that we have some young people that have a desire on their heart to do something for God it's easy it's easy to look at all of them and say well if they just do this different why why they why are they just act acting silly outside well it's because they're kids this should be true they're just kids and we do our best to raise them and to teach them to come in the house of God my son he could tell you when he comes up to the to them drums you know what instructions I gave him he I think he's a great drummer he's he he he they're both they're they're learning they're they're not the best they know that but they're learning they're doing a good job but you know what I tell them here's my teaching here's what I tell him this is the most important thing is that you pray when you go up there and you make sure that there ain't nothing between you and God and when you sit down those drums you don't worry about the people and you don't worry about what's going on don't be looking at your friends and talking to your friends but you play that drum and you worship God on it just like David said in the Bible he said I'll praise him on the High symbol and I'll praise him on the low symbol I'll praise him on the string instrument I'll praise him I'll praise him with my voice I'll praise him with my singing let everything that has a breath praise you the Lord but dedicated to God everything we do in this place we're a body Believers and we come to dedicate ourselves we made a vow to God how many can lift your hands say brother I made that same vow if you haven't how many lift your hand say let me make it now let me make a vow to God that I could stand behind the word of God friends I believe God is calling this church to a higher place a higher level I know I know that there's been some great things that has happened in our church already I I hear from Brothers all the time that compliment our church and the work that's been done in this area Great Men of God that would say this this is the easiest place in the in the world to preach to there's just such a a freedom and liberty and the people get so behind the word of God and they and they just want to come preaching you wouldn't believe it but there there there's preachers all time that want to come preach it because they heard the testimony of what it's like and just have a have a place and the church is so behind the word of God there's a another Elder he called called me the other day and he got to talk about our young people he said you know what your church is doing it's setting the standard of how to handle young people in this message a standard of how to raise young children and and he said you're literally are setting a standard in your generation I thought that was a great compliment from an elder you know sometimes you look at oursel and feels like you ain't doing nothing right but I thank God that he would that he knows our desire but even in all that brother Mark that we're still moving to a higher level this church is moving to a higher level this Vision that God has given us it ain't it ain't just for it wasn't just for a little bit to get established and say well God's done with us we're going to a Rapture friends we're going to a Rapture and we're going to fellowship and we're going to win every show that we can we're going we're not going to leave anybody behind we're going to try to take everybody with us we're going to sigh and cry for the Abominations that are done in the city we want to please God that's our desire to be pleasing unto God I'll just say it like this I'm getting long but this is our assembly brother Wes Leia I'm proud of it I'm proud to have a place of of Fellowship it makes me proud as a pastor to see people come through those doors back there and they come in and they give their heart to God many times I think we're over 50s something people that's came in and and baptized just a few just a few years in this little assembly in a little Community but what happens when when they come in those doors they get baptized and they they give their heart to the Lord they come in they start having fellowship with us and that's a wonderful thing water baptism I think it's wonderful it's according to the Scripture it was a commission of God but you realize brother Mark all it does is you come in and it puts you into fellowship with the people and you come in the church you recognize that God has accepted you you you you you you express uh outwardly what God is doing on the inside but when you come through those doors and you go through baptism you receive water baptism it puts you in fellowship with everybody but friends that is not our goal that ain't Pastor mat's goal that ain't what I'm after that that ain't what we're trying to do is to get people to come through those doors but there's still yet another door that you have to enter but says see when you come in these doors he said it may put you in fellowship with everybody else he said but there's another door and this door that God put his name on and his name is Jesus Christ you say how do you get in his name how do you get in there well you got to be baptized into there by water no by spirit for the Bible said there's only one Lord and one faith and one baptism and it's a holy ghost baptism that's the door that we're trying to get people in it ain't the doors of Grace Tabernacle it ain't to fill up a bunch of pews with a bunch of people that just want to have a place to entertain one another but we're trying to get them in the door that they can have fellowship with God that they can call upon the name of Jesus but said we can do it we could call we could call on his name we could baptize we could speak the name of Jesus over here but it doesn't make it so but once the Holy Spirit really that genuine word of God comes into you then brother the message is no secret to you then when the genuine word of God is Born Into You see there's another door to enter into then brother Mark when you go through that door it changes everything about going to church when you go through that door you come to church you start singing I'm one of them them old fogy songs that that you used to be so critical about you come into the house of God you say man let's sing that song I'm one of them again I want I want I want everybody to know that God changed me brother brother Mark gets so excited he tells his testimony every Sunday morning that God changed me and he delivered me why cuz God done something for him I'm one of them you come in singing and praising the Lord you come in because you've been you've been born again then you say I'm in this church this glor church I didn't join I was born I had a new birth and some glorious day I'm going to Sail Away by his grace not by my works I'm in this church we're part of the Church of God we were born into it butam said there ain't but one church it's the body of Jesus Christ many has made it different things if you make it anything else there's many lodges that's been built up in this world for the mark and bearing that old Blasphemous name you say why could you say that so harshly because they speak speak against the word of God and blasphemy means to speak against something so when they take anything that God said and make it something else it's a Blasphemous name when the word of God says one thing and a church sets a different standard it's a Blasphemous name because they're disagreeing with the word of God let me tell you what they've done the Holy Spirit baptism was sent to the Church of the Living God and the world has replaced it the Catholic Church replaced it with a wafer the Protestant Church replaced it with a handshake the Pentecostal Church repl it with emotionalism but I thank God that there's still a people of God that recognize the person of the Holy Ghost and realize that there's a door that I can enter into that I can be one with him and then God can use you when you enter into this door brother Mark then God could use you that the music players want to come this morning God can get you so far into a place brother Mark that the devil don't even know what to do with you isn't that what happened with Moses he was a he was a little old old Prophet coming into Egypt with a stick in his hand but brother Wesley it didn't take long he just kept pling them he was that Pharaoh he was so plagued by the voice of Moses he got in there he brought flies he brought Li he brought fire he brought smoke he brought death he brought frogs darkened the skies made made the sun go down in the middle of the day black in the skies and finally Pharaoh had enough of it and he just said get out out get out of here he was so surrendered to God that God could do so much with him that the devil didn't even want didn't even know what to do with him just get out of here get out of my presence take what yours and leave surrender to God brother said I'm so glad that a man can be so completely served god Till the devil don't know what to do with him that's right obey God so completely till the devil would just say get away from me I don't want to hear it no more I wonder if you stand to your feet how say brother man let me get to that place let me be so completely surrendered to God let me be so let me so completely serve God that the devil just says get away from me I don't even want to hear it no more let the words that come out of my mouth be the testimony of Jesus Christ let me testify of the works of God till the devil don't even want to be in your presence when you come around they avoid you and off where you going I can't be around him I know what he's going to say he's going to say well you ought to be in church God's doing some wonderful things boy he's changed a lot of lives I saw a little girl the other day whatever she was sick in her body and God healed her but the devil don't want to hear it get away from me cuz they're going to testify of the works of God I believe that I believe we can be so completely surrendered to him so close to God it ain't no wonder the devil hates his church but am mark because when everything goes wrong he finds a people of God that are still praising God oh you hear me friends when he brings pressure on your life you still come in the house of God and you still got your hands raised and you know what the devil does he follows you right in the church and he comes over where you are he say why are you raising your hands brother you know God forsake you why are you raising your hands you know he let all that happen to you why are you still LIF in your hands why are you praising God it's you you serving him the whole time when you got in this mess why would you still raise your hands but you come in the house of God and you know what you do in the presence of the person of the Holy Ghost you lift your hands you say Lord everything may seem like it's Fallen apart House Bill may not be paid trailer done got broke something done fell apart business ain't working extra things happen car broke down but when the devil finds you he said I'll come by they'll be they'll be some broke down now they won't even I'll take all the joy out of their life but when it comes around there you sit Lord I love you Lord I Thank you for every trial Lord I glory in the tribulations Lord I Thank you Lord for holding me Lord I love you I think you're a wonderful God I praise you I give my life to you Lord I glorify you I can't help but tell him how much he means to me I can't help but tell him Lord you when it seemed all was lost but you come by and you spoke to me he uses trained servants what went after lot it was a trained servant God trains his servants to go into the secret places of your heart places that the enemy would hide away that he didn't think God could get to but under the anointing of the Holy Ghost God begins to go into the heart of a man into that little land of hobah where the devil's hiding says you can't stay here you can't reside here that man belongs to God you can't reside here that family belongs to God you may have thought you had them but they belong to God in the secret place I wonder if you be honest with me that they enemy you say brother man I know where he's hiding I know

victory brother Mark that's when MDC met him the Bible said he was the king of Salem the king of Peace he said brother M said is what he showing us he said melic met him he gave him wine and bread showing that after this Earthly battle is over we will meet him in the heavens and take communion again in that great wedding supper Jesus said I'll drink no more with you of the vine or eat fruit or eat drink with you until uh we are Anew in my father's Kingdom that there'll be communion with him after the battle is over but brother Mark you know what whenever he came in this hour and you fought every battle and you've overcome every battle said then you can say I want to serve him he sold out the things of this world he said I won't take any the possessions of Sodom you know what Abraham done he turned down everything they offered him he said I'll just take what mecdc has to offer said he took and turned it all down and that's what we are doing we turned down the things of this world have you met mecdc since the battle was over said I was 21 years old one day and I had a battle with all kinds of things I wanted to be a fighter I wanted to be a Trapper I wanted to be a hunter I wanted to be all these things but then I met mecdc and he gave me communion and ever since that day it was settled forever I've went on his side and I've been rejoicing on the road and that's why one day I know when that role is Called Up Yonder and it calls us into the air that I'll be with him I'll be a part of the marriage supper of the Lamb why because we met MDC brother Mark that's what we're doing this morning we come to have a spiritual communion with him oh how many he's living in Victory today how many say brother Matt the battle's over I don't you don't have to keep going through the same battle that's what the devil does he'll put you through the same battle tomorrow that you went through yesterday but there comes a time when the children of God say the battle is over and then MDC came in and he entertained him and he brought his own wine and he brought his own bread and said Abraham I want to have fellowship with you the Battle Is Over let's have communion we want to have a spiritual communion with him I know about his peace a't that what he does he's the the king of peace brother Mark he's the king of War the King of the great battle he conquered every King and after the turmoil of all day and all night of pursuing and weary oh Abraham went back from that battle and came dragging back into the tent here come El kazmc said let me feed you let me have communion with you when the battle's over when you're weary when you're tired of fighting he'll give you Victory and I let me just settle in have a spiritual communion with him you don't have to be in battle all the time you don't have to have a your life don't have to be chaos and turmoil but I believe that we have a right to live in peace I believe that how many say amen I believe we have a right to live in
