this morning that that he would pass by our way he would come and he would quicken his word to our hearts in our lives it would give to us direction amen there's anything that's out of focus that our focus might be right where it needs to be on him amen whatever your need is this morning you believe that he's already met it you believe he's already provided it's not something he has to do but he can raise our faith to be able to receive what he's already done he knows what you have need of you don't matter and what you think about it whether you think it's something insignificant God declared even in this generation where there was a little fish that was dead out of all the things that took place and God showed his healing and yet God took the example right there and the Prophet speaks to us he says God was showing that there's nothing that's too insignificant he brought back a little fish you know that was impossible that was impossible the insides of it had been ripped out it was there all the entrails it was all out but yet God moved on the scene and God restored he's the same God this morning he's the same one that knows exactly how to put things back in line put things in order in our life you're loving this morning you men could we just go to him in prayer you got a need just hold that there on your heart this morning Lord Jesus we stand your Lord this morning Lord just humbled Lord in your presence so thankful Lord for your touch Lord in our life Lord we realize that just even within ourselves if it had not been for you Lord coming Lord and speaking to us and there be a corresponding part that you sold within our hearts Lord God we would have missed it and Lord with that realization in our hearts and with every need that is presented here this morning Lord Jesus we need you to come Lord and father that you would quicken Lord to us Lord Jesus what you were quicken us to it Oh God Lord for these needs Lord here this morning we all stand in need of you Lord all God needs that are greater than anything that human instrumentality can meet or put together Lord father it'll take you Lord Jesus and Lord we believe that we are in the midst of you Lord aunty so father we Laura just submit and we give over to you Lord the needs and everything that we have before us Lord and we Lord Jesus just looking to you that you will come in a personal way and change us Lord changes further Lord and the service Lord from glory unto glory Lord we love you and we praise you O God Lord we just give ourselves to you Lord and all these things Lord may you just come and just have Liberty here this morning guidance Lord is a speaker of the word I I can't do anything Lord I just want to be a voice I want you to be the speaker Lord you know what our needs are Lord God I just want to be just a vessel that surrendered Lord surrendering every thought in everything Lord and as a people Lord we just want you to come Lord and that you would have your way here Lord in our midst in our lives change us lord I pray granted Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen let's look into the word here this morning Matthew chapter 3 I want to probably on the prayer request no doubt was mentioned regarding the passing of sister gomez's mother and we want we certainly want to remember them in prayer was there yesterday in the evening there with them just about a few hours before she had passed had passed on and you know what a great comfort it is is where with with sister Gomez's mother you know she was very much a Catholic all of her life but here in the latter part of her life you know sometimes we just don't know how God has everything orchestrated and you know I think back you know to the moment I don't mean to keep you standing but I think back to where you remember it was at about four or five years ago she came over here on the boat her mother she actually thought they were gonna lose her and they couldn't fly her they had to bring her over on a boat you remember that is about four or five years ago I my time frames are all kind of off a little bit but that was about that that amount of time and when she came over here you know here she is with you know and you know with brother and sister Gomez and over that time you know they just had began to further express to her and how that she in her heart and that how the Lord touched her life to where that she embraced the Lord Jesus Christ as her Lord and Savior so much so that see many of you you know the backgrounds from things of which that you've come from the Catholicism to even where when there were different ones that even last year it wasn't even a year ago some were still they started to bring in from different parts of the family start to bring in rosaries and different things to her and she looked at them when they brought him in and she says I don't believe in that she said I believe in the Lord Jesus Christ amen you know and that's that's just so wonderful in you know brother ray I think of your mother I think of that as well you know and to God be the glory you know sometimes we we're wanting to see them to turn to truth but I'll tell you this right here the greatest witness that you and I have is the witness of his life in us and just be ready God prepares you and you and I hope prepare us maybe just for just a moment and I we don't know when that moment is but God is working he's working he's not out of sync he's working and I just I think God for that was with all my heart because even when they tried to do it even even here just recently again bringing her rosaries and the other things like that she said I don't want that here [Laughter] then that wonderful amen you know even how the Prophet made it so clear to us he says to where if you have he said he said you had to take a Catholic person he said a Catholic man a woman he said but if they're trusting in the Lord Jesus Christ as their Savior not in the church they're saved I kind of jumped there just a moment you see they can they can trust in him as their Savior now there's some things that doesn't change it doesn't move places to the election but even when you take individuals that can be in other places they might be under a Lutheran title Baptist title Pentecostal title but if they're trusting in the Lord Jesus Christ as their Savior they're saved there say then that wonderful to me that's to me that's just glorious I I've said this all the time if all I can do on with on the job if I can fellowship with someone maybe they don't see what we see but if we can all we can do is fellowship on salvation that to me is not all we can do I can shout on that I can rejoice on that and then if there's something starts stirring in their heart for a time God will prepare that amen in the Lord good amen amen so good to be with each and every one I'm not trying to keep you standing it's just good to see you all amen I love you I really appreciate you amen nope no other group of people I'd rather minister to than you all I love you amen I really love you oh man I'll go other places and go other places the minister but the whole time I'm thinking about you all and that's the truth so well we certainly want to just look on into the word and Matthew chapter 3 verse 11 is what I'd like to start and we'll read just a few verses of scripture verse 11 and I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance but he that cometh after me is mightier than I whose shoes I am not worthy to bear he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire whose fan is in his hand and he will thoroughly purge his floor and gather his wheat into the garner but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire I can just stop there for a moment here is a prophetic ministry john is identifying who he is his place in the word and he's also pointing out that there's one who is coming even among us he's mightier than I then John breaks into the next next scripture and I say John is the Spirit of God moving on him because the fulfillment of this word it will lead to this very placing in verse 12 whose fan is in his hand he will thoroughly purge his floor gather his wheat into the garner but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire we're living in the time in the day when that scripture is to be fulfilled but see the Spirit of God is even issuing in there because there's a completion to this work then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John to be baptized of him but John forbade him saying I have need to be baptized of thee and comest out to me and Jesus answering said unto Him suffer it to be so now for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness then he suffered him and Jesus when he was baptized went up straightway out of the water and lo the heavens were opened unto him and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting upon him and lo a voice from heaven saying this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased amen may God bless his word bless you as you're being seated this morning I'd like to to speak here for a few moments on true reconciliation and I just want to just deal with that word just in a a part of it right now because that word to be reconciled if we just look at the definition just for a few moments here to reconcile completely that's that's the one meaning to reconcile completely to reconcile back again so if it's back again then it shows there was a former there was already a place there was already a place where we were reconciled or brought to our already together so to reconcile was to bring back to reconcile back again bring back to a former state of harmony so if you just think of this let me just give you a few examples so maybe you'll see the thought of it where we want to go that when you look at to be reconciled and you take for example just opening up in Genesis one where that the earth itself was covered over with darkness its void its without form but here God says let there be light so he sends forth a word and the word that he sends forth is a word of reconciliation it's a word to bring the earth back from from a state of darkness of where there's no form and it's void to bring back and so there first must be a word that goes forth first God will not do anything outside of his word but God will speak his word and within that word there is the authority the creative power of God for God's creative will to come to pass every one of us in our life we want God's will and yet where you and I find our struggle is where many of the times is trying to look at things and then trying to make things happen either by our own feelings our own desires and yet it's nothing that you and I can make happen it's not something that God wants our strength to make it happen but our strength is to yield to him that he can bring it to past is that okay it's yielding to him that's that's the whole part as the strength is the yielding yielding to him that he then by his word it's his creative will so you find the earth here's the earth when the Spirit of God begins to move upon the earth it is reconciling the earth unto himself to that former state of harmony but yet the Spirit of God going out and moving is not the reconciling buddy it leads to full reconciliation to where that the earth itself that where the the actual dividing of the heavens above beneath to where that even the dividing of the waters of the land all of that is part of the consoling part of it but yet even in those dividing of things it's not the reconciling but then when the earth it's south here the seeds begin to come up and you begin to see different plants taking form you begin to see the botany life then you begin to see the animal life and yet still it's not fully to the place of full reconciliation but yet then when it comes to the place here one in the image of the one doing the brooder of the brooding the one stands there in the image upon the earth of the one doing the brooding then God places this man into a body of flesh and there he places him in the garden and here you have a work that began in reconciling and now the earth itself here here in a place of full reconciliation it is a process that goes on it's just like let me give maybe a another simple example when you take the word that was sent down to Egypt and the word went down there and when God sent Moses with the word and that was I will bring you into a land that floweth with milk and honey that was the full reconciliation but there had to be a message that would go down there a word that was speaking of this and this was the fulfillment of it but there had to be a word that would go down there and begin to deal with the hearts of the people here the lamb comes forth in that time then you find them coming out and walking in the wilderness and many that came out from under the bondage of Egypt they begin to walk out in the wilderness in a very short amount of time they begin to complain they begin to look at things and they and eventually we know even where it led to that there were people who settled in that Transjordan or the the tide of Jordan that was not even the promise they saddled there what they failed to grasp is that message had a for final fulfillment or a full reconciliation to take them from bondage and place them into the land of inheritance so there's a full reconciliation those who just stopped in the wilderness we're not fully reconciled but a full reconciliation is to take us from from that condition and all the way back and that's why I say death in our lives those when we have been born in the Spirit of God listen to me now we've been born the Spirit of God your soul and my soul has been fully reconciled to God and with that promise moving in us it pulsates within us to know that there shall be a redemption of the body this is not just where we're stopping we're happy we're glad we're thankful but our happiness our joy it goes beyond all the things of this earth because there's enough around us there's enough things that just to get us down and to try to pull us away from the real focus and the real purpose but thanks be to God the real happiness the real joy in our life is that to know that what he has started he'll finish that I'm going somewhere this is just a journey all of these things all the way through it's just part of the journey so when we look at this with the Ministry of John this is something just some some time ago about a month ago I just was so drawn to this just in prayer one day I began to look at this word this word is laid on me heavy for for over a year on reconciliation and I began to look at it and I think of when I look at this this whole setting of John see John's ministry you see here the Messiah coming you see a great parallel in the hour we're coming you know this is one thing that the the message of the hour has has brought to you and I to where we're not reading the Bible as a textbook we're not reading it as a book of history but we see it as a book of prophecy let me just say it like this every believer in every age they have also looked at this book as a book of prophecy because they themselves were a partaker of that same life that you and I or a partaker of so they were looking they were waiting they were walking by revelation and waiting on these things to happen there was something moved within their life to let them know that there is coming a time there is going indeed to be a rapture Paul was looking forward to that rapture Paul could say though though we we who are alive and remain we shall not hinder nor prevent the coming of the Lord in every age they look for his coming they live for his coming they did not live in a passive life there were things listened just in this age the the people who lived in the previous ages they had to endure all the pressures that came along with that age but God gave them his word of promise and that word of promise held within it the life and the strength to be able to bring them to overcome and they overcame by the very life of Christ himself that was issued into their lives through the ministry that God had given in that time they gave that word three eminence and they were over comers and part of the bride in that day hallelujah so when we look at this a parallel this hour you find that what was taking place here in the Ministry of John it was a great reconciliation taking place here this was a time that God was desiring to come to to where that God could get back inside of man the where he could come and dwell inside of man I wanted to say it like this not just dwell in a mortal body but he wanted to dwell in his word his word that he has sold in mortal bodies God dwells in his word is that right that's why the mystery of even the outpouring of the Holy Spirit that here the Holy Spirit can fall upon all flesh but yet the Holy Spirit is sent for the servants and his handmaids which those that are part of the word that the Spirit of God comes and quickens that word that soul than is laying within you and I and Christ is dwelling in the very midst of our life to give order to everything else are you with me and by that authority by that authority within us that gives us the strength to subdue our spirit and it gives us the strength to subdue our flesh it's a parallel our here we are the great reconciling what a time that took place when here the Lord Jesus in this moment he walks down to the river of Jordan think about how the Prophet would place this over and over in the message of lamb and the Dove and I'm just going to be referring to many of these places brother Branham he's standing there he's getting ready to preach on the wings of a snow-white dove and brother one of the brothers there within the Assembly at Shreveport had said brother Branham you remember the messages you preached on lamb and a dove and you know I'm the dove and the lamb and he said I guess you're with your schedule you're too busy to to preach on messages like that and the Prophet said when I get away from that I've gotten away from my message you see it didn't diminish all of those things were pointing to the place that in order for a uniting to take place there must be things that are alike it must be things that are alike human hell God represented himself as a dove and he represented his son on earth as a lamb it's showing that meekness will only come and dwell with meekness I'm gonna ask you a question here how in the world could you and I make ourselves me how in the world could you and I produce in ourselves something that's acceptable the question is we didn't do that but the Spirit of God drawing upon our life he knows what is laying down there and so this Holy Spirit the purifier the age of the Lord moving out begins to move upon our lives and draw out of our lives what's needed in order for that union and it's just simply us submitting to the predestinated plan of Almighty God and if it's just that simple and it's just that great then that is the same way from henceforth it's us submitting to the predestinated plan of Almighty God who glory be to God so it's not our ingenuity our work at our our orchestration of this this bride is not a manhandled bride this bride is is is his Christ's own body it's the body of the Lord Jesus Christ it's all everything that he's said in and and how that he's orchestrated all this all you and I are we are actors being a part of that word but being a part of that word we and ourselves don't even have the right means act it out but the option the inspiration comes of even how to act it out within this age and it's all Christ Himself getting glory to himself I think this is a very great thing when I look at this hour a howl that things must be alike there couldn't be one thing that would be on a life remember that dove was not set to settle down upon the lamb brother Ram many times he'll go over and say if the lamb had had been like a wolf in head snarled like a wolf and all of those things he said he couldn't have sat down on there so you see it isn't the Holy Spirit is not the Dove of God is not just someone who's overriding our will because we still have free more agency but remember the choice that you and I make is not a choice as though we're making a choice but it is God it's a reflection of a choice he made it's not our desire the Prophet says that throughout the message in regarding election it's not your desire it wasn't Abraham's desire it was God's choosing what God chose he knew the desire you had within you but that desire was already sold there and it's up to him to make a way for that desire to come forth Oh glory be to God so when we're looking at this place of it here we find that it is God Himself moving the bringing this place bringing it all to a place I like on the scripture says then came Jesus here's the Lord Jesus here he was right among them he was right among them but at a certain part you know it's almost like you're in a symphony and a certain thing is wrong you know you're waiting somebody's telling you do it at this time and doing it this part I remember one time when I wasn't in the player whatever more I didn't like getting before people I still don't but they said run the lights for this play so I had this little thing and I go Lord when do I turn the red lights on window I turn these back lights on and it probably got better gadgets now to run those lights but I was looking at this sheet of this play you know and I'm just hoping I get the lights right when this one speaks red lights on in back row and see I'm looking at a cue I'm not just up there flipping lights green and blue and red and whatever more I've got to look at a script and the reality is if not for the Holy Spirit even looking at the script we missed what the script wants us to do that's why it's so necessary that our eyes we sing that song keep your eyes turn your eyes upon Jesus that's absolutely the truth we have to stay focused on him because he's the one who wrote the script who is the script and we're a part of the script so we need his leadership in the script so here here is standing here's the point then cometh Jesus he's led by the spirit to this place to this moment for this time the Bible you know here it says winning when he comes when he comes the Bible says in Malachi 3 verse 1 behold I will send my messenger and he shall prepare the way before me this was the Ministry of John the Baptist another part in the scripture that's identified you see here's a part here there's a part in Isaiah write all of these parts it looks like they're all scattered but when God gets ready to fulfill them God assembles the word that is ordained for a moment and that's where the believers they rest in the Lord God who is revealing and vindicating his word that's our rest so here he brings these scriptures together here he is John's place now listen it wasn't enough for John just to read this no doubt John like you or me what could he read through these things but yet out there in that time when he's out there with God in the desert these scriptures had to be quickened to him they had to be more than just something that was rehearsed he had to have more than just what his daddy Zacharias or Elizabeth of even what they would say to him it's not that he had to have another message that it was the same God had to quicken this to John so that John might see his position in the world hallelujah it was necessary for that glory then the Bible goes on to say and the Lord look at this and the Lord whom you seek shall suddenly come to his temple even the messenger of the Covenant who is the messenger of the Covenant Jesus Christ it's the angel of the Lord the same one the same one who brewed in the beginning same God that same God changing for these the messenger of the Covenant hey man is that right and here he is this one you're seeking after he shall suddenly come to his temple we know that he could not it could not come by way of a sexual birth we understand that but when we look at that why did it have to be a virgin birth because it must be a body that is separate of blood that is separate from what has already been it cannot listen to me now it cannot come under the inspiration that fell in the beginning where Satan through the tool of the serpent he enticed Eve in deception to give herself and then here you have a Cain coming for every one of us this is why David could say we were born and said shaped in iniquity there's got to be inspiration come that it's not inspiration like that but it will take and produce - what is needed is the virgin birth a body that God Himself can come down in his own body be able to redeem you and I back to himself because we belong to him we were always his even when you and I were in the world or maybe you were just sitting in a in a church pew even like I was I still belong to him but just sitting around the message I wasn't reconciled to him there has to come a reconciliation there must be a call by faith a cleansing by the blood and there must be the fire of God coming down mental Holy Spirit comes and begins to dwell and reflect that work then there is a reconciliation that is made manifest so here the Lord shall suddenly come to his temple I want you to catch even the phrase of what's mentioned here suddenly it speaks of such a a change that's going to take place a transition that's going to happen he shall suddenly come to his temple this here this body I always think of how the prophet he places it in future home and he takes this event of we're here the Lord Jesus here he is walking into the water and as he's walking into the water to be baptized he said then down after the baptism here comes the Holy Spirit in the form of a dove and he's descending down and he's letting it be known that this is my part of the earth that I've come to redeem now watch this the Holy Spirit moved upon the prophets is that right the Bible tells us that they they spake he spake in the fathers spake in the prophets unto the fathers but yet the Holy Spirit had never come to a place to where it was abiding inside of a vessel he couldn't do that Redemption had to come and this is where the the the direction that the Holy Spirit that was given to John upon whom thou shall see this spirit descending and remaining she couldn't just be descending but descending and remaining you see what that is that's an evidence of the Holy Ghost in you it descends and it remains to work out and fulfill that word that's promised it's not just it's not just the Holy Spirit coming and then pulling back and then coming and pulling back sure you you feel times where you don't feel his presence but I'm talking about when he has come he brings a change within your life and he takes up residency in the temple of his word that he has sown in your life your life has become his sanctuary and from the sanctuary he gives order and authority to the other courts so here he shall suddenly come to his temple here he's coming to claim his body what he and through this body he will redeem the rest of the attributes so he come to Jesus Jesus there was an attribute he come to claim that attribute he claimed that and here as he goes walking forth now let's this transition let's move back here into the Ministry here of John looking at this in John chapter 1 where they came to John I want you to just look at this here just for a moment they came to John and they begin to ask John who are you everybody knew his name John that's not what they're asking who are you what character what characteristic where are you where is your ministry in the scripture so here John the Bible says in John 1 verse 20 and he confessed and denied not but confessed I'm not the Christ and they asked him what then art thou Elijah he said I am NOT no wait a minute he says he was an Elijah he wasn't that Elijah that was to come but it was the Spirit of Elias that was on him you see the Holy Spirit John is catching what they're asking this is not John's intellect here this is the Holy Spirit what's he doing it's positioning the Holy Spirit does not breed confusion it's letting him know I'm not that Elijah I'm not that in time ministry glory be to God and-and-and-and art tell that prophet he answered no but yet he was the Prophet that was spoken of in Isaiah he was the Prophet that was broken up in Malachi 3 we just read but you see the Spirit of God is catching and gleaning they were trying to place him in the scripture and they're giving this and they're giving that but John knows his place and the Spirit of God is able to discern that and he says I am NOT that prophet they said unto Him who art thou that we may give an answer to them that sin us what say it's Dow of die itself here he goes he's going to declare his ministry he said I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness make straight the way of the Lord has said the Prophet Isaiah's they've asked you know that when they've asked before they tried to place him but John knows exactly where he's at do you see friends they were already they were overlooking this promise right here they were overlooking and it was a key a very key Junction and here John stands there because he recognizes who he is so he's able to identify himself in the scripture how beautiful and I believe that with all my heart that we are to identify ourselves in the scripture it's not us making ourselves something but it is the Holy Spirit that divinely positionally places you and reveals to you who you are you are a part of the bride of Jesus Christ a part of the word in this hour a believer [Applause] Alleluia and they which were of the Pharisees they asked him and said what baptizes thou then if thou be not the Christ nor Elijah neither that prophet John answered them saying i baptize with water but understandeth one among you whom you know not he it is who's coming after me is preferred before me whose shoe letter I am not worthy to loose you see look how John John is speaking in his message he has already identified there's a change coming there don't even recognize who John is and even John in the midst of it he's identified there's one here who's mightier than I he's here John's ministry is announcing that he's here he's mightier than I and he is coming he's actually preferred before me you see the humility he's announcing there as a forerunner there's going to be a transition now the Bible goes on to say it says these things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan where John was baptizing the next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him and said behold the lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world see he's identifying the very sacrifice he's identifying the very body are you with me now he's identifying the body and he's also identifying the future work that will take place in his priestly ministry amen this is he look what he says this is he of whom I said after me cometh a man which is preferred before me for he was before me and I knew him not but that he should be made manifest to Israel therefore am I come baptizing with water John could declare he's here but getting them not how could he do that because listen John his remember where's John resting John's resting in the Lord see it's not up this is not about all of a sudden John's quickened John sees this place in the scripture and now John's got to make all this happen no God is the one working John is just a vessel that's the same with you and I it's not what you and I got to make happen it's God it's God working and performing his word so John all John had to do is say you know what I'm gonna do what he told me to do he told me to go stand here he told me to baptize and John's not doing it just out of mere just something mechanical but John recognizes the calling there is a need for repentance what's it doing it's making a people ready for the Messiah and John's ministry here it is it's a ministry that is that is making a people ready he's standing out there and he's pointing the people to the word there's a need of repentance and there's a washing there's a baptism of how these baptized them in water washing them what's he doing it's preparing the people for the Messiah who has to come let me tell you something this word that God has sent let me just let me just just dwell on this a moment even leading up to the opening of the seals there's a preparation of the word making you and I ready I want to be very clear and go on record we do not do away with what's prior to send be a part of where we are in this hour where the message itself has taken on flesh in the lives of the people he was longing for that he was Lord will it has it is so here John said I knew him not but then he should be made manifest in Israel therefore I am come baptizing with water and John bear record saying I solve the spirit descending from heaven like a dove and in a boat on him and I knew him not but but he that sent me to baptize with water the same said unto me upon whom thou shalt see the spirit descending and remaining on him the same as he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost did everybody see it there no John saw it but you see it was necessary that John would see it and when I say it so necessary God ordained it to be that way here they are they these the people have been brought John's ministry here apart within that a ministry to forerun to introduce the coming Messiah that ministry was a very critical ministry very critical and crucial ministry it was calling those people together and through that ministry the very Messiah would be identified and John is standing there and he's waiting I don't know him I know he's here I know who were he I'm not even worthy to unlatch his shoelaces I'm not even worried for this and here he comes to this place and he tells the Lord Jesus I have need to be baptized of you and what did the Lord Jesus say suffer it to be so it behooves with us become a thoughts to fulfill all righteousness as the Lamb of God he must be washed before he's presented see God's not going over all of these orders he was the sinless spotless virgin born Lamb of God you agree with that he did not have to be washed like you and I are washed or baptized in his name he didn't have that was not why he was baptized he was baptized as the sacrifice being being made ready to present he was also being washed as the coming High Priest there was a transition here it was Melchizedek now on earth in a flesh body this is why the Prophet could say Melchizedek was not Jesus Christ but Jesus Christ was milk hesitant because because Melchizedek when he appears to Abraham it was not in a virgin born body it was creative but how that God in this hour in order to redeem us he must come in a virgin born body the transition was already there our high priest think of this think of this the people who were there the priests and the high priests think what kind of a of an attitude they had they had no care for the people they had no care you say how can you say that but the Rev says they would visit the widow's house he talks about your kind no priest but listen friends all of those wonderful flowery things that can be done but when they were taking the key and shutting up the kingdom they did not have the love for the people they could not they could not even be touched but this high priest he could be touched by the feeling of their infirmities and that touch was not just something that happened within the courts of the cavern Akal here he is moving under the leadership in the direction of redemption he makes his way to Samaria and he brings a little woman who is beneath all this cloud of darkness and gloom and all these things said about her life but beneath there is a true seed of God an attribute of God a redeemable thought of God so what does he do he comes and reconciles that thought that attribute unto himself and when he reconciles and her life is changed her life begins to express who she really always was so what she was living under was a lie there was a shadow about her life oh there's a lot told on you come on somebody Oh somebody's total out on you but you see the truth came the person of truth Himself came and he broke the lie that was around her life and around your life and my life when the person of truth comes seals are broken he's the seal breaker hallelujah so here John jump makes this declaration and he says again I want to read this here the next day verse 35 John stood and two of his disciples and looking upon Jesus as he walked now watch his disciples have watched what's taken place here in the water okay they've they've seen this they didn't see the Spirit of God descending like a job but John did the heavens were opened Hey they had been closed off now they're open this was the signification to John this is him and the next day John see as well as his disciples the Bible says the next day after after John stood and once you watch this in verse 35 and two of his disciples looking upon Jesus as he walked he says behold the lamb of God notice he's already said this once now he cries out again behold the lamb of God so after he's already introduced the Messiah his ministry and the message changes there's a transition to where he is identifying now what was one time prophecy is now in fulfillment so he cries out again behold the lamb of God now watch this in verse 37 and the two disciples heard him speak and they followed Jesus now no doubt there were many who heard him speak but there was two that heard him speak many heard John but to hurdy you said what are you saying I'm talking about that they could hear this what an event was taking place my I'll tell you what great knows out about it you're gonna be going to tell me the presence of God wasn't around I don't care if they didn't see the light the presence of God was there that was said that listen to me that was the greatest event that taken place upon earth when God was reconciled to man heavens and earth kissed and embraced the greatest event you tell me a supernatural event tell me inspiration was not falling and not striking in that hour in loss but there was two of them that heard what John said and when they heard what he said honoring what he said help me now he spoke the word and them honoring what he said they walked with that word and they followed Jesus they caught the transition are you with me John didn't have to explain they caught the transition they were a part of that transition I don't know if you know this or not some of you probably do you know there's still a group I think it's called Madden's I think it's called the Madden's modeun ISM that it's a group of people that still believe in John's baptism and still everything revolves around the River Jordan yes even when we went and invaded Iraq there was I can't member how many thousands fifty thousand something like that you can read this listen um I'm a it's right you just punch it on the internet and read about it these are people who believe in that of John the Baptist ministry but they've never moved on they built their homes they built elder doings around the River Jordan and they missed what the message was it's just something that's it's just handed down it's just a it's just a way of life it's just a tradition they didn't go on they didn't move on they're still dwelling within that where everything's revolving around John the message was not about John John was a spokesman and a vessel of which it was to be declared but the message was not John the message was the Lord Jesus Christ and John was faithful to that remember he had the opportunity are now the Christ without thy prophet he had the opportunity but he stayed true to who he was I want you to watch this here and spoken words original seed how that the Prophet says the messenger of Malachi 4 will appear at God's appointed time we are all looking for him we believe he will come that's in 1962 that is according to his word it will be at the end time which it is time now for to see it he's declaring this is the time now to see this he's declaring this he will be correctly dedicated to the word as they have always been indicated by God's Word and have indicated God will vindicate what he preaches to be the truth as he did Elijah for it is Elijah coming making ready for the Mount Zion rapture see making ready for the Mount Zion rapture who is ayan it's the Church of the Living God the bride of Jesus Christ it is the culmination of all ages in the last days it would be like Lots time so these are little checkpoints along the way and he lets it be known within this here but how that God will vindicate what he preaches to be the truth can I have some more monitors up here my voice is literally just straining please I don't want to bust you all out my voice is just really straining right now so you pray for me will you this is something the Prophet continues to lay out for us even in the seals he says it must not only be revealed it must be indicated it's God to be vindicated the vindication is of his very person Christ himself coming and vindicating what he has revealed to be the truth so it's it's not to infer the vindication it cannot just be oh my it cannot just be just truth that's given out but it must be vindicated that's where it falls in our life just as God comes and vindicates that to be the truth then it draws you and I to what God is opening for the Lord to move into our life and fully vindicate his truth in US and through us right at the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ they didn't know him is that right Mary thought he was a gardener right they thought wherever every wherever you laid him and he walked with them on the road to Emmaus their eyes were holding that they wouldn't know him that was done purposely that's why Paul could pick it up later in his time and say though we have known Christ after the flesh henceforth we know no man after the flesh because it was no longer knowing Jesus Christ as the Messiah as Redeemer after the flesh I walked with him I talked with him think about the Prophet emphasizes that in Christ the mystery of God revealed he lays on that four paragraphs it's not just enough to walk with him it's not just enough to walk where the promise is that we must be partakers of the promise and that promise lives inside of you and I and you know what you've got a right to ask for that you and I have a right when God is real making known his word and you say brother Samuel sometimes it seems like it goes over my head but remember the same God is speaking it is the same God who desires to open word in our lives and it won't be something to that he opens that we become more knowledgeable but it actually lifts you and I in position of what God desires for our life and I tell you that lifting by the current of the Holy Spirit it lifts us above complexes it'll lift us above all of the things of this world that want to try to get us away from the purpose of the hour Elijah came there on the mountain he began to he began to take stones and assemble those stones he didn't go and get new stones he took the stones that were there what was there he brought them together he assembled those stones and there came order how did the order count how did Elijah know what order he was doing and according to the word I have done all this according to that word so the word had declared itself and gave direction and within that word to be made known these things being in order that God himself might come down and declare himself as the Lord notice what Elijah called for not just God but that that part Lord master we were chief oversight are you with me because the Israelites had called bail God God let him know when I bring you back to myself I will take all the names of bail out of your mouth Hosea Hosea and you shall in you shall not call me no more bail bail means God you shall call me no more bail but it was God but it was God in the formation of a man's thought I will remove that theological thinking away and you shall no more call me bail you shall Misha because you were issue from me husband here's a transition the prophets letting us know and 62 remember even when he talks about there's been a settling down there's been a cooling down seems like nothing's taking place he said everything's dying everything it was all making me wear the brem says his preaching will be with the spirit let me just try to get through this his preaching will be with the spirit and strength line of God's Word because so much has been called God's truth many will misunderstand this true messenger there's been a lot of things called God's truth the seventh angel this revealing of the word that God had promised a visitation in this hour was not for a new Bible the message books do not replace the Bible perhaps you've been around I've seen people they would carry their Seventh Seal book and said this is my Bible that's not my Bible but if that is truly revealed you'll love your Bible more it opens the scriptures what has been wrote all the way down you see listen it's not people friends these are the things for you and I it's discerning spirits it's the enemy that wants to try to divert the focus and the attention let me just can I just preach a few moments this is where even the trickery then even when you had in this time there's always been people walking away from the message I don't know if you know that that's true there always have been there were people that back in 70 they wanted to throw away their books and everything out there's been people doing that this is not anything per se new in the sense I believe it's a greater culmination of those things pointing even into this time I believe we're at that time you understand what I'm saying there's Bruce things even when the internet at first came out after Al Gore invented it that after it came out some of you'll get that tomorrow but after it came out there were people already saying different things brother Brian you remember this there are certain things that you could open and things like that on a on a web site and whatever more those types of things where people's always been troubled by the cloud and troubled by this and troubled by that you know it's what's very simple is when if something is revealed to you and made known to you you simply rest in the reality of it when brother Branham identified that cloud it said his cloud it's God's cloud hallelujah and here think of God's mercy remember the drawing brother Steve had where it was traveling from east to west right I want you think about it if it had kept on boiling and not come back for you and I it would have bypassed us but notice rudram says those great telescopes call it the cloud as it was coming in and he said when I got there they were there waiting on me he said that what those telescopes didn't catch they didn't catch up catch it when it was going the angels that formed his wig there's always been these the controversies and this and that and there's always been and you know what let me come back to this point that it was just so quick into my heart what the trick of the devil is is is somehow to try to bring people back to a place where we got to prove the brother branham's Malachi 4 we got to prove his losers own ministry of Luke 17 and 30 we got to prove its revelations Ted 7 that's a trick of the enemy you say how can that be a trick of the enemy be cause his his focus is its to try to divert from what God is doing now let me tell you something the greatest vindication of this message this banner that we're under is the life that it is producing in you and I and even when you don't understand that you're sitting here and you say I don't understand at all but you know that it's a living Christ that's discerning your life and he's releasing to you overcoming power daily in your life when will I understand all this will understand that in the times and seasons that he has set down there were people in John's time John said this in 1963 John identified he's the one who's come but over here John in 1964 said hey go ask if he's the one or do we look for another come on somebody you know brother Branham preached a message Forgotten beatitude Forgotten beatitude but them said this is a beatitude that's not put in with all the rest of them it's tucked away over here and brother Brant pulls that beatitude out and he begins to go into John's thinking he said what it was John and there the attitude is blessed is he that's not offended in me the last person you think would be offended in the Lord would be John come on but what was John offended what what offended means that word offense is stumbling I'm gonna preach just a little bit you said you've been preaching another part but I'm preaching alone I'm going another side road now y'all with me he he comes to this place he's stumbling on it because John is looking at I don't see happening what was I don't see happening his fan is in his hand he's just early purchase for you see that junction of time for when that was to come into place although it was absolutely the truth it was absolutely right to say it buddy it is reserved for a time and for a season and there are people that will be upon the earth that will move into that part of the fulfillment but what did Jesus say stick around and I want you to go tell John what you see see he didn't he didn't send John back with John no hold on let me get it all together here and we'll you'll get your iPad's okay we'll download it from the cloud and we'll do all this and you know then then you can just take it on back to John let let John read it let John read over John didn't need to read but he needed to see that's why I'm telling you right now don't ever get the thinking in your mind that we don't need to see him don't ever get to thinking in your mind well we don't need miracles God's already confirmed the message I'm not talking about confirming the message again but we're talking about God making it even more real and more personal to you and I if he's a living God he still does the same thing he's the same God yesterday today and forever hallelujah so they went back and they told John what they saw you know what that did that removed the film from his eye I hope you're with me John going down there in that if we could say in that place of offense John was like that bush like the red blur Ram talks about that eagle got blown out and that snowstorm that stormed and fell into that bush that falling in the bush didn't make him not an eagle he was still an eagle when you've stumbled it's not that you're not an eagle when doubt has thrived the swirl around your life it doesn't mean that you're not an ego hallelujah you're always an eagle you were born as an eagle hallelujah mama Eagle came over your way and drew you to herself sports might come things my tongue but as you're down there in the midst of that time you'll start hearing all this chichi chichi chichi chichi chichi chichi chichi chichi chichi chichi you see where chatter takes place in an earthly level but that Eagle he looked around he said I can escape this what I do he said his wings and took off he didn't try to straighten out the squirrel who was doing the chatter he didn't try to straighten everything out and this one with this one and this one that was but the eagle himself he said himself there into the heavenlies friends this is our victory is in him if we get focused on the earth we lose sight of the promise and when you lose sight of the promise you start all these things start entering in in your life the frustrations and the hurts be seems so great everything seems so great you feel so many things but when you can just look to him and set your wings you'll find sufficient grace to be able to soar above that kind of finish this quote [Music] because so much has been called God's truth by fakers many Truman ministers will misunderstand that messenger and that did happen still does happen I mean think about even these things that as we speak about how many of these things we spoken about over the years and yet there's been people that have read these things if I'm not him I'm laying a platform for him and they feel like the platform is for them this is a body ministry the profit has come and what then what was the profits what was the profits message to do let's look at John's message John's message us to do what introduced the body of the Lord this is him this is him let me just read this now as the endtime prophecies will repeat I believe as the forerunner came from the wilderness and cried behold the lamb of god the second forerunner will probably do the same by pointing the people to a word born bride so the ministry of malachi for revelations 10-7 the revealing of luke 1730 is to point the people to a word born bride the body of the lord not just a part of the body even though in this age we are only a part of the body the building that's been going on down through the ages is that right but in this closing part the scriptures are clear they without us should not be made perfect it goes with every age that succeeds the next age it is Christ working by his Spirit through his word drawing a people unto himself that he might reflect his word through their lives but in this time think of it Jeremiah was apart Isaiah was apart all of these were parts but when he came he was the fulfillment of it all all of these down through the church ages has been a part there's been a part is that right here everything being a part you and I listen to me now here's the understanding we're a part we're not separate we are apart but where we are in that part this is a combination of all things to where God has brought a body from the feet all the way as the Prophet said our place is the neck that the head itself might set down on the body here we are in this lady ocn age but yet we've been called out or called up higher by the Spirit of Almighty God to where the word might have preeminence in you and I the word cannot have preeminence in a denomination that's why it is a domination believe this and that's it but here a word born body just as John could stand there and say behold the lamb of God now what's this next part here the Bride of Christ will be pointed to the skies at the appearing of Jesus so the Bride of Christ this word born bride because what did Jesus say upon this rock I will build my church what is that rock who is that rock that rock is him the personal revelation of who he is that's the new birth it's not just I know this to be the truth but it's Christ himself being personally revealed to you and in you it changes your life it changes your thoughts it changes your whole being here this is pointing to a word born bride this is where wrath this is whereas now notice a word born bride a body that now Christ himself the son of man can step inside of his body and be made manifest you see I may just skip over here just a few things and his appearing they'll be pointed to the skies at the appearing of Jesus we know that coming and appearing are two different things there right there is the literal coming of the Lord Jesus Christ that he will come in a literal physical corporal body is that right but we also know that in order to be a part of that physical coming there is that part within that that is his coming by his word his presence his fullness that must come and it brings a people into that place of readiness which we know to be his appearing he has appeared to us making himself that appearing is him making himself known as the same God this is why the brother Graham could say over no these are not just loose statements well brother brown could make a statement of people say 10 couldn't God do this and can't God do things outside the scripture brother M says sure he said he's God he can do whatever he wants to do he said but to me he says I want to stay inside the scriptures what you think of this when the Lord Jesus raised from the grave when he makes himself known by many infallible proofs he doesn't appear to them in ways that he never that he didn't do the first time but he appeared to them in the same ways that he did before that he might prove himself that he still alive and it was through that that part that was then that was necessary those forty days like we looked at it that ministry was necessary in order to bring a people to the upper room they had seen him on the outside what they needed was him on the inside so that meant making known from that resurrection where he's taking literally the seals off himself it was all laying in the word and he walked with them it wasn't a hurried up thing he walked with them and he began to open the scriptures concerning himself he's taking the seals off himself then we know he enters in with them into that place where he breaks the bread now and this huh it's him he appear there right there and then he's gone you see the appearing wants to stimulate their faith that there's nothing out of order everything is right in order everything's right in time his appearing he was making himself known to them so it's a call called to the promise of the hour a word born bride bride that is born of the word a man what is it what is taking place it's God revealing his chosen place of worship see here's odd come down let me just skip over these things here and just skip to the skip to the places here you find the Ministry of the seventh angel he's on earth this is what's being ministered on earth and he's pointing us to a time that's coming well brother and he's pointing all those seals all those sails all those thunders see things are stirring in his heart I mean just I mean I'm gonna just I've got to keep going here with this you remember brother Brown when he's talking about look we're leading up to that place of the seals you're not brother Rams talking about praying and fasting well let's pray let's fast memories drawing the people all where we've drifted from all the all-night prayer meetings and all this listen it's not saying that now that the seals are open that we don't need those things listen to me now all of that was leading up God's presence moving upon the earth that the people were moving to pray and look for those things how much more on what has been revealed to you and I ought we to be in prayer prayer for the fulfillment of these things it doesn't do away with fasting you see now what they were looking for now has it's arrived what's it doing it's us what are we doing you say Oh praying or fasting I'm talking about us consecrating ourself to the mighty God to Christ who's in our midst that same Christ now that mystery being unfolded in your life it wasn't by happenstance that you're born in a message family it's not by chance that you come in to a church it's not by chance that you hear the message hid everything God is arranging it I wish I had 10,000 10,000 years to appreciate this morning wish I had ten thousand voices my voices it seems like it's just failing me this morning but here is that seventh angel he's on earth the Prophet says it like this in the message breach here he is standing on earth at the time of his coming and he says he tears the seals off of that book and hands it down to his seventh angel messenger he's got to have one the Prophet said like John like Elijah that set aside to begin to minister these things I hope you understand what I'm saying friends the holy spirit of things that's been speaking and ushering to our hearts it's not enough just to know God sent a prophet it's not enough it's not enough with this the rapture is not about rallying around brother Branham I know sometimes the people say who are you trying to do we're trying to do I'm not trying to do anything I'm trying to declare as the Prophet himself is there to be rallying around the Lord Jesus Christ that's his desire of where we would be in this hour and that's why we don't need another message it's the God who already spoke by prophecy in this message this message becoming flesh in you and I which is the promised scriptures of this hour let me say to you very clearly when Sarah was there here's Sarah hearing herself in her condition God had her and his mind the whole time was that right but here it comes down to this time and we know that God even tells Abraham you're going to have a child of Sarah and you're going to call his name Isaac seeing how God dealt with Abraham then here in Genesis 18 God had appeared in lights forms dreams many gifts but in Genesis 18 he comes down and takes on the form of a man and what does he do why is the purpose that coming the purpose of that coming is to bring Sara's faith through the place that the promise can be made manifest you don't see in the ku don't see in Genesis 18 Abraham saying I don't know how to I don't know if this is gonna be previous chapter when Abraham's not saying in 18 I don't know no it's Sara but you see when he came he come to dissolve that dot that she had that part about her life was a complex to her think about it the by he wasn't a good thing to be called barren John's mother Elizabeth LeBaron there wasn't a good thing to be known as a barren one but God had a reserved for a certain time because this would be done in Abraham or in Abraham and Sarah's life it would not be through their strength God allowed Abraham's strength to die he allowed that age to die he allowed it to come to a place of deadness where it could not produce anything then he steps on the scene the very life giver himself the prophesy the promise himself he steps on the scene and he begins to step on the scene and through this ministry the bridegroom call comes it's the bride man caller the revealing of the son of man what's the bridegroom called doing it's calling the bride how was the bridegroom calling the bride the bridegroom calls the bride by speaking and manifesting bridegroom's print scriptures and promises and by manifesting bridegroom promises it calls the bride they mad and wanted to do that unites the two together all of that being said for this when he's told he told Sarah I'm coming he announced his coming here was his appearing now he announces his coming and his coming was going to be a coming inside of her first and that coming inside of error would carry her to the coming son so that coming was actually a going are you with me when he's told Sarah he said I will visit you according to the time of life who was that that said that was it the body was he going to come back in in that same body no but the one who was in that body who was speaking that promise was letting Sarah know that I am going to visit you according to the time of life so the revealing of the son of man what does it do it brings a word borne by into position for Christ to step into she is bone of his bone flesh of his flesh life of his life she is him a reconciliation reconciling these parts together and the Bible said Sarah judged him faithful there's no greater honor that we can do you might look at all in your disappointment you might look at all your flaws you might look at all of your letdown you look it up but you're looking at the wrong thing you need to look to him because what he's speaking he's not looking at your weaknesses he's not even looking at your strengths what he's looking at is his word and the greatest thing that you and I can say Lord let it be in me me to get out of the way Lord dissolve all down Lord and all unbelief Lord even remove complexes about me that I've got about me but I'm no good and I'm this Lord dissolved that I take your word hallelujah let his word be preeminent let it cast out and cast down all imagination let it cast down every doubt and say Lord I'm united with the promise of this hour these are other things and things that take place I have sealed it's just to try to get me down they try to get me from the purpose is to try to take me from the joy of you and your the joy of my life Lord help me Lord the Bible says he shall arise with healing in his wings healing we're walking and talking with the king that same son of man the Lord Jesus Christ is here in his bride body the prophet said in the message of trial he said I charge you to believe that Christ the Son of man is manifest in the bride's body what do I have to do but say man what do I have to do what can I do Jesus never tried to do anything I know this is simple I know it's simple but friends that's just it's just reality of where it's at god help me help me to give myself to that simplicity there's more for me to give this simplicity remember what the Prophet said in that pick up your pen and write the Spirit of God said noticed notice what harmony is to exist now between the groom and his bride notice notice means look at observe the harmony remember when Lazarus died they couldn't move him they couldn't pull him oh my there's so much more to be saying but let's just move to this simplicity I do nothing what I see the father do whatsoever the father doeth that doeth the son likewise that's the same privilege that you and I have we don't have to be hasty God don't want you to be hey listen the focus please understand me you have needs in your life I have needs there's things that I wish I didn't have to even think about or do you understand I mean there's things I wish I didn't who here we just passed was the tax season coming up or it's already past I don't know I I do mine way ahead if I don't even like it but there's things we got to do like that right there's certain things that you have to do that we have to do we don't like doing them there's certain things that comes up like this for certain things that even with a job and other things that can come up and so forth but the thing of the thing of it is is that in the midst of it we just remember our focus and our purpose is him when things itself wants to try listen there's times you know how it is I know how it is there's things that comes my way and it seems like it pulls me right down just like that Eagle fallen in the pine tree and that's and that is a truth and sometimes you look at you think what am I doing here sometimes I can get to looking at and you're seeing you know you're hearing chatter you're listening to chatter and things like a hit done and you get to looking at so many different things and what does that do it keeps us there but there have before that ego could take off that ego could not take off if he's still looking at chatter he's got to point his head to where he wants to go he knows where he needs to get to that's the first start you say well he didn't take off right away he had to set his head first so first of all turn your attention away and turn it back to the purpose and and you find that heart say Lord returned me to the purpose store me back to the first love Lord get your head turned in the right direction then listen you've got the wings you've got the equipment for it you're built for it you're built to overcome this not in your natural self your natural self you're not built for it but within you you're an eagle you're ordained to overcome this yes you are and the grace of God is ever-present to build you up all you're gonna do is look to him and say Lord I lift up my eyes to the hills from whence cometh my help and just set your wings and what's the Spirit of God who has healing in his wings has strength in his wings you watch the presence of God sweep down and take you to where you want to get back to before you fell into that pine tree I know I'm preached and personal here this morning but I'm just going to what he's giving me don't get looking at the needles focus on him Lord Jesus lifted me up Lord lift me up Lord set my wings Lord Jesus but Simon how am I gonna take care of this front don't worry about that you're focused on the wrong thing how am I gonna make this come out right you're worried about the wrong thing that's only the enemy trying to trick you and keep you down I gotta work this I know set your wings and you'll find he will bring everything right where it needs to be and it no longer is something that's your mind that's that's consumed and everything around you just adds to that battle and it keeps bringing you down lower and lower you're built to soar in the heavenlies you're built for this you're ordained as a son and daughter of God don't focus on the storm the storm is only an opportunity now but God proves his grace that there's a strength there's a direction there's an authority in you that's given to rise above that what's he doing he's reconciling you he's drawing you beyond your doubts your complexes your thoughts are yourself he's drawing you the real you he's drawing you to himself I feel like singing that song I give myself away I knew Lord I knew but consecrate myself to you I know I knew a new Lord afresh the sender how am I gonna do it all you have to do sarah is judge him faithful who made the promise judge him faithful and he's faithful to move in your life let me tell you something we are called in an age of impossibility we are called to do things in this age that's impossible it's impossible for me to produce a rapture it's impossible for you to produce a rapture it's impossible for me to preach you in a rapture but my dependency is not on me my dependency is in him he is the one he is the rapture he is our catching away he is our quickening that catches us away he's already caught us away within right he's already raised us above the things of the world we can't produce that you're not going to produce that Christ is going to manifest it through you you are ordained for this moment I'm ordained for this moment so what can we say Lord as he did in groom form in groom form he committed himself to God you loved him this morning I trust I trust that it's it's come together I trust that it it's so quicken to our hearts so remain alive and more and more real to us let it be Lord let it be do you love him this morning let's pray Lord Jesus more time I'm sorry Lord with the time I just thought you know I never I never said or intend anything to be long or anything Lord but just from my heart this morning lord I just pouring out Lord those things that Lord have laid in my heart Lord for some time but yet certainly Lord only portions Lord God never Lord what I take this this pulpit Lord I would not take you with premeditated faults Lord I don't know how to bring these things together Lord I don't even know the direction Lord and how that you lead I know a thought Lord and when you place it on my heart but father this is not my ministry this is your ministry it's not my people Lord it's your people Lord God that you have ransomed and purchased with your own blood and Lord Jesus this is our desire as we see more clearer more clear the Lord in the purpose of this message and to recognize the Lord that the greater one how many times as your profit would minister and words Lord titles they were not just titles of sermons these are announcements a greater than Solomon is here the Uniting time ensign future oh my these are announcements Lord love letters Lord Lord where you're making no your will for our lives help us Lord help us Lord not to lose focus of this hour there's a lot of things Lord many many many things that desire to try to come our way that help us Lord to stay focused upon you Lord Jesus no matter friends may come friends may go Lord things can change the Lord so quickly all around us we see this world oh my such change Lord even lord word a person can feel so secure in their job as Dolton well I know I just I just know I'm gonna have a job tomorrow there is no security lord no other security outside of you Lord when we would even look at those things we could become anxious and fearful because there is no certainty in it the Lord God when we can just be so focused Lord to know that we're not here because of our job we're here to serve you we're here to serve your purpose we're here to declare you as the call was made and Isaiah 53 he was cut off from the land of the living who shall declare his generation that life that expression [Music] boy was not the ending the Calvary was only the releasing glory whereby the ransom price was paid to redeem us that then through the offering up and ascending on high that the high priest himself could begin to release back into the Church of the Living God his own life uniting with that seed that word that was there from the inside the whole time and raising up his children breeding back sons and daughters of God again or father this morning if there's one here Lord that doesn't know you that way I had pray this morning that God in all humility that Lord Jesus they were just from their heart Lord their God and say Lord I want to be received of you Lord help me Lord maybe or there in a time of dying out to themselves but thank God there's water present Lord to run away on our own ideas our own thinking lord I pray this morning that's your minister to that heart maybe they don't even got the courage right now to raise their hand but God I pray that within their heart as they'll say the Lord don't pass me by Lord I pray that God you'll brood upon that our Lord let them know your darling yes you are speaking parsley to them Lord I don't know Lord that you care as your prayers and sword moved apart employed let them know that Lord their God the storms of life sometimes the Lord we have warnings sometimes there's warnings when there's a weather change there's warnings winds high winds will begin at this hour of the day this will take place at this hour of the day there's warnings Lord sometimes we've not given heed to certain warnings forgive us Lord and I pray that Lord to know within this you are faithful in your word that all things work together for the good not that everything is good there's been a lot of things the Lord I know that I'll speak for many but I can't speak for my own self there's a lot of things Lord there's a lot of mistakes I've made a lot of things I cannot call the mistakes I made tests and trials but what I can say Lord that by your grace you have taught me you have showed me and you have helped me Lord even when I find that Lord God so many times that you by your Holy Spirit will even take me back sometimes Lord sometimes when I've been sitting in counseling someone Lord and the Lord God you'll take me back and I knew exactly by the grace of God where they're setting and you begin to give me the words to say sometimes Lord it's things that pull right out of the mistakes that I've made they wouldn't know it because I don't say [Music] the Lord God how that you'll come down and make those things known well there's many times the Lord how it will come I don't it's not it because of any mistake I've made it it's just how you come and MA what a wonderful feeling that is as you take control Lord right now as we look at this their storms may be a storm that's come up it's knocked one of your little Eagles and they're down there in that pine thicket and they realize I don't want to be here this chattering all this is just getting to me I don't want to be here they realize the Lord it's not just that they don't want to be there but I pray that by the leadership of the Holy Spirit this morning that they realize that they've got the power within them to overcome that they've got the power to be able to rise above that all they have to do is set set their affections on things above set their eyes and their focus and believe in that same God believe in that same life then he arranged them right back into the heavenlies they don't want to be there Lord they're still an eagle but they won't arise out of that back into the heavenlies back into the purpose help us lord help us to be more consecrated as you spoke to us this morning with these things that we see before us may we be desperate Lloyd desiring to see you in US Court we praise your wonderful name papa we love you this morning the name of Jesus Christ [Music] that's your desire won't you stand with me you've been set in a while you from the from the very back all the way back those are not even here streaming or would archive this later even a part here of this of this assembly may we all just consecrate ourselves in the purpose that God has for us consecrate ourselves in there I think like the Holy Spirit spoke last week their brother Steve the purpose is not that everybody come here to church the purpose is not that everybody go to this church or to that your that's not the purpose that's not the zeal of the hour the zeal and the purpose of the hour is being Christ the purpose and the focus is in Christ it's the rapture that's the focus that's what this message when God sent His Word it causes you and I to lose sight of ourselves and focus on him you love him might say brother sandal I've tried to help this individual I've tried to help this person I they don't seem like I can help them you may not be the instrument that God will used to help but it don't mean that what what's been done was in vain he understand it's no more than than myself I'm not everybody's pastor I'm only those whom goddess has set forth in ordained and for whatever time [Music] you understand what I'm saying there's some times where there might be people that will pass right through this assembly they might pass in this assembly maybe for a year maybe for two years may for three years sometimes sometimes there's things that God will do and I will try to find the answers to it I don't try to find the answers to it God knows what he's doing is that Alright he knows what he's doing and that's why that even within it God puts a burden on your heart for this work and this assembly here I can't teach that I didn't give you that I didn't give myself this burden but you see what it is we're a part of it co-workers together are you with me I'm just I'm just declaring to you my heart we're coworkers together in this we've got one objective and one motive and that's the scene the Lord Jesus Christ glorified we want to help every life in every soul that we can help is that right that's what our desire is as you see that let us not get our eyes on anything else but let us stay focused looking unto Jesus who's the author and the finisher of our faith [Music] sometimes I had things you know you look at sometimes people need healing and God knows how to bring healing we all need healing at times and God knows just how to bring healing to our lives I'm a witness of that I'm a witness of that you are - I'm so glad aren't you glad I'm glad there's people I'm glad there's brothers and sisters I'm glad there's things that God can move through others and speak to me that would strengthen me you see it all at any all in me and it's not all me by myself it's not all you by yourself it's part of a body [Music] I'm so glad about that I'm so glad about them sing that song force by the Brian could we just sing this just as a prayer just a few moments let the
