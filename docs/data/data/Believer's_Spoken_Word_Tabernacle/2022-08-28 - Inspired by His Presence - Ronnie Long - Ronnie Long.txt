amen thank you for the music and the songs good to be in the house of the lord with you this morning and grateful to have another day to be in service for our king amen how many is happy in the lord this morning amen it's a good day to be a christian amen praise the lord i don't know if maybe some of you don't know me but i'm just brother ronnie he's gonna have my wife with me i don't know where she's at somewhere in here blending in but amen praise the lord i just got a text from brother samuel who said greet the church for him it's kind of opposite usually it's me greeting sending greetings to him to greet his church but praise the lord so we're praying that the lord used him mightily where he's at and that maybe that last soul would be there to hear the quickening of the word amen and we could be caught up we might see him sooner than we think amen if you have your bibles this morning turn to the book of luke the fourth chapter i forgot my glasses off to squint to read the scripture but i think i can enlarge the song after that and the 17th verse and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet isaias and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written the spirit of the lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the lord and then he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all of them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him and he began to say unto them this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears father we thank you lord for this opportunity just to open your word this morning lord we just ask that you would lord just anoint it so father that it would be a fresh manna to our to our ears and our hearts this morning lord we just ask that the lord your quickening power would come and just activate that that seed inside of us father that we could just have communion with you this morning lord and father we give ourselves to you afresh this morning lord just asking that you would just uh use us in any way you see fit lord we we confess in this building this morning that we have great need of you father and lord we're nothing without you but lord we're asking that you would come and the lord you would take the service and lord you would just anoint the hearts and you would just lord allow us to step aside of this temporal age that we're in lord and just step into eternity for just a moment this morning father and lord we'd ask that your angel would just come in and the lord it would minister to hearts lord it would heal it would it would it would lose the the the bond father that it would break out of captivity those that are captive father that you would just set at liberty all of us and hear this morning lord we ask in the name of jesus christ amen amen you may be seated uh just a few minutes today i just want to talk about inspired by his presence and so when you're walking in the word and there's those moments in your in your walk where sometimes you're just walking but then you get inspired that you're at the right the right place at the right time and you're doing the right thing in the right season and the right word and everything just lines up correctly i believe the bride's coming into that phase of of the walk where we're realizing that we're walking in step with the word and we're becoming inspired that that it's not just a word a fable or just a story but it's a living reality of what we're walking through it's a manifested word in this hour and i know that those are those are key phrases that we hear all throughout the the message and all throughout the the preachers have been preaching it for 20 or 30 years the manifested sons of god and the son of man ministry and all these key phrases but i believe we're walking in step with those promises that were promised to come but now there's something different in the air now there's a season of victory that we can see that that we're just over the next hill i believe there's there's victory there and i think the bride and whole is realizing that this promise is not for another day we're not waiting for something else to come we're not waiting for another revival or another messenger or another age but we are at the final age we have heard the final word we are the final voice in the final age to to finish the work which he started i believe we're all all in agreement there that we're not waiting for something i don't think that we're we're looking ahead for if just this could come i remember growing up in the church as a kid you'd always think ahead well one day this is gonna happen one day there's gonna be a bride's revival or one day and that was so maybe 25 years ago but that time has come and i believe we're walking in the bride's revival i believe this is what what we're seeing today this is the revival of the bride it'll be a short quick work it's promised that it would come and it would activate hearts and there would be uh the the the divine healing restored to the church and the gifts restored to the church and and the word being preached in purity back to the church that's how it restores our hearts back to the faith of our fathers is when the word is restored and so jesus himself had to recognize that he was walking in the perfect will of his father when he was taken up on the mountain and he was tempted by the devil and he was tempted in the three temptations and we could preach a while on that but i think we probably all know know where that that that that ended up it is also written it is also written so he knew that the only way he could defeat him was by the word so that we may use that as an example of how we defeat him is by the word and so jesus taken up there on the mountain he he recognizes that he's walking in the perfect step of the will of god and he walks immediately down to the temple he has the scribe he hat takes this the scribes from the from the preacher and he opens up to the book of isaiah and he finds himself where he's at currently in the word now he could have turned to psalms and he could have read my bones they stare at me that's that's him but that's not where he was at that time so he could have identified himself in the word but he had to identify himself in the exact day that he was walking in so he opens the scripture and he shows this is where i'm at right now this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears this day and so he closes the book he hands it back to him but then again we find that book open in the book of revelations right it's in the hand of the angel and it's an open book it's no longer closed and we know that he didn't finish that entire scripture if you go back to isaiah 61 as where he was reading from the spirit of the lord god is upon me because the lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings into the meek he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound to proclaim the acceptable year of the lord and the day of vengeance of our god to comfort all that mourn now i i think as a child i remember reading the rest of that scripture well he didn't finish it because that's a scary scripture the vengeance of the day of our god but actually if you take that word vengeance back in the greek it means vindicated it it translates right back to vindicated and if you take vindicated back and look it up in the dictionary it means to set free so he's following the same context to set free them that are bound that's what the word does it's not to it's not to establish one man over people or or to build a kingdom over here or to build it a a creed over there but it's to set free them that are bound you know in the scripture here he talks about uh uh bringing liberty to them that are bruised you know a lot of times in church we can we can get bruised a lot of times in ministry we can get bruised you can get hurt as just a church member going to church and get bruised no doubt if we've been if we've been in church any amount of time we wouldn't have to pass the mic to ask that everybody in here has been hurt at some point we've been we've been damaged we've been we've been we've been sore we've been afraid we've been and you know what's what's funny about a bruise is if you get a bruise on you know i've had a bruise in my rib and and just by by human nature you begin to protect that and and you'll walk and you'll walk kind of different and you you you have your arm over that bruise because it hurts and it may be the ruse has disappeared for months and months and maybe years but you still protect that you know and so we've built up a complex maybe around that bruise that we've suffered and it was a real hurt and it was a real thing and you know but it's changed the way that we walk it's changed the way that we enter into service it's changed the way that we that we receive from the lord and we begin to cover ourselves where we've been bruised but this day this scripture is fulfilled that he set liberty to them that are bruised that we can walk freely that we don't have to protect that we don't have to guard ourselves but this word is a pure word that we know exactly where we're walking step in step with this word we're not guessing we're not we're not we're not speculating but we know exactly what his word said and we're walking in perfect step with it he's come to set at liberty them that are bruised i'm thankful for that because i don't have to walk unassured of where i'm going or walk in fear that i might get hurt again or i might be damaged by somebody but i know the word and i know what he wants done with it and i'm walking step in step with what he's promised for it to come to pass this day this scripture is fulfilled brother bran would say first the prophet goes to god and the word comes down and he wrote it in the bible and now that was god's four ordained plan the prophet saw and he wrote it in the word so that the people following would be warned of situations and things to come see now by inspiration that word was spoke by god by inspiration that word was spoken by god the prophet brought it and by inspiration we have to receive it so by inspiration god spoke it by inspiration the prophet received it and by inspiration we have to receive it it's not a a mental conception of it or it's not a theological conception of it but it's by inspiration is the only way we'll understand all that god was important to christ and all that christ was he poured into the church we'll never understand that by an intellectual conception of it but it's by inspiration only this is the plan of god he says and this book is none other than about than the bible and the author of it is not an inventor he's none other than creator himself who promised divine healing he wrote the book he inspired it and it's god's inspired word later down he would say now if if if god who made the bible who wrote the bible the bible is inspired god's word do you believe that do you believe that with all your heart all right it's god's inspired word then if it's god's inspired word then the inspiration of god is here with us to make this word live to prove that he's here surely you can receive him is that right so it's by inspiration he wrote it let me just maybe just slow down a minute here by inspiration he wrote it and so by inspiration he'll reveal it jesus had to find where he was at at that exact moment in time to identify the inspiration of god of that moment this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears so we've got to recognize what day are we walking in what's happening right now in the word of god to identify where we're at in this plan of god i believe that there's more prophecies about this end time bride than there is about any other people that have ever come before about any other pro prophecy that there ever was prophesied about there's been more about this oncoming bride than there ever has been before there's more sure words about us than there ever was before i believe we should be the most assured anchored people it's by inspiration i cannot talk you into it i cannot explain into it i cannot power point you into it but it's by inspiration that you receive this message in this hour this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears it's not for another day another time another people but it's right now in this time we are walking in perfect step with the word so if we receive the word and perfect step in this time then we get all of the benefits that come with it i believe we've lived underneath our privileges for for our entire lives but now we are recognizing we are walking with the word and with the word comes the benefit of the word we should not be walking in depression or anxiety or fear or or or or anxious about tomorrow we should know exactly he holds us in his hand he's holding tomorrow we may not get tomorrow but he's holding it anyway we may we're not promised to walk out of this building but he's holding us anyway we're so sure that we're walking in the perfect plane of god that even if he slay me i'll trust him even if he takes me today i'll trust him we're walking in the planet this day this scripture is fulfilled in our ears not somebody else but our ears we're walking in the perfect plan of god by inspiration when able by inspiration come no beauty but he come in inspiration he had no bible to tell him it was a lamb but god revealed it to him it was a lamb no inspiration to tell him that it wasn't cain said well now reasoning it's a fruit they must have eat apples i'll bring fruits as an offering and jehovah will receive this because it looks better than what that would be so jehovah will receive this and today the people think the same thing but it's got to be by inspiration it's not how well we dress right it's not how well our our our hair matches our tie or our car how shiny it is or our our rims are shined up and god doesn't care lick about any of that he's not worried about how you look or if you're if you've got glasses if you don't got glasses if you're balding if you've got plenty of hair god's not looking at any of that he's looking for the inspiration at that time to catch his word of where we're standing at this hour we've got to recognize we're moving in flow with the word we're in harmony we're in synchronization with the word where there's there's abs and there's flows and there's valleys and there's mountains but you've got to recognize where are we at now in this plan of god we're not looking for another another source we're not looking for another wave i'm not i'm not looking for a plan b or a way out or somewhere else to run to but i found my refuge i found where my hope is placed i found that mighty tower that i can run into and be saved i found that plan of god that i can walk step in step with it's by this vindicated word of the hour that we recognize we are walking in step with the word we're not looking for something else we found the main source remember brother branham would talk to demas shakuri and back in the 60s and he would tell them there's oil out there in kentucky and they would say oh well where where is it exactly say well it's right there but i'm not going to tell you exactly where it's at because it's not for commercial use this gift is not so you can benefit yourself and and raise a kingdom unto yourself and and so they packed up by the inspiration of the prophet and they they packed up all their equipment and he got some business partners and he goes out to kentucky and he drills down and he hits oil he said oh the prophet was right look we've hit oil but brother branham said they only tapped into a small reserve they didn't hit the main source he said they began to drill oil wells all over that place and they got oil and they were making money and then their their their motive and objective became a reality and they began to steer off of the word they began to build kingdoms unto themselves and argue over money or argue over control and brother bam said those little tributaries that they had hit began to to run out you see they were pulling from one another those tributaries and it's just like a man getting close to the word he's getting close around this message but he taps in he gets a little oil a little gifts in the church a little a little healing takes place maybe a gift of knowledge or a gift to preach and he'll tap in close to that word but eventually that oil will run out because he's not tapped into the main source but brother bam says so that the prophecy would be true not more than a hundred yards from where they originally drilled another company came along later and drilled right there and they struck the main vein you see it's right there we're just men have for years have been dancing around the main source they wanna they drill into it they get a little life coming out and then they begin to denominate amongst themselves they begin to they denominate and you build a kingdom unto themselves but they're right next to the main vein and that main vein begins to draw its oil back into it and that that that temporary well will run dry that well drilled over here and that well drilled over there you see it had life it had the real oil at one time but it began to run dry but that main vein will never run dry brother brahms said that back in that day he said it would produce 1100 barrels of oil in a half a day i like that because if even if the 11th hour worker can come into this door he can tap into that main vein he can receive the same benefits that those of us have been tapped into in our whole life the same benefits 1100 barrels a day tapped into that main source we're not looking for anything else this oil is not running out i can't speak for others that have tapped into a temporary source that and then we find ourselves at the gate and they're asking me for oil but you've got to be tapped into the main vein already you've got to have the source already we're not looking for another source we found the main source we found the main vein of inspiration we're not looking outside this word this is where our hope comes from the devil would like to tell you to tap into this ism and tap into that schism but this is the main vein if it doesn't line up with the word i don't want it it might be close to it it might have a little life in it it might show signs but the only the main vein will have oil when the time comes we must know where our roots are tapped we've got to be tapped into the message of the hour if we're not we'll run dry if we're at some man and he might be proclaiming to preach the message but if we're tapped into a man he'll run dry we've got to be in the word we've got to be tapped into the only sure thing to know that this is the day we're living in all other things will run dry but only this main source will continue to have life but sometimes that oil gets clogged up with our own selves we might be tapped into the main vein and we might have our own our own log of tradition in the way we've got to blow it out brother ram says you did you drill a hole in the stump and you put a piece of dynamite in there and you blow it out that's how you get that logger tradition let the oil flow he said we call that prospecting you've got to dig it out so that that main vein can flow through sometimes we wonder well what do i have to do with this if the words already flowing and the the promises are already coming and i just don't seem to be in flow with it what do i do you've got to blow the logs of tradition out of your life just blow it out well i just don't act that way or i don't well maybe you should worship differently than you've ever worshipped before maybe you should do something that you've never done before for the lord maybe you should reach out in another realm that you've never reached out for me maybe you should pray that prayer that you've never prayed before and watch the lord move and activate when you blow that log out of your way the oil's there we've just got to clear it out but the ramp said bore those holes in the ground dig them out set dynamite blow it down keep on blowing shafts going down till we find it till we find the main vein and tonight we're trying to take the word of god and use it by the power of the holy spirit to blow all the indifference and doubts away from us all those little light fluffy things that just doesn't have any foundation doesn't have any weight in our life we want to blow it all out of the way so we can find this glorious vein that vein is christ to think that brother branham was preaching to a people that were not even there yet he was preaching to an audience of people that were that weren't even on the scene yet just earlier this week a brother sent to a to a a chat pictures of of where brother branham had preached in in kentucky and it was a big amphitheater with rows of metal bleachers and where he had preached there and i was sitting there looking at picture thinking i doubt if any of them got what he was preaching he preached 19 services in a row there i think it was clarksville 19 services in a row there and i doubt if if if just five of them got what he was preaching in fact he said if i could just get five good men we could turn this world upside down nobody got what he was preaching at the time and and then men use that now to say well when he preached the seventh seal he said you don't have to believe it just just live a good christian life you know you'll never understand this but just live a good that was for the people sitting there but he knew that there was a people to come that would understand what he was preaching that would receive what he was preaching that he knew by prophetic utterance that we would receive that word in inspiration in the right time and he would say this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears it was not fulfilled when isaiah i first said it jesus had to identify at the time that it was fulfilled now we are at the time when that prophetic word is being fulfilled through the bribe there will be an understanding of it but abraham says when it fell upon luther it manifested that promise of that hour when it fell upon wesley it manifests the promise of that hour when it falls in this day it manifests the promise of this hour when it falls upon moses it manifests the promise of that hour you see he's he's showing us how the word works in the pattern fell upon noah manifest the promise of that hour when it fell upon jesus it manifests the promise of that hour see it's the holy spirit coming down to quicken make a lie those those people that's foreordained of god to be in the rapture notice that is if he is a true eagle he will understand the message of the hour if he's a true eagle i don't believe it says that this isn't for you and you'll never understand it or it'll always be something that you can't attain but he said if you're a true eagle you will understand the message of what i'm preaching to you this day this scripture will be fulfilled in your ears you will understand it he says in the message paradox so therefore we know that luther could not get it wesley and so forth and reformers knox finney calvin and down so forth they did not get it all but what they had was the gospel truth but now somebody say now in the last days we are given the understanding by the word that we are going to understand it now somebody say now we are given the understanding by the word that we will understand what the prophet was preaching to the elect i say that's me i say amen to every word of god i say i'm walking in step with the message [Music] this is our day this day this scripture is fulfilled amen in calvin's ears in finney's ears no in your ears this day we're inspired by the presence that the word is in this hour we know the word we're inspired to walk in it in season in time in pace don't get ahead of it don't get behind it walk in pace with the word hallelujah i don't wanna drop your brand new mic praise the lord we were so in tune with it this harmony is now to exist between the groom and his bride he shows her his word of life she receives it i like that line she receives it she never doubts it therefore nothing can harm her not even death for if the seed be planted the water will raise it up again here is the secret of this the word is in the bride as it was in mary i like that little parentheses there because it gives us an action of what we've got to do the word is in the bride as it was in mary and what did mary do when the angel said this day the scriptures fulfilled she said beat unto me according to thy word be it unto me this day i'll receive that promise be it unto me we've got to have the faith like that to recognize whose presence are we in who's come in the room today who is what we've invited him to come and we're surprised when he's here we've got to recognize we're in the presence of the one who can change our circumstance we're in the presence of the one who can break our cycle who can bring healing to the body who can bring that that prodigal back home we're in the presence of the one who can activate the seed inside of us i say be it unto me according to that promises this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears we've got a part to play we say be it unto me the bride has the mind of christ for she knows what he wants done with the word we know what he wants done with the word we've sat here service after service we've been preached to we've studied at home we've listened to tapes in the car we know what he wants done with the word we've got to do it we've got to take what we know and apply it to action to put it into action god's plan moving through a bride moving through lips moving through feet moving through hands manifested sons of god that's what the plan of god is she knows what he wants done she performs the command of the word in his name i like this right here why for she has thus saith the lord i was preaching this one time this quote a man came up to me said well that's brother vale's book i said well you'll find the same exact quote in spoken word as the original seed which brother ran him utter with his own voice and he said she has thus saith the lord the power is in the bride it's no longer in one man or back 65 years ago the power is in the bride to use it to make manifest the works of god in this age that's why we believe what we believe it's not just a set of rules or conduct or a way to live a life but the power of the almighty god is in his bride somebody say it's in me it's in me why would god take the time to come down and manifest himself into vessels if we were just going to sit there and let that oil idle there but he came down and he anointed us with power so that we might perform the command of the word if they lay their hands on the stick [Applause] if they say unto this mountain and do not doubt in their heart if they take me out my word it shall be done unto them the power is laying in the bride in this hour this scripture is fulfilled not waiting for something not waiting for a big man to come back it's already in the bride [Applause] then the word is quickened by the spirit and it comes to pass like a seed that is planted in water that comes to full harvest serving its purpose aren't you glad to know you got a purpose that's the biggest lie of the devil i've ever heard that you don't have a purpose you know we we sit through i've been through a few meetings this year and sat through a few prayer lines and i can tell you most of our young people struggle with if they have a purpose what a lie from the devil that god would come and manifest himself and open himself unto a people and then the devil would get in there and say you don't have a purpose you have a greater purpose than anyone that's ever walked this earth you are the final voice to the final age you are the one that gets to kick them in the lake of fire if the young people want to know what their purpose is they are the ones that bind him with the chain of circumstance to say you have no room to work here any longer i'm not your slave but i know where i'm going i'm walking in step with the word you may never hold a microphone in your hand that doesn't matter you've got to walk in step with the word and bind satan in his own territory but the man said we bind him by not giving him any room to work with let the holy ghost do the work tap into the main vein serving its purpose those in the bride do only his will no one can make them do otherwise they have thus saith the lord or they keep still they know that it has to be god in them doing the works god in them doing the works that's what we're witnessing we're not witnessing a decrease this message is not weak we're not backed up in a corner if i could just sit down with you i can keep you for hours just telling you of the testimonies from this year on i've seen more miraculous this year than i have in my entire life put together god is on the move he's doing something he's making a way for something he's activating our faith for something you're pastors in mexico i was in mexico here a few weeks ago and the lord came down in a supernatural way i could take the time to tell you but we'll get to talk about it over there we'll have ten thousand years to cover just one trip but the lord was so mighty in battle there i saw i saw the instant healed which is amazing to see a thyroid gland just decrease and the symptoms disappear i saw a hernia just just go back inside somebody's body i i saw i saw the this crippled old man just get up and shout and run around the church and all that's amazing but what's what's more what's more magnificent to me is the spiritual healing that god will do you know a doctor might come in and repair a hernia a doctor might come in and give you a good injection of antibiotics and one who is sick might get up and walk but when the lord comes in and begins to heal bruised hearts when he begins to heal those broken parts those those places where a doctor can't touch a a minister can't touch a counseling can't touch certainly a psychologist can't touch when the lord comes in and begins to to administer to those needs it begins to rewire a heart and you see a cold stony heart begin to get adjusted to the word of god and he begins to come in and just change the situation that's a supernatural work to me when i see the lord moving in action and taking someone who is just a regular church member sitting there their whole life and making them on fire for god like they've never known him before to me that's this scripture being fulfilled in our ears and it's only by the word it's him in them doing the works tell me what man's hands are clean enough to lay on the sick that they might be healed you won't find one tell me what man is clean enough that he could go into counseling and counsel someone and unlock that spirit out you won't find one but it's christ in them doing the works that's why when we find a god-led man that allows christ to work through him we can we can march step and step with that man we can put shoulder to shoulder with that it's christ in him doing the works it's christ and your mama doing the works it's christ in your daddy doing the works it's christ in you doing the works that's why we can walk in this word he's fulfilling his own word he did not complete all his work while in his earthly ministry so now he works in and through the bride it's a powerful quote when you get ty really go back and read this he did not complete his works while he was here on earth so now his reputation his name everything that he is all of his power all of his strength is resting on the bride it's you it's me we're walking with the word we have thus saith the lord or we keep still by his word it's him and us doing the work he works through his bride she knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must now do but he will now somebody say now he will now fulfill through the bride that work which he left for this specific time don't tell me that you don't have a purpose to fulfill he left it all resting on our shoulders him in us resting on our shoulders to fulfill that which he left for this age this specific time tell me what other what other generation was left to have a body change tell me what other generation was left to get so quickened by the word that they would change the very elements of their mortal body where they become so quickened by the word that they would get caught up in two heavenly places in christ jesus into another dimension tell me what generation was left with that commission you have a greater purpose in your life [Applause] it's us this commission is for you it's for those that believe in this day this scripture is fulfilled and there are some standing here which shall not taste of death for they will be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye caught up by what the commission of the word we have thus saith the lord there will be a body change now tell me what would get the bride so hot in the word that she would actually take a body change there would have to be a short quick work ahead of that there would have to be the miraculous in the faith building and and just another level of anointing i don't know about you but i think we're experiencing another level of anointing in this hour if you're where you were five years ago you better find the lord today you've got to continue in step with the word we're in perfect harmony the bride and the bridegroom walking step in step hand in hand he says the time is at hand the time was not previously at hand and the wisdom and economy of of god in this mighty revelation could not come forth thus we immediately learned the revelation of god for each age can come in that age only and at a specific time look at the history of israel the revelation of god to moses came only at a specific time of history and even more specifically it came as the people cried unto god jesus himself came at the fullness of time he being the complete revelation of the godhead and in this age somebody say this age the revelation of god will come in its due time it will not falter neither will it be premature think on this and heed it well for we are in the end time today i don't think you have to wonder if we're in the end time we are in the end time today we see so many of the prophecies coming to pass in the king of the north on the move and wars and rumors of wars and pestilence in the land and and and and lovers of them own cells naked wretched blind and knoweth it not murders and suicides at an all-time high we see that we're at the end time so if all of the negative is coming to pass if all that all of those prophecies about that world is coming to pass how about our prophecy as the bride of god that she'll grow stronger that she'll get deeper as she'll get higher and she'll get more in love with him than she was yesterday that's our promise [Applause] i keep falling in love with him why we can't help it he's pulling us he's drawing us higher there's something in us that he's anchored to and he's drawing us through another plane even when we don't feel like it he's drawing us to another plane even when we don't realize that he's drawing us to another plane even we don't see the changes he's drawing us to another plane he's raising us up in faith for what the final capstone ministry his reputation is resting on this bride to think that god i'm in construction when i put my name on the project i think about every detail of that project because my name is on the permit i'm responsible if that project fails i'm responsible if it looks like garbage i'm responsible for it my name's on the project you know sometimes we'll go we'll go to a project and we'll look at it we'll say no this house is it's got shaky foundation and the first thing we check is the foundation we'll look around that house and think no it's it's not real you know it's bulging here and you've got you've got some falling here and the walls going out here and they must not laid the foundation right or it's just too old or it's just been sitting here too long and we you know we end up just walking away from the project no it's not worth taking on we'll just we'll just start over on something new but i think god that's not how he looks at a project god specializes in broken things god specializes in broken people and broken foundations and where we've been heard along the way god specializes he's the repair clinic he can fix the foundation he can fix where we're where we've been where we've been heard or ever been pulled apart or maybe there was too much weight put on us at some time he can fix that god does not walk away from a project thank god he doesn't look at something and think oh it's too far gone but my god specializes in things not impossible even when i didn't feel it he's working even when i didn't see it he's working even when i couldn't i couldn't feel it in my body he never stopped working he took on the project i'd say i can't speak with you but i thank god he took on my project where i had france excuse me where i had failures where i had inconsistencies he took on the project he said i'll make a beautiful thing out of that i'll take that broken thing and i'll make it beautiful i'll make it exalt my name i'll make it lift up praises i'll make it lift me up on high i'll make it such a beautiful thing that it'll even take a rapture with me to think that god took us in our inabilities oh my to think how many times we let him down how many times we failed and we made a promise and the next day we went back on it how we see we've commissioned we're going to do this or we're not going to do that ever again and we walk and the next day we're out in the same thing god still loved us anyway he said i'm not giving up on you i can fix this project i can take this broken vessel and i can repair it i can take this broken vessel and i can i can seal up the wounds and i can seal up the cracks and i can fill it with my anointed oil that's what god's doing in this hour he's not taking the theologian and the high call he's taking the broken vessels and he's making a paradox out of them by raising them higher than they ever imagined they could go that's my god it wouldn't be that big of a deal for god to take a monk that's lived his whole life in a cave and say yeah you know what he's not made these mistakes but that's not how god operates god takes a sinner saved by grace and raises him to a plane above any other that's my god he doesn't care about your mistakes his grace covered that he doesn't care about your faults his own blood paid for that he doesn't care about where you slipped up yesterday he already atoned for that my god specializes in the broken things that's what he's building his kingdom out of all those stones that were rejected that's what he's building his kingdom out of he's not building him out of just perfect synagogues somewhere men have tried that god is building his kingdom on stones rejected by the rest of the world never been so sure of god's grace in my life to think where i came from if he never did another thing for me oh he'd have done more than i could ever ask or imagine he'd done more than i could ever fathom if he never did another thing for me he's already done so much but i don't believe he's done with his bride i don't believe he called and anointed us and elected us and placed us so that we could just walk a okay christian life i believe he called us for a purpose i believe he anointed us for battle i believe he called us to go into victory you know there was one time in the bible a man who recognized the presence of of jehovah around him and he had made a promise to his men he said this day we'll kill every one of them and the sun began to fall and the sun began to set and you might be thinking that god's running out of time to perform your miracle but you just got to have the faith of joshua you just got to have the faith in the eyes that joshua had to say he's not giving up on me lord we need some help you know what the lord did he caused great stones the bible says to rain down from heaven and those great stones of fire began to fall upon those giants and those stones killed more giants than joshua and all of his men put together if you're backed in the corner maybe just call out to the lord say lord i need some help today i need some help in this situation and the lord caused great stones to fall now those stones were created to kill giants those stones were made to slay giants [Applause] and they fell and they and they killed the giants before them and we know the rest of the story joshua then under inspiration was able to say by the power of the word son stand still it's not getting too dark for your miracle that prodigal's not too far gone you're not running out of time you just got to have the faith of joshua and say son stand still in the name of christ anointed by his presence to walk in step with the word to walk in perfect time now whether god orchestrated the sun to stop at that point in time i don't know but by faith joshua spoke it and it came to pass now we don't need the sun to stand still we don't need squirrels but by faith what do you have need of today [Applause] to recognize where we are in this word this day this scripture joshua could have said those words out of his mouth this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears look at the sun standing still and joshua finishes the job that day and then later years later there will come another giant into the land trying to rob the people of god of their victory and david recalls and remembers what the lord did for joshua he said somewhere in this valley there are stones that were created to kill giants and he begins to walk along that stream and he begins to find some mildly looking stones some stones that maybe nobody else would pick and he begins to bed down and pick those stones up and put him in his satchel these stones these were created for a purpose this stone right here was created for a purpose i believe it's killed a giant before takes that stone and remember goliath prophesied how he would die but watch how the watch how the lord uses it and david do we know the story [Music] that stone had already killed some giants before that was a heavenly stone it went so fast i don't know if it went and circled the earth and came back around but you think that a stone a stone hitting a giant would knock him back but the bible says that goliath fell on his face the devil will always bow before the word the devil will always be on his face before the living god he can't help it it's already written in the word and this day this scripture is fulfilled he'll fall on his face before the word it is also written it is also written i don't know what it took to do it that stone was created to kill giants brother branham picks that up later in the beginning of the message paradox he says i got a new bible today he says there was there's three bookmarks in it you know these little tassel things he said there's two of those in there said the first one when i opened it was on the first building of the temple the second one was on the second building of the temple and then my wife had put a bookmark in it i opened it to it it was on mark 11 22. have faith in god if you say unto this mountain and do not doubt in your heart it shall be removed what is he saying the third building of the temple is upon confession of the mouth he says those great stones are confessions that's how they built the temple by those great stones you can take the time to go research it those great stones are a confession of faith so let me say to you that you're not just an average stone sitting here this morning you're not just an average rock sitting here this morning but you were created to kill giants your purpose in life is to slay giants god caused you to come down from glory to kill a giant he's going to cause you to set on fire to kill a giant those great confessions be thou removed now i don't know what you have in your life but if you got anxiety say be thou removed you got depression in your life say be thou removed you got fear in your life be thou removed you got secret sin be thou removed you got diabetes be now removed last saturday night i watched somebody walk through a prayer line who was instantly healed of diabetes be thou removed and do not doubt in your heart and it shall be given unto you be thou removed by faith walking in the word this day is this scripture fulfilled that third temple is built in the manifested lives of sons and daughters of god upon their confessions the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth speak it and move forward be thou removed thou shine in my land be thou removed you giant of sickness be thou removed maybe sometimes we can't even put a finger on it we've just been walking it a little bit down a little bit upset a little bit afraid a little bit just it's seeming like we're not walking in total victory there's a giant right there be thou removed in the name of the lord jesus christ brother branham had a burden on him that he couldn't quite explain he just seemed like he lost his zeal for the people but they're just a simple prayer they are just honoring a promise he had given to god god said you remembered your promise and now i'll remember mine be thou removed and the burden was gone and the burden was lifted you see how quick god can activate that inside of you the fate to recognize you're walking in perfect step with the word we know what he wants done with it we've just got to put it into action speak it by the power of the lips it's time to put it in your mouth put it in your mouth and speak it upon the confession of my god i say be thou removed be cast into the sea thou thou demon of doubt be thou removed and do not doubt in your heart and it shall be given unto you to recognize whose presence you're in you say well i'm a sinner but if you'll just let me see you lord jesus manifest this word that we're talking about i know that's how job seen you i know that's how abraham saw you i know that's how the rest of them saw you because it was your promised word being vindicated i've heard all kinds of things and gimmicks and everything but i understand somebody say understand that there's a last day message in the land that was spoke by an angel on the river in 1933 i heard of the healing services and i know when that takes place i can't stay in this old rut anymore we got to get out of the rut sometimes we just got to get up out of that you know when you're riding on the side of the road and you get stuck in some of those those semi truck ruts you just got to break out of those sometimes and sometimes as believers we get stuck in the same old rut i say it's time to pull yourself out of the rut we are walking in victory we're not defeated we're not discouraged we're not afraid we're not a retreat we're walking in total victory with the word going before us it's a promise of the hour this day is this scripture fulfilled it's got to be revealed unto us when that anointing comes in we've got to recognize who's in our midst we've got to recognize it's not just a funny feeling it's not just an emotion who is it that's in our prayer closet who is it that comes in this building every sunday and thursday who is it that walks with us when we're out in the world who is it that protected our car who is it that protected us when we're in harm's way we've got to recognize the anointing if we could ever realize the anointing that we're in contact with our lives would never be the same jacob knew that there was an israel inside of him he knew there was somebody else inside of him he knew that this isn't me supplanter is not my testimony i don't want to be this the rest of my life there's something else inside of me but when that anointing came when he recognized whose presence he was in he said i'll not let you go until you bless me i'll not let you go until i get my blessing [Applause] how many times has the lord walked into those doors and we failed to recognize his presence and we've we thought about some other thing and thought about this and then we find ourselves in the middle of week why hasn't god answered me where is god now he said i was just with you and you failed to hold on to my anointing you failed to hold on to that presence that i brought in that room i sent my angel in there you felt the brush of his wing you've got to hold on to that anointing that's where your new name is when you get a hold of that anointing you're no longer the birth name you were born with you're mrs jesus christ you've come in contact with a name-changing anointing that will change your whole outlook on life struggle struggles yes troubles yes trials absolutely but your perception is it's totally different than before you came in contact with that anointing he can't lose you he can't forsake you you know when you've never met the lord you could say those words but you don't really mean them but when you've come in contact with the lord he can't lose me he can't forsake me we're in love we we met each other we came in contact that one that i got a hold of jacob didn't just forget about that the next day no he walked with the limp the rest of his life but he was so desperate to get a hold of that anointing he said you'll find a pile of bones here if you don't give it to me now that's how desperate we've got to be to get into this plan of god you'll find a pile of bones here i've got to have it i've got to walk in total victory and a new name is laying there there's an israel in you there's an israel inside of you you may not realize that you may have already covered the revelation of it but there's a new name inside of you that the world can't speak it they don't know it they don't see it they'll never understand it but you know you were called to a higher place than where you've been living your whole life there's something greater but when the anointing comes in don't let it go don't miss it don't miss that anointing i was preaching on this subject a little bit on this subject in australia a few months ago there was a young man in that service who was running the audio he had come from i think tennessee he's an old tennessee boy and moved up to canada running from the lord and then somehow he ended up in australia still running from the lord he meets a girl who's a backslid girl in a message church they get together they start going to the church and he's get back in step with the word back in step with the word and they're they're doing on their all for that church and giving their all to that youth camp we were at she's just administrating the services you know as far as the paperwork and the spreadsheets and he's running the sound i said god bless this couple for being so dedicated to serving the lord but at the end of that service i closed and i began to walk out the door and he got off the audio and came down and he was walking my direction i thought maybe he's going to ask me if i want a water or maybe he's going to ask me if i need anything and as he got closer to me he began to tremble and i recognized he's not coming to ask me he's not coming to ask me if i want to water he's coming to ask me for water and we got in contact with each other he said i don't have what you have i've got to have what you have he said while the anointing of god is here i've got to have what you have you know friends i didn't tell him that he had to crawl on his knees up to the front of the church i said as peter said silver and gold have i none but that which i have i give unto you in the name of christ don't tell me that god's not having new births take place i watched one happen right in front of my eyes that boy is totally different he's a hundred percent different in so much so that his wife didn't know what to do with him but then four days later the lord caught up with her and the same thing happened to her god's doing something in this hour he's changing hearts in this hour just since then that was about two months ago since then the boy's been called to preach he might be the first evangelist to ever operate in australia don't tell me that god isn't doing something he's mindful of your situation but when that anointing comes in don't let it go until he blesses you now remember it's not a man it's not this big preacher it's the anointing of god it's recognizing whose presence you're in friends i'm all in favor of receiving it by the preaching of the word i i've heard testimonies just of last week of people receiving the holy ghost and healing by the preaching of the word but i'm also in favor of prayer lines and laying on of hands and and and going to to nighttime prayer times and we're called out at 3 in the morning i've seen the lord do miraculous there too don't put god in a box but when that anointing comes whether it's through the preaching whether it's through the prayer whether it's the laying on of hands whether it's through a word of prophecy don't miss the anointing when it comes that's where your victory is it's under that presence but the man will say i labor to stay under this anointing to see where the message is today that's an exact quote to see where the message is today this day this message is fulfilled in your ears but we've got a labor to stand under that anointing it's hard to stay under that anointing it shaves us it takes away from us it empties us out it checks every thought it checks every move it's hard to labor to stay under there but it's where our victory is that's where our promises lay that's how we find it the man would say the anointing's here i think over thousands of times he would say the anointing was there and the light struck the lens i don't believe he was just talking about a picture that somebody took i believe the anointing is here and the light has struck the lens a lens is a piece of glass or other transparent substance that is used to form an image of an object by focusing the rays of light from that object i don't want to over complicate it you're here to reflect the image of christ i believe the anointing is here and it has struck the lens we're here to magnify what the lord is doing we're here to magnify what he's doing in our day in this hour not days gone by off you could have been here 30 years ago or 60 years ago or 2 000 years ago but he right now today christ is living in lives jesus is moving in situations he's healing he's bringing back he's restoring there in that meeting in mexico yet another prodigal runs to the front and gives his heart to the lord that's three in the last year i've seen just under where i've been associated with it's the time for it it's the season of it he's moving mountains be thou removed listen for the change in the anointing remember the man would talk about the symphony and we say he's the great conductor and he's conducting that symphony and you might just get one note you might just get that one symbol clap or that one horn blow but listen for your change listen for that anointing to come through the conductor is conducting we've got to stay in tune we know what he wants done with the word we've got the sheet music in our hand we've got to read until we see it's my note this is my section the conductor's coming my way there he is there he is the anointing has come we've got to recognize it's our time we're not born in the wrong age who weren't born in the wrong season we were born for this season this age to bring to manifestation the promises that god gave us it's already in us to overcome you may not feel like it sometimes you may not have looked in the mirror this morning i thought i'm an overcomer by the bed you probably look in the mirror and think i'm an overcomer this morning maybe you did i know i didn't i didn't even look in the mirror but it's already in you to overcome and when that anointing comes through that's what activates it when that anointing comes through that's what sets that gene seed brother and we say so we have these times what time do we start 11. so we have these times the symphonies of the symphony of god's word that's the whole drama changes you are you who are interested how many is interested listen for that change you know it's getting close you hear the way the drums are beating amen want something to happen you know this is a change see it's going to break out into a burst in a few minutes and you're watching for it you can tell the way the drums are timing oh god if you can hear the drums of the finish now if you can hear the echo of the music of the heavenly word singing itself out it shall come to pass in the last days the symphony of god's great drama that he's playing it changes him his symphony at the junction the composer and those who are interested listen for the change are you interested this is eternity are you interested listen for the change we're out of change a junction of time but you're you already have what it takes to hear the change you don't need a musical ear you need to have his ear you don't need to have perfect pitch you need to be in tune with the word and the change is coming we feel the change in the air there's an atmosphere the inspiration the anointing it's changing the waters are troubled the timing is is it's a specific time for a specific burden but we have what it takes to overcome in the darkest of all ages i think one of the greatest the greatest lies that the devil has told the bride is you're not gonna make it you don't have what it takes you're not going to be there should the great the great trumpet sound it'll pass by everybody else but not you well you know he's telling your neighbor the same thing you know he's telling the preacher the same thing you know he's telling the guy in the back he's telling the deacon the same thing he's telling the song leader the same thing he's telling your mama the same thing he's a lion devil and he would like to get you to think that you're not gonna make it but we have a more sure word of prophecy in this hour that you've already made it guns already saw you walking in perfect victory by a prophet's vision he saw a bride without spot or wrinkle and she was walking in step with the word [Music] not building a kingdom unto herself she was saying onward christian soldier marching as to war we are not divided all one body are we he also saw your mistakes and that bride started to get out loud and a prophet through a vision would say get back in line and the bride responded he saw where you slipped up and the bride responded and got back in line with the word [Applause] satan can't stop this satan can't kill this he can't destroy it he can't stop this move of god the movie is already on for the bride we are not stopping we are not slowing down until we reach complete and total victory by the changing of our bodies that's why we believe what we believe [Applause] it's already there that's right trying to cut them down and bring them to a spot when the great capstone comes the ministry that's in the church and the capstone will just come right straight together like a magnet they will just seal right together oh god help us to have it'll be there don't worry this exact quote don't worry it'll be there he said it would be there so let's just fit ourselves to meet that cornerstone let us love and project our lives in christ and be sincere and stay with the word until he comes and we just fit right in there like a glove over the hand like that with him oh that's the church that god is waiting for are we just blessed to be the church that god is waiting for don't worry if you have a fridge take that and print it out it'll be there don't worry it'll be there when that lying devil comes to tell you always say everybody's going to get it but you don't worry it'll be there when the time comes it'll be there you want another one for a reference jesus said say to this mountain and you've heard and about that time had taken place that's the ministry that we're entering into we're way up the road now soon the coming of the lord jesus and we've got to have rapturing faith everybody in agreement we've got to have rapturing faith in a church that can be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye to go out or will not go now what if i just ended that quote right there you might leave with a question but the very next line he says but don't worry it'll be there it'll be there and when the power of the church rises it'll bring its brethren the power of the church it will bring the brethren from here it will bring other brethren there will be a general resurrection and oh how we're looking forward to it [Applause] don't worry church it'll be there when you're up against the wall and the devil's got you backed up and you don't know where you stand it'll be there he already predestinated the resources for victory inside you you can't fail he can't lose you he can't forget about you he can't forsake you he can't take back his word he's already put it in you recognize the change in the anointing this is another season we're living in this is another time another age i'm not laodicean anymore i've come into another age i've come out of that that old starchy lukewarm church going quote knowing scripture quoting i'm coming to another age where there's life and where that life is there is where liberty is we're on a higher plane it'll be there friends but the brandon didn't he he said well and and the devil began to torment him and say well you said that squirrel would be on the other side of that log what if it's not there and he said it'll be there when you get up against that trial it'll be there when it's just you by yourself it'll be there when you're not sure if you have the power to overcome it will be there it's a promise it's a prophetic word recognize the anointing that we're under it will be there should he call today it'll be there i don't know how fast your life's got to change to get there but it will be there it's a promise not a guess it's not an estimation you've already been given what it takes to receive it you were predestinated to receive this message in this age that's a promise it'll be there predestinated resources but under inspiration that's when they come to life inspired in his presence whose presence are we in if the music players would come inspired in his presence to recognize a change there's a change in the symphony coming yeah i hear the the chord is building up it's not ending on a on an end chord it's building up there's a change coming the conductor's moving your time your time your time your time he's moving he's changing what is it for we've got to recognize as jacob recognized yeah this anointing will change my name this anointing just as john recognized under that annoying anointing on the on the isle of patmos i'm just john but then under that anointing under the open book he saw that he wasn't just john but his name had already been written on another book there was another name written there and i john under that anointing shouted so loud i don't care if you shout i don't care if you're quiet you've got to recognize your name is already on the book what you have needed to overcome is already inside you it's predestinated inside you it's a predestinated resource to recognize the word and walk step in step with it now we know what he wants done with the word we've got to walk with it we've got to move with it we've got to take the word as it were hand in hand eat the book yeah we've got to eat the book we've got to absorb it we've got to become it it's not theology it's not by mind it's not by understanding it's not by how much i can scour over these things it's by revelation i'm gonna make it i wish i could sing i've seen that song i'm gonna make it he already said i would you know one time in the bible there was a lady who had the same the same torments that you have by circumstance she was put in a bad situation in life she had she had forsaken her friends her friends have forsaken her they left her alone her parents had forsaken her and there she was all alone until she met someone who told her she had value watch the anointing that's in here until she recognized who she was talking to nobody thought she was of any value before she prostituted her body man would spit on her step on her she was the the worst in civilization but then one day she came in contact with somebody and she much like you thought there's no way i'll ever be worthy enough to walk with him there's no way i'll ever be worthy enough to to sit with him at his table but something inside of her knew there's an israel in me the whole time she was out insane the whole time she was she was out in the world she knew there's an israel inside of me if i could just labor under that anointing like just labor he might reject me but i've got to try i've got to try to get there we know the story she spent all of her savings on a box with oil you think about how she walked through that room where they all knew who she was they all knew oh my sometimes us as church people somebody walks in the church and we think oh we know who she is we know what that brother's done see she's dragging that chain of sin of condemnation under that anointing you think the living word was sitting in that room and she was a believer she could feel that coming on her she could feel that oh look at that shekinah glory all around if i could just get to them i hope they don't stop me i hope they don't stop me if she's dragging her chain and as she gets closer that chain begins to get a little lighter it begins to get a little bit more off her shoulder she's pulling it a little less by the time she can get to him all she can think about is washing his feet you think what is this what is this crazy woman doing lebron would say if you do because the holy spirit can inspire it to you but if the soul isn't right with god as as we've been through it's no good anyhow remember false anointing ones will rise in the last days not false jesus says false christs and we'll deceive the very elected if it were possible but notice she had a service to do for him remember she's not a preacher she's not a prophet she's not a song leader she's she's got a service to do for him she had heard of him but now she's seen him with her eyes she had a service to do and she had nothing to do it with well i felt like that so many times in my life i want to do something for the lord but i've got nothing to do it with so she rushed forward anyhow to do the service and watch this god furnished the water and the towels to wash his feet she had heard of a living god all her life but now she's seen him with her eyes she knew it was him and inspiration struck her and said this is the messenger he needed a service and she had nothing to serve him by but his feet was dirty so she rushed forward anyhow to do him a service because she was inspired to do it she went forward to serve him because inspiration struck struck her and that was the hour that was the messenger that was the messiah who was to heal and she believed it and he needed a service done to him and she went forward without anything showing that she could do it she just went upon her inspiration and god broke up the fountains of the tear glands in her eyes the same eyes that had the same ears that had heard and the eyes that had seen broke up with joy god given long hair and with them tears flowing down god furnished her towels with her here with her hair and with her tears she served his needs the need of the living god she had heard about it but now she's seen him she could do him a service we may not have a some great gift or some supernatural ability but don't worry what you have need of is already in there what you have need of to do a service is already laying within sight of you but under the right inspiration under the right anointing in the right time it will come to life recognize what anointing you're under we could just bow our hearts this morning oh jesus how we love you truly god there's none like you lord amen father we have no gifts to bring of our own and father no beauty that you desire us or father no no treasures of this earth that we could bring that would mean anything lord but lord what we have you gave us father lord you gave it to us for a purpose this revelation of the word of the hour you didn't just give it to us so we could argue about or pick her about it or reason about it but lord you gave it to us that that we might wash our feet with it lord father we exalt your name we praise you father lord truly there's none like you lord your name is above every other lord oh god there's no one like you oh jesus when no one thought we were worthy you thought we were worth it when no one thought we were able to do anything lord you saw away oh god when we were backed in a corner it looked like there was no way out you made a way for us lord oh god we didn't have the words to say your spirit brought inspiration lord father even those times we didn't know what to pray you gave us utterance lord oh god there's truly no one like you father you gave us this word and commissioned us for a purpose in this hour i believe every word that's been written down here father i believe every word that's been spoken by the mouth of a prophet lord lord it was given for a purpose lord i pray that we can put that word into action in our mouths lord that we can speak victory over our situation that we could speak the lord healing over our sickness that we could speak restoration over our family that we could speak restoration over our faith lord that we can speak uh just a tremendous blessing lord pouring out upon our neighbor's life our life lord to come more in contact with you father oh lord i ask lord that your anointing that i feel amongst us now would go and minister to each need lord let the voices of the children of god ring out and say i speak for that need i i speak and confess it with my mouth mountain be thou removed be thou removed in the name of jesus lord i believe that confession is a stone that was made to slay a giant and father has gone forth through a sling of faith just now out of the lips of a believer to say be thou removed giant you'll fall before me today oh god lord for every member of this this church lord i pray that you'd increase their desire lord oh god we know sometimes the lord you just feel you feel like you're going in service but you just it's not by inspiration it's not by faith you're just going but lord i pray that situation would change lord i pray that member this morning lord would feel that lord you you there's victory inside those doors there's promises inside those doors there there's a hope inside that door i've got to get in those doors father i pray that our zeal for the word would be restored oh god maybe if we've gotten cold or indifferent lord i pray that that anointing angel we'd grab hold of it and say i'll not let you go until you bless me i want to be more in love with this word than i was before i want to know it in a greater level than i have before i i don't want to just know it on words on a paper but i want to know it in life oh god may our worship change lord it may be in spirit and truth father oh god how we love you lord amen oh jesus how we worship you father father you know the love that we have for your man

encouraged and just uh strengthened by by what the holy spirit said this morning um i you know how he was talking about how satan lies and lies to us and such and sometimes you know uh he can make us you know lie to us and and make us feel like you know the victory we have in our life is now is not what it is uh but uh you know if you would say interview the devil in the morning say what what what's your purpose for today he says well i'm gonna take say dave and i'm going to do this to him i'm going to do that to him at the end of the day he's not going to be serving the lord he's you know i'm going to take him down and such but at the end of the day that's not what happens you know you might fail and stuff it might all through the day you know you things might uh not go the way you would plan but at the end of the day it's satan that failed he didn't get to uh do what he had planned to do you're still standing for jesus so it's it's satan's the failure you're still the victory so on monday morning you know you can wake up in the morning and say well at the end of the day i'll still be serving the lord satan he has his plans he's going to fail on tuesday on wednesday on thursday all through the all through the week you can just chalk it up you know satan zero dave one day two days three even though it doesn't feel like that in our spirits a lot of times but he was that just it was kind of how you know god was dealing with me but you know he was talking about how satan lies to you and satan lies and he tries to say different things you know there's there's so many things that come up throughout the week that you know it's a battle that we're in but it's already done god's already put it inside of us it and it's just god making it manifest and bringing out in us the purpose that he has already said he's going to do so let's just go before him in prayer and lord just come to you in prayer lord and just i might not have said that exactly how how you brought it to me and such lord i just but lord it's just such a encouragement lord that it's already done lord and how how you brought it out this morning it's it's not it's not something that we're just guessing which way and what's going to happen lord but lord it's already done this is your plan this is your purpose and you are manifesting yourself and your playing through through this pride in this last day you know it's changed from what you you did to what you're doing through your bride now and we just lori just want to surrender lord to what what you're doing we just thank you for the word we thank you for the promises the things you've already sent the things you've already placed inside of us lord we just we just love you lord and we just i just prayed just we'd submit the lord to that lord each and every day lord and just lord not say let satan trip us up and not believe satan what what he's saying lord but just lord just to trust in you lord and keep our eyes focused on you lord because that's where lord our focus should be satan cannot introduce anything to us except evil lord and how he did to even in the garden lord it was just they were already as god's lord they were already new good the only thing you could introduce lord is is evil and that's the only thing he could try to introduce to us lord but i pray that you just lord give us the strength to turn a death here deaf ear to what he is saying lord and just focus on your promises your word and just walk in tune with you lord as i was spoken this morning we love you lord we just thank you for the
