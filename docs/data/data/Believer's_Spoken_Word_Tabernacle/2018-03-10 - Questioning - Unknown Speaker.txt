here with us amen the Lawson's god bless you good to have you here with us man we're good to have so glad to have brother Jeff that he would he and sister Marie that they would make make an exception and come here to be with us and we just so appreciate that so much amen I know that each of you have already heard of concerning with brother John in the passing of his of his father and we just won I know that probably most of you had heard of that and we just want to continue to lift them up as a family in prayer and you know it it just really it struck real close to home last night and my only brother John being here with us but it just really struck real home and knowing that that's just it's daddy and just you know you're it's something about that it's very precious you know and and so we just you know there's a lot of avenues that they they need the doors to open as far as with visas to be able to get there and so forth but you know I know there's nothing that's impossible with the Lord I'm so grateful for that that God is mindful to open doors and and I just so I asked you just to continue to keep them in prayer as well and also I I just I'm sorry I was sitting right there but I can't remember if it was a request made about sister Doris her dad was there a request made okay there I just talked with her again today and and her dad he's not eating and and other things right now and I think he's about 90 is it about 90 and 90 something like that and what you say 92 so you know I know that different family has come in town here this here this weekend and he just needs a touch from the Lord if and that's he certainly needs strength he certainly lived a long life but he needs he needs a touch from the Lord so we just want to hold them up in prayer right now as a family and hold up hold him up in prayer as well for each of them they certainly have a lot that they're dealing with right now so it's just in the midst of all of this God knows all our needs don't eat I'm so glad about that and I believe with all my heart that you know God prepares the experiences you know it's not just the word but God prepares even the man to come with experiences and things from in his life and God will take that direction right through the word and God will minister that right to you and I and I'm so thankful that God is so mindful of that aren't you hey you know you don't have to be but he is he just shows his love and his care and I'm so glad about that tonight amen so let's just turn our turn our attention to the word of the Lord and let's just sing that little song once again that we were singing because we do want God to have his way here tonight amen let go and let God head is wonderful let go and let God head this way your sorrow [Music] [Music] one more time [Music] [Music] praise the Lord I believe that's what every person that really loves the Lord wants is for him to to have its way praise the Lord sure appreciate our brother asking us to come and to be with you tonight I I've never come anytime that I didn't enjoy myself I appreciate the presence of the Lord and and just really appreciate our sister Pat that allowed us to come and to stay with her and it's just so wonderful when you come into somebody's home and it's the presence of the Lord that's there it's so welcoming you know and you know that everything is gonna be alright if he's there he's the Lord let's let's take our Bibles tonight if you would and go with me I didn't give these brothers anything to pull up on the screen so we'll see how good they are tonight and see how quick they can pull these scriptures up for us but let's let's go to John chapter 3 and certainly desire your prayers tonight always desire the leadership of the Lord and we just really we want his leadership tonight we want to say the things that that he wants said and he knows every heart and you know if we can just believe that he's gonna speak to us tonight that he will praise the Lord if I ask how many needs tonight probably every hand in the building would go up because somebody most of us have needs because we're human beings there's things that we deal with because we're human beings you know and God is so mindful even read samuel mentioned in himself you know about how mindful that he is so if we really have a need and we really understand how white God put a fivefold ministry in the church then we'll take that need and we'll hold it right up there before the Lord and he'll answer that voice in John chapter 3 I want to begin in verse 16 I know this is very very familiar to two believers but we want to begin in verse 16 and we'll read 16 17 and 18 before we pray and let you be seated John 3:16 the most famous scripture in the Bible it's been translated into more languages than any other scripture that there is in the Bible and it's it's just so so power all the Word of God is powerful but let's look at this for just a minute here for God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life now we read that scripture we quote that scripture we witness to people with that Scripture but let's look at the next verse for just a minute because this is the one that doesn't get read near as often and it has just as much of an impact as some of these others do for God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved he didn't sit in Christ to condemn the world a lot of people feel like that's why Christ came to the world that's because they have had a different Jesus projected to them Christ came to save the world not to condemn the world that's why every every person he said whosoever will let him come praise the Lord many times because of the way the word has been projected to people it's caused them to have a question in their hearts a question in their minds of you know what does God really want out of my life and why is this like this and why is that maybe the Lord to help us tonight to answer some of those let's read verse 18 he said he that believeth on him is not condemned now that ties those first two together but he that believeth not is condemned already it's the unbelief that a person has that would bring them to condemnation but if they would just believe if they would just accept the remedy as we might would call it what God sent to meet our need everything will be all right he's the Lord he that believeth not is condemned already because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God as our heads together you've got an unspoken request on your heart you'd like to raise your hand to the lordy he certainly knows Heavenly Father we stand here before you tonight Lord and as human beings we certainly don't have anything that we can count on Lorne you're the only answer that there is you're the only thing that is solid you're the only thing that's in movable Lord you're the only thing that is certain Lord Jesus we stand before you tonight we need you to come and we to break the bread of life Lord we need you because in the breaking of the bread that their eyes came open and they begin to see you by revelation or they begin to see the word it actually been fulfilled right before their eyes Lord I'm asking you to come tonight and to take this vessel it just move it completely out of the way tonight that you could speak through us Lord and I pray that you just bless every person that's made the effort to be here tonight Lord as they hold their need before you tonight Lord may you direct these lips father and may you put the word in my mouth that can be spoken to them that will help them to overcome the devil Lord we just commit ourselves to you we bind every demon power in the name of Jesus Christ and we ask you to come pour out your spirit upon us Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen god bless you you can be seated brother Samuel told me to make myself at home tonight and then he and then he took the mic away from him he said let me check these batteries I'm gonna make sure they're good for three hours but I promise you I'm not gonna preach three hours tonight but you know this this is a subject that as brother Samuel was saying some of the things that he did about experiences how that the Lord will take those experiences in a man's life and he'll use those experiences to run through the word to to help us in other experiences and different things that that were going through but you know there's something that Satan has done from the very Garden of Eden and he's still doing it today and that's trying to get people to question God's Word if I was going to give this a title tonight you know all the word ties together but if I was going to title it tonight I would just simply call it questioning because we live in an hour when whatever God is doing Satan's going to be right there trying to do something to make people question whether that's God or not I mentioned to the last couple services at home you know but we we live in an hour when we don't have to wonder what God is going to do because we've already seen what God's going to do we've heard what God's going to do and now we're actually experiencing what he said he would do ourselves have stepped into this vision of the message of the hour and we ourselves have become the voice of God upon the earth and he's all but I ain't no voice of God yes you are your life will speak louder than any word that you can say and it's that life right there that's going to judge a dying world if they don't accept what Christ sets before now what Satan will do is he'll get somebody to stand before you that'll make you question something that's going on every single time that God is going to do something all the way down through time when God begin to do something the enemy came in there and tried to do something to pull everybody's mind away from what God was actually doing praise the Lord if you look at the very times and I you know I I'm a pastor but I preached by inspiration so you all just pray for me because I want to be able to go right down through here the way that I feel like the Lord wants me to go but you know every single time that God has done something Satan's always raised it up to try to do something to bring people away from that or to make them question that or whatever and you know in the days of Noah he raised up all around even to play there's only 8 people saved in the days of Noah it wasn't because the word wasn't preached it was it wasn't because there wasn't an answer there was an answer come on the very life that Noah was living was the manifestation that God had spoken to him because he wasn't going around just telling people you know hey we're gonna build a boat man you know he was building a boat you know he wasn't talking about all we're gonna do this and we're gonna do that he was doing that come on buddy so hard now look he I think he's here so you hold on ok you know better man said when they were down there in Egypt he said they weren't talking about applying the token he said they were applying the token it wasn't talking about picking out a lamb and going and getting the blood and doing this now they were actually putting the blood on the doorpost it was on display everybody knew it was praise the Lord now we live in the hour it's exactly the same thing for us because God has come down in such a way there's not going to be anybody that can stand in this day and be able to say well you know I just really didn't know what to do Lord no sir it's been it's been put together too perfectly for us to say I just really didn't know what to do or it's been made so plain that even a fool cannot air their it you know that's the word and as long as we stay with that word then we're going to be alright if you don't stay with the word then you're condemning yourself I had somebody ask the question the other day said so what about the judgments was yesterday's every person going to stand in the judgment Allah that's not easy to answer to a sinner because I'm not gonna stand there I don't plan on being there brother sister I you said well Jeff you gotta be there I will be there but not to be judged this word is judging me now I'm judging myself now I'm allowing this word to mold me and shake me and make me what God wants me to be therefore when it comes judgement time I'll be with him doing the judges I won't be off there being judge but I'll be with him because I become the word from my day and they're going to be judged by the word for their day now the word for the day ain't gonna be just every preacher that stood in the pulpit but it's going to be those people that actually received that word and then they became that word because of their receiving of the work he's the Lord if Satan can get us to question the word of God in any way for the men said you're on your way out then now if I know that you said that there was visitors here and if you don't understand why I'm saying saying brother Branham it's no different than me saying brother Paul brother Peter brother James you know God spoke through me in all down through time as they were moved by the Holy Ghost God begin to speak through them but you know the main thing that Satan wants to do he doesn't even care he doesn't want you to just turn her back and and walk away all he wants you to do is question the word because if he can get you to question the word then you may as well walk away you understand what I'm saying you have to believe God you have to take God's Word you have to apply it in your life and then just submit yourself to the Lord you see this the scripture says if you resist the devil he'll flee but we don't we don't quote the first part of that scripture the first part says submitting ourselves unto the Lord resist the devil he'll flee so if you're not submitted he's not gonna flee he's just gonna stand there and laugh at you because he knows he's got a right to stand there he said there's a difference but a sister and talking about the token and having the token applied in our lives praise the Lord hey man the devil knows what he's doing he studied us for thousands and thousands of years he knows what makes you tick he knows what makes me tick he knows what takes you off he knows what takes me up come on he knows exactly what he's doing better sister he's not an idiot you know we get you know we get to preach them we get annoying who said that dumb devil you know if that devil was so smart he would just leave us alone but he's never gonna quit and he's not dumb he knows exactly what he's doing and that's why the thing that makes you so upset is what he does every day you know if you would just not let that bother you anymore he'd leave you alone right so once the enemy can get you to question the Word of God he's got you disarmed once the enemy can get you to a place where you're questioning something that God is doing or something that God has done or something God wants to do in any way if he can get you to question that word of God then the next thing that comes as a spirit of doubt and when that spirit of doubt comes in there that spirit of doubt just sets down on you and then you start doubting everything and when you open those doors up every channel that is open it actually opens a channel for something else to come in come on but sister it's no different than on the spiritual side we come in under justification and the Lord doesn't work in our lives and brings us out of the world he saves us and we know that we've been saved we know something's taking place in our lives as we open our channels up to allow God to come in then he'll begin to clean our lives up he'll move us right on into sanctification you know I know this is very simple but it'll help us it will if we'll catch it a little bit but you know it's a constant opening of more channels because in the fall all of our channels got clogged up right well there's only one thing that opens those channels and that's the work now we have to be submissive to the word in order for that channel that come open to where God can use it at the way that he wants to a man doesn't get saved tonight and then he's got a call of God in his life to preach tomorrow he has to open channels in his life up and submit himself to the Word of God so that the work can have preeminence that praise the Lord if thou it goes far enough it'll bring a spirit of unbelief don't question God's Word you say listen I don't understand it there's lots of things we will never understand with system we'll never understand it but we're not asked to understand it as much as we are to believe it just allow God to have preeminence then listen to what brother Branham says in the greatest battle ever fought he said you see his attack he said now listen closely now his attack is what to disbelieve God's work he said can you see the greatest battle that was ever fought he said there's only two forces Satan hang on now what is Satan's weapon against you is to try to get you to disbelieve your weapon you know that's what a bully does a bully acts big and bad and tough because he wants you to doubt whether you can take him out or not raise alert I went to school with a lot of bullies you know they always they got a they can all talk big but it's different when somebody backs up what they got to say praise the Lord maybe I won't go to go into that he says it it he's trying to get you to disbelieve your weapon see and he disarms you he said listen he said real quiet now listen if he can get you to disbelieve that your weapon is equivalent if he gets you to disbelieve that your weapons not strong enough that he has disarmed you so better what's our weapon what are we supposed to use against him who you are I mean what did he tell Gideon he said go in this time I and you shall deliver the children of Israel what was he going in don't call it God never handed him a sword or a and weapon that God said you're a mighty man about amen take this word I've given you then go defeat your enemy yeah it's no different today because we have been given a weapon that will destroy every demon power that there is now I know that I know you know we've got all kinds of fanaticism and things that follows every revival is that what the prophets said there's all kinds of fanaticism that follows every single revival but pros history if there's fanaticism and there's got to be real amen there's got to be a group of people on the earth that are going to raise up that are going to say and do exactly what the prophets said we'd say and do exactly what the Bible said that will say and Duke we're going to live exactly the way the Bible said we'll live everything that he said would take place in the life of a believer that's going to be manifested in the lives of real believers but if Satan trying to get you to question whether you're one of those are not well you know brother I tell you you're just not the best preacher in a message I knew that before I ever got here but you realize that many men they question whether they've even been called or not when God wants to use the gift the way God wants to use the gift if a man is not a deep teacher that he shouldn't try to teach deeply I know I said I know it's real simple you know but it's the truth anyway he man the truth will stand when the world's on fire right if Satan can get you to disbelieve that your weapon is equivalent he's got you're disarmed ready BAM says oh brother Neville I hope you never leave that seat oh I hope and pray not he said he's disarmed you when he gets you to disbelieve that weapon see when you lay that down that finishes your fight when you when you laid out who you are that finishes your fight God's not going to come down here in armas with a k' fifty sevens and all those things that the world is fighting about listen that's just the reason these things are raising up the way they are is because Satan gets everybody's mind on that kind of stuff and we forget what we're here for well you know we're so caught up in the world times that we absolutely questioned look why in the world even put me in this age maybe I'm the only one does that race Satan is a master at what he does you know I said it before he's not an idiot he knows exactly what he's doing he knows how to stumble every single person but God knows how to keep us from stumbling and you see that's the thing is submitting ourselves to that the question won't be there if we submit ourselves to the word because will automatically go to the where we'll go to what God has said we'll apply it in our life and the enemy recognizes whether you know what you're doing or not you know that's why brother Branham said unconfessed sin gives the devil a right to stay there that's listening to message the other day and rather Batum came out and he told those people he said the Lord spoke to him up there in that room he was praying he said Lord what is going on here why does it seem like you can't break through here and he said God spoke to me and said you bring every one of those people up to that altar tonight and make them confess their sin because that unconfessed sin it didn't matter how anointed brother Branham was Satan had a right to sit there and he did because Brennan says why couldn't you break through well he couldn't break through because of the unbelief he's all right unbelief doesn't stop God what it did in the Bible Jesus took a man completely out of the city because of the unbelief in the city so that he could give him what was his right come on brother sister you know what we're in an hour when Satan's going to do anything that he can to get us off the word because if we're just off to even just a little bit then we're off the word we might believe in the Godhead and we might believe it that mysteries have all been revealed you know we might believe all the different things that have taken place in this day but if he can get us off just a little bit in our holiness well I don't think it's really that important but yet for me to read my Bible and prayer every day well the reason that you don't think that's important because you don't read your Bible prayer every day it's kind of simple isn't it God's not going to put us in a position and then not give us an answer to what our problem is you know it's God's grace for the sister that he loves us so much he will not let us stay in a broken condition he will come no matter what our condition is he will come and tell us how to get out of that condition but look God is not going to get down there in the mud and wallet with you in the mud he's not going to get down there and wallow with me in the mud but he'll stand right there with his hand reach down say come on son I'll pull you out of there if you let me I'll lift you up if you let me I want to do something for you please the Lord he said don't lay your weapon down no lay your weapon down you got a shield of faith that'll quench all the fiery darts of the wicked but if you got the shield laying over here it ain't gonna do you no good you've got to hold it up there you've got to have faith that what God is given here is more than enough to defeat the devil and if we just look through the Scriptures we can see that he did it in every circumstance he's defeated Satan don't ever hand there's never been a battle that Satan's ever won when he come against the Lord we've lost lots of battles but he's never lost a war I don't look for him to start now we know that in the Garden of Eden when things took place the way that they did in the garden that was just a fulfillment of God's plan God was not caught off guard by what took place in the Garden of Eden God could not come down there and say Adam I need you to fall from grace I want to fulfill myself here I my attributes have got to be expressed Adam and I need you to just mess up okay but God knew that they would and he knew that by doing that then he would be able to express himself many times we don't even recognize what's going on and God may be bringing us around and putting us in the middle of a circumstance that we can't even imagine why we're there but he's doing it and not just to help you but he's doing it for somebody else you know if you look at Paul and Silas and the way that they preach the gospel I mean they were on fire they went around setting cities on fire and then they got sitar beat out of them they got locked up and changed and thrown in the middle of Jail right down in the middle of a dungeon these guys are bleeding they're hurting but they decided to work God they decided that they'd rather sing about it they'd rather give God praise that they've been counted worthy amen they would much rather have done that and look God did all of that because that jailer needed you saved he's all better Jeff that's not why well you you try to convince that jailer that it wasn't he and his house were saying because Paul and Silas took a beatin come on read it sister many times we look at those situations and God does something you know look at the life of Joseph or me like I'm you know I'm just gonna preach okay look at the life of Joseph for a minute you know and what those brothers did to him was outrageous what they had in their heart to do to him you wouldn't think about it especially somebody that's considered to be a Christian but they were writing a will of gun he said I know but that wasn't the will of God look God already had a plan how he was going to get Joseph down there Joseph had already seen the vision the word had already been given and God had to do something to get him down there where he could be fulfilled now watch the real Christian Joseph didn't complain his whole way down there he wasn't fussing and arguing and fighting in the yard I don't understand this you know I'm sick and tired of it I don't even want to be a Christian anymore it wasn't that way at all what was in him was just being expressed hallelujah hey my sister it's something that should just come out of us because it's part of us you know all the things that Joseph went through I mean look at the things that he went through and what was it now God did not give Joseph a book when he was born and saying I just keep reading this book over and over and over and it'll tell you what you are but he was a perfect a perfect type of Jesus Christ amen now he gave us the book come on he gave us the book he said just keep reading it until you believe it because this is what you are it says everything that you are if you'll just follow the directions if you'll just follow what I've given you and just walk in these things but Satan wants us to question you know we pick up our Bible in silora I just really need help Lord if you really need you to speak to me and you open it up and it's Matthew chapter 1 and so on so begat so and so and we get so on somebody gets on then that really doesn't help me right now lord I need an answer he already told you believe all things were possible to them that believe but I don't know if he loves me or not for God so loved the world that's all of us he gave us his work nothing will ever change that nobody can make it any different he's over Jim you know if I could do this and if I could do that if I could do that if you could do something that he didn't need to die he died because we couldn't do anything because he loved us so much all it takes sometimes it's just that one little thing to be thrown in there to make us question what God is doing I want you to think about this for just a minute you know but when Moses is there his mother is teaching him constantly why he's there in the house of Pharaoh he's being raised up in the house of Pharaoh he's an ingenious man if you study history and stuff you'll find out he actually conquered many countries for Egypt he was a great a great warrior you know and when he decided that it was time for him to move he was doing it in his own intellectual conception and that that's why it didn't work and then he ran and got away from God you know but God that didn't stop God's plan it didn't change anything at all God just had to get him out Terry could beat all of that you know worldly nonsense out of him hello brother if you're in the middle of a beating right now it's probably because he's trying to somehow love you but look he wants to get it out of you because he wants to use you for something he's got a purpose in your life he's not just putting you through it because he likes to put his people through things but he's got a plan and a purpose in what he's doing and when we're questioning the plan and the purpose then he kind of puts a hold on things now Moses comes back and he meets he meets God you know better man City and he had more in five minutes after meeting a pillar fire then he did in all those 40 years before because now he met God and now he actually knew what the plan of God was now I ask you this question did he have a revelation of how God was going to bring him out of there come on the God gives revelation when we have need of Revelation right we don't want to be like those people that you know I tell you we've got the Holy Ghost now and should we seek God for gifts by the man said oh don't do that he said don't do that he said just be a Christian just live right and God will give you what you need when you need it raise the Lord you know here Moses goes down and does exactly what God says and the Egyptians they call up their magicians and they throw down their rod and they turn into snakes and everything and it looks like Moses is an idiot I mean think about it now if there's ever going to be a question come up God told him you go down there and give my people he said I've heard their cries I've heard their groaning I've seen the bondage that they're under and I am come down to deliver them now go get him praise the Lord there's a point I'm trying to make in this better sister look he has come down and he come down for the same thing he come down to deliver of people now go get up hey man God's got a people an army on the earth that he's going to use to get those children and bring them out of that bondage if there's ever a time of questioning it could have been that time for Moses as he was standing there yeah but Moses didn't question God said I'm gonna bring him out of there Moses held on to that word and that word actually did exactly what God said it would even when the people turned against him Oh God I mean Moses is right in the line of duty and Pharaoh says oh you want to go worship you want me to cut you overtime off no we're gonna add to it we're just even gonna take the straw away you guys go get your own straw and make sure every brick is going to be livered and the people turned against Moses Moses come walking through and they said why have you done this never said you come down here it's been nothing but a great battle Pharaoh is turned against us you know it used to be a little easier around here anybody can live for the devil right so lord I was witnessing to a man one time and you know he was standing there just smoking like crazy and talking about going to heaven and I said brother I said you don't think you're gonna meet God with that cigarette in your hand do you and he kind of looked at me and I said I wouldn't try that if I were you I said God's not going to dwell in an unclean vessel he kind of looked at me yeah Sam is enjoyable and he said boys you're a rough old coot ain't you and I said brother the word is true you know I said God wants you to be free of that thing I said so he sent me here today to help my brother on this roof job because he knew you won't come up here and I was gonna get to talk to you and he just kind of looked at me out and I said look if you really want to know God I said you've got to submit yourself to him I said you can't run with the world and expect to go to heaven it ain't gonna work that way he said man you're a tough old Buzzard I said I'm not a buzzard I'm an eagle please alert but you realized by the sister we've got a world full of people that's all don't worry about them cigarettes that ain't no big problem it is a big problem if you're Christian you're bound by a demonic power woman it's got so much power read the band said I'd rather see my wife laying in the floor drunk then to have one in cigarettes hanging out of her mouth because he knew the power of that nicotine devil come on amen I'm starting to fill it home now raise the Lord I was bound by that nicotine devil for twenty years but I'll tell you what ever since I've been set free I just love for people to come for prayer when they need deliverance from that thing they were cuz I know I got it specializes get that kind of deliverance I know I'm glad that is able to bind the nicotine demon and I gotta bind a drug devil they made I know I got that electric he doesn't send somebody down there to bring his people out and not go but he goes down and and likes them to bring those people out of there he may resistant we've been anointed in this day to do the things that God's called us to do we've been anointed for the challenge of that of Leodis here he's a lord better give off of that a little bit praise the Lord a man says this and faith in the Son of God he's this man we're talking to him he's a reverend enemies that if we had no automobiles no gunpowder no atomic bomb man would still die better man said just a minute doctor he wouldn't have died if you hadn't left the Tree of Life praise the Lord brother sister you can't be on the Tree of Life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil at the same time God don't like mixed treats it's his scene Hinds pure praise the Lord you can't you can't serve God and Mammon you can't mix the two together come on now look you gotta love me enough get to heaven praise the Lord if he said be at home that means preach I can't preach at home right if he hadn't left the tree see he left the Tree of Life leaving that tree brought death that's right he said now that's just the results of leaving that tree but as long as he stayed with the Tree of Life he lived forever when he left the tree and refused this tree and eat of the tree disobeying God that's when the question mark across God's Word game he said now to me that's when death sets in when you put a question mark on God's Word you know that yep I really don't believe that brother Branham was a prophet it really doesn't matter whether we believe he's a prophet or not he's a prophet anyway hazel or a man but as you know I really don't know about this cloud thing well let me ask you a question have you ever studied history at all to find out about that star that led the wise men to Jesus hello raise the Lord did it lead them to the leaving work come on start with the clock amen it will lead you to the Living Word because it's exactly the same thing it was God's Word brought into manifestation that if we walk in that word it'll bring us right into that life huh even brother Branham said himself he said there's nowhere in history that you can find that that star was ever seen by any other observatory or anything else but it was there just the same come on look when they went running into the city and begin to question where is he where is he you see the problem was if they'd have stayed following the start they'd had never had to address a question where is it they'd have been led right straight to him hey man that's powerful Ray's alert stay with the stalk the one that was in his right here the seventh one that brought the revelation of the word for this day not for another day brother sister we have a more sure word of prophecy a more sure word present day through that is the more sure word of prophecy is present they drew he's the Lord that's when death sets in when they begin to question put a question mark on God's Word then death set in why do you think it's so easy for people that's been around this message for years and years and years to all of the sudden all of a sudden it's not true anymore all of a sudden I made a mistake all of a sudden it's false and it's a cult and it's this that somewhere down the road a long time ago they started questioning one little thing and instead of going to a good Holy Ghost field pastor like they should have so a brother Jeff you know I you know how if I questioned some I wouldn't ever go to my pastor be careful you're giving that thing a place to stay there but God put a pastor in the church to help you and he'll recognize when you come what you have need of and he'll cast that thing off of you and you'll be able to get back with God where you need to be praise the Lord that's just look we don't have to have a prophet that stands up here and calls us out and calls are saying out we know what we're doing wrong amen but it's still the same Holy Ghost it's still the same discerning spirit that calls these things out during the services and God does it for one purpose get your eyes back on the goal start watching the work just like he said keep your eyes on the goal when the goal is Christ anointed work you know I think we've got so many perfect types that lay in the word and we can always go back to those things and God can always go into the old and bring out new because when the word is anointed it it starts opening up in a way that you've never seen it before that's why sometimes your pastor comes in he he plants and he plants and he plants and he plows any plants and he plows any plants any weeds and he does everything that he can't and an evangelist will come through and preach a message and you go thank God I see it's a truth but you see Paul planted in Apollo's watered but God gave the increase some of the pastors laboring in laboring and he's doing all the work and he evangelist looks like Superman but remember it's the same God that's working through all of them it's the same God that's doing the work in the life of the believer to get them the place where they need to be and you know Moses went in and called out 12 spies and said I want you to go here in spy out this land and look brother sister before they went there they knew what was there Moses had already told them under inspiration what was there he had already said it's a land flowing with milk and honey because God told him it was a land flowing milk and he already told him the land alone everything belonged to them but what happened is they got over there and saw the circumstances that he didn't say nothing about what if all these giants were here why didn't he tell me about it because God no care about Giants he's a giant killer what about all these serpents he's a serpent bruiser what about all this sickness he's a healer he's a deliverer he's everything we need hey man God's not worried about the obstacle he's not worried about circumstance hey man he's got it all under control he can change on all of those things but they begin to question because the circumstance was different when they thought it was going to be maybe I shouldn't ask for a raise of hands but how many of you all came out of the world into this message and never had a battle okay yeah see I'm glad I didn't ask for a raise of hands hazel or is there anybody in here tonight that can really tell me that you've never made a mistake since you got saved but sir he's not worried about our mistakes he's not worried about our obstacles he knows the beginning all the way down to the end he even knows what's going on in the middle but he's not worried about what's going on in the middle because you're beginning as you're in Jesus could say I come from God and I return to God I was God when I left the ramparts of glory then when I go back I'll still be gone [Applause] hallelujah I was a son of God in the mind of God from before the foundation of the world now look I will never go back to being in his mind I am now the manifestation of what was in his mind he said I'm not questioning whether I'm a son of God or not I'm not questioning my circumstances raised the Lord well it's so easy for you preachers yeah all right I get so tired of hearing that we live in one of these two come on that's right we're all dirtbags whether we come on he's alone look the seed goes in dirt doesn't it let me plant your garden you put it in the dirt it all goes in the dirt but what's in the dirt is not the dirt what's in the dirt that's placed there is what comes out is the life raised the Lord you know it's such a simple thing to me we would not have near the problem with the false doctrines that we have in this message if people would just look back 30 years ago or 40 years ago or whenever they started it and look there was a seed there it looks so good it was so anointing he could preach I'm telling you that man was anointed so his devil that's what the scripture says he's the anointed cherub and he said and I have said Nisa so the devil could say huh I'm anointed I'm a protector of the heart and he's saying exactly what God said and the whole time iniquity laying in his heart he said one day I'm gonna knock you off one day I'm gonna have your place one day I'm gonna be worshipped and he certainly done that praise the Lord but you realize that didn't change God's plan it didn't change God's program it doesn't change God's thought about you it doesn't change God's thought about me so I'll tell you what I my life was just so don't worry about what your life was go from where you are now and just keep your eyes on the cross and keep going vote just keep looking to Jesus Christ now as the word comes forth apply it in your life submit yourself to the word biggest problem that we have resistors not submitting ourselves to the anointed were not allowing I'll tell you brother they probably not gonna do you much good your opinion is not gonna help you a lot no more than what my opinion helps you but brother sister we've got something that is unstoppable we've got something that can't be defeated we've got something that they will not fall by the wayside you know Jesus said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God and whether it's a word that has been written here or a word spoken under inspiration if God spoke it to you it'll carry you through that's right I'll give you an example of that you know that the Lord is something that the Lord did for me years ago and I'll go back to experiences you know but it's something that the Lord did for me years ago when I was growing up you know my my father and my mother divorced when I was a year old you know and I always held it against my father I absolutely hated it because I had to live with my mom and stead of living with my dad because I want to live with my dad all the time you know a boy wants to be with his daddy all right I'm glad I never lived with him right he didn't know how to be a father he didn't know how to be an example now don't worry I'll fix it up in a minute don't think I'm trying to trash my dad okay but I want to bring you to an understanding you know I came to a place with the Lord where I actually lost my job and I've been on this job for nine years you know and I just thought they'd that company just couldn't make it without me and believe me they can make it without you they will show you that they can make it without you but you know it was in that time period and I've told many people this I'd go through it again tomorrow because it was in that 18-month period that the Lord filled me with the Holy Ghost but you know before I got the Holy Ghost I was in my basement one day and I was praying and I was asking the Lord to help me because it seemed like something that was just a block there and I just could not get through and the Lord had really brought me so far you know I wasn't able to work at the time and sometimes I'd go down to my basement not pray through four hours a day that's all I could do I mean I've outgrown my life crazy you know man's that maybe at home you know I was just praying and praying asking the Lord for help and and you know I really began to cry out you know I was I mean I was crying I wasn't saying I was screaming I was crying I needed to help from the Lord and something happened and I don't know to this day what happened but when I came to myself the first words I remember I said lord please I said forgive me for hating my father that's the Lord I didn't know I hated him you know and all these things just begin to out of my life all of these things come out of there you know because that was something that was keeping me from becoming what he wanted me to be and I had to I had to get that out of there now however it comes whatever happens God's gonna do something to bring those things out of your life and you know when I left Michigan I moved back to Virginia and that wasn't even a church down there I had to drive two hours one way to go to a church but I was so positive that that's where I needed to be even you know I had a pastor told me he said you're out of the will of God and I said listen brother I love you you know I said you'll always have a place in my heart you're the one that introduced me to this message and I said ah I love you but I said God told me to go brethren I've got to you don't even have a church to go to and I said I understand that but I said I'll Drive two hours to get to church you know I said I'm not gonna just give up and go home but that's where he told me to go and I'm gonna go so I did I started witnessing all of my family you know and I just I knew that God was just gonna bring everyone I mean never has brought any of men but it didn't keep me from witnessing him it didn't keep me from from staying in the presence of God holding them before the Lord and one day in prayer the Lord spoke to me he said I give you your father he said you'll baptize them in the name of Jesus Christ I come up out of that closet man I started telling everybody you know I said I'm up baptize my dad I said my dad's going to save don't baptize my dad you know I said the Lord doesn't give me my dad I mean I was just so happy I was telling everybody about it now that my grandmother's one day working for her which was my dad's mom my grandma Snodgrass and she said honey pray for your dad he pray for you dad I said mama quit worrying about daddy she said oh no he needs to be saved I said ma'am oh he's gonna get saved she said what I said the Lord doesn't give him to me I said the Lord told me I'm gonna baptize him in the name of Jesus Christ now my grandmother was a Baptist but she took across that front porch and she was screaming and everybody in that valley hurt hurt everybody around there hurt her and my grandmother stood on the banks of the river the Creek that we baptized my father in the name of Jesus Christ oh they meant and my father went on to preach the gospel for 17 years he's now in a nursing home from a stroke and he's not been able to get over but for 17 years after that he went on to preach the gospel he meant no better sister I didn't have nothing in this Bible that I could go to but God gave me that work God gave me that word and it was just as real to me and just as strong in my soul and the day that we baptized him I brought him up out of that water and I looked at those people on the bank and I said listen if you've not been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ come into the water I said he's here to receive you today if you want it you don't want to be baptized in titles there's not gonna be a title that you'll be able to get through that door you gotta be born again you can only be born again when you come into fellowship with Jesus Christ praise the Lord now don't get me wrong wasn't nobody there that day I baptized up my father right but it was still word that God had given me and I never questioned you the first time I never questioned because God's Word don't fail raise the Lord so brother Jeff what about my kids and what about this and what about that go to him and you take the word that he gives you and don't you ever doubt it don't you ever doubt it you've got a sickness in your body call for the elders of the church let him anoint you with all in the prayer of faith shall save the sick not maybe not hope so they shall be sane praise the Lord the word doesn't fail business sister the reason the enemy wants us questioning the word is because he totally disarms us when we begin to question the work we put one mark on the word and the word can't have preeminence in our lives anymore raise alert we sit sometimes and you know we know we're not where we need to be with Lord and the Lord comes out he anoints your pastor and he just walked right up and down the avenues of your life and you sit there and you go he's gonna be so ashamed of me if I go up there I won't go up there that's the devil that's just the devil your pastor his life a pastor's love is unconditional just like God's is praise the Lord if it's not then he doesn't need to be a pastor raised alone right how do you think brother Branham could look into the lives of those people as they were coming across through there and still loved them enough to bring them into the presence of Christ when he saw things there he said many of the things that he saw what caused penitentiary offenses right but he would bring them through there and bring him into the presence of Jesus Christ I need to tell him I see a greater need here then what's in your body he said you're a sinner is it you need Jesus Christ in your life will you receive him today they wouldn't I don't ever remember seeing one that I've ever looked at anywhere that received Christ that didn't go away he'll praise the Lord they never questioned it because they were standing right there in his presence but what about some of the religious people that sat in the meetings and quite while he's guessing that he's guessing and he try and he said quit thinking that I'm not guessing I said you're hindering the service now stop that I was listed a plastic he said I'm fixing to call you out and he could have done it dude because he did it many times praise the Lord well what was it Satan there in the middle of God manifesting himself in a flesh body but sister that's what William branham's ministry was it was God manifesting himself in flesh now please don't misunderstand me it wasn't Jesus Christ the Messiah standing here that man was born in sin and shaping iniquity just like we are raised alert it had to be saved just like we do huh he had to have his walk with the Lord he had to be sanctified cleaned and set aside come on he had to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost brother Branham talks about over and over and over and one time he's preaching in a place and he said I'm very at home in here tonight he said I see that bar back there preaching what used to be a bar he says I'm feel very at home in here tonight he said because it was in a little black church or I received the baptism of the Holy Ghost a converted bar room so I feel very much at home tonight I'm glad to see that this is converted to a house of God if one of one of the preachers nowadays said well I feel very at home in a bar and boy we'd been trouble with me there'd be a vote first thing in the morning uh-huh well it's the truth he's a lord but you see it's the enemy constantly trying to disarm you we have been given a weapon that cannot be defeated if Satan can anoint us to question the promise of God then we'll bring an evil report these men that went over into the land saw the exact same thing that Joslin Caleb saw many of the men that walked with brother Branham they saw the dead raised they saw eyes created in sockets they saw leg straight now they saw God manifest himself in a way that had not been done since Jesus Christ walked the shores of Galilee and yet Satan would come up and make them question one thing and they turn and walk away from it just like they did with Jesus now I want you to think about this that was a part of God's plan a part of God's program because when Jesus in Chapter six there of Saint John rather man who made this statement he said when Jesus stood there he looked upon them and he said except you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and you drink his blood you have no life in you this is a hard saying who commit and they said they turned and walked with him no more now brother Branham said Jesus looked out and saw a bunch of parasites hanging on him and friend you know the parasite is it lives off the life of a victim anything that lives off the life of a victim is a parasite and Jesus saw that those men were pulling virtue strength different things out of him that could go in to those believers that could help them that could make them more of what they're supposed to be I'm not you know I'm nobody's judging I don't want to be nobody's job it's not our time to do that there will be that time when we stand with the Lord as I mentioned earlier but this is not our time right now we need to fulfill that grace amen as long as there's breath in a person's lungs there's grace for their they meant but there are things that our prophet told us that when people do that they've crossed the line they have crossed the line we'll look if that was a parasite that was pulling strength away from somebody and God warning say let me just put it this way say that there was a church and there was somebody there under the inspiration of the enemy that was trying to move those people off of the word they were taking what should have been the children's bread and putting it before just trampling on it walking over it making the Word of God of no effect before the people you know making statements like why would brother Branham say that we don't live in a day like that now why would brother Branham make that's because he was an audit of God that's why he made that statement just like Elijah said let the glob that answers with fire peacock why did it why did he say that he was standing there against his own country his own countrymen but he was anointed of the Holy Ghost right that's a parasite a whole body of believers there that maybe would been pulled way out somewhere we know that the God's not going to lose a one but look at all the things that could be caused in their eyes all the things that they went through all the scars that many of them have all the distrust because a lot of those guys that do that are very anointed I mean they can put it together man they know how to work the mind you know many of them going to school you know gone to college and they've learned psychology and these different things and they know how to deal with the mind of a person I'm glad that you know I'm not dependent on God deal with my mind because I don't have much of one but you know I do have a heart that's tender I do have a heart that I want him to be the king of praise the Lord I don't want to question anything that he's doing if there's a parasite hanging on my life that's pulling strength out of me that could propel me into the arms of Christ I want that thing cut off I don't want anything at all in my life that's going to question what God is wanting to do I don't want to bring an evil report you celebrate you know your you don't have a you know if you're getting a pulpit you start saying bad things you know that no if I don't have the token applied I'm bringing an evil report no sister this is evening time this is evening time it's not time to question and wonder and how should we do this and how should we do that we've been given an instruction book come on look we're not in a foreign country to where when our prophet speaks it's got to go through 15 interpreters he came to our own land God brought him right out of the United States he speaks out well don't say he speaks English but then he speaks hillbilly he talks like I do you know what we call English you know he spoke it's not hard for us to understand what he said I know some of his terminology maybe people don't understand you know when I go to Africa some of the brothers I ask me what did brother Branham mean when he said grease what do you brother Branham mean when he said this or when he said this you know I grew up down in the hills I know exactly what he means it's not hard for me just like it's not hard for you to understand what he says but how would it be for you as a black brother you receive a high profit now how would it be for you as a white person come on Satan has never let that spirit die even in our message brother sister he's never let that spirit die he's always trying to raise that thing up it's us against them and it's them against us and it said if we're Christians friends were or one we are all worn together no matter where we're from brother sister Amen if we're children of God we come from God our skin may be different color we may have a different accent you know we may act a completely different some people are educated and some people are like me they just barely made it through high school I don't think that God really cares brother madam had a seventh grade education what he wants is a heart that he can deal with he can live in amen and an evil report if our life is not projecting what the word says it should project then we're bringing an evil report we're defaming what he wants to do for us he meant let me see if I can find a couple quotes here now some of you are getting getting tired but I'm not rather Bentham preached the message why it had to be shepherds it's 1964 he said notice they complained about God's provided way he said it was the reason that they died you mean complaining caused them to die that's what my man says well I think your brother Samuel would do it like this that brother Samuel be led of the Lord and then you be led to the Lord praise the Lord he said they complained that's what made them die in the wilderness they complained about God's provided way I business I want you to think about this okay we should consider it to be the greatest privilege that we've ever had for God to desire to come down and separate us from the world separate us from all these different things pull us out of denominationalism pull us out of darkness into his marvelous light we should be the we should really consider ourselves to be the most privileged people in the world but Satan will come and say well you know you would really be more on fire many times because of the sign that people are born under this Oh God am I not a Christian what am I not a Christian he said well Jeff that's not true why do we have an interview with sister Bruce that was recorded down and it was actually recorded by accident brother Rams getting ready to preach the masterpiece message he's in the office with sister Bruce the poor sister brother Brandon breaks it down in another message and talks about the sign that she was born under the different things here is a prophet telling her sister I've watched her life under vision if there was anything there he said as your pastor he said I'm duty bound to tell you that there's nothing there sister this is but brother Branham I make so many mistakes Satan because of the sign she's born under making her question brother man says mister Bruce that's what the blood of Jesus Christ hey anybody make a mistake today that's what the blood of Jesus Christ is friend's brother sister I'm not talking about willful sin I'm just somehow making mistakes and we all do it but here's a sister that the Prophet the Prophet is telling her she's got the Holy Ghost and he's praying for her I'm gonna die if God doesn't do something he said sister you're not gonna die and she's still questioning because of the sign she was born on it because of the makeup that she has I know there's probably nobody here deals with that tonight but sister we all deal with this right here and the quicker we can bring that subject to the Word of God submit ourselves the sooner we're gonna be able to stop questioning those things brother Ben said if you really want to deliver and send your life he said just overcome that thing that that bothers you one time just overcome it once he said oh what a satisfaction what power what victory it gives you to overcome that thing and if you can overcome one thing well you can overcome the next thing and the next thing and the next thing and the next thing you know you're standing on the front line and you've got the full armor on and you're ready to meet every demon power you saw yeah it's just not that way it is it is the sister a preacher doesn't just learn you know because well God called me to preach hallelujah glory to god I'll tell you what I'm gonna do be careful that a man said a man has to learn to preach all right just like we have to learn to be Christians we have to learn to submit ourselves to the word and Satan's greatest tactic that he uses against us is to make us question thanks make us question was well what about brothers songs oh he was such a wonderful brother don't worry about brother songs I'll just keep going oh my god if brother saw himself belongs to God Satan can not get him we've got to have that kind of confidence but sister if that man belongs to God if that sister belongs to God something's going to bring them back we can't go in the rapture if they're part of that rapture until they're backed with need to be and if we got that kind of confidence with God and start praying in that matter with that kind of direction it'll change circumstances raised the Lord you know but my son came to prayer meeting Tuesday night he said dad I really want us to pray for this man that I work with he said his father has got to go in for emergency surgery tomorrow and I said well what's the problem and he said well they they told him that he had pancreatic cancer you know he went in for some tests and stuff and he had a date you know three or four weeks down the road but the doctors had called him that day and said he's got to begin here in the morning this is much more serious than what we thought it was and Joshua just put his hand on him and he said don't worry he said we're having prayer meeting tonight and we'll pray for that the man got in his car and took off went home the next morning at work he comes walking around got this great big smile on his face then he walks up to Josh and he said hey he said my wife just just text me he said they opened dad up there's no cancer there hey is that what does if I don't understand how that works I don't either but it works that's what matters I don't question how God's gonna do this just let God do it let God be God let him do what he wants to do the way that he wants to but the madam said they were complaining about God's one man message they were complaining about God's profit and that it caused them because of rejection of that leader it caused them to die in the wilderness he said tell me when God ever used a group to lead you won't find it in the Bible he said the word came to Moses and he said coral we all know he got himself all together and he complained about God not being just to do the thing that he did it to make one man with the message he said we're all holy I want to ask you a question where did he get that thought at Moses thinks that we're not holy Moses never said that the enemy planted that in their minds to make them think they were justified in coming against Moses well Moses thinks that were just not as spiritual as he is that's what it is he thinks we're not as high as he is like some people feel when they're listening to a tape and better Ben says look you'll never be any higher much a pastry praise the Lord the pastor can't bring you any higher and as he's there himself because the husband must be first protectors of the fruit he's got to move into that realm he can't give you direction on how to get into that realm unless he's there himself come on when brother Branham stood and told us about crossing over he wasn't making things up he'd been there he knew exactly what he was talking about another man him begin to describe Eve he wasn't making up a story he said I see her standing there in the garden he said the most perfect woman that's ever stood on the earth before he said her blue blue eyes and her blonde hair coming down her man said and I see them walking out of the garden brother Brendan said and say well let's think that maybe it was this way he said I see them but sister he wasn't just making things up when he told us about these things when mother BAM said we live in three three dimensions we live in like matter and time they sit down the fourth dimension he said that's radio and that's Airways never there now the fifth dimension that souls under the altar is those people have not repeating there that's where they go now the six dimensions where Christians go when they die in the seventh dimension is gone and you had people that were sitting out in there in the audience that had been in school all of their lives they're going I was talking to Perry green one time and he actually told me that there was a man in the in the meeting said he come to him and he says I don't know why this man says he's not educated he said this is a smartest man I've ever heard in my life but you see it wasn't his intelligence he was in another room when Jesus stood on the earth and he said father there's one thing I'd like to have he said let him be where I am he was standing right there with him mister brother branham didn't tell stories and he didn't project these things to us for us to talk about what a great messenger we had amen he had passed into that realm he was living under an eagle anointing he was flying above the nonsense the world did not affect him he lived it around with Jesus Christ and he was saying come up hither come up hither exactly the way the angel spoke to God and he said come up here and I will show you things that must come to pass here now look John was on the Isle of Patmos John was in the worst trial they've never been in in his life and there came the presence of guns that come up here a little higher with me it didn't take away Padma's but when he came out of there and went away from Padma's he never went back again came average history he never went back he never questioned what God had done for him he never questioned the revelation that he had been given but he knew it it comes straight from God he knew that that was what God's Will was for his children and he'd go back brother instead he said before the fifty little children love one another but John's love had come into a around come on read first John second John and third John and look at the way he writes come on just go to the Gospel of John and look at the way John writes compared to the way Matthew Mark and Luke wrote John wrote to the bride because he was a type of the bride he was in a different realm altogether hey man this bride is in a different realm all together brother sister hey man Silver's yeah life is so hectic in life is this enough that's the devil he's constantly doing something to get our mind off of what God's doing and look God can use that to mold and shape your character to bring you into that level that he wants you to be to bring me into that level that he wants me to be if I never had a trial I never had I'd never be able to tell somebody with good faith well I know a God that can deliver you well how do I know I never been delivered come on sister you know it's God in simplicity it's God in simplicity you know it's done I don't know what time it is but I gotta stop he's a lot he told me to be at home and this is what I do at home he's a lord let's bow our heads together tonight okay you're so easy to preach to God I mean you know I got a cute computer in front of me I preach to you all night but you know let's bow our heads together and let's think about the things that have been spoken because I know the Lord wouldn't put something on my heart or any other ministers heart if people didn't have needs I can tell right now not trying to be spiritual I don't mean it that way at all but I can just tell from looking on some of your faces as I preach the word some of you are dealing with those questions don't you just raise your hand to the Lord tonight and say Lord I believe the things that her brothers spoke up tonight Satan has tried to bring me an evil report Lord he's tried to defame you he's tried to take away the reality of just how real it is Lord he's tried to take away the things for me that'll give me victory in this hour evany father as we stand before you tonight Lord I certainly thank you for all that you've done in our lives Lord and I certainly thank you for the anointing of the Holy Ghost I realize father that coming into into a congregation of people and not knowing any person Lord and knowing that every one of us as human being has needs it pulls us back and forth all over the place sometimes Lord and brother branham even said one time and he said I'm not much of a preacher I can't hold a thought together but it really helped me because sometimes when that inspiration hits it's almost like I can't hold a thought together or but I believe if one of our brothers and sisters has got off the path I believe you'll get down off that path and you'll walk right down there beside them and bring them right back on the path where they need to be other as we stand here in your great presence tonight knowing knowing that you're more than able to do every single thing that you said that you would do in the world we submit ourselves to you tonight Lauren and we resist the enemy now Satan is gonna have to flee tonight Lord he's gonna have to leave these people tonight those that want to believe your word and those that know that their weapon is more than enough to defeat the enemy because this anointed word if the worlds were framed by the Word of God then that same word will defeat our enemy anywhere any place any time under any circumstance or the tonight Father in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I ask that you just moved through the people art you see the things that they're dealing with in their lives and the questions that are there and many times Lord a man loses a job and he begins to question you know Lord what what did I do wrong maybe he didn't do anything at all wrong horn maybe you just needed to get him in another direction you need to get his mind upon you so Lord let us do that tonight whatever our circumstance is whatever it may be Lord take those things father and direct our thoughts back to you direct our thoughts back to the promise of the word Lord that you said is anything too hard for God your arm is not short for it can do off or tonight in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I just feel that sweetness moving horn I asked your father to just brood over your people tonight Lord the prophets spoke of the world being in existence and how the Holy Spirit came down upon the earth and that Holy Ghost begin to brood over top of the earth or and as he begin to make love brother Ben said brood him and make love Lord and is you begin to make love to the earth those seeds that were there something begin to happen to him something begin to make a move something within them begin to respond to whatever that was that was making love hallelujah god help us tonight that we can respond to the Holy Ghost Lord as your desire is just to draw every one of us up into that realm Lord up into that place Lord we're not gonna leave our patent us as it were but just come up into that place where the word can come bring bring the revelation to us or bring us up into that place Lord what we're we're in fellowship with you even if we are on Patmos Lord even if we are going through a trial even if we are have been thrown in the devil's jail as it were we're having to fellowship with you just like Paul inside us raising up their hands and worshiping in the midst of that circumstance or you changed many lives in that circumstance father and I believe with all my heart Paul and Silas would have gladly gone through it again for the fruit that came from it Lord I pray today God you'd help us Lord to look back over our lives in the circumstances and the situations that that we didn't understand and many times even questioned Lord look back over it and see the fruit that you brought out of it but look back and see a people Lord that not tossed about with every wind of doctrine but if people have been stabilized by the Word of God that can stand in the face of all the demon powers of Hell and say i love you lord i love you i believe this word lord i'm going to allow you to have preeminence in my life because you've got a greater call for me lord you've got a higher realm for me to come into and i believe with all my heart lord there's a body calling there's something that's drawing me up higher lord i thank you for that tonight father in the name of the lord jesus christ I ask that you those that are in need of deliverance to not let that ministering spirit just minister to them right now lord other those that have sicknesses in their body we defy every demon of sickness what the word has been preached and you said that you sent your word and it healed the people yeah I believe tonight that we can just accept that Lord and go out of here with no sickness in our bodies we can go out of here totally delivered Lord because I believe you heard the cries of your people I believe you've seen the bondage that they're under what I believe you've seen the oppression of the enemy you've seen the struggles in the stress and the pressure of life or you you've seen those things and you come down here you came down to change their circumstances or father we just worship you tonight we ask you to just move among us right now Lord the

there's not one person not one Lloyd that father could be able to walk out of here tonight and honestly say and you did not speak to them personally for Lord we know that God you never miss the mark but you speak personally to each of our hearts Lord Father we can go through many times I've thought about Lord as the brother was ministering tonight Lord to think it's something that just even where the Prophet was sitting there in the message go tell he had such a bad sinus condition and Lord you had already made known to him the first and second pool and he was walking within that but as he was in this situation he looked over sister median he said sometimes I wonder if I'm even called and Lord sister meet him she looked at him and said you ought to be ashamed of yourself to even say that for what God has done nor to think how that the profit he took that at that moment and you spoke to him when they could not bring the fever down they could not do anything to get that condition under control but you spoke to him and this is what you said I've already confirmed the furtherance of your ministry all you need to do is accept it and he said that I accepted Lord that's all he had to do he said at that moment not only did everything begin to change but he said the fever broke the sinus condition broke it's to accept what you have already confirmed to us Lord father no doubt standing and sitting here in this building tonight there's many hearts Lord God that have already been confirmed Lord God by the genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost may we Lord Jesus rest within what you have confirmed Lord God other it's not the backing of an organization it's not the backing of a man it's the backing of Christ himself Lord Oh as we stand there as the Prophet said that little policeman standing on the street doesn't have no more power he couldn't stop a runaway Pony but he has authority Lord Jesus that's authority comes Lord by recognizing Lord who we are Lord Jesus that authority Lord where all heaven Lord is behind it Lord God because it's your word Lord and your fulfilling your word Lord in our lives lord what a rest it gives to us Lord you've not asked us to do anything but to have faith Lord you're the one who fulfills and you fulfill it in your way in your season and everything Lord and how that it's accomplished you do it all all that you ask for us is to believe Lord God and Father how what a rest that is to our hearts Lord I pray tonight Lord that you're God when we leave this place I know one thing Lord then I'm leaving here tonight closer to you than when I came in Lord Jesus I'm thankful Lord God for that because we we never leave out of here neutral we either live closer or we further wane Lord may there not be one tonight that would would leave farther away but Lord Jesus as you yourself the very answer of all questions have spoke to our hearts tonight we want to say thank you lord dear God we just ask that you would refresh your servant Lord father Lord give him strength Lord for the service even in the morning should you tarry father we give you all the praise honor and glory in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and have been good to be here hey man you know I think of what brother Brahim said in the prayer letter when he sent that out they said brother Branham would would write them in there he says and what you have to do is he says you have faith in God and you begin to call those things that are not as though they are and they said and the other thing is is that you need to start doubting your doubts and just believe God's Word you know that's the I've just listened to it earlier this morning brother Bram said I like this he said this covenant that God made with Abraham he said he didn't include nobody else in it remember God would say before if you will I will but in this covenant God said I will I have already and that wonderful and that same I became flesh that same I is here in flesh tonight that same I am in a wonderful all blessed be the name of the Lord O my all we have to do is yield he's the one fulfilling the word that's all we have to do is yield to him and you may God bless you tonight and then we'd certainly so appreciate each and every one of you for being here may God bless you Sheikh answer one anothers you're being dismissed in the name of the Lord [Music] is
