there's a happiness that the world never gave us there's a happiness that that no matter what the stock market is doing and everything else there's a happiness that cannot be taken away from us jesus would say it this way he said the joy that i give you no man taketh from you amen this is real joy amen serving the lord amen well we just want to prepare our hearts just turning into the word of the lord here this morning and as we are turning there to ephesians chapter 2 i want to just greet you on behalf of brother dave kress and i don't know maybe brother dave junior i don't know if there was a written request or anything so maybe i might be duplicating it but brother dave we wanted to thank you all brother dave senior wanted to thank you all for praying for him he had surgery there this past week and he just had come home yesterday he's doing he's doing well he's recovering and you know recovery is part of the healing process so he just wanted to thank you for your prayers and that's that you that we would just continue to remember him in prayer that god have just continued to strengthen him and just moving on his behalf as well and um i also i don't know if this was i couldn't hear it back there but um brother danny lewis remember them in prayer his mother had passed away on thursday morning and brother danny was actually in route to leave to go there to fly there because everything took a turn for the turn for that direction on wednesday evening and so he wasn't even out of the airport in cleveland when he had received the call so we just want to remember them in prayer brother danny when i spoke with him he just had asked that we would just remember them in prayer during this time all the arrangements everything that has to be done but it's not just that that's that's their mom and so you know that's that's that's something that we just want to remember them in prayer i know that what brother danny had told me uh over the course of time like this past summer we didn't see him here for a few months because brother danny had went and spent time with his mom she was in a nursing home and you know i know that she had talked about she wanted to go on home to be with the lord and you know so certainly she's went on to her reward and we want to pray that god will just comfort the family in this time in this hour aren't you glad that he's a friend that sticks closer than a brother amen aren't you glad that even when you or i don't even know what words to even say or how to even ask for to articulate what help we need we can just say help me lord help me and he he knows he knows how to minister to our needs amen so as we turn our attention we have a baptismal today uh sister rebecca savage will be buried in the name of the lord jesus christ amen be raised in a newness of life and also um i got back to my office on thursday night and i had a little note waiting on me and it was a note from my our youngest son zachary so he's going to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ as well so let's just uh before we read would you mind if we just pray and just ask the lord you take your need what it is that you've got on your heart and just ask god to say lord just speak to me just speak to me lord heavenly father lord we come to this moment in the service and we are lord so thankful that you you've given us a place that we can come together lord where the word it can be preached god the holy ghost will come and lord to demonstrate in power and to move lord through lives and hearts that even while the word is going forth lord where diseases are cut from people's life where sin dear god's hold is dismantled lord o god where faith begins to lord to move lord god in the hearts of your children and it causes satan to tremble lord we just ask right now may you come o god among us that same angel the lord that oh god as you spoke lord to moses and said my name is in him lord we ask here this morning god that you will just come lord and manifest your name o god lord just reveal oh god i pray your word to our hearts lord i ask that god as speaker and congregation the lord may we just lord be yielded and be sensitive lord o god you know the request lord that just comes from our hearts that just says lord speak to me and lord as you speak to us we're going to have that same simplicity as samuel did when he was just lord a boy and you called his name and the only thing that lord that he had to say was here my lord so father this is our request this morning lord that you'll just speak to our hearts in a personal way we've not come here to be seen lord we've come to hear from you lord we ask that you come lord in a special way through every part of this service lord and may you receive all the glory and the honor may there not be one need that would walk out of here lord unmet this morning lord i'm certain oh god that you're here lord and for the lord you said where two or three are gathered in my name i'll be in their midst also lord we just invite you now lord that you'll just take control o god lord of every spirit of every situation or god of every life we pray in the name of jesus christ amen amen ephesians chapter 2 verse 1. now what we're getting ready to read here we read from this on thursday night and most of you would be familiar with what a eulogy is we're getting ready to read a eulogy now as we know a eulogy is what is given at a funeral myself personally i've had to read a lot of them i don't like reading them because a lot of times i can't pronounce names and so i have to ask and i get all nervous and i try to phonetically write it out i'm giving you a little behind the scenes because sometimes i can't pronounce all those names now that doesn't mean i won't read the eulogy for your loved one but what i'm saying is as you understand that eulogy it talks about a person who was here but now they're no longer here they've they've moved on and we come there and as believers we realize that when we come to that of a funeral what we're going to bury is not that person we're going to bury the shell the house that that person that character lived in and so there's a eulogy you don't read a eulogy of a living person right i know sometimes people write their eulogy when they're still alive not me not me but we don't read the eulogy of a living person it's when someone has passed on so here's a eulogy written by the spirit of god of our lives and you hath he quickened made alive who were dead in trespasses and sins so i want you to see there was a part of you that was alive and there was a part that was dead the part that was alive needed to die the part that was dead needed to be raised where in time past ye walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and were by nature the children of wrath even as others now remember why why was it regarded as the children of wrath because we were under that first birth doesn't matter how good we were we can meet a lot of good people but remember a good person is not salvation if we if if people if if all god required was goodness he would have never rejected king he would have never rejected esau because esau was a much better man than jacob but when the holy ghost came hallelujah now we're talking a different story we're talking a man who now is living by the power of god now thou has power with god is that right so there has to be one to come and lift us from the judgment the condemnation of that first birth and that's only one could do that that's god look at verse four now he begins to speak of this but god who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with christ by grace ye are saved and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace and his kindness toward us through christ jesus for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god not of works lest any man should boast it's not what we quit is what he took amen amen for we are his workmanship created in christ jesus unto good works which god hath before ordained that we should walk in them amen i'll tell you this is one funeral where this eulogy is wrote right here this is a funeral that bring calls us some rejoicing this is a this is a eulogy when ministered and received and identified this funeral it causes rejoicing amen amen amen i'd like to continue to speak to you this morning on the sovereign working of the holy ghost may god bless you bless the word as you're being seated i want to come back into those places on thursday but i want to move where we were at and move just a little bit further and i know sometimes it's a little different and god will do things a little different i feel just to continue with on some of these parts right through service after service there's some things we're just trying to just being impressed of the lord to to come to we look at this and to know that when we speak of the sovereign working of the holy ghost we recognize that it's the same god in when we look back at genesis 1 where we find that the earth was darkness and void there wasn't any any life that was expressed upon it but when god spoke he began to speak now every seed was already planted that was there you couldn't see let's just say the tomato plant or the orange tree you didn't see that but the seed was already there but what was needed in order for the seed to come forth is the atmosphere had to change that was upon the earth you see it was an atmosphere that was was was preventing or not allowing that seed to come forth you see darkness itself the the earth itself in that in that condition in genesis 1 it shows that darkness had come there had been a separation from god's uh from from the from the very presence of god but now the word this is grace in genesis 1. now the word comes and says let there be light and god in speaking that word it now is speaking with authority to the darkness that is over the earth to give way that the light might have the right-of-way the preeminence and we all know this in the simple terms that light is greater than darkness even in the natural you can take a little a little match and you light a little match and this room could be completely dark with no windows but you light a little match you'll see that little flicker of light or you can take a a real dim flashlight a real dark room and that little that little itty bit of light it will still it will uh uh overpower the darkness but we we recognize that within this whole working in genesis 1 it is god moving back and changing the atmosphere in order to bring forth the desire and what he has placed within that earth those seeds to come forth now all it needs for that let's say that tomato plant that was planned planted there it it all it needs is the one who spoke it knows where it's at that he would send his light and the nourishment upon it and everything that is in it the characteristic of a tomato plant everything is already within that seed that seed will not have to try to look at other tomato plants and say well i wonder how i get leaves like that or how do i get tomatoes like that no no it's already in it the only thing it needs it needs now life something that is greater than itself to come and release it from the shell that it is inside now when we look at this god working and drawing us unto himself and when we see this we look in ezekiel 36 i want to go right back in there in ezekiel 36 24 god says for i will take you from among the heathen and gather you out of all countries and will bring you into your own land see it's god god calls for a separation then will i sprinkle clean water upon you that's the preaching of the word and you shall be clean from all your filthiness and from all your idols will i cleanse you you see once god brings them into a place it's important that to its it's a blessed reality that you can hear the voice of god and it's not just to hear it but that you've got a heart that will even be open and say yes lord that's all you got to say is yes lord that's yielding to him and then god's drawing you and his word is going forth to cleanse you you realize right now through this room there are waves that are passing through this room this this box that i have right here this transmitter there are waves that's going to a box over there and then it's channeled all through the wiring and this is what you hear over top of all the speakers and things but you don't see those waves you don't see them at all there's waves going through this room television waves there's wi-fi signals there's you know all these g's three four five and whatever more kind of g is going through this right now there are signals of cell phone calls there's voices going through here listen to me and i'm this is not i'm not speaking here of scripture this is science you know that but you recognize you don't see it you don't hear it but if you had a device something that was able to pick that up those waves and break in on that then it would no longer be something that is just out to error in the invisible it becomes something that is known is that right yes so we find how that god er how he moves by his word and i say that to to make this statement when we are setting and we're listening to the word let me just tell you something i i you know i've stood upon this for many many times in this old church you don't have to wait to a certain time of the service for all of a sudden the change to come the word while it's being preached while it's being preached the word can go right to work in your life god can move down so deep within a life that while that word is going forth this is scripture that they were filled with the holy ghost while the word was going forward demons were cut from their life sicknesses were cut from their life i want you to understand jesus said my words they are spirit and life he also told him that the kingdom of god he says it does not it's not something that comes visibly but it comes without he says without observation and the kingdom of god is the joy the peace and power in the holy ghost it's the word revealed and made manifest that what does it do it reveals jesus christ in all his power and authority to be the same yesterday today and forever i say it like this that that word going forth if you can just said in your heart to say i've come here to receive from you lord at your needs you watch how the word the word can pass right in to your being and you could have come in here all down in the dumps you could have come in here bound with sin you could have come in here empty but when the word passes through your life you then become that receiver of the signal that's being sent amen jesus said within this we find because this is the spirit of the lord jesus here moving verse 26 of ezekiel 36 notice what god said he will do a new heart also will i give you and a new spirit will i put within you this is nothing that we have done it's nothing you as a person can do this is what god said he will do [Music] and i will take away the stony heart out of your flesh and i will give you a heart of flesh this is all an operation of the holy spirit he is preparing amen that vessel that he might come and dwell in that life let me just say it like this just as the prophets of old were anointed by the logos by the holy spirit and they would speak and these prophecies that were laying in the scripture that would speak of the coming of the messiah it's the same way that with the working of the holy spirit in our life it is him that he is under we're under his operation and he is making a preparation for him to come just as he came in the body of his son of that flesh that was the coming of the lord is that right it's the same way the word goes forth to prepare for what the coming of the lord which is the holy ghost in you he's preparing his coming jesus could not come without john proceeding is that right there had to be a preparation boulders in the road when a king is traveling down this road boulder's got to be moved the roads got to be cleared out this is what the word comes to do it comes to clear things out for the word himself to come in and then look you see this is a new heart and a new spirit it's a very wonderful thing but the sad reality is that's where many people stop and i say many people i'm having numbers i'm just saying this right here this is where brother branham under the inspiration of the spirit of god would begin to go in preaching messages the impersonation of christianity what some people can't keep victory what does it take to live a christian life and go into messages after messaging and dealing with this because what it what was seen is there were lives that were up and down they were in and out up and down i'm not talking about a person getting down within where you can get down or discouraged but i'm talking about where it is alive that though god has touched that life they've repented of their sins but they come to a place and they get remember that first birth is a birth based on reasoning against the word i'm okay i'm a good guy i do a lot of good things for a lot of good people the rich young ruler had you beat he stood right before the lord jesus and said i've kept every commandment if he was lying jesus could have called him out but what he felt and what he failed in he didn't have eternal life and eternal life is not a commandment it is the person of jesus christ see this is what happens you see when brother brown would pray wouldn't deal with this he would make when the word comes let me just tell you something the devil gets all squirmy because he knows he's being uncovered because his whole plot and ploy is to rob you from what god has desired and intended for you to be and to notice if the uncovering of where we find that new heart and that new spirit and remember as we were looking there on thursday uh evening when when the bible says when the unclean spirit is gone out not cast out right not cast out when the unclean spirit has gone out when does the unclean spirit go out you know sometimes you know you look and you say well man i never seen this a devil cast out let me just say it to you like this every time when prayer is offered for the sick it's coming against the devil you take aware of life here healing comes in it speaks there's been a repelling a driving back of satan of the spirit listen that's why sickness comes in our body these bodies themselves the cells and and one more you can do whatever you want to you can suck carrot juice to your orange in the face there is you'll never bring this body to a place to where it's completely free and so immunized to where it'll never get sick there's weaknesses in our bodies in our cells this is why we need healing when healing comes what does it do the first thing is to cast out that spirit is to address that life when jesus came to the tree and fruit was not on it he said cursed be this tree for not having fruit amen what did he speak to the the life that was in the root and when they came out the next day they found the tree was dried up from the root see it comes it comes to deal within within that life in that new heart god giving a new heart and a new spirit that's a new way of thinking this is where people begin to say oh yeah yeah and it's a wonderful thing let me just understand don't misunderstand me it's a wonderful thing because it's a working of the holy ghost but it is not the holy ghost himself coming in it's him preparing because remember he's not going to come in with somebody who's disagreeable you'd be foolish to marry somebody you're arguing with all the time god's not going to do that well when he comes in i'll stop him to argue no he's working in a manner to bring a lamb like life if there's a seed on the inside it's lamb and it takes the lamb of god to bring that lamb to life what is that lamb doing it's where it begins to sacrifice it's where it begins to release it's where it begins to yield to the working of the holy spirit then the bible says see the heart the heart becomes open a new spirit it becomes open and see then god said in verse 27 and i will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and you shall keep my judgments and do them let me just say it like this i don't believe there's any person that begins their walk with the lord with the purpose or the intent of failing it's a walk that has to begin by faith he that cometh to god must first believe that he is and that he is a rewarded warner of them that do diligently seek him amen that's a gift of god grace comes by your way and it's not god's faith it's your faith grace comes by to cause your faith to rise for your salvation are you with me this is why as the working of the holy spirit coming in our life and this is why i i i just a very clear when a person surrenders their heart to god they're touched in a service do not get in your mind that just come into this church you've made it right because now you got a bible on the coffee table you've made it that's religion that's religion there are many in hell right now because they accepted religion instead of salvation amen come on now we're going to get somewhere he is to be the object of our desire amen it's him that's to be the goal if a person comes and i'm just being very frank if a person comes and says well i don't want to be a prostitute no more i don't want to be a fornicator no more i don't want to be a doctor no more i don't want to be a drunkard no more that is not enough you're just wanting to be a better person that's not what christianity is about christianity is about christ coming in you and then the attributes of his life you become a good person no one yields their life with the intent of well i just i want my life just to be swept out and garnished and cleaned up and i just want to make ready for that for the unclean spirit to come back with seven other devils nobody enters that is that right nobody does that but what happens is when a person this is understand this is where it becomes an impersonation of christianity where it becomes you or anybody trying to live a christian life without it being christ in you doing it it's an impersonation you're having to make yourself after a while guess what your will and your intellect will have to give in right you see what happens this is what happens when the unclean spirit has gone out a person can say man i used to drink i used to smoke i used to do this and i used to do that man i must really be on on the right cause i don't drink and i don't smoke and i don't wear pants no more i don't do this no more that don't mean that you're full of the holy ghost come on preach with me now you see what can happen is this is where unclean spirits when a person comes to a place that they're not going to move any further they begin to reason against the word well i'm a better person than i used to be i'm you don't want to just be a better person you want to be a holy ghost-filled person you want to be born again amen this is the desire this is the blessing that we would be invited to be partakers of because this many times is the reason why and i pray that god i just speak it right now i pray that every unclean spirit and every devil that would try to make people antsy walk away from their computer or walk away even here i bind every one of those devils that would want to try to hinder this working because he knows the power of this word of the holy ghost taking residency in that life and him being exposed he's uncovered he's powerless when god comes down brother brown would put it just as simple as this right here it's when god sends his bulldozer down praise the lord see those seven other devils coming in becomes a religious person remember what we read on thursday night it ended they become oh my they're a real bad drunk now or they're a real bad bad dope head right now or they're no no no they become religious that's the worst kind of devil there is is a religious devil that's the worst kind of devil there is but when the holy ghost comes down he comes down with the bulldozer hallelujah he comes down with the bulldozer in the backhoe come on now some of you many of you build houses i've been housing those you've seen those things take place when they there is a blueprint they have that lot it's already divided they come in there with a bulldozer first there's got to be men that can go around and move that dirt around level it out getting it into a place trying to get the the drainage right as much as they can before the backhoe comes in and the backhoe begins to dig the areas for the lines of water and sewer and all those things and begins to dig out where the basement's gonna go that is all part of the preparation for your house it takes that where a decision has been made and now there's work that starts on that lot there is that bulldozer there is that backhoe what is it doing it's preparing to lay a foundation it's preparing to build a house why because your desire is i'm going to live in that house that's how god works he is preparing when he sends down the bulldozer bulldozes out all the tin cans bulldozes and cleans it out he is preparing to come himself well he puts the drainage just right so the holy ghost it'll flow right out of your life he does not let me just tell you the holy ghost does not turn you into the charge and keeping of somebody else he comes himself and he's he's the caretaker matter of fact brother graham said the angels trim your bushes they are the landscapers because we're under his working amen is that right now this this sovereign working of the holy spirit jesus i'm just going to refer to some of these places in moving when jesus stands there talking to nicodemus here he comes and before this time he could never speak in terms that the time had arrived where a man or a woman could actually be born again we read in ezekiel and you see it all the way it's all typed out from genesis 1 all the way through of god's desire to come in redemption and dwell in the midst of his people is that right so the sovereign working of the holy spirit he begins to work within that life paul would call it paul would say it like this he would say great is the mystery of godliness it is the new birth is a paradox you can't explain it right you can't explain it but you know that it took place it wasn't an emotion the motion might have accompanied it but it was an emotion the new birth is the passing from death unto life and jesus here in john 3 he lays this fundamental this is this is the fundamental doctrine of the church of the living god he said ye without a man being uh born of water and of spirit he can't enter into the kingdom of god that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is spirit and notice he says marvel not that i say unto you you must be born again notice the words marvel not because a person marvel not they're trying to think trying to figure this out that's what nicodemus was trying to do how in the world can a man be born again does he have to enter back into his mother's womb that'll produce the same thing it produced the first time if it was possible because he that's born of a woman is a few days old and full of but there has to be that has to come forth a birth that is not of the woman tree hallelujah there has to come a birth that comes by the man tree the tree of life are you with me it would have to be his life so this is where the great uh mystery and the condescension of almighty god coming down and you see this is indeed where it is a mystery many people can look at your life and we don't have to go out there people can even look right in here and say well i don't understand it i i don't know how you know brother samuel or brother so-and-so or sister so and so i don't know how they do it you gotta know what your family understand is not the person's uh dna that's doing it there's some people who are some strong resolute people that says i'm not gonna drink that that's not good for business deals i'm not gonna do it they're a strong resolute person come on somebody there's people that can lay things down they stop this and stop that but you remember this is something that's so much greater it's not our works does the holy spirit come to energize us to lay things down yes he does by his sanctifying power don't marvel don't be perplexed about his work jesus goes on to say the wind bloweth where it listeth and thou hearst the sound thereof but can't not tell whence it cometh and whether it goeth so is everyone that is born of the spirit you're a mystery you're a mystery people can't figure out what's wrong with your life right god did a work in my life all the people said give him so many weeks he'll be back out here they knew they knew and i say this shamefully even the police couldn't straighten it up i had a lot of promises but right back at it why nature right nature our promises don't do anything but i can tell you this right here when god deals with the heart and you stand on that word and say god i'm finished with sin let me just tell you something he's their present to take you he's the one that's drawing you and he's the one to make sure and to see that that desire that he sovereignly is raising up in your life that it comes to pass remember there's not one person in her that can bring the word to pass but he brings his word to pass and you are a part of the word and he brings his word to pass hebrews 10 1 for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the thing the law gave sacrifices but it was a shadow the shadow it was not the very image can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers there unto perfect for then would they not have ceased to be offered because that the worshipers once purged should have had no more conscience or desire of sins now remember god can touch our heart and deal with the heart and that heart can raise because there's three stages to a birth right is that right water blood spirit justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost three stages of the sovereign working of the holy ghost now remember a person can repent of their scent wonderful wonderful i rejoice in that don't you if you don't something's wrong i rejoice in that now they could repent of their sin and they receive forgiveness from the sins that they committed but here's the thing if they don't go any further than that they're still the snake on the inside the very root or cause of why they did those other things forgiveness is like you snapping off the dandelion and the roots still there it'll come back it'll come back is that right so forgiveness is a wonderful thing but want to go deeper to where that the very snake is removed because that's a real problem see god deals with the heart to bring it in forgiveness for you to recognize there is indeed forgiveness for me through the blood of jesus christ i don't care how rank or how vile i don't care how a person is oh brother samuel this age you know this age is filled with all sorts of stuff it's already been covered in the word of god i'm sure that coral corinth those who are in corinth they wouldn't walk in here today and blush they would not walk in this world in blush but god let them know where where they came from he let them know their past their past had been removed he let them know because there was a process that they had been brought through to complete victory so when we recognize when we when we see that this perfection that god was calling for it would never come by offerings perfection doesn't come by offerings the offerings in the old testament it only covered sin in other words they were forgiven when they came and offered that sacrifice they were forgiven but you see the coming of the very image the true sacrifice the lamb of god there would come forth the holy creative blood of god peter would call it the blood of christ and that would pay the ransom the payment required for sin in order that we could go free let me just tell you something i understand over 2000 years ago that that event of calvary was made manifest it was there in the mind of god before adam started us to molecule revelations 13 8 that the lamb was slain but from for the foundation of the world before the devil ever was before there was ever god already had the plan set amen what was the plan that his children though his children would be separated by a birth that would come from reasoning against the word but he would come by his word and deliver his children that were trapped in that first birth that did not ask to come that way but they were trapped like an eagle in a zoo the eagle dries up and he wants to get out and it comes back down it flies up why there's something in it that is built to fly and the cage the bars are keeping it from escaping but there's got to come one who's able to set that eagle free and when he sets that eagle free it don't become an eagle it always was an eagle now it escapes the bondage [Applause] so god came down the very image wrapped himself in a blood cell hallelujah many great men abraham elijah on and on but every one of them were polluted blood everyone came just like you and me there had to be a blood that could deal with the sin question there had to be a blood that could pay the debt this was not a time of covering it was a time of redemption amen amen glory be to god see he would come in the likeness of sinful flesh he would take upon him as the bible said the seed of abraham he would experience every weary feeling that you or i feel right he would experience every temptation he would experience every sickness he would experience all of that and then in full obedience walk to calvary and pay the price shedding his blood he would descend into the lowest parts of hell and deposit our sin debt there and he would come triumphant marching right down up through the corners of hell stop in paradise empty out paradise and lead them up here in a resurrection is that right what was it it was the working of almighty god to destroy the works of the devil this is why it's a blood that comes to you and i a blood this is let me just i'm being very purposeful here this this blood it don't just forgive you many times i think the the thing is people want to they experience the forgiveness and thinks that's deliverance forgiveness is not deliverance forgiveness only makes way for your faith to say i can be delivered amen forgiveness is where they feel oh my you know i feel the lord lifted off and i feel this and that's a wonderful thing listen friends we we need the forgiveness of god even after we've crossed the line we we uh you know and from death unto life we still are things that where we die daily but it's not something in our nature i don't want to go there but you understand there's got to be a blood a power that comes that's not something that's presented to you and i that it's just forgiveness but it's something so much deeper than forgiveness it's where you come to a place you're no longer identified with that old man he's dead funeral has been preached a eulogy is being read amen will they come and say i remember when you this i remember you know what you do you you remember the house but the guy used to be here he left he got evicted how did he get evicted well you see the holy ghost came and began to energize my faith i began to see something greater than what i had ever saw you see i've been trying to satisfy my thirst with all other sorts of things but i realize that'll never satisfy my thirst and there became one around my my my pathway you know you know like the woman at the well and he began to deal with a real thirst that was in my life that nothing could satisfy or quench and when he began to stir my faith how was he doing that he was doing that by his word they weren't playing an organ they were not playing a piano his word was creating an atmosphere for faith to take hold it was his word that was going forth her life she came to that well it was covered with darkness but the word began to move forth and the spirit was there to perform what the word had spoken amen no no no the guy that used to live here you don't live here no more amen it's time to do ownership see a new heart and a new spirit it can get ashamed why don't you quit doing this well you see what it is the science said you know this and science said that and or sometimes people say well you know my church teaches this so it ain't yours you're ashamed of it come on now preach with me a new heart new spirit he can get out there among the people and he starts getting ashamed you know why because it ain't standing on solid ground come on now i'm not i'm not i might be scolding you but this is spirit of god uncovering satan's working in your life i tell you out of these services god's bringing forth you're either going to move on into victory or you're going to go further in defeat it's your choice what you do with the word of god amen amen but i promise you this i'm sure the holy ghost he's going to keep on working and dealing and moving in our life you see there's a blood that comes to loosen us this is why paul i don't have time to read these statements over and over but paul would deal with not just how that the lord jesus was crucified because he had to be crucified he had to pay the penalty for you and me but remember paul would go on to say how in that he died he died only once and whoever is dead is made free paul would deal with this crucifixion and he would he would he would emphatically express that by jesus christ the world is crucified to me and i'm crucified to it he would say that every believer for every child of god has crucified the flesh and the affections and the lust thereof in galatians 2 20 let me pick this up he said i am notice this testimony i am crucified with christ nevertheless i live yet not i but christ liveth in me not what i'm struggling to do christ is living in me this coat is like the body it just so happens that this coat in this suit did not get purchased by somebody going to a bar right it just so happened that it got purchased purchased by by a preacher you see it but but the shell itself the coat it could have only gone wherever who was wearing it went right it wasn't the coat oh the coat says go into the bar no it was whoever wore it took it to the bar there you and i the coat our life our tabernacle our vessel our tent our body remember it was the nature within us that caused us to go certain places do certain things no matter how much you try to resist it it's the nature within the coal how do i do do i got to get a different coat no you need to get a new man inside the coast when you get a new man inside the cove you don't have to worry about the cult going to the bar because it's a new man that he don't want to go to the bar you've got a new man on the inside that don't want to have the things of the world why he is a new man but a religious man will say ah it don't hurt it's all right look at me i'm a good guy this is all right everything's fine well don't bother me to look at you know don't bother me look at women i can look at women or women are beautiful oh look at this right here it don't bother me to drink he don't bother me looking pornography he don't bother me to do this right here if it don't there's a problem i said if it don't there's a problem but there is an antidote i know they're looking for a vaccine for covid they're looking for treatments brother let me tell you something the word don't come to bring treatments the word comes to fascinate you against sin we can live in that pastor's office to your blue in the face and i'm blue in the face it ain't the pastor's office or counseling that'll change you i'm talking about a god that's here this morning that can change you transform your life [Applause] hallelujah oh jesus somebody say sweet jesus come he's here this is the sweetness of the holy spirit i'm crucified with christ nevertheless i live yet not i but christ liveth in me and the life which i now live in the flesh the life that's in here that i'm living in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me well i thought he paid the debt for the sins of the world he did but you see this is a personal revelation right when that revelation becomes personal not about pastor mama daddy but for you then that's when things change amen now let's look at this because as we were reading in ezekiel 36 god had said i'll give you a new heart and a new spirit i'll take the stony heart out of you and i will put my spirit within you now we recognize he said i'll put my spirit in you i cause you to keep my judgments uh judgments i'll cause you to keep my statutes in other words he is saying i will come and live my word out through you in hebrews 8 10 this is a covenant that god is speaking of he says for this is the covenant that i will make with the house of israel after those days saith the lord i will put my laws into their mind now remember moses went up to the mountain when he went up to the mount he received the laws of god is that right thou shalt not and that was glorious glorious but remember what the law did the law only pointed out you're guilty you're guilty you're guilty i mean the guys don't pull you on don't pull you over here to pull you over and tell you what a nice-looking car you got they might do that to kind of sweeten the deal the ticket they're going to give you but they pull you over because you have broke the law now don't look at me funny as soon as you pass one down the road you're all of a sudden looking in the mirror and you know all of a sudden just my everything now it's not in a hurry anymore let's just settle down why because fear takes hold because you're thinking oh my are they going to have grace or is law going to come down on me is that right now notice here here comes moses with the laws now remember where they wrote in tables of stone but you see as long as they were in tables of stone they could never change nobody but those tables of stone were represented if it was only a type of where that the word now listen to me now where that the word would be received moses was god's prophet here the word would be received but then that word when it's received there was that where the word was to go forth to the people to where that that word would actually be placed into the lives and hearts of the people let me keep reading i will put my laws into their mind i will write them in their hearts and i will be to them a god and they shall be to me a people notice this is the sovereign working of god god is putting them in the right place and they shall not teach every man his neighbor every man his brother saying no the lord for all shall know me from least to the greatest for i will be merciful to their unrighteousness and their sins and their iniquities will i remember no more isn't that isn't that wonderful that every man shall know the lord from the least to the greatest or greatest to the least it wouldn't matter what the status is this is where the spirit of god would move down upon paul and paul would be able to pick this up this inspiration and let the gentiles know that though in a way it was all hidden in the old testament but god intended to visit you god intended to take you as a people for for his name sake paul would begin to minister these things of the truth and he would let him know there maketh no difference whether jew or gentile it'd make them no different circumcised or uncircumcised paul would even think of it in the same church paul would have those who was a master and there would be his slaves that would be sitting there or servants that would be there now when you think of slaves and things like that you can't think of it in terminology to how some of our history has written things because even when i go to the philippines and other places like that even times in africa they will have sometimes they will have servants they're not slaves they're people who actually will work in their house help keep the house clean and they actually help you know provide food some of you would call that a maid or you would call that you know a cook or cleaner or whatever more but you understand paul would have to by the spirit of god express that he that how god has called you he did not call you because you were a master neither did he call you because you were a servant he lets him know it's god's grace no matter what your rank is in society whether it's up here or it's down here that makes no different to god because god does not call you based on the ranking you are with the world he's calling you out of the world he's not trying to highlight your ethnicity your nationality he's not trying to highlight your cultural heritage he's not trying to highlight your first birth what he really wants he wants to annihilate or kill that first birth that he might step inside and you become a new creation hallelujah oh you don't understand the baggage i've got jesus specializes in that amen his reputation is made on those the prophet said even he said you could take a woman that could be so foul that the dogs won't even hal her name but he said you let god take a hold of that woman you let god come and change that woman's life you let god change that man's life god will clean that life up by his holiness to where holiness sets down on the inside that is a paradox the work of the holy ghost how powerful their sins and iniquities will i remember no more praise the lord let me just try to wrap up on this point is that all right we're just trying to wrap up here on on these things beer sins and iniquities i will remember no more now to think of this i will be merciful and then we truly we need and we are so thankful for god who is rich in mercy because if we got if we got what we deserved all right now you might be able to say well i was a goody two shoes you know i i knew all the sunday school verses you were still a child of wrath you needed to be born again memorized in scripture it's not the new birth knowing the message is not the new birth knowing god sent a prophet is not the new birth believing it's the truth is not the new birth but the new birth is where that life has come in you by the word for that day and you are birthed into jesus christ where it's no longer you trying to live a christian life christ comes in and lives a christian life through you amen mercy oh my what mercy is given you see let me just let me just dwell with this very much because this this is a um a very tremendous reality on on the baptism of the holy ghost because we we recognize of the new birth because when you recognize that in so much of what is called new birth or being born again has been so misconstrued when people have uh you know there's those the churches that you know teach well when a person confesses the lord jesus christ as a savior he is saved but the bible says he believeth unto salvation and paul said that that you you heard the gospel of your salvation afterwards you were sealed not when you heard it and believed you were sealed after you first had to hear it first had to respond it's all a working of the holy ghost but you see notice this is god listen to me now this is god coming in this hour this has to be clear because it's got to be clear for rapture god has ordained you and i to live as sons and daughters of god in this hour to walk by faith to walk with a faith where enoch walked let me just tell you to walk with the faith that'll stand right in the face of the devil and say you're a liar stand right in his face and say you ain't nothing but a bluff come on now what are you talking about i'm talking about as our husband was a serpent bruiser we are anointed to be a serpent bruiser [Applause] let me just say it like this you take a man that was bound with drinking bound with pornography bound with all those things you let god transform that man's life i tell you right now there'll be a witness coming out of that man's life or you let somebody's been a church member they've sat in a church for year after year you let god energize that life that person will be a witness of a living god and they'll be there to encourage the others brother he did it for me he'll do it for you [Applause] you let god take a hold of that life why they'll be witnesses unto him by what power the power of the holy ghost that put you into service what are you doing well i got some more steak on this plate just trying to this is the mystery that part we just wrote and wrote it right here in the beginning there was a part of you that was dead that was that seed of god a desire to serve god right knowing that there is a god knowing that there's got to be more there's a seed but it was dead like the seed you go to plant your corn tomatoes marigolds on and on and on it's dead right is that right now there has to come a certain water or water that's able to when water comes up on the sea probably i'm probably not speaking to people you know this you take seeds and they are hard i don't care if they're a little lettuce seed looks like a you know it just looks like a i don't know it's just a you know a little little something it's hard it's hard you know what you have to do you bury it and when you bury it you water it what does the watering do the dirt that that seed is encased in it takes that water and what the water does is it begins to soften the hardness that's in that seed because there's a germ on the inside of it but it needs to be delivered of the hardness so the water comes to break down that hardness that's why there is the preaching of the word this is why jesus said except the man be born of the water and of the spirit the water is the word the preaching of the word makes you aware it brings conviction because the spirit travels through the world is that right you must be born of the water and of the spirit it listen it takes two that it takes two to have a birth i mean my wife didn't have those children on her own right those guys they look like me sorry about that some act like me sorry about that it took two come on now it takes two you have the seed of god on the inside of you but you need the quickening power to come and raise that up is that right it takes the father and the mother it takes here the father is the word the spirit we are born of that new jerusalem who is mother of us all the spirit of god coming down with that word to deliver birth to deliver sons and daughters of god to deliver word birth outside of the word and it's just spirit it could produce false births false sensations false evidences come on somebody is why god sent sends his word this is why we must be born of the water and of the spirit everybody okay i know you're getting nervous you're saying i say i'm coming down that last point but i i don't want to fly through it right right that seed was dead when god dealt with your heart and you repented listen to me you were not repenting for the seed that was dead inside of you that was the potential son and daughter of god how can something that's dead commit sin the seed the seed of god the son and daughter of god on the inside when you were sitting on the bar still drinking it wasn't the seed of god that was their drinking but neither could you be recognized as a son or daughter of god in that condition but there had to come a call like it did to the prodigal what's he calling to he's calling to the sea that's on the inside talking about receiving a signal as it's moving through the building what is it that receives the signal it's the seed of god on the inside flesh profiteth nothing the flesh will say i get tired man when just gotta hurry up man just gotta go here but the inside man says keep it coming jesus see the inside man says it like this inside man does not look at it and say oh yeah you already passed that checkpoint oh yeah i did that it's not that's not what a spirit filled believer does it takes god's word and they keep on the roots keep on growing deeper and becoming more established let me just tell you something these words that god is speaking right here in these services is not just trying to lead people in the path of life and to show people that path into sonship it's much deeper than that even it's to bring you and i who have even crossed into that place that your faith might even be firmly more established when i repented you repented i did not repent for what a son of god did or a daughter of god the seed was dead we were dead in sin and trespasses are you with me but now when the quickening power comes it comes to raise up that seed that was planted there that was god knew from his mind that which was in god and when you drop from your mother's womb and you took that breath of life that seed was already there in you that's why you couldn't fit in this is why oh you don't know all the darkness you don't know all this a lot of darkness a lot of things but remember the seed is what he's coming for as soon as that seed is quickened it's over i said it's over sealed to the day of your destination it's over you now have a different man inside the coat a different man inside the coat you see this is where within this this is why brother brown would take this example and you've heard this many times but he would talk about in the message rapture he also speak of this an invisible union of the bride of christ and see this is where he says let's just say for example and brother i was dealing with the fact he said i've always preached that jesus he was deity it was not just a man it was god condescending god coming in flesh then we look at our lives and to see that within our lives brother branham would say the bride is not just washed she's not just forgiven she's justified and then he takes the little story of where brother greene could come to him and brother greene you know uh maybe had heard that brother says had heard that i had been drinking and and doing all sorts of things and then when he come to me and brother green said brother brown am i heard you were drinking and brother brown said not me all right what you heard was wrong i hadn't been drinking see he never did it accusation had come his way but he never did it right now watch out brother and goes you forgive me i didn't do it what are you forgiving me about but if i'm guilty now listen to me if i'm guilty i can be forgiven but i'm still not just because i did it but you see when the blood of jesus christ is come it cleanses us from sin till it's put in the book of god's forgetfulness he's the only one can do that i feel sorry for them guys that go sat in the booth and talked to talk to another center on the other side some of them guys i'll tell you what's the truth or vile and everything else and talk to him a man can't save you a man can't take blood for you amen come on somebody that's only a copycat there's a real mediator there's only one mediator between god and man and that's the man christ jesus there's only one man he won't just forgive you he'll take the very nature that made you do it in the first place that's greater than forgiveness thank god for forgiveness but we're talking about being justified how can we be justified when that new man that new woman on the inside is raised up by the power of god you might have all these things in your memory and the devil try to haunt you and point things out in your memory but remember when the quickening power has come and has raised up that seed it's a new life brother it's a new creation you and listen there you stand justified you never did it though dwelling in this body this body held certain things clicked on certain things did certain things but yet remember this body was moved remember this body was moved by the life that was in it but soon as you get somebody different inside of here hallelujah this suit might have been worn by a politician now it's too cheap right it could have made all sorts of promises and done all sorts of things but you see it's not the suit it's who's in it it's who's in it you know oftentimes we have baby dedications and those are wonderful times i know my my wife really likes those times and we all we rejoice right but you realize when that baby comes it's innocent right innocent and you think my goodness it's so innocent but do you realize that graham said when you've been born again you're actually more innocent than that child is how can that be because you were once dead yes the sins that were committed in this body there was another life that was in there and there had to come forth a crucifixion a death that that one who was dead might become alive where it comes to a place where it's it's a love affair it's no longer you or me it's no longer as paul said i that liveth but it's christ who liveth in me see when this has come you don't have to look over your back you don't have to look at who's around right you don't have to wonder because you're not putting nothing on you're not acting you're not impersonating it's genuine from the inside amen no longer i who liveth but christ who liveth in me oh my see now it's his life that's operating through that seed word that's producing just exactly what he himself had called for i'm going to stop right here i'm just going to stop here this morning but i believe with all my heart i believe with all my heart that it's god's desire to sovereignly work in our lives in our hearts and if there is something there in your life if this today no matter where where you're at you might be a person and you might have said man i wonder why my life was always up and down in and out i couldn't get much further because than this today but you realize friends we're not just talking about living a good life people can live a good life and there's a big difference between being a christian and a spirit-filled christian big difference a new heart and a new spirit a wonderful thing but you don't want to stop there you take the word and you apply the word in your life it wouldn't do you listen i can lay my hands on you and i believe with all my heart that quickening power a portion of that that god has allotted to me it works in my life but i want you to understand i can't make nobody live a victorious life you could come live in my house you being around me is not going to make you live a victorious life you understand what i'm saying right here's the real miracle of it if you were to take you were to take a pig i take a pig and i bring the pig into my house that pig is gonna eventually it might like some of the scraps i give it you might like some of the food it might be you know everything else around for a little while the thing about it is it still has a desire and a nature on the inside i could put a bow tie on it i could bathe it in buttermilk man i could make it a shiny nice guy and man i could really clean him up and but he's still a pig right in his nature are you with me the first chance i get up in that patio door and that screen he puts that nose on that screen he starts watching my movements i know he goes to open that door at eight in the morning tomorrow morning i'm getting out why there's things out there that still have a pool still have a pull well what has to happen if we can get to that nature on the inside and you take out of that nature a pig now you look at the outside and say oh that's a pig i mean that's how we do from from little kids we look at something oh that's a pig you know we have those things p.i.g pig and we learn to identify something by the outside but there are characteristics that we know about a pig is that right we know kids like mud and pigs like this and pigs like that characteristics what are those characteristics those are attributes of its nature if you can get to the inside of that pig and you can bring a change of its nature in other words take that nature out of a pig and put the nature of a sheep on the inside somebody look at me like what are you talking about it's a simple expression of the new birth god taking that nature of a pig that lights the world the mud and everything else and he puts in that nature of a sheep hallelujah i don't have to worry about that pig zame boy i wish i could get out that mud hole no his nature's changed what has happened he's received victory he's got victory over every mud hole he's got victory how does he get victory because there is the nature of a lamb of a sheep on the inside he don't have to make promises oh five days without this whoo ten days without this no he's past from keeping of days and times new moons he's passed to a place to where he's at rest no longer i that liveth but christ that liveth in me i'm taking a little bit of time i'm not near where done but i trust that this right here i trust that god spoke to your heart listen friends if the word comes and it's cutting i don't apologize for that i don't want to see no one miss it i want to see everybody make it but we don't make it with pats on the back we've got to come god's provided way and i'm standing right here today as a witness and there's other witnesses right throughout this room of god performing a paradox taking the nature of a pig and raising up that nature of a son and daughter of god amen what am i talking about where here we are walking in the word walking in the light of god in this hour amen living for him not a struggle but a pleasure what burden a burden a burden to serve god what burden he said my burden is light amen yoke is easy that's his word for his work and i say this morning if you're in that place this morning come up higher come up higher don't just take a new heart and a new spirit come up higher but something you don't understand i've got certain things i'm talking i've got certain things in my life don't make excuses right what does the things in your life how can that compare to the power of almighty god amen we're not talking about you licking your spots and you becoming a better person we're talking about the power of god coming and transforming we're not even talking about when here you recognize when god has moved into our heart and that transformation has come we are resting in his working we're yielding to his word his word is what's pulsating in our life it's not me it's christ let's pray heavenly father lord jesus you know every need lord that's here before us your god when the word is spoken as you deliver it then lord your spirit comes to move lord god in behind that word and to perform what lord you have called for now lord i ask your god not only for hearts and lives that are gathered here those that lord are streaming or will archive this service lord god i ask lord jesus but lord may you just deal so personally with every heart and i pray god that lord fear that would try to take a hold may it be driven back lord doubt and unbelief may it be driven back lord in the name of jesus christ may o god their eyes not be upon themselves but may their eyes be focused upon you and lord if they've walked with a new heart and a new spirit that's a wonderful thing lord but god as they recognize like if they would go to a doctor and a doctor they would let the doctor know i'm having this pain or i'm having this condition or this is bothering me at night or this the doctor will pull from his knowledge of symptoms that are known by the person [Music] and then he once the diagnosis is made he will make a prognosis he will tell them things either to do or to avoid even to write a prescription and that is to address why it is the need and why they're there now lord the new heart and new spirit in the removing of that stony heart that's a sovereign work of you lord that you're working in that life so we don't we don't despise that we know that you're working it takes you to take a heart that would be so cold so hard so indifferent towards the word of god and it takes the warming rays to begin to move on that life and begin to turn it to where it begins to be open to the things of god it takes you lord god to come around and set a mind in order for holiness where they begin to think in holiness lord beginning lord to apply that faith and laying things down it takes you lord coming and moving in that life because you're the object you're the object lord you're the reason you're the reason that a heart or life would repent and be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ the lord you're the reason it's you they want to be united with you [Music] now lord i pray right here this morning god may there be hearts honest hearts that are before you then lord that they can make that declaration this morning say lord i don't want that up and down no more i want to i want to be right back in there with that hidden part that hidden life lord i want that desire where you come in fully lord and you control my emotions you control my being lord i ask the lord god you move in such sovereignty such simplicity i ask right now god for every heart and every life that god that you have lord call to and they lord responding i ask lord god that you would move lord for that heart that's your mercy lord you're merciful and i pray dear god [Music] may you lord may their faith be placed in you who begun the good work to finish it may their faith be in you lord and god i ask lord that you'll do that in their life lord according to their faith lord grant it lord i pray if there's one here this morning that doesn't know you lord and their heart is stony but god the holy spirit has been moving around and whispering to their heart my son i'm calling you my daughter i'm calling you lord i ask god the lord as the brooding of the holy spirit has been brooding oh god father by your word lord upon their lives i pray that god that they lord jesus would make that stand lord for you and say yes holy spirit here i am lord i'm coming i'm coming lord lord i pray lord for hearts and lives [Music] living out as witnesses lord they know what it means to where it's not something they're trying to do they're not trying to live a good life but lord it's where the love of god has come into their heart that's a precious precious reality lord may they lord god just take that ponder that rejoice and continue to yield to your working lord as you would continue to move in their heart and life bringing every leaf every fruit all everything that is packed in that seed it's now moved from potential to reality [Music] may they just lord water it day and night [Music] looking to you father may it be that comfort lord be with us lord as we come into this moment lord we

been dealing with her heart for well since back in in january but even right here in in one of the services i noticed where she really had made a stand for god well at that still at that point she hadn't spoke anything about being baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ yet she had god had already been dealing with her heart and it was uh two weeks ago i think it was this this coming monday his uh i was out walking and you know listening to him music or not music but one the message at the park and out i walked right by sister rebecca and my mind is on what i'm listening to so i didn't even hi and i kept going and as she just to make this short we came back around i came back around and then about that time where i was before she came right back through that area and i agreed i said sister rebecca forgive me i didn't even remember my mind you know and we began to talk and it was the very first things that she expressed out of her heart she said the first time that i saw she said when i saw you i just had finished praying in my heart god make a way so i can talk to brother samuel i'll be being baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ now i should have been out there early that morning walking but there was a lot of things that came up but you know what god had everything arranged and we just thank god for the for god still moving with hearts and lives that are tender and sensitive to his voice no matter how hard the spirit of this age is jesus christ in his tenderness can overthrow every bit of hardness so we want to go to prayer and just ask that god will just cap off the work we know that the lord you know already we baptized brother drake there back in october last year almost a year ago now and just a wonderful thing that god is doing and let's just go to the lord in prayer we want to just pray for our sister and what a wonderful step that she is making amen let's just pray together could we heavenly father lord as we just come to you lord with thanksgiving thank you lord god for this heart that lord that you have touched her life lord and that god that it would be turned lord it would be surrendered to you and lord with a desire lord to to walk pleasing to you and i pray that god that is lord you moved upon her life in that way and as she stands here dear god a sovereign working of the holy spirit lord to leader into the water of water baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ i pray that god that as you said lord that he that will not be ashamed of me and my words in this generation i'll not be ashamed of them god i ask lord god that father made that same quickening power that raised up lord the body of our lord from the grave lord may that same holy spirit oh god come lord god and finish the work lord god in the life of my sister i pray for that's her desire lord it's you and you alone we ask it in the name of jesus christ amen sister rebecca according to the confession of your faith in the lord jesus christ

so thankful to god's mercy and grace for how that the lord is so dealing with hearts and lives it don't matter what age you are when god deals with your heart all it takes is some simple obedience to his voice and you know um probably i could have my mom come over here and give the testimony more than i could but you know zachary a lot of times since my dad had passed away he'll go and you know spend time with with uh with my mom and times at different times back and back and forth you know keeping her company as well and well you know he's he's heard the preaching he's we've talked at different times but he happened to be down there the one time with his his mammal and they were reading the bible in the morning and they began to talk about water baptism that was on his heart and um began to talk about that he had already given his life to the lord and um then at that point in time it really really began to dealing to take a further step to really you know because that's tied together repentance and baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ and so after this past thursday service i walked in the back room and i i didn't see the note but my wife found the note and she brought it over to me and uh on on the note he said i want to be baptized too and you know i know that that it's not it's something that god has to do the work in a life you know it don't matter how much as parents parents we want to see god working our children but we can't make our children christians we can't make our children serve god but i'm glad that god's put something greater on the inside of us where he changed us and then we've got confidence that the same god who got a hold of our life he's the same god for their life and that's where our confidence is in the working of the word in our own life so we just want to pray for him we want to lift him up prepare and ask god the lord will just continue to take him on i told him here just last night i said son you just keep walking in simple obedience god speaks to your heart you say yes lord walk on because everything in him is yay and amen let's just pray together heavenly father lord as we come here lord one more time

have lord than my children would serve you fully and that lord their lives would be filled with the goodness of god with what you did for my life and their mama's life but lord we know that it has to be you to do that and we're so thankful that god that you have placed within us a confidence a place a ground that we can rest lord in your working and that's for every parent in here lord god we can
