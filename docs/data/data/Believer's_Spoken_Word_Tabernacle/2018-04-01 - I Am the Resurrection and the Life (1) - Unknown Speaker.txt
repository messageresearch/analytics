she make her way forward she's gonna give us a testimony at God's grace and then and then we'll take the prayer quest for the Lord God still answers prayer amen just a quick testimony I don't want to take too much time from the word last night my mother called me and she said that uh my brother gave his heart to the Lord so mean so for those who does not know the story and I just quickly in a nutshell I was we were I was seven when my father passed away my brother was ten and since then my brother took it really really hard and he never really recovered from it he from moving to having everything we moved to having nothing and that just was hard and my brother so he he went out on the streets on a very early age and he was out there hustling believing that that's the way he had to do things in order to help my mom and but then by doing so he got involved with a lot of bad friends and people and he started abusing alcohol and drugs at a very early age when my brother and I kind of took two separate ways I went to the far extreme of trying to seek the Lord's face and he went the other way and I think the foundation started when I was in a convent and so I then took the approach of I we need the Lord we need the Lord and my brothers like no we need to get out there in the world and do something about our situation so he it was really bad it got really really bad I'm I'm talking about you know you have people that's out there in the world and they abuse alcohol and drugs and they kind of just stick to themselves my brother was the aggressive kind he would come home and he'll you know break down doors and windows and you know threatened to you know set us on fire and you know do stuff to us and you'll just want to beat us all in the house and and I was the one that always used to stand in between him and my mom and take the punches for her so it was hard but it you know so you know I'm talking about a guy that um it got so bad that he he would literally hurt everyone out there I mean I witnessed a time that um I was out with him and they had he attacked they attacked him and his reigns attacked a guy I don't know where he was coming from they attacked him and you know took his shoes and his wallet and there was just something fun you know witness I give it to mama I'm talking about a guy um he got in so many fights and he just wanted to attack everybody he was the strongest man he he was under the influence and I mean you when you're out there and you hurt so many people you make enemies so instead of my brother being the one coming home and fighting us you know we had to be afraid of people out there enemies that wanted to hurt us you know and my brother would take advantage of their sisters and guys we've been trying to hurt his sisters you know me and my two other siblings and we would be so afraid if my brother comes home we would just lock the doors and just stay in there or will flee to friends neighbors and so forth I'm talking about a guy that tried to commit suicide on so many different occasions talking about several overdoses he would drink and use drugs together being beat up so many times I remember one time he was close to death could blow with a baseball bat to his head crack crack the skull and blood on his brain we thought we'd lose him you know it's it's it's bad when you get to a point as a Christian I was at the time Pentecostal it's bad when you get to a point where you ask God to rather take his life it's better to cry once at a funeral and for the rest I had to repent that many times God to forgive me for it and just seem that there was no hope to this day 22 years we've been praying 22 years God still answers prayer [Applause] my brother city he sat there and the minister was preaching on enough is enough my brother said he doesn't know what happens to him he just felt someone pick him up and drag him take you to the altar and he raised his hands and he said Lord enough is enough and he said forgive me for everything that I've ever done I know that because I was in the same position I was in the pew when and I felt that same hand lift me up and took me to the altar I believe every word she says so I just want to encourage each and every one I know there's once praying for your children and your children's children and your brothers and your sister don't give up don't be like me give up don't you ever give up on a breathing body God is so safe and he won't every single one is praying for a lovely he won't save him even if you never left to see it but I believe you will thank you for your prayers and thank you I know there's ones even if I didn't give prayers out here I'm sometimes so embarrassed for my brother's behavior but in my heart I've been praying so thank you for praying with me God is faithful because he has risen my brothers alive to me hallelujah hallelujah praise be the Lord God is good oh my thank you Jesus amen amen a lot of Prayer quests we have week after week you know praying for lost loved ones praying for children that's out in the world never give up if you don't pray for them who's gonna pray for him if you're not holding on before God who's gonna hold him before God I like that what said there you know even if I don't live to see it I don't have to let see it lord I just want to see them over there I want to be with them again so we'll just trust the Lord this morning they don't give us faith to believe so stand for a moment we'll take this prayer quest before the Lord like to ask brother Cruz would you

so much truly to be thankful for amen it's so wonderful we we think of this what this day it means and truly it's it's more than just a memorial it's a reality and to think of it that there are many many many great men who had lived many great men many great promises that were made and many wonderful things that our Lord and Savior did in his earthly time here upon this earth and the body of flesh but that Easter morning is what's sealed at all that's what proved everything right there everything was proven at that moment because to think about it was all of all of the sick that were healed and how many how many needs that were met but if he had not rose again we would still be in our sins but he rose he rose and because he rose then we can raise also and that wonderful so thankful to God for His mercies just want to greet each and every one of you and they're so good to see you this morning and we want to just look right into the word of the Lord and welcome our visitors here with us in John chapter 11 we're gonna read just a few verses of Scripture it's good to have brother Jean back here with us amen good to have each and every one of you some of you that were away on your vacations or other things I trusted you I rested and ready to go for the days ahead nobody said amen to that I don't know any time that I ever go and have been over the time on vacation I always get I always get a little bit cuz I know it's luck when I go on vacation I don't rest it seems like I actually come back more tired than when I that's why this is kind of like the the routine of things but God knows what we have need of because we all need rest we do need rest that's very very very scriptural and you know and sometimes we get to looking at things and we feel like that my we have to do this and have to do that and have to do this brother Branham was asked a question you know you you're familiar with a many statements rather better made and truly he he labored for the kingdom of God and then brother Branham was asked a question as he was going fishing and one of the individuals asked him so brother Branham with all these all the time being so short and you know with so many lives to be to be redeemed how can you go fishing and brother Branham said I like this now this is a latter part of the ministry he says he says I come to this place he said God knows everyone that's his he said every name that's on the Lamb's Book of Life is gonna be there and he said he must rest in that wonderful you know and that's where he says it God God is going to accomplish every every bit of the of what needs to be done and sometimes we do have to rest in order to get if I can say it recalibrate it a little bit and when you get recalibrated then God can actually use you for what he has intended to use you for so we we certainly need that so I'm not advocating that you all go on vacation I'm glad to have you here this morning and I'm glad to be here with you and gathered on this on this great Easter morning so let's look here in the word in John 11 verse 17 just a few verses of Scripture and then we'll let you have your seats then when Jesus came he found that he had laid in the grave four days already now Bethany was nine to Jerusalem about 15 furlongs off and many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary to comfort them concerning their brother then Martha as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming went and met him but Mary sat still in the house then said Martha unto Jesus Lord if thou hadst been here my brother had not died but I know that even now whatsoever thou wilt ask of God God will give it me jesus said unto her thy brother shall rise again now watch her response Martha said unto him I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day so she she believed in the resurrection she believed in the resurrection and so she believes in the resurrection but now her understanding now is to be opened in that not just believing in the resurrection but he who indeed is the very resurrection so verse 25 jesus said unto her I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believe us now this and she said unto him yeh Lord I believe that thou art the Christ the Son of God which had come into the world let's just pause there Heavenly Father Lord as we are just so so thankful this morning Lord for for the resurrection Lord and it's Lord something that Lord Sutch of the greatest event Lord that's ever taken place upon this earth and to think of it Lord that because you raised you were delivered for our offenses and you were raised for our justification Lord God we're so thankful for that Lord and we're thankful that Lord that you Lord as the life Giver Lord you have come down through every age you have sought out each and every one of your children Lord and father you're still calling Lord God to each and every life and every heart father and Lord we just pray this morning that Lord Jesus as we look upon these things and we reflect upon the goodness of God we ask the Lord that you would pass by our way and move upon our hearts Lord afresh Lord may there just be an outpouring of your presence Lord are refreshing from the presence of the Lord and father to where that by your spirit Lord you'll move upon hearts and lives Lord that perhaps gathered here this morning that don't know you Lord or know you in that real intimate way Lord God I pray that your Lord just move in such a measure this morning Lord father - whoa Lord God every heart Lord and may every one of us Lord truly be able Lord at the end of the service Lord to find ourselves Lord deeper in love with you Lord than when we entered this place this morning father we give ourselves to you a speaker in here and ask that you would just have your way among us Lord say what needs to be said Lord and will you just come and quicken the word to our hearts we pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen and may God bless your being seated if we could keep on reading here just for a few moments and we find in verse 38 here now there come to the sight of where Lazarus is laid and the Bible said Jesus therefore again groaning in himself he he come to the grave and it was a cave and a stone lay upon it and Jesus said take you away the stone Martha the sister of him that was dead said unto Him Lord by this time he stinketh for he had been dead four days jesus said unto her said I not unto thee that if thou wouldest believe thou should have see the glory of God then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid and Jesus lifted up his eyes and said father I think that thou has heard me I knew that thou hearest me always but because of the people which stand by us edit that they may believe that thou has sent me and when he had thus spoken he cried with a loud voice Lazarus come forth and he that was dead came forth bound hand and foot with grave clothes and his face was bound about him with a napkin and Jesus said unto them loose him and let him go when I think of this here of how that we look in the scriptures here and that versa scripture had just been so resonating on my heart here for a few weeks I am the resurrection and the life it's more than just a wonderful statement but here we find that within the midst of it you know this this setting it's a setting to where that the Lord Jesus himself is receives word that Lazarus has passed on he receives that word and yet he delays to come until after four days but yet what we we recognize within this as within every part of God's program there are no coincidences with God there's no nothing there's just all this just no this is what a happenstance there's not it may it may many things sometimes it startles us but the reality is is that God has everything divinely arranged and planned out and when we look at this here the Lord Jesus is speaking to the disciples and he has made known to them that Lazarus is sleeping but yet they look at him and say he's doing well if he's just sleeping you know but what it is they're not they're not catching the understanding of what's being said so he said now for your sakes to bring it down to where you understand he is dead but I'm going to wake him so he's letting them know so now everything's opened up that truly Lazarus has died but the Lord Jesus is going to wake him and I want you to think of this that time itself where Martha said if you had been here this wouldn't have happened and I think that for all of us there are a lot of things if we can bring this parallel of this story right down into our own lives that there's a lot of things that we could say Lord if you had been here this wouldn't have went this way Lord if you had been here this wouldn't have went this way Lord have you there's a lot of things that we could say with that but then let's come to the other part of it that he himself though he were not there per se and and to interrupt or to stop but yet he is still the same Living God who can bring forth even that which seems to have been removed God is able to restore he's a restorer he restores those those things even in a heart and a life that are attributes of himself that reflect the great attributes of his life a father a mother a husband a wife all of those things are attributes that are reflected in God and yet sometimes there's things that can come around our way if Lord if you had been here but God's letting us know that even in the midst of things that when a situation itself would take place that would seem so dire and it would seem so final but let me say this to you there is nothing that is final as far as final with God but in all but in God all things are possible you you might look at the situation I might look at the situation and it looks very bleak it looks very hopeless but yet if we can look to the Lord as Martha did when she said if you had been here he wouldn't have died but she said I know whatsoever thou ask us God he'll give it to you she was confident that he that that what whatever would be asked it would be given so when I think of this I think of where you and I have been placed to where the scriptures would invite us to say if you ask the Father anything on my name that will I do that's the same God it's not us performing that word it's God performing his word and a think of how that near there the the very Almighty God standing here you know in this portion of Scripture here is where many will look at things and say well it was just it was just a man and you make too much of a hurry as a man he wept but yet that shows the greatness of God's condescension so to the place that God Himself condon sending creating a body and taking that body upon himself in order to redeem you and I this is the same Almighty God who stood there before Adam and molecules and time and dust this is the same God who brought forth life here is the very God of all eternity now tabernacled within his son Jesus Christ and he's standing there and he's announcing that I am the resurrection and the life I am the very one who brought forth life in the beginning the very one who took a situation that was dismal with void and darkness and no thorn and the very same God who brought that forth this is the same God now dwelling in their midst and yet when we see it how that within the midst of it that in the humanity part of it he was so moved to where he wept but yet beneath in the midst of all of that beyond the tears and beyond all of that it was God standing behind that veil God was in Christ and there was no way that a man could raise another man to life it's just like when you've ever been touched in your body and maybe it's a husband to a wife or a wife to a husband and you've prayed for one another you've been prayed for or you've prayed for someone else it was not your touch that that moved upon the need in the situation but it was God who moved and God honored faith because by his word it said if they shall lay hands on the sick they shall recover it's God honoring his word so it's God moving on the scene more than what a man could do even though the Lord Jesus loved him but yet it took more than just that of an earthly power to raise him up it took almighty draught this the only one that can raise from the dead back to life again and to think of how that you know brother Branham puts it like this he said in that time he said if he had not a spoke and called out Lazarus at that time he said I believe that everyone within the grave would have come forth let me read that and at that word Lord he said I can hear him scream with a loud voice way out there in spirit land Lazarus and I believe if he hadn't called him by name that have been the general resurrection right there I believe it that's what I think of him he said Lazarus come forth and corruption knew its master the spirit likewise Lazarus had been dead for days his soul was somewhere in eternity I don't know where he was that neither do you we won't argue about it where his soul was but anyhow it heard the voice of the Son of God and a man that had been dead for days stood up on his feet again when it looked like everything was sealed up come on now four days for messengers of death it looked like everything was sealed up but here stood he who is the resurrection and the life and no corruption though all of those things were then think about corruption corruption was the result of the fall at the beginning but here by the voice of the son of God speaking in that moment the authority of the word assembled what had been started in corruption and what was already starting to go in a certain way even as Martha said no doubt he now stinketh but the voice of the son of God went forth and corruption knew its master it had to heed to that voice so here was the glory of God in the very son of God who was reflect ding the glory of God this this all this whole moment and event was for that the glory of God might be made manifest that the Son of God might be glorified you know God's God's interested in that our faith and our confidence would be so built within him and it it takes more than just words compared to words and chapter to chapter and verse to verse and getting all the right words it takes more than that it takes the Living God the author of the word who gave the word to come and make that word alive and real and personal and move upon a heart to wear a heart might be ever so destitute and down and discouraged and it seems like there's no hope for him but it it takes the Living God to come on the scene and move upon that heart and begin to whisper to their life that there is a hope that there is a reason there is a lay out there is a living God there is the presence of God that can change and turn around your life you've got to have something to believe in you're gonna believe in something you're gonna believe in something it might as well believe in the one who is actually able to do something for you that is greater than any man can do I look at this there's this part in the word here the Bible says that in John 11 44 that here as the dead came forth and he called for Lazarus the Bible says he was bound hand and foot with great clothes these are what grave clothes are a band either for bed girth or tying up a corpse after it's been swapped in linen great clothes are all right for adverted man but when that man is no longer dead he needs a change of apparel great clothes that reflect what do grave clothes reflect death that's why apparel when when when when God came down in the beginning he found Adam and Eve and he found them here they were uh
