that that'll bring the blessing to us and that's why we need more it's got to be more than just me or you it's got to be him come we just want to invite him that he'll come and you'll take that word and he'll speak to our hearts he knows either God already is mine for this service and the direction knowing our needs and we believe that that he's mindful and so we just want to approach the throne of the Lord in prayer you've got a special need or request upon your heart you hold that before the Lord as we go to the Lord in prayer Heavenly Father nor Jesus we love you oh how we just appreciate you Lord your god we're not coming before your throne as beggars we come Lord as your children that you have brought us Lord to yourself to where that Lord such a way would be made that you would declare to us ask the Father anything in my name and it shall be done that you would desire that we would come and present our lives before you Lord I think in the time of Israel there were three times a year that their males were to come and present themselves before the Lord we see that outworking Lord in the administration Oh God son of man son of God son of David we see that administration Lord we are it's never Lord left to wear that we are not to come and present ourselves but we're here to present ourselves before you Lord we're asking this morning that you would come you administer to our lives you would take that Lord of the fruit that you have brought forth in our lives and old God may we just Lord as feasting with you and may you just speak to our hearts Lord in such a personal way Lord we go we have a need of you this morning that you'll come you would be the speaker Lord let me help me to get out of the way help your children Lord help them to get out of the way the needs that they have Lord they just place them on the altar Lord God just laying and having just one expectation and that is for you to come Lord I'm not trying to figure out how it's going to be just it's who it that's who will come and do it and that's you so Lord we just ask that you'll take control now minister to every need we pray for your glory we ask these things in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen let's look right into the word here this morning we want to go right into the scriptures and I'm just going to read a few verses of scriptures from Ephesians 6 and then we will allow you to have your seat in Ephesians 6 verse 10 we've been moving through this for some for some time here finally my brethren here's the admonition the Spirit of God through Paul finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might put on the whole armour of God that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand so Paul has made very clear that though that we here are walking in this life but our warfare is not a flesh and blood affair it's to recognize that there is spiritual powers demons evil spirits that we are fighting against and Paul has mentioned and let it be very clear that this we are wrestling and against principalities power these are fallen angels those that that fail to keep their first estate and here these angelic battles fell on humans and become human battles then how that we need the discernment and the wisdom of the Holy Spirit that we don't try to approach a spiritual battle with flesh and blood affair because we're always lose and that's what Satan listen Satan knows if he can draw us out into flesh and blood he's already got a swift he's already got us whipped this is where that we need the discernment of the Spirit of God not just to discern that of the opposition but also to discern where we are at presently even in our heart our mind our attitude we want to stay behind the word in all things so then Paul goes through the different parts of the armor now remember when the armor itself is the full word of God which is the life of God the Holy Spirit the seal of God all of these parts come all together you don't gain one part and then you gain another part no it all comes together the things that just like in a natural army Navy so for Marines and on and on you gain rewards that go on your armament and there are rewards that will when we come to the other side it's not just the reward of the crown of life of a new body but there will be rewards that are handed out for how that the lives have been yielded to him here we're not living for any certain to have a great accolade of rewards over there we simply want to be there we want to see him and so the rewards at that time what a glorious time that it will be so to see that within this all these parts of the armor when we get to looking at this and we've come through that of all all of these down through verse 17 and that's where I want to go to you find that each one of these clear down through the middle part of 17 are all defensive we've got there is there the word is given there is a defensive part within the word because we're going to come into battle we're going to fight there's fights going on and you've got to have our lives have got to be covered in this battle but remember if we had all of the armament and we had all of these other pieces to defend and we did not have an offensive part within it then we would surely be defeated but God gave see the balance of the word is that of defensive and that of offensive and God would place that even as Israel was coming in to the promised land which Ephesians types that of the promised land now notice let's draw here in verse 17 and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God so may God bless you bless the word as you're being seated I want to just just to take something from here there is many parts and we just see how the Lord would lead us truly many of the inspiration of things just over the months and things of just kind of as the Lord just dropping things I certainly was not looking maybe in this direction but how that God would help us to see that within our our armament when we are to use the sword of the Spirit that how that in reality that is where we are depending upon the leadership of the Holy Spirit we are not to just venture out in our imagination but it is to take God's Word and to stand upon that word and God will inspire his word to our hearts there are things and promises and what we need that we need the inspiration of the Holy Spirit and so this sword of the Spirit which is the word of God when we begin to look at this this is a statement that brother Branham made within that of of the message and you know when we think of this sword it was a sword that was not something really long when Paul was writing this by inspiration this sword that he's referring to is that sword that he would see on the soldier that he was chained to you see Paul and brother bran would tell us Paul would write of these things even of the races you know the Olympic races and he would liken it to that of a life that's running he would be able to catch inspiration from that and it being applied to the kingdom of God will this sword that would be the accompanied on the on that of the the Roman soldier it was that of not a real long sword it was reduced down to 24 inches and it was what there's known as called a a gladium it was a short sword and the only way that that soldier could actually come into carrying that gladium is when he came into manhood he was a young man he came into maturity and when the sword of the Spirit was given to him ittan was it that sword itself was signification he has full citizenship so he was he was there in representation of that of Rome full citizenship he was there to see and not only he was armed a benefactor of the of all that Rome was but he also was a defender of those freedoms and that Liberty and I believe that's exactly that what the reality that is to strike the heart of a believer is we recognize when we can see and realize the Liberty that has come to us it is that Liberty of which the Spirit of God would right through Jude let us earnestly contend for the faith the Liberty the Spirit of God that word of God which was delivered to the Saints because Satan is out there to try to take away if he can that word because remember there is no Liberty outside of the word of God Satan promises and wants to say well this and that if you didn't have this you know if it wasn't for the word of God if it won from that but once a person comes to a place of overcoming and they recognize the Liberty that's been tugging on their heart dealing with their life telling them you can be free I have set you free accept that Liberty once they finally lay down and they allow Liberty to move into their heart then the Word of God is no longer Grievous it's no longer in opposition they then and now have the same one who has brought Liberty living inside of their life and then it is Christ working in them and when it comes face-to-face with the word they realize that God is on my side and so that this is where as a believer we are to walk and I want to take from this thought because when we look at the Word of God the sword of the Spirit meaning the Word of God and I don't want to deal so much with that of the word that is wrote there the Word of God in terms of Rhema and logos in this case it is the Rhema which is that which is spoken by living voice that which is soul made personal by the Spirit of God but within that it will take as brother Branham would write to us in greatest battle ever fought he said we are to take the sword which is the word of God and pull it with what a hand of faith a strong hand of faith the two-edged sword now notice Hebrews 4 it's a two-edged sword it cuts both coming and going it's a loosening now when we think of this here there was a need for in Redemption there was a need for man to be set free when the Lord Jesus himself when he came remember the religious of that day they who had the promises of the prophets the Psalms all of the Messianic promises they had and when he came he came where it was not according to their thinking they were looking at that there was a need to a stir the rule of Rome from that of you know from that of Israel to remove that ruling part but what they didn't recognize that that in itself there was a greater rule that once that rule was taken care of the rest of it will also fade and that is he came not to remove that of the physical Empire but he came to do away and dude battle with that of the spiritual Empire because remember that where it is to begin with in the heart of an individual and then it leads even to the outside what God has done and he brings forth in in our life it needs to that place to that of the Millennium where eventually there Satan is bound with the chain of circumstance and then over into the future home so there must come that's that that is the qualification and the need in order for for us to to be able to move even into that place it was a need to dwell or to deal with what was present in our life and so when we find this I want to just if I can your heart would just move in this direction we want to look so much not just looking at the armor not just looking at the sword of the Spirit the Word of God which we should have a heart that says every word of God is yay and amen but we want to look at the operating power behind this word and so to look at the operating power behind this word we want to look at how then even in that day they missed what was going on and hear God yet was coming according to his promise word and here he gave them there a baby in a manger the scripture said behold a virgin shall conceive and we find that in John 3:14 the scripture says as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so must the Son of Man be lifted up see we were snake-bitten we have been bitten by that first birth we need a deliverance that first birth is a rebellion against God's Word is that right that whosoever believeth in him very important words believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life for God so loved the world now I want you to think it was not that God loved the sin and the framework of the world but God's love was for that of fallen humanity he's coming to redeem to redeem means to restore to bring back for God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son but whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life for God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved he that believeth on him is not condemned you realize nobody has to go to hell this said whosoever believeth on him a person may only be able to see to a certain degree you don't have nobody has to go to hell if a person it makes up their mind and their heart and said you know what I wanna I want to live for God I want it forsake the world nobody has to go to hell but he that believeth not is condemned already because he had not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God Jesus look at look here in John 10:10 we're speaking of as the chief Shepherd the thief cometh not but for to steal and to kill and to destroy I am come that they might have life and that they might have it more abundantly as the father knoweth me even so know I the father and I lay down my life for the Sheep and other sheep have I which are not of this fold them also I must bring and they shall hear my voice who's he talking about we are products of this we were of we were his sheep of the Gentiles but remember what he said when I'm here I am not sent but to the lost sheep of Israel there had to come a final turning and a rejection to where the gospel would go to the Jews we see or to the Gentiles which would come Paul would identify that was the ministry that God had committed unto him the mystery which which was hid from before the foundation of the world that of God taking out a people for his namesake so that we're we were always sheep of God and Durell as his life was laid down for us we weren't even aware of it as Gentiles but he wouldn't matter who we're aware of it or not he did it because he foreknew you and me it was only an acting out of what already took place in the mind of God the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world this was God's heart Christ is the very heart and expression of God them all so I must bring how will I bring them by my voice he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith to the church it is the Word of God that brings life and authority power deliverance salvation Redemption it is in the word and when the word is preached there is a living God going forth among the people of God it is Liberty that is being proclaimed Torah be to God and there shall be one fold and one Shepherd oh my Romans 5:6 for when we were yet without strength in due time Christ died for the ungodly once you think of these words now for scarcely for a righteous man will one die yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die but God commendeth his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us much more then being now justified by his blood we shall be saved from wrath through him for if when we were enemies o my enemies and I'm in our mind in our soul in our nature for if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his son much more being reconciled we shall be saved by his life so remember here the reconciling God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself here is all unfolding through the life of the Lord Jesus and then as he as he hung there on the cross suspended between the heavens and earth remember here he is now paying the price and has then from the vivir death and then the burial and the resurrection then he ascends back up on high and that same spirit that same life which was to do what it is to reconcile bring to a real harmony in the heart of an individual a man that's real harmony harmony isn't just a group of people being together but harmony is where our spirits and our hearts our lives are knitted together in one purpose one mind and one accord and so here his life comes to reconcile us fully to the word in other words so that there is not a breach between us and the word but when the Holy Spirit in our life it yokes us to the word and there is a change that has come about in our life this is a reality of reconciliation and so remember God has given to you and I that word of reconciliation a word that is that the Spirit of God carries to the heart of an individual and not just says you can be free but lets them know you are free quit walking the same line like Johnny crow you are free what must I do act upon the Word of God just simply receive it Oh God has brought it down for our hearts and lives to be able to accept it and Paul said and not only so but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom we have now received the atonement we've received the atonement he is the atonement we've received the atonement because it is the life remember when they were smoked the sacrifice God let him know in the Book of Leviticus and numbers and in there in even in Deuteronomy when you when you offer the offering let no man eat of the blood but let the blood be poured out because in the blood is the life and the life is the atonement and that's why in this hour if the blood itself is not enough you must have the life that was within that blood and that is the token that is the atonement and the word atonement at1 meant those who were - yeah they shall be one it is atonement at one mint are you listening now it took van of the laying down of the life that he heather life might come and join us together now think of this here the word the word became flesh and dwelt among us but the word and unnoticed he was always the word but notice has he descends he becomes or he takes on his own word he comes in the form of his word is that right now he not only become the word but he become the high priest of his own word amen he's not only the word but he is the high priest of his own word I want you to think of this for a moment we're talking about the weapons that we're using and this is one of the first ones we would deal with is that that of the sword the sword is not a defensive and not a defensive weapon a sword is an offensive weapon is that right god don't want his children running from the devil we need the armor when we're in close combat you understand this sword oh my this sword is not is not ten foot long no you're going to meet the devil face-to-face this sword was twenty four inches you've got to be able to thrust it in him or if the prophet said trained for the knock out punch 'as but just like boxers that we would know of many times when they get knocked out what do they say I want a rematch and the devil you can knock him out and tomorrow he said I want a rematch you knock him out the next day next day I want a rematch he need not very never gives up he keeps coming he did the same thing to the Lord Jesus now the think of this here he become he himself he brought the weapon down for you and I but it was not a weapon how that man would think about it remember that there are the Jews and different ones they had the word but they were absent of was the real weapon yet you would say well they had the word but yet they were absent of the real governing power that was needed to actually bring and utilize that word and bring deliverance now we've seen glimpses of it that'll come right down through different ones that's live down through the Old Testament but here looking at the Lord Jesus brother branham brings us and says it like this he says now that's the material that the church has got what a weapon there was never been one like it he was the word and when he come he was born in a manger he come to use the weapon of l.o.v.e love to conquer the world not with army bullets not with machine guns and tanks but he come in a different manner he come in the form of love he was God's love oh my that's totally contrary to the framework of this world it's contrary because the way that this world is that whoever is ruling is the one who actually has more firepower or who has greater power but you see that's not the kingdom of God so in order to operate within the kingdom of God and that our armor would function the right way we have got to know and understand and be yielded to the operating force that actually brings about a strong hand of faith now you would look at it let me just kind of move ahead and then just drop back into this you might ask yourself the question what does love have to do with the strong hand of faith I want you to understand the Bible says that faith worketh by love it is by love that faith works and it operates and so within this in order to have that of faith that will actually be operative and stand on God's Word there has to be that of a real governing power of love that's behind it think of this in his life what was showed to you and I as much as Paul can look at this Roman soldier with the sword on his side so can you and I take the glimpse of this great warrior remember in the book of Isaiah Isaiah 59 when he came the Bible says he would with righteousness as a breastplate and he would come with that of salvation as a helmet you say it doesn't mention anything about the word but he was the word you see the word he became flesh and dwelt among us and he play he brought the word back to a place that the word itself could be so seated in the heart and soul of man that the word could actually move from that and the sword would be that which would go forth through the mouths of his children because after all in the beginning it was by the spoken word and the spoken word is the original life so he must be able to restore and get the word back to its original place not that of the mind although we need to have the helmet of salvation but the word in order for it to be operative it must be seated in our heart by divine love so notice when Jesus would come he would come in a manner they would call him a fanatic they would call him Beelzebub yet you find you know as a Bible reader you do not find Jesus standing around trying to debate with them trying to prove his point trying to do this if there was leadership that was given that would cause him to say consider this consider that consider this but remiel eyes that hidden there was many that just rejected him even of the religious of that day but Jesus would go what's this what's how that this of love would be made manifest he would go to the lowest city on earth called Jericho and in the lowest city in Jericho the shortest man in that city named Zacchaeus would actually have to crawl up a tree to be able to see him you see it shows how God made himself so low for you and I what was that such humility there was nothing like that that was upon the earth at that time remember that of the world is about stepping on one another and edifying self that is characteristics of the world but here the very heart and love of God it came down to so low to the shortest man on the earth had to get on a tree and look down to even seen OMA now to think of that with the weapon brother Graham would go on to say it again with weapon of love he conquered every devil with what the weapon of love he conquered every devil oh my now think about what the what Satan had actually done in the very beginning from even when he led the rebellion there in heaven he led them away from their first estate is that of the love of God remember we see the identification of them spirits working there underneath that administration of a white horse rider where it would actually draw away the people in the Ephesian age that spirit would be identified the Antichrist spirits already working it was right there working amongst the people in that hour what was it to do lead him away from the love of God then the men remember many of the people did not for say forsake the letter of the word but they first sucked the life of the word and if Satan can bring a substitution in that of a removal from the word I don't care how much a person has a Bible he's got him whipped because remember it is not our strength or our mind that is to operate the word it is to be the Spirit of God the love of God seated in our heart that actually operates the Word of God in our life now when we think of this here remember in the beginning when the fall had come about when the fall came about remember we see how there begin to be a blame immediately immediately when when situations came and here God comes down and immediately when the Prince of God comes down among them the first thing that you find is when he addresses Adam why Adam is the head he's the husband he's responsible for what is going on in his home and so the love of God noticed the love of God he doesn't come out accusatory the love the love of God comes down and begins to ask Adam or what what you know what what have you done it begins to ask him you know you know Adam could have come right out but Adam instead of coming out he heared they hid themselves and notice the love of God was trying to call him out but we find that when they come to that spot here we find that Adam says were Lord it really ain't my fault it's the woman you gave me now notice this before that when Adam took her out of knowing that if he did not place his life in there then if he did not place that life in there in her womb God would come down and kill her but because his life was there in the womb God could not kill her so he addresses Adam now remember when he addresses out of notice the condition now of the fall when Adam took was a partaker of the fruit immediately Adam looks over and he says it's the woman you gave me she's the reason I'm in this fix that I'm in and now then he comes to the woman okay he says why is it that that is thus what does she say it's because of the serpent he beguiled me you see what happens when love they were walking in divine love but when they got out of divine love they no longer we're looking at their life and evaluating it they were looking for somebody to blame for the situation or the condition they were in all about how much greater when God's love returns to you and I by that of divine grace we're not looking for somebody to blame we're not looking way back they're to blame we realized that we were lost and I'm done we are in need of the mercy of Almighty God we are repenting and we are asking God for forgiveness in our life what brings that about but divine love of God unmerited grace Oh glory be to God this is why when Jesus would stand there in John 18:36 and he was asked a question remember by Pilate was he a king or not and he said My Kingdom is not of the world if my kingdom were of this world then would my servants fight see how it is the kingdom of this world that of even our connectivity by our first birth is that of a fight oh mama that I should not be delivered to the Jews but now is my kingdom not from thence right now it's not from Finn's so now he's not gonna operate by the laws or by the ways of this kingdom remember the ways of this kingdom it says if you take me then those that are with me they're gonna fight for my deliverance but he lets them know we're not fighting for control of this world but we and there is a there is a an actual decree and there is an actual word the Word of God that this of the earth it belongs to the sons and daughters of God the earth listen to me now as much as our soul needed Redemption the earth is a redeemable attribute of Almighty God the world is only the system the cosmos that is opponent but as much as our souls need in Redemption and leading our bodies to redemption the earth itself is longing and in need of redemption it's got its water baptism in the days of Noah it's received out of the blood dropping and placing a claim sanctification upon it and the baptism of fire will break out in the Millennium in a further working of sanctification and then all clear over to the future home where that the earth itself receives the baptism of the Holy Ghost is that new city that new Jerusalem you see that's what has already happened in our soul when we've actually been born again of the Spirit of God we have been born of that mother our mother is that New Jerusalem we have been born of the life of that city or glory be to God he who is our milk ascetic we have been born of his life and so the administration in the life of a son and daughter of God is no longer of the world we do not love the world or the things of the world but the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts what is it it's another Kingdom that has already moved in that's why we can say I walk in this world but yet I'm not of this world we realize as children of God we're actually walking in two different worlds at the same time no Jesus could say but you see the son of man here he is on earth and yet he's already ascended into heaven why because the baptism of the Holy Ghost the quickening power to a child of God he raises us into heavenly places though we walk here in this earth but we have our position in Christ in heavenly places Oh glory be to God so here when we begin to look at this we find that what he come to do he come to conquer hatred you see hatred itself had a way that it would actually bring division and you think about this in this regards then anytime there's ever been a war or a battle that has been fought many times when whoever becomes the ruling party then whoever is the losing party they actually then they never have just a a real gratefulness they never have a real thankfulness but what it actually comes down to these types of victories that would be fought between nations it actually ends up in being hatred one who's overtaken and here they are you know let's say that you know when you know this nation a took over nation be nation a can go in there let's just look for example when America went into Iraq and America goes into Iraq and just lay aside your political viewpoints right now and let's just let me preach so when you look at this when they go into Iraq you know you'll find maybe a degree of certain ones here there that they're real appreciative you know maybe that there was certain and liberation from oppression but you find there were others that you and I should think good Lord they ought to be thankful they ought to be appreciative of being liberated they ought to be appreciative but you see that type of war only leaves the leaves hatred it leaves it what you and I see we're here they are coming against the Americans they can see an American and listen that American might be working over there and that American may not have even been for the war at all but all they see is that's an American and they look at it and let's take them out you see it only produces a hatred they may not even know you but there's a hatred that's produced that's what those kind of wars produce but you see that's what Satan had done in the beginning it had brought a hatred but you see God himself god is love he did not come down with army takes bullets and that of carnal means to try to overthrow and move in a carnal way why the same problem would have existed even within us and within mankind there has to be a liberation and that liberation must come from the time of our first birth there must come a Liberty by the love of God that takes its place in the heart of man to where man's life is governed by the love of God anything outside of that produces a hatred let me just say this to you no wonder why you find that there are people who walk away from this message and this truth and they absolutely they don't just walk away and say well I don't understand it but the Spirit behind them is a spirit of destruction the spirit hates this message it hates it you see what it is it's a spirit behind it and they'll say man I'm free I've never been freer than I've ever been before well certainly they are if they feel free you know why they've set here like a bunch of hypocrites they've never been born again of the Spirit of God they never had the love of God within their heart the message was only intellectualism it was only theology it was only doctrine they only used it listen to me closely now they only used it to their own advantage for a certain period of time and then once it got them to a certain advantage point they see no problem with dismissing it what is it it's because their heart was not filled with the love of God brother the love of God the Holy Ghost coming into a heart it overthrows hatred and resentment listen what the Bible says when we love God His commandments are no longer Grievous Oh [Music] glory be to God amen he came he came to conquer hatred he come with a different weapon listen to me now he looked upon the sick and the sick but demon-possessed he was able to look and he's seen beneath the demons the demon spitting on him the demon saying everything but it looked beyond that and he said there's my son beneath that there my daughter beneath that amen when it came to the woman at the well he looked at me the darkness that was on her life what did that the love of God man's eyes was like the disciples what's he doing talking to a woman like that the Pharisees remember in Luke 17 when Jesus uses the parable of the prodigal son he uses it in that matter because the Pharisees they wanted nothing to do with sinners they were afraid if they got within a certain distance of them they would somehow be contaminated what they didn't realize they were already more contaminated than the sinners were they were full of dead men's bones they themselves jesus said you have not the love of God abiding in you yet they themselves had so many outward things among them oh let me get on this now but you realize that it was able to look beneath and see what was really needed I'll tell you that's what the world is dying for the world is dying for the love of God the world is not dying for hatred they can make all sorts of laws and everything else but you know what there's one thing that's a great governing principle and that is love notice how the scripture this is the weapon the Prophet was letting us know this is the weapon that he used of love in Song of Solomon chapter 8 verse 5 who is this that cometh up from the wilderness leaning upon her beloved I raised thee up up up under this apple tree there thy mother brought thee forth there she brought thee forth that bare thee sent me as a seal upon my heart as a seal upon thine arm notice this is the request of the bridegroom to the bride for love is as strong as death so the seal the setting upon the heart is that of love and he goes on to portray it for you and I that love is as strong as death death is working in our body right now just as death itself you look at mounted pictures as you look at pictures of where you were a few years ago you might see more wrinkles you might see a few more strands has been gone off maybe if few more gray hairs what's happening death working in your body it was already there it kept working but how much greater is well this is how love works love overthrows love overtakes in our life Oh blow ray and notice jealousy is as cruel as the great here's the comparison to love once again the coals thereof our coals of fire which hath a most vehement flame many waters cannot quench love o my you know water can't put this fire out this is not a man-made fire come on somebody many waters cannot quench it neither can the floods drown it Satanists tried to when the enemy comes in like a flood the Spirit of God will raise a standard against the word remember many waters many floods many waters remember the sitteth upon many waters of all of her doctrines and people's and everything else but yet the love of God cannot be overthrown but vice-versa the love of God is actually moving in the hearts of the people of God and the kingdom of God is going on though Satan has been against it he's tried to throw him in lions he's tried to feed him to the Lions put him in the vats to try and boil it out of them he's tried to bring tests and trials her away he's tried to get you so discouraged he's tried to tell you that this message is the reason why you can't really have joy it's because of this but he's alive there's never been a greater joy than the word that has become life and given you in our life it is our joy and we recognize that no matter but tests or trials that come but through it all all the floods and all the waters it cannot quench it it cannot drown it even when we're at our lowest time the fire of God the love of God still burns bright no wonder Paul said nothing shall be able to separate us from the love of God if a man would give all the substance of his house for love it would utterly be condemned it shows real love has nothing to do with how much you own in life love is priceless see that example between those two couples brother Branham had married I want you to think of this rudram takes this point and why are people so tossed about and he talks about how he says he stood in a man's meeting that had a tent and he says I'm not slamming this man God forgive me he said but where a man said he could cast out evil spirits listen to this statement which I have no doubt of that but evil spirits are not cast out by cruel indifferent living the most powerful weapon there is in the world is love see the discernment of the Spirit of God brother Branham was saying though that man's line he can't cast out evil spirits he's saying I don't doubt that he can cast out evil spirits but what's he dealing with that though there can be things take place many moving and merry miracles and things like that but yet he does not have better the gospel life to actually be able to break that yoke of bondage and man can not do that that takes the Holy Spirit himself this is why brother Branham would say and you must be born again 1961 false teachers produce false births why because they put it up on something that's not true whatsoever and yet many false teachers can have all kinds of science and all kinds of wonders but remember you don't know a man by his signs and wonders you know him by his teaching his fruit and what is it the fruit is that where the teaching the life goes forth and it moves within the lives so notice brother Brown notice where the Spirit of God is going it's going down behind of even the man who is standing out there and saying I can cast out evil spirits remember though I have faith to move mountains and have not charity I am nothing is that right so when we notice here remember the way listen to me now the way that the Spirit of God comes it travels through the body is that right we see it in the book of Acts we see it where Philip went down to the eunuch it was the Spirit of God leading him down there we seem that while Peter yet spake we see in other times were Paul lay his hands upon them it was the same Spirit of God moved through that of the body it did not produce little Peters and little pause it actually was that same life that what did it do it brought forth the image of Christ in the lives of those individuals so it is not by cruel and indifferent living notice the Spirit of God is going to the depth within this guy who has the tent inside of his life his own private life his own private life he might a drink his own private life there were many of them had many great miracles and things I can't step off the plane over here in Cleveland and couldn't even make it down the ramp but yet had many miracles in their ministry tremendous miracles you see amid the grace of God that we recognize is something greater that we're to hear the call of the word rather the word the world has miracles the word has signs and wonders but the word brings about a life that that life stays in liberty that life itself becomes settled in Jesus Christ so not by cruel and indifferent living the most powerful weapon there is in the world is love now let me just give you this example maybe that will somewhat help when it comes to how that the Lord Jesus moving about and moving down within our lives now we read here in the scripture where it said that while we were yet sinners yet he died for us we were unlovable this is what the scripture said when we were unlovable yet he himself gave himself for us when we absolutely there was no merits or even the slightest little thing that we could have said oh you know here's a lot of here 99% bad but that one little sliver oh man I'll lay my life on the line there was nothing good about you or I are you with me but yet he himself what was love doing love was conquering oh my he came with the word and love was using the word now brother BAM uses this example you familiar have I've preached from this many different times but where you had the man who was a young minister but the RAM said you know he was a young Pentecostal and brother BAM said the problem with him he had watched too many of these meetings where they were grabbing people and casting out spirits look Graham said that was his problem and he says now what it was he said now you know here he went in and he would grab his wife his wife was a Lutheran they were always in contention one with another when he would come in she would say hi I guess you all shouted and spoke in tongues tonight and whatever more now remember he would walk over to her and brother and say this is what he told brother Branham he would grab her and rule her out in the middle of floor and he's out there I cast you out know what he's doing he simply was watching what he saw in meetings but there was an element he was missing behind it you see the element that he was missing was really love his approach to the word the word was right the word will cast out spirits brother and sister you realize when a heart a heart can be sent right here in the pew they don't even have to come up front but if they're sent right there in their heart begins to go with the word you realize what the Word of God is doing it's actually cutting away demons while they're sitting there and their heart is agreeing with the Word of God you don't have to have hands laid on you to cast out a devil sure there are some circumstances and things or I've witnessed within that that a person actually needs encouragement they need help but you do not go do that by force you do it by divine love for the soul that's down there so my water Liberty that gives to you and I you that's ending at home this morning you might be in front of your computer your tablet your phone you whatever it is but to realize the word when you allow that word to come in and you agree with the word take your eyes off yourself and agree with the word the word itself it comes out of his mouth as a sharp two-edged sword it actually liberates it'll not only cut spirits of depression and oppression it will actually cut away spirits of sickness it'll cut away spirits of doubt and unbelief this is the power of the word of God love itself overcomes it overthrows that of the hold of the enemy now notice this program said what had happened here in this particular place it was between this husband and wife it was almost for skates but he said now he said brother branham he said I just can't seem and I don't have this up there but I want you to listen to me I just can't seem to move that Devil out of her you see he's saying something that's right on but he's not even catching what he's saying I just can't seem to move that Devil out of her you say well what has to be done recognize there's a devil and there's her recognize the devil's the one you're angry with not her come on somebody you see this is what the Lord Jesus did notice bill Ramsey said you go about it the wrong way he said when she starts out like that you say all right dear bless your heart honey and be real kind to her not to the devil to her just see how much you can do for her we mean the help of the Holy Spirit you see what love does without love governing where we end up butchering people up no wonder they don't want to talk to us about anything about God preach brother Samuel why you've got to have the word governed by love and if it isn't love pulsating into it then you've walked right into a man they need to hear this they got to do that right away you're defeated because what there has to be a discernment between her and the devil all right now he said brother Branham how will I ever give the devil out of her once against he's not recognizing it he said you do as I say and just keep praying in your heart God will take care of the rest of it he called brother Branham up in about two three weeks he said my home's revolutionized my wife is a different person baby BAM said which is the most powerful screaming kicking stomping or putting your arms around in love this is the reality of the token let it be a plant this is the words of the Spirit of God through the Prophet let it be a prize with love and consideration let it be an atmosphere in your home bet your loved ones misses his words they will fall into it Oh glory be to God notice here the Lord Jesus here we find John would write of this and let me just let me move here just a little bit herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment this is confidence if we can have confidence in the day of judgment which you and I and ourselves we don't know how long we have upon this earth but even when we look ahead to that moment we want to have confidence and the confidence that we have in regards to the day of judgment if we've got confidence regarding that then we've got confidence to live every moment of the day because as he is remember he raised up seated on the right hand of God he's seated in power he is our mediator I find no fault in him come on someone because as he is so are we in this world you look at this remember that's where you need the discernment of the love of God what is he looking at as he is so are we in this world it is that same perfection be you therefore perfect even as your father isn't in heaven is perfect what perfection is he talking about he's talking about the perfection that comes from the life that is within the blood and this is the confidence that we have because within our hearts the love of the world is gone the desire is to please him there is no fear in love but perfect love casts out fear when fear wants to try to come perfect love cast it out the devil comes along and says you know what at the end of the time you're not going to make it but the RAM send the token what does it do he said you say I already got the token perfect love cast fear hey man so how is love cast out by perfect love and that's all of Satan's Kingdom because fear hath torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love we love him because he first loved us so how was it that it was drawn out of our hearts to where come to a place of surrender that the love of God could be shed abroad in our hearts because he loved us first go Paul would say in Galatians 2:20 I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not i but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me Paul said I cannot know about everybody else but I know it's been made personal to me that's what has to be made personal to you and I when that is made personal to an individual sin flees brother you don't have to worry about trying to clean up and straighten up it flees from your life why because the love is gone it's not about us trying to put new leaves on you get and you get life on the inside the leaves will just come out is that right notice Paul would go on in Ephesians 2:4 but God who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in our sins hath quickened us together with Christ by grace you are saved and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of His grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus let me just carefully warn you do not let these be scriptures that you just know by mind these are scriptures that must be not only revealed but they must be that where we recognize in our heart what great love has been expressed to us not just that he died on Calvary but Paul brought it down in Ephesians because remember Moses couldn't take us over but Joshua the Holy Ghost sent back can pack us into the land so it's not just that Jesus died on the cross remember many can believe on him and believe on the work that he did and they will be saved but there's a difference from believing on and believing in him when you believe in him when that revelation of Jesus Christ is revealed to you that your sin debt is paid brother and the life of the atonement moves on the inside of you you have now been raised up the same way the Spirit of God raised that dead body up you and I go walking around on earth we were dead what part of us was dead that seed on the inside it was laying there dormant but there had to be the right waters the waters of life of the waters of his own life that would come across that of the seed and would raise that sea into heavenly places in Christ Jesus what are we witnessing what are we partakers of the great love of Almighty God the great love of God that has come from the very mind of God and moved down into the heart of the believer this is why brother Branham would express this to us in Christ the mystery of God revealed and he would let us know and speak with us very clearly on what the what better the new birth is it's the revelation of Jesus Christ to you personally he would let us know you don't make converts to Christianity by its laws and its governments there are many different laws there are things that listen when the word is coming forth the word is given to you and I and the word will admonish us the word will speak to us the word will help us and we can take that word when it's revealed to us the Spirit of God will take that word and we can say Lord may my body come into complete obedience to that word what is that that's mortifying the members of our body and the Spirit of God on the inside is bringing that body into subjection so here it is all a divine working by the spirit of all my god notice in Revelations 1 verse 5 and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the Dead and the Prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood notice he loved us conquering and he loosed us this is what washing means he loosed us we are no longer tied to that old man that's why we stand justified in the sight of God as though we never did it in the first place because the real you or me on the inside it never did do it but it took the Spirit of God to raise up that reality that real son and daughter of God only inside him begin to move upon our life like you did the prodigal son we begin to recognize the condition we were in and we begin to have a hunger oh if I can only get back to my father's house there's prayer in my father's house he was calling for bread bread being a staff of life he had a remembrance that begin to deal with him of that of home what is it it's the spirit of cloth the love of God is going out there it's dealing with the prodigal son the Prophet would say it this clear he said mom and Daddy were at home praying for him and the angel of the Lord was down in the Pigpen let me tell you something the angel of the Lord was not ashamed to walk in the Pigpen because when the angel of the Lord comes brother he don't leave people in a pigpen he brings liberty he knows if I can only get that life and that life begins to hearken that life begins to line up I can move in that life and snip him and not I'll have to worry about a pigpen no more because why the very nature of the pig on the inside has died and that sheet that was for our day and foreknown before the foundation of the world the Sheep has heard the call of the shepherd it has responded to its creator to its maker under him to loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood and has made us kings and priests unto God and his father to him be glory and Dominion for ever and ever amen let me read this to you just give me just a couple minutes this is out of a message perfect faith when we were sinners alienated without God in the world in that muck of mud as I talked about this morning how can overcome God come to us God sought you you never sought God no man can come to me except the father draws him first notice not pulls him not pushes him draws him this is what love draws he and God came down in that muck what you were God came down in that muck what you were and sought you out and brought you out that ought to create a perfect love look what you was and look what you are what you are what you are what did that somebody that loves you can't you have faith in what he's promised you then real genuine love will create a confidence in his word he caught me when I was nothing I'm still nothing but I'm in his hand he caught me he loved me when I was unlovable he loved you when you was unable lovable but he changed you just like the colored sister said in her testimony I'm not what I ought to be I'm not what I want to be but I think God I'm not what I used to be she knowed she had come somewhere something had happened and that's the way it is if God when he when I was an alien from him so loved me till he stooped down to get me and pick me up that gives me confidence that he wants to use me he's got a purpose in doing it he seen something in me notice he was able to see the difference he did not look at my life and say nothing but a drunkard nothing but it is nothing but our there he realized those are only spirits that's driving him right now hallelujah let's stoop down and love address the real problem I need a deliverance I didn't need rules how do you mean laws I needed deliverance [Music] when this message really strikes a heart you realize it's not laws it's not this and don'ts its life its life brother it produces the life of Jesus Christ hallelujah he's got a purpose and do it he's seen something in me he's seen something in you aren't you glad II look beyond my faults Oh glory oh my rear I wish I had time to preach what I really feel burning in my heart right now he had a reason to save you look at the people that's unsaved today he walked down in the pull of Salome excuse me pardon me skew host excuse me pardon me he stepped over people that were in worse shape than you or me came to a man who was slaying impotent brother Bram said he had a condition and when they killed him but the man could not get to the water but the one who sent the angels came to him hallelujah he stepped over it called being called Beelzebub he stepped over being called a fortune teller he stepped over what was he doing he was coming to get you and me gal repeated God oh my look at the people that's unsaved today look at the millions he could have took besides you but he took you oh man no one can take your place you're in God's economy no one can do it that's his love to you but in saying what does this have to do with the strong hand of faith remember our faith is a divine revelation that is to be built upon the love of God it's the word that's to be handled by the love of God it's the love of God that will constrain us and cause us to wait for his leading we might have the word but we're just waiting on his unction of how to move about it it's love that gives us confidence what is it his love seated in our heart then won't your love reach back to him and there's a love affair no matter what the situation is its circumstances is governed by this love that creates notice the circumstances is governed by this love that creates faith that God loves you and you love God and you love one another and that brings faith oh you said perfect faith it's pure it's just as pure as love this so when you love somebody and you got love your husband or you love your wife now there's no need anybody telling you you don't do it you do it because you do do it and you know you do it how can you prove it oh prove it he said I pray it by the way I live to him I'm true honest wife I'm a loyal honest husband and that proves to me but I love my wife or my love my husband see your life proves what you are same thing with Christianity your faith you have confidence in one another it's pure it's something real that you can't show it to somebody else yet you got it and your actions prove it that unadulterated faith like your love is to your companion I'm closing then you'll prove it by the way you act you ain't complaining no more you know it's done you just walk along no matter what it looks like what anybody else says you know what's happened you know it's finished just as well as you know you love your husband and he says love and faith has to go together their kinfolks they love that produces faith when Satan tempts us we are to resist him in a perfect faith in a perfect word like Jesus did how did Jesus conquer every devil my love it wasn't love for the devil it was the love for the word it was the love for the father's word to stand there even when he was pulled in temptation they used the word remember let me just stop right here and just drop a little something Jesus in his warfare with the devil he brought it to the place that the weakest Christian can take the Word of God and defeat Satan anywhere anytime under any circumstances brother Branham would say it in these words he said Jesus showed us we didn't have to be strong he said we could have weak we could be weak in faith but that in itself would overcome what is it it's faith in God's Word are you with me it's taking that and looking for so many times we look at things and say well I just seem like I don't have big faith you don't need big faith in a mustard seed faith Jesus never ever preached about these great big faiths he said if you've got faith the size of a grain of a mustard seed what brings faith about love love God deals with the heart and in love that heart is to respond to the Lord and is that heart response to God what is it faith unto faith Oh what application has it comes down to our lives this is how then were to use the sword it's how we're to use it in our homes it's how to you it's how were to use it even where I'm when we're among unbelieving family members it's how were to use it when we're even around the boss this is the reality how's it to be governed by love by love that the love of got one love look what I was look what I am now what did that somebody they love me somebody that left me actually brought that love it wasn't the person it was the love of God that love that was moving behind there and somebody mere you I said God let it be that I can be an instrument that the love of God can flow through helped us to have that patience another new you you may have to you you have to express the love of God many times sometimes for a long time before you can ever stop drunk dropping little seeds here there what is the love of God it's the person of Jesus Christ I want to say Lord let all of my actions be governed by the love of God if you don't know that love of God today in that way just inviting men say mighty Conqueror great and mighty Conqueror Lord Jesus right in Lord upon my life glory be to God him listen when he comes in remember he won't come in if there's still love of the world he said well I found he conquers but he conquers my love you see what love does love does not say you can't do this and you can't do that love itself is to draw you to a place do you recognize there's something far greater than anything of this world it draws you to a place till all of these things mean nothing and he means everything remember he conquers by divine love he does not come in put us in a headlock no that's not how love works that will only bring hatred and resentment and spite but his love moves in to do what bring about a yielding in our life he can get about that much of an inch listen to me he gets about that much of a little bit like that and the more of that personal yield the more it will grow and it will keep growing it'll keep growing what happens love is as strong as death not growing in a heart and justification it'll grow out to sanctification what would I do it'll grow out from sanctification into the baptism of the Holy Ghost it'll grow to a place so from just the welcome mat of my Savior it'll move to the place of be the Lord of my life all yes or Jesus help us Lord I pray oh god as we Lord look in your word the evaluation as we examine Lord our hearts are examined in your presence Lord by your word Oh Lord God how true this is Lord to every son and daughter of God Lord that's been born of the Spirit of God we know this reality of the love of God what we were and what we are now what did it somebody that loved me somebody that loved us greater love hath no man than this that he a man would lay down his life for his friends this is the greatness of that love laid aside your splendor took upon roads of flesh and blood and you came down and you read English you paid the price that is the spirit of life of Atonement might go forth could minister to our hearts or Jesus you begin dealing with our lives like it says in the Book of Ezekiel we needed a new heart and a new spirit our heart was so hard and it was stony but you said I'll take that hardest stone out of you that hardness that indifference you knew what was the cause of our indifference our obstinance it was that heart that needed to be changed then you said I'll give you a new spirit because the Lord you knew that spirit that we had in us we couldn't even get along with ourselves much less our neighbors but you came down and then you put your spirit in us causing us to walk in your ways Lord God to where our will you surrender to your to where as Paul could say it's no longer I who live at the Christ who liveth in or Jesus I pray this morning if there's one under the sound of my voice it doesn't know you in that way may then may they see it's the love of God may they recognize Lord maybe Lord lay that to heart it's the love of God that conquers it's love that conquer sin it's love that conquers unbelief it's enough that cast out Devils it's love that sets the captive free nor Jesus I pray O God granite there's never been a start in their life may it be a start Lord may they start Lord just by yielding to that tug upon their life but God may each and every one may there be a full yielding Lord God across the Assembly or God where hearts and lives are completely filled with the Spirit of God may lord I pray in our hearts as your children but I want more of the love of God to take over more of Santa lord help us or God as you teach us or show us your God of how that this sword the strong hand of faith the strength of the faith to handle this sword comes by divine love the love of God shed abroad in our lives it's what causes us Lord to take your word and to stand there I pray that Lord Jesus help us may you take forward this morning Lord you seen how many different Lord God there's so many different pathways but I'm confident the Lord God as your spirit would go forth to break this Lord to each of our hearts to show us what we have needeth helpless Lord God I pray to operate with a real discernment and wisdom near God as you would instruct us just as the Lord Jesus himself come to be able to discern between the person and the spirit that's motivated help us Lord Oh God we love you Lord Jesus help us or what love the name of Jesus peace no love lifted me [Music] special [Music] but the master not despair ah and fun [Music] now say [Music] for his love lifted me [Music] [Music] and we're screwed [Music] to him [Music] so minded and so true hey rich masters vessel instead [Music] let's go to the last verse [Music] just found me yeah by out of the mask see billows [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] me [Music] [Music] or blessed be the name of the Lord what did it some model of love was expressed it was received grace allowed me to receive that love unmerited unmerited we can look at it and say how could he love me but he loved me it wasn't that he loved the condition I was in he loved me the condition that he saw the real me was in I was trapped what that evil was trapped he wanted to set me free and what could set me free set me free grace made it real to me love had been projected and attained to it sin and grace stepped in and brought what love was calling for glory be to God or this ought to give us such confidence with our children it ought to give us confidence with our loved ones what it what should it give us confidence with but just to have that love of God residing within our hearts remember love will do it because love you
