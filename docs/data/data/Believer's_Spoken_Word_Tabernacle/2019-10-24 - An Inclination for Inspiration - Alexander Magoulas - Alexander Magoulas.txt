nice to see you all in the midweek the ones that could make it out and we just appreciate the mercy in the grace of God to be with you here once again I know many you're working folks so we'll just get straight in the scripture tonight try not to keep you four or five hours so my wife reminded me about that tonight so but if you have your Bibles tonight when we looked in the Book of Daniel the seventh chapter and I I think it was clear back in March I I preached a sermon here I believe on on the inspiration of God and I've actually got the home churches things I've kind of taken several different thoughts from that and so I'd like to go maybe back on that direction tonight and I'd like to speak on the inclination to inspiration now before you ask me why I use the word inclination it's because it rhymes with inspiration so sounds really it's kind of evening anyway but the idea of being inclined or somebody that's inclined to inspiration and I would like to take my text so Daniel the seventh chapter this evening and we're gonna read verses 15 to 16 for a text and then we'll have a word of Prayer here the Bible says this it says that I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of my body and the visions of my head troubled me and I came near unto one of them that stood by and asked him the truth of all this so he told me and made known the interpretation of these things now if you were called a lie who says in the book of Job he says the inspiration of God gives understanding and so he had seen these visions and they had troubled him and then it was made known the interpretation of these things so we look to the Lord tonight - maybe continue to do the same and give us understanding tonight and that before we do so let's just bow our heads for word of Prayer our most gracious Heavenly Father we so thankful for your mercy and your grace and your kindness to us your dear children Lord your loving-kindness it's better than life to us father your words sweet as the honey in the comb Lord we're so thankful father I think of a natural people Israel and how you promised them a land a good land that flows with milk and honey your prophet said as the type of us the believer having received the Holy Ghost father and Lord even in the midst of our earthly journey we go through trials and we face Giants and we face the proverbial walled cities of life and yet we're so thankful for this Holy Ghost gospel we're so thankful for your spirit living with and in your people tonight that you were leading guide us probably you would manifest yourself by your power Lord not by the wisdom of men but by the power of your spirit that our faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God and lo we're so thankful tonight that you give us your spirit that we might freely know the things which are given to us by your grace and by your provision because you have said it Lord and we rejoice in that tonight father I pray the word which has been read now Lord me you just give and other it's an inspiration that which were said may inspire and move the hearts of these your children that have gathered here tonight Lord they're not my children but they're your children a father you they're your dear ones with whom you have purchased with the precious blood of Jesus Christ Lord I believe you have plans for them plans for peace and for an expected end Lord you desire to do good things to do great things in their life by your spirit father believe you've purposed each one here tonight that you've called that they would be blessed by you for a purpose father I just pray you come and take preeminence in the service now as the angels of God walk the aisles may your spirit moving every heart I pray and father bless your children may they go from this place tonight with a greater inspiration moving and stirring them in their life I pray Lord for myself I just want to be more yielded to you than I've ever been before I want to be so careful to hear every and be led by your father and we just commit ourselves to this purpose now we ask that you had your way and father we give you the praise and the glory and the honor for it for you asking in the mighty name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and the bride says Amen god bless yous you're seated tonight so as I said I was taking this thought of inspiration several different ways and nor will and I might continue with it even Sunday by the grace of God but the brother Brennan makes a statement and it kind of ties it all back into this I want you to retain this in your thinking and in your hearts as you meditate upon these things or the brands that inspired believers with the inspired Word he says the two together brings the results amen and so as I've said before and I'm going to say it again we know the Word of God tonight is inspired amen it was not necessary before I came to service tonight for me to go make sure the word was inspired I didn't have to qualify it I didn't have to get it inspired I didn't have to take it to a certain place the word of God's inspired he's preserved it he's given it by his own grace it was his own counsel but tonight the questions can we find ourselves living in the same inspiration can the Word of God that's been written it could be more than just words of the page tonight you God writing in our hearts amen I believe that's what the Spirit of God comes to do is to put the long dog in our inward parts amen and I believe if you're believing tonight and you have to hold the ghost I believe that's a reality for you tonight and everything you need for your earthly journey is already in you by the Holy Ghost and I saw what you understand the inspiration is that something that's far off from you the inspiration on this Bible is here but I believe the inspiration in the believers at the heart tonight if we can allow God to speak to us and direct us in such a way we can find ourselves seeing the witness of this and our lack of the great away and then I want you to send that people in this Bible they were moved and they were inspired to do things they themself really understand at the time and yet we find out it was gone most was inspired to stand in the gap for a people Joseph a man in prison for 13 years and he comes out interprets a King's dream brother Ram talks about is alive was a type of Christ that man didn't know the prison name is a type of Christ Moses didn't know and then the prophecy didn't even really fully understand and yet we find out it was God all the time I believe as believers we can find many times our life that not as though things are alike and maybe we even scratched our heads at the time maybe we are Salva didn't even know it was God time maybe we even thought we made a mistake and then sometimes we hear the word of God and we obey the Word of God then we begin a question like John the Baptist visit yours in another Lord that man muted seen a vision that men knew that God spoke to him yet he found himself because of those circumstances a man well that's his nature that was the spirit of Elijah that's his nature a man that comes back to what I'm talking about tonight sometimes people when God speaks to them sometimes they get inspired you know it's like Elijah he was a bold man up there was a 450 prophets the bear but when he come down off that mountain he was a man he was a man he was just a man like you and I are they're like passions a man sometimes this is why I say that sometimes the devil trying to scourge you because you got bills or because you got troubles or because you're going through things and you think well that's not very spiritual but I want you understand these people in the Bible there are many like passions they went through the same kind of trials the same kind of things it wasn't there a statue that made them of special people understand he was a God the god they served the Bobby's disciples that's what made them different and if he's the same God tonight that makes you the same way so you're special whether you feel like they're not and then now you're not special like the world says you're special or you know Sesame Street but you're a different kind of people amen I'm not saying that to be glad I remember the world's always preaching this idea when you're showing the listener but listen you really are a different kind of people in the day the heirs of the super highways and supermarkets there's a super people there's people like the Prophet Dame of the Bible says he was a man with an excellent spirit the Spirit of God listen the other magicians even believe that God could live and work in a man and here it was right in front of them manifested and then he had an excellent spirit the Bible said nah that's pretty that's a good compliment that's what I want me know him for amen well I could be known for a lot of things and not for a lot of other things I am known for amen but that's he had an excellent spirit amen praise the Lord and so we look at this the inspired word with the spy believers homies inspire tonight if you're an inspired believer it's going to bring results the proper said it would bring results bring it to anybody you're the class of people on the earth that believe so why do somebody else to do we're looking in the pew neck stuff we're looking for some great something the great something is here Christ is here he's anointed tonight he's ever been a man he can defeat the devil the Word of God can defeat the devil any place anywhere and anytime that's a midweek service amen hey oh man he coming up here to get me sorry praise the Lord excuse me amen now and I want to make a point and I've said this Amen but I want you understand you can't make inspiration happen remember you can wait for inspiration I've talked about this last time I was there you can read your Bible and you can pray brother Ram said you can do that every day we'll grow closer closer to God real closer to God read your Bible and pray everyday hey man listen it's not so far off that it's impossible it's it's something you can do read your Bible and pray that's where you get your inspiration if your hearts are attentive and your ears are inclined you can receive inspiration from God and amen we wait on inspiration and we yield to it amen we don't want to wait on and they're not yield to it like Balaam but we want to hear from God amen I mostly hear from the Lord amen well if we want to hear from him let's do what he says when he speaks to us amen I mean I'm talking about this idea being inclined or inclination to the Spirit tonight and the reason I'm taking this thought and this is kind of what I was hurling get around to here is that many times inspiration like I said it doesn't always look the way we think it's going to look amen sometimes it manifests itself a little bit differently and we get the wrong idea about once what inspiration is inspiration is not always you're running and shouting and jumping although it can be and that's good and that's fine but that's not always what it looks like and then we look in this Texas over here tonight in Daniel he sees Rothfuss this property sees his visions and it actually troubles his spirit amen he actually becomes agreed because of the things that he sees I think of John in the first chapter of the book of Revelation when he turns to see the voice of one speaking him he falls down like a dead man and then that's not our idea of having church tonight that's exactly what happened to him when he got inspired and he's seen this thing he's found like a dead man and even the Prophet we know many times and the meaning come out under the power of those visions he said he didn't wipe them out amen and so sometimes inspiration affects an individual differently than maybe they'd expect amen the reason I'm saying this actually I like I said I've been studying this thought looking at it and I had a sister come to me one day at church and I was talking with her and her husband after church and I got to talking about this and it kind of inspired me to speak about inspiration on this thought a man but she was talking to me and this is the sister and since the time she become a Christian she began to deal with things she get these tremendous burdens or weights in her life and she was convinced there was something wrong with her mentally man and so I want to I want to preface this night this is this is not in a replacement for something that has an actual chemical imbalance or something like that I'm not trying to replace that I'm not trying to take you away from a doctor but in this sister's case I think in many times with many of us I'd begin to talk to her I begin to feel her spirit out a little bit and talking about this idea and she would go through these things and not realizing why it was she thought there was something wrong with her amen praise the Lord and so and I think many people in the same instance they they get a certain burden or maybe they're sensitive to the spirits of certain things and many times they think there's something wrong with them I said sister I don't think there's anything wrong with you actually I think God's trying to use you and there was actually the obvious she lost she wasn't good enough I'm like no I think God's trying to use you I said sister there's so many needs and burdens in the church today and even this he said like I said people don't always know what it is we don't always know what it is but I believe you're catching the spirit of it what God's want me to do is pray amen and so she kind of brightened up and I talked her about this and some of the things I'm talking about tonight with you but I said even in my own life and I'm not saying this to promote myself but if somebody's in the ministry or whatever I'm sure they can relate but there's been times I'll go to preach somewhere and I'll go in the back office and I have my coffee in the morning and I had my bagel or whatever I'm having and I feel great I'm getting ready to preach and the next thing you know I'll be weeping on the floor or I'll be on a burden and when I was first preached I thought what's wrong with me see I thought there's something wrong with me and you might argue there still is but in this case in this case it was actually God trying to deal something with me and I begin to notice after a while you get a certain burden or a certain feeling about it and it would cause me to preach or going to certain inch a channel of inspiration and what I'd find out is there somebody in the Carnation going through whatever I was feeling and so I've been gonna recognize and so I say this tonight I think that's not just for the ministry I think many times we go through things and it's more than just the if it's cloudy outside or whatever but many times as Christians we're subject to the spirit of thing and God inspires us and I think many Christians they don't always recognize what it I didn't recognize it when first started happening I thought to myself like this sister thought there's something wrong with me why didn't I get ready to preach I get all whatever and then I think I was you know it's like it was a big deal but we find out and the Prophet talks about this and he says that many times he's a poet she says poets prophets spiritual people he says they're always considered neurotic or something wrong with them amen and he gives the example of Stephen Stephen Fowler and he wrote old black Joe and old Kentucky home and how the man he'd get done and he'd go take a raisin trying to kill himself or were young copper he went to drown himself brother Brandon he's the example to show you that that people that get inspired amen many times when when the inspiration leaves they have a wood they look like they're neurotic brother Graham says this and it's in the sermon blind bartimaeus 1957 he says see he says when you're out there it's wonderful but it's when you're coming out he says look at Jonah the Prophet well that was a message of God and prophesied to the city about the size of Saint Louis Missouri to people which didn't know the right and left hand he said his message were so forceful until they put sackcloth on their animals but then when the spirit left and he was so depleted they sent her a little tree and he got angry and wouldn't God would strike him dead because a little cutworm cut the gourd tree out from hundred is that right he's looking Elijah the Prophet on the inspiration a man stood there called a fire out of heaven cold water out of having the same day killed four of the priests and wrong with the threat of a woman run out into the desert it was either 40 days and 40 nights walking around the angel woke him up when he was sleeping fed him twice for that long journey he was water in the desert not knowing where he was and when God found him he'd been pulling back in a cage he says how many knows that is only to just get the spiritual side friends he says I love to hear people shout I say amen I love to hear people praise the Lord but that's not spiritual yeah I've seen people shot and danced and praise the Lord no nothing more about spiritual things than a Hottentot knowed about Egyptian out you might have get your dictionary half he said they come up on the pop I'm just running around and around and screaming and carrying on that's emotion emotions all right but brother when you come right down to the fact of it that's not spirit that's joy but spirit is spiritually discerned amen so much I want show says it's spiritually discerning things and this is why it's careful like I talked about inspiration to not only you to it but to receive it the right way because we don't want to be if you're sensitive to the Spirit of God and you don't submit that to God you become sensitive to other kinds of spirits amen brother BAM talks about he used the example King Saul Amen because the evil spirit that come on is that right because he rejected the word of the Lord so we never want to go to God with her own idea well we never want to seek God and try to hear our thought in his own voice we want to stay neutral and let God speak to us and then we want to receive it the way it comes amen otherwise you've threatened to get yourself into other kinds of spirits amen and so that's why I said this many times Christians maybe they have a certain burden and they think that they're maybe they're depressed or they think that they're melancholy and many times this why I don't try to qualify this I want to be careful but many times it's not a mental issue at all but they're actually catching the spirit or they're sensitive to burdens or needs in the body of Christ now that doesn't mean just the building you're in but the very body of Christ amen and because people don't realize it that's why they they don't submit your name n the Bible says this in 1st Corinthians chapter 12 and the 24th verse it says our for our comely parts have no need but God hath tempered the body together having given more abundant honor to the part which lacks that there should be no schism in the body well praise the Lord amen long doesn't want there to be a schism in the body he wants to work together and so the parts that are weaker or more uncomely the Bible says here those members should have the same care for one another if one member suffers all suffer with it or if one member on enjoy Swift today men siddhappa stores more abundant honor amen praise the Lord you think about your heart and your hearts very vital to the operation your body but listen it's very weak as well it doesn't take much to damage the heart that's why it's protected so well praise the Lord and so many times in the body the members that seen the we kiss for the seamless fragile sometimes they're the ones that God bestows were abundant on Iran because they serve a function that maybe you don't see it visibly like your hand in your finger here I Amen I think God for prayer I just got back from India here amen and I know people were praying for me and I know what it means to me as a minister when people are praying for you because that's what makes the difference a man does anything but the people that come together and they pray and brother Branham here I was just reading this cooked at home church here the other day my brother man when he's getting regular Palestine he asked the people to pray for him he says those prayers he says that would be accounted to you for those souls just as much as my efforts over there and then listen don't ever think your Labor's in vain he said well I'm just praying for this and this son I didn't do nothing special you shut up and you believe the word and you're praying for one another and the Bible says when one rejoices one long-desired we all rejoice because listen it's a body we need each other and when you begin to recognize - somebody's not me versus them or this person here is this person not here and when I don't care if it's your pinky toe gives it a little paper cut and you watch the whole line we're gonna work he'll walk normally medicine captain you break out the bandage and you get out the alcohol the body takes care of itself and then listen these hands if I cut my toe these guys aren't in pain yeah they feel the burn into what's going wrong because it's connected to the body and you become connected to this body of Christ connected when you come to this body your subject you're subject to sufferable one summers but we also rejoice when one is honored Amen how God has tempered us together why that there would be no schism in the body praise our Lord my my brother in says this and this isn't a question as it answers 1954 he says and I think this is relevant to what I'm saying tonight he says I'll give you my estimation of what I think is the closest thing to an evidence that a man is a Christian than anything I know of you know what it is now watch this now this is not what most people would think but he says it's travail of soul but that's a remarkable thing we thought be something else look at exciting he said this true battle soul a person that's always so hungry and thirsting for God than just simply deny they just keep stamped they've got to do something for God they're full of love and they're just soldier we all just travail them all the time the Bible says he that goeth forth song and tears will doubtless return again rejoicing bringing with him precious sheaves as I ride he says all those sins now watch this analogy he uses is it now look this church he said it this morning if this group who people here that I if God would say now look William Brando I'm gonna make you answer for that group of people what you tell them now what do you want do you want them all to shout to share I want them to shout do you want them to all speaking with tongues I won't ever one of them - that's not there some message churches hey I'll come back to here in a minute hey man he says this do you want a wall to dance in this merit he says I want every one of them - all right well that's good but what would you rather have them do and he says I'd rather have a church that has such a burden on their heart for prayer than the Justina's altar and we'll be here day and night yells and in their house just constantly in prayer and humble and trying to get people to come to God and make him call the hospital and visiting the sick and trying to get people to come to church and do right I'd rather have that then all the other put together he says the although the other is right it belongs to the church so I want to make sure I don't throw that out amen I'm all for something praising God we can do that - amen I think we ought to shout rejoice because God speaks to us in the first place we ought to be excited about that amen he says but if I had to have I put that first because if you've got that the other will take place so I don't have to make you praise God come on guys let's get go when that happens the other will take place that's when that person you've been praying for for months they get delivered and they get saving you see them in church I don't have to make you rejoice you rejoice just finally because they're sick in their body and you see the Lord do something on the line when you're praying for your traction you're praying for salt Franco would give you a greater measure and you see it come to pass nobody has to make you praise God nobody has to make you shop you've got a reason to shop you got victory amen he's you got that you just get so hungry for God that shouting will take place you got so hungry for God speaking in tongues will take place he's not so hungry for God you just keep on her and keep this up you go to seeing yourself get indifferent just remember look out there's another spirit trying to work itself in their notes the other spirit come so if we see ourselves getting indifferent we know what spirit that is and then we shouldn't be indifferent with one another we should actually be trying to bear one another's burdens all the Bible says bury your own Amen not me trying to shuck paper are there any of you you know fix my tire for me cuz I don't want to do it nothing like that amen and then we should we shouldn't have to we shouldn't have to make each other feel each other's burdens because we're part of the body amen it's one thing to have ramps is one thing to have sympathy but compassion is doing the will of God amen since what we're talking I just know I feel bad for somebody this is this is what I'm saying you get a burden and maybe you don't know why it's because you're touched with their and further mister the Bible says Amen it's one thing to just feel bad about it that's something to be touched by it hey man so a lot of Christians are they they encounter these same conditions and like I said they feel heaviness they feel burdens and this we live in a dark and an erotic age and you've got every scientist in every psychologist and every doctor telling you oh it's just this it's just that and men's hearts are failing for fear a man and many times we think there's something wrong with us because we we do what we all do when we get sick we will get on Google and look it up and we'll I'll get on the Mayo calm website well I got this sin oh you do you feel you feel sad sometimes well yes I do oh well there's something wrong with you it's like that's everybody hey oh do you ever get discouraged well I want so I hope you might have this oh mercy Lord I've got this problem I got that problem and a lot of times the devils put a scarecrow on you hey man many times just the devil trying to say there's something wrong with you and actually st. Joe God's actually got enough confidence in you but he's trying to get you to Christ I need you two to intercede for somebody else what the sisters his sister God's trying to use you is what it is and we were talking certain things in this somehow I'm getting it all tonight mmm but I said it's the Lord's trying to get you to pray about a certain thing or entering for a certain thing and you don't realize it I don't know what that does for you but that got her excited what she realize that her problems and a trial wouldn't even her own but God had enough confidence in that little lady that he went to pray through her for him eating the body amen see it changes your whole attitude about the burden and I'm gonna have myself here a little bit amen but it's because she didn't recognize it my brother man he talked about this and I'm he uses this example he's talking about somebody who's asked about speaking in tongues so I'm not trying to make y'all Pentecost tonight but it's it's in the word amen but he talks about this in questions and answer he says I when I asked your brother he says have you ever felt the Holy Ghost shaped you so bad till you just couldn't hardly say nothing would you sit quiet sometimes just sit there and cry have you did that he says left the Holy Ghost now he's talking about this because the person asks about tongues is the reason people don't speaking with tongues many times is they don't know how to yield themselves to the spirit now and I want you to saying this pertains to anything with the spirit not just this amen he says many times they don't know how to yield themselves the spirit they're looking for something way off this is what we do we're looking for something away off they says when it's right on them that's the reason they don't some people just get this as worked up in emotions a bunch of words it has no meaning still got the Holy Ghost amen he says the people that are looking for something far and they miss it because it's there already amen amen praise the Lord my brother and he gives you an example in his own life and for the sake of time I'm not gonna read the whole quote but many of you were probably hopefully familiar with the story a brother man talks about time he was at the hotel they were having meetings and he was at the hotel praying one day and he got a burden on him amen like I was talking about earlier I don't know how bad it was but it was so bad really bad said they he told Billy Paul go ahead and have brother Baxter preach the meeting he got so burdened he didn't even want to preach a man I don't think we're the brain just skip Church skip Church it must have been that bad it was so heavy on him he said go ahead and run without me amen and he got down and he begin to pray and I want you know this is the prophet of God now this is the man that seen visions and he's seen miracles and he asked himself when I'm not like I said it's in the quote but he he asked himself you said Lord what's wrong with me and he knew something no he thought there was something wrong with him and then we can talk about how spiritually wasn't this that he didn't know he said Lord what's wrong with me and also he said he began to hear somebody praying and he said something like German Arlo ducks the man he's looking around for the bellhop and the owner he's looking who is it and then he finally realized it was him not his praying or I was just so he said it just kind of cuz it's telling me waiting for you done he said when it got done I thought I could run through a troop and leap over a long so that's the way to get where the burden you pray maybe you think there's something wrong the Prophet did to ask the Lord about it quit asking Facebook and quit asking Google could ask in your neighbor asked the Lord motors is something wrong with me and got me into savings and God begin to pray for you and that's how you get rid of the burden hey man we don't have to go drink a bunch of alcohol to get rid of our burdens we've got new wine comes straight out of listen many times we deal with heavy burdens you were never intended to bang them alone jesus said take my love my burdens easy my looks like he's sewing you got a bird you don't think he came back give it to him he never intended you to do it by you some of the break place he put the burden on you so he would pray so now the prop against them praying he goes down to meeting Billie's get ready to go out and bill oppose get ready leaves and I'm calling India and he goes and he preaches that night and many know this testimony but a woman coming to meeting and ship it on the way there the hospital won't even transport her cuz she had tuberculosis so back and lungs it was heat up and they're driving down the road and the hit of thing and she begin to hemorrhage and the bot that time she was supposed to die I'll send some come over and God healed her right there on the side road all the way to me this is the property even see a vision about it he didn't know nothing about that he inquired the time there's at the same time he was praying hotel just something you can do you can stand now you don't have to do it that way necessarily I'm not trying to push a certain thing what I'm saying is when the inspiration comes sometimes it's not making you jump up and down sometimes it feels like a burden because there's a need somewhere and his whole point is if he hadn't prayed if the Lord had interceded for that woman what wouldn't happen to her hey man ah I was just to make another illustration this isn't just the program I'm talking about it's not just telling them talking about I'll give you another quote I'm going to read this one to you tonight brother Brown says this in questions and answers 64 or are you following me all right I'm not trying to not trying to go too fast or anything here but brother Brad says this any questions and answers is in 1964 they asked him can every Son of God be so anointed so he can do miracles signs wonders or is this just he says it at the directions of the Holy Ghost is yes it's out the directions of the Holy Ghost if you are a son of God or a daughter of God how many then we got you tonight wherever you are whatever you are when you have received the Holy Spirit then the Holy Spirit directs you to do things I like that do things you're not talk about fussing fight with your neighbor are you not the message he directs you to do stuff wants you to do some things a man we're gonna get something done in the kingdom of God he says I don't have time I said I he said I wish I could just tell you little stories every man I think of it just have to pass it by but I think this one will hold for just a minute he says I was down and married in Mississippi as many of you oneness people brother Big B was holding a sponsor my meetings he's a oneness brother one night in the meeting Billy Paul and went over to the arena and had give up prayer cards I was pouring down rain and the people were saying outside with umbrellas and things and Billy give up the prayer cards and he'd come to get me is then when he why come to get me there was a little lady that sat down in front and there was another lady walking with a little baby trying to keep it quiet and this little lady sitting here with a little calico dress on ever it was was a mother to and she'd seen the lady you're familiar with the story I hope I wouldn't I want to point something out with us tonight the Holy Spirit spoke to the woman something on her go pray for that baby now watch this Wow she said next time she passes I'll go pray for her that was a good idea watch what happens but when she passed by the lady was holding a prayer card oh she said I couldn't pray for the baby what happened that you could frame of the baby Oh My she's got a prayer couldn't I couldn't pray for the baby said brother branham will pray for that baby tonight and Who am I to pray for the baby if brother Brendan's gonna pray for the baby watch what he says now that was reverent and that was nice but that can't always be the will of God sometimes it's different amen this amendment we get superstitious about this stuff and then we know there's a need maybe in their own life you say well if I get a church son there if I can just get a hold of stone so if I call such-and-such a preacher if somebody comes by and there's a certain thing listen that's nice that's reverent but that can't always be the will of God beside where so much religion and so much preaching and so much preaching churches well it's all week we leave God on this building I've heard so much retarget sikri well if we come and we do this we do that my neighbor my child goes or something I've got to come on the scene I think for church so let's not just get an idea like this one listen she was ready to practice she saw that prayer card many times we're ready to do something for the Lord well somebody else will do it what God told you to do you need to go do it and then listen God was wanting that woman to do it you know the star in the moment anyway God put that on her heart and it was for a reason and God puts things on your heart amen don't ignore it or think it's something else but I want you to learn to recognize maybe in a greater way than you ever had before because maybe there's a need and you are the one that God is wanting to use to meet the need he might not want to use me to get it it might be you it might be you it could be me coming out whatever Amen but if God is speaking to us let's not get a traditional idea many times our traditions make the Word of God of none effect he says that can't always be the will of God sometimes it's different the Holy Spirit kept telling her go pray for that baby finally she thought so now we begin to rationalize like we do finally she's hard well that woman will turn me down cold knowing that she's got a prayer card she wouldn't want me to pray for that baby she brought that baby here not for me to pray for but for brother brand to pray for it well that's not why she brought the baby though she actually brought the baby there to the baby would be healed brother Brown was just the means of the end is that right but see how she did why nobody want me to pray amen brother Brown will pray for so the hatred the spirit kept saying go pray for that baby finally like I like this promoter wasn't even the best finally she's a while to relieve myself I'll just give her my seat sit honey would you want you got that baby we did it come sit here take my seat oh honey I don't want to take your seat I'm trying to keep the baby quiet oh but you look so tired and worn I should say well I am well sit down here and take my seat and she said I see you got a prayer card perhaps there's a brother I'm gonna pray for your baby she said well I hope this number will be called said well I do too unless she said well are you sister are you a Christian said oh yes Justin I'm a Christian too and said ever since I've been sitting here the Spirit of the Lord has been Tommy pray for that baby would you give me permission now what you think about that she rationalized their own mind already she don't want me to break I like it you know well if I pray for the baby maybe maybe something bad will happen like what we do amen what's that push they might turn me down and they'll be worse Wow well they might not want me to pray for him but what if gluttonous means my prayer well then you'll be in the exact same spot you're in any way trying to put some complex on well you're just not good enough you're not brother randomly you're not the past you're not us but your son would you give me permission let me give it permission would you give me permission I know brother Brown will proof that baby if it's called and you just keep holding your card he'll get it said but if I lay my hands upon the baby and just offer a little prayer to make myself feel better oh and get out from under what's calling me wouldn't offend you you know what she said I would offend me greatly don't you program I'm the only the prophet of God will pray from hi baby don't you go crazy I'll let somebody I'll call up Billy Paul and you get him on the phone what do you figure she said why certainly not maybe in the fender listen you are if you get bored you've got nothing else to pray for will pray for little brother Alex I'll take all perfect yet you ain't gonna send me one Mitch hey man praise the Lord I believe it be hope to be even if you don't I'll take it Amen I believe in the power of prayer I believe it's in every Christian I believe it as the Prophet said when the weakness Christian Christians had pray for one another pray for me pray for you Pastor she said why it's certainly not darling pray for the baby see the mom never had an issue with it it was the woman she was the one in the way where are the ones that get in the way hey it was a little blue baby and the little lady prayed for it she give the lady your seat climbed up there Bobby was standing up some Christian brother better gentleman enough to get up and give this lady's seat so she sat down about a half hour later I came to me spoke for a few minutes called the prayer cards this one was third or fourth in line with the baby she said there said oh thank you lord the woman about you said thank you lord I felt so sorry for that little mother I believe the baby will get well now baby it's true oh my she said I believe the baby will get well now because brother branham just the third or force and thank you Lord sitting there feeling for the baby then when I come up start praying for the baby when the lady come up I looked here so now your baby is a blue baby you brought it here to be prayed for and your name is mrs. so-and-so new comes from such in such a place but the baby's already healed hi my there was the woman up is about me what's on her heart by the name of mrs. cells are sitting up in the balcony first one on the end of the fourth row prayed the prayer of faith for the baby and the babies are here she almost dropped down in her seat I tell you what if sometime you stop feeling sorry for yourself and get downloaded you might fall out of your seat I think you would shock some of us tonight to know what God can do in your life is he just surrender to God a little more submit to God just be a little more firm get a burden for your brother sister you would be shocked how didn't would shock the church tonight if we realize just how much the Lord will see you each one of us I believe God will see use you don't see is you he said I normal sees this guy and that guy and this person God will see is you hey man the Bible says in the last day his people not just the preacher up trauma just the prophet his people wouldn't do exploits listen you've met a promising God before you God is owning you to do the supernatural you look more supernatural part here sustained by supernatural power you heard from a supernatural right there ain't nothing normal about you put this on passed out and you need to put this on mainland oh you're a supernatural people born by supernatural inspiration Grace and say Lord if you want to use me maybe you have to get a little burden like that woman maybe have to go through a few things but I'm saying lord if it's for your kingdom if it's for your people Lord I'm willing to be used by God I don't want to bluff about it or RV or fuss about I'd submit to it this man talks about I believe it's blasphemous names he said them men of old they're those apostles there were men a few words one they're wrong I said Lord let me be such a prisoner like the Apostle Paul we're gonna have to give me a flowchart and the play-by-play and enough information though I can understand it God just one word from you God - one little myth from God it's a commandment to me Maria she almost dropped out of her seat it reminds me of a I was reading the book of Acts of the night when Peter for the kids and peers in prison they're praying here's the man they're praying for we say oh that couldn't be me you're the one singing your brain don't be surprised that God answers prayer uh-huh praise the Lord that's pretty good Damon let's see if we understood how effective our prayers were we'd pray a lot more we wouldn't have to be told to pray we'd do it a man I don't know if I were sure my my little girl had testimony she was praying few years back we had real dry season up there where we're at in Van Wert and hadn't rained for weeks and she asked me Virginia after daddy can we pray for rain I said that's a good idea in the Bible Elijah was a passion he would know different you know and he prayed for instance we'd go and pray for she prayed for I went in the store and I come on ten minutes later and I tell you what he was pouring you can say what you want to think about that but I believe God answers the prayers of children he's hot listen he said to have a favorite child hey man how many sometimes we didn't have faith like that I don't have to have explained or drawn out something he said it I believe that settles it I'll tell you what my little girl one to pray a lot more after that you realize God hears your prayers and he wants to use you it'll change your whole attitude towards serving God this one my father overseen amen watch what the Prophet says here there's not what if she had not done that it's what I really want to come to with us tonight what if she had not done that what about him framed for that woman what if he'd not done that what if he just took some pills or what took a nap or whatever what if she had not done that see what I mean that woman would have hadn't made me more sympathy for that baby a mother to baby than I would and the mother being he says can we all do miracles yes can we all do miracles yes when you're directed by the Holy Ghost to do miracles God you ask seek again he's in us to do stuff hey man if he's in here he's gonna be rivers rivers of living water for the rest there was a truck too and then he's not a hot water heater in you he's not a kiddie pool in you he's got rivers coming up there's something you coming out to do something and listen I don't believe it's like that it wasn't no little trickle oh my goodness a man but the best is a big old Gus shirt come on Smita rock amen I believe is enough brought you here tonight we could just tap into it my face God could mean everything [Applause] anyone in bondage amen we we don't suffer tonight from a lack of resources and then we're not suffering Zach because there's not enough power to get the job done brother rested we got untapped resources brother I tell you what if a surveyor came out here tomorrow and he checked this church out and he found out there was a big thing of oil under this church you'd have a big decision to make amen none of that resources that would change how you treat this problem I don't forget another building what you want to do one big go pump out here hey man when you realize what you got available and the devil election is going to think you're just an ordinary person nothing ordinary about you now if that woman would not have carried out what God told her perhaps they've been a rebuke in the spirit to her she disobeyed God amen think about what would happen that baby if that woman is this thing God had an that uncle's had a nag her into it but I don't want to say it that way but he had to really pull out every man who pray for the baby would pray for the baby because he wanted to do it and that's how he wanted to do it and she hadn't done it what would hurt him into that baby than that mother what you think about every smart with your own life if God is wanting to use you certainly if you're not really Cernan - what's it mean maybe maybe the person sitting next year maybe a lost them maybe someone you don't even know yet amen he says this always always if you are a Christian something is persuaded to do something go do it and he says again go do it don't doubt it go do it I think you wish to go do it he's trying to emphasize something there amen don't doubt it good it's like I said this woman she had nothing to lose really and then we act like we're gonna lose out if we pray for somebody or share a message with amen well listen I said I look I've done I've been that way before look up here all holier than thou now go get that from me I've done the same thing I love no point in doing that that's pointless you don't know listen when Jesus tells the parable the seats are their master team that he just thrown it everywhere he throws on stony ground he throws it on the path but he's not worried about running out hey man where it goes determines what turns out listen that sheets over he's not worried about it he throws it out there hey man listen I'd rather be guilty throw it out there and land on the wrong ground they're not throwing out there in missed the right ground well I'm not trying to sound glib but it's true we we act like we're gonna man well my co-workers there they're gonna think I'm a Holy Roller think you won already Williams just tell you now huh especially you sisters if you're out there in the world and they're gonna think you're nuts anyway they're gonna call you might as well get started now what are we worried about anyway I ain't doing this because I'm trying to impress nobody all right if I see one salt listen one salt sweet ten thousand words listen they can go to a ballgame you get excited they can they can go with honor get excited over there their presidential nominee when they get exciting though rhyme the streets no carinii but when one soul comes a guy because results rocks and excites me the sea got boost something for every one of his little laflamme's I'll be honest maybe it sounds silly but listen if I come to church I'm happy for you sure about that oh man I tell you what I hear that and I began to get excited I get a little victory next thing I know c1 is honored we're all so then if we're part of the same body there's no schism then it's in our best interest of the other is less so why wouldn't I pray for you why wouldn't I want them hey man why would you want to bless one another remember this is why I say this many times we miss opportunities do something for the Lord because we mistake it as a as a personal trial or a personal issue there's something wrong with me and what I'm saying tonight is if you're a Christian God has more confidence in you than you realize amen that was the remarkable thing about job listen it's not remarkable that a man should have conferencing it is in this day and age but the idea that a mention of confidence God everybody should have confidence in God God can't fail and you can't live really spiritually and some staff conferencing god that's another thing when you always God have put confidence in you not in your flesh and your natural belly but in the Lucky's place in you he's got enough confidence in you that he wants to intercede through you he wants to speak to you he wants to minister to you that's a marvelous thing we don't want to take it for granted because we do many times amen that's trying to get our attention and we think it's just us we think were going through a crisis what do you think is what's wrong I think God's actually trying to get our attention no brother Brent talks about his own life he talks about I believe it's in the Uniting same time he said he'd prayed to God because he had tension in his life he's familiar with this but he had a tension in his life and he he prayed God would take that tension from his life and I want shows God never took that tension from his life but he took the fear of it out of his life see the tension actually made him who he was he said I might not even be a Christian without that time listen that nervousness that that bit on edge it's cuz he was built that way it was for a reason God couldn't take that from him without changing who he was but he took the fear of it away and that's what I want you tonight to realize that don't be afraid if God has used you or if you're going through this rings a bell if this resonates with you if you realizes God speaking you don't be afraid of a bird and don't be afraid of maybe Daniel look what he went through it's for a reason and when you realize that it takes the fear of it away cuz that's what's the real problem is the fear of it Amen I give it I talk about time others at the home church I give an example I said if I woke up and I come to church here tonight and I said in the vine awesome my stomach just hurt like there was a knife in my stomach and I was up here I get I'd probably shut down the server three quick and then I'd be concerned I didn't know what's wrong did I eat something there's something happened you know handsome I wouldn't know what's wrong and I'd go to the hospital or whatever because of the fear of it amen but if that same service I cover tonight and and a brother comes in here comes a brother Brian a big 300 foot pound gorilla of a man comes in and he wants to slug him and I jump in the way and I take that blow for him listen it's gonna hurt just as much it's gonna make me suffer just as much but I'm not gonna be afraid I know I know and because I know why not only will I do it I would do it again do it again [Music] [Applause] and then when you realize what it is when you even your trials your trials they're not they're not pointless the trial your faith is worth more than gold trying to fire we don't really sit that way when we go through it but how many can testify you've been through a trial and you went through it and maybe you Co along years later and you run into something they're going through the exact same thing and you can stand and testify I'm know God is faithful I know exactly what you're talking about I've gone through that and I know that the same did for me can do it for you listen your trials and the burdens of things you go through there for a reason and when you realize it it takes the fear of it away I'm not saying not gonna have trials can't make that promise that would be a lot through much tribulation we do enter the kingdom amen yeah I can't say nothing to have trials but I could strike and testify he'll take you through and I can't say that you'll never get a burden but I can testify I'll help you bear the burden and then he'll make a way when there's no leg and that's the miraculous thing see now you're not afraid of the pain little more my children I mean how many parents you see your kids sick you saw if I could just take that for them I would be sick listen your heavenly father already did it for you if you feel that way how much more does God feel that way in you so don't be surprised when you go through this it's gone in here he's actually entering in in you to the infirmary the Bible tells us to endure hardness as a good soldier a man I like that and do hardness as a soldier soldier sometimes I gotta take some blows cuz it's part of the job and then it didn't say to her hardness as a victim didn't say didn't do her hardness the song has got rougher than everybody else you endure hardness as a soldier listen that soldier when he's enlisted he knows he's gonna go through fights he knows he's gonna be attacked but he knows he's gonna win in the end if he's got the right kind of leadership he's in the right army hey man listen captain you're gonna listen there's a reason you wear armor hey men you're you're expected to take some gloves we've expected some fiery dark to come our way and then that's why you've got a ship listen if I tell you what let's just one of these guys camps out in the foxhole and lets the girls do the fighting y'all I'm on a wall hey man one of these guys with the Stolen Valor listen if you're lifted and you're in the fight you're gonna be attacked you're gonna get hit but listen you don't have to get defeated cuz you've got on the armor that can take every blow give that a shield that can quench every fiery darling and you've got a sword it can cut through their soul and spirit to the dividing asunder of the Johnson Larry listen you've got the weapon to defeat the devil when the doctor don't have it and the psychologist don't have it and politics don't happen the banker don't have it you've got the answer to the devil's question Paul talks to the bottom and he's striving for masteries his temper listen these guys he he talks about he buffets himself these guys are getting a boxing ring they don't think I'm gonna get off like it hit never they know they're gonna get hit probably I want at least once or twice less they just toilet lay the guy out and then it's expected but they're conditioned because they know that they can give it a lot better than they take it and then if I get hit this much I'm gonna hit him back twice as hard I know that I can in do her and hit a lot harder than the enemy and listen what you've been equipped with the message you've been given you look built to win the battle whatever movie hits you at you equipped it with standing you're gonna put the head and back you're equipped to overcome and then God didn't put you on the front lines through thought well you be the first to die just give up no but he's saved the very best he called the very greatest a man say what he named did the poor the despised think the base but they that humble themselves got his out hey man he's just looking for something that could submit themselves enough for God say God use me to pray that need my church to witness to that person in need Lord use me or don't use my intellect or my ability or just take my willingness you supply the ability you supply the armor you supply the sword you supplied everything Lord I'm just here offering myself Lord when you begin to deal with my heart I don't want to harden my heart I don't want to ignore it listen many times that's what we do we get a burden or something we get on the phone we talk to everybody we talk to everybody but God about it what I'm saying is let's give it to the Lord and see what he does you might drop out of your seat amen endure hardness as a swimmer your soldier retaining your thinking that's why you suffer sometimes because you're in a battle and then your soldier you're not the victim you're not the one being occupied or press your the liberation we're the ones that have come under the auspices of our Lord Jesus Christ that this creature might be delivered from bondage but then the captives might be set free like it listen if you're gonna fight you should you might get a little blood on your sword might get a few dings in the armor a man let's talk about that pray then roman soldiers coming in i can't remember the generals name but he come in there and that one man he comes along i'll beat up and everything he said i want this guy to write on my chariot next to me that's the one right next to me the one who's all beat up looking at his armies blood-stained sword cuz he done some fighting that's the one I want standing next to me and then I believe God looking for some soldiers to get out of the cave and take the whole I think he's looking rusted bloody the sword a little bit tonight they're men they're hardnesses soldiers a man let's say them I might put some calluses on your knees a man might cost you a little sleep hey man but listen there's victories there behind there's glory to be manifested in the bride of Jesus Christ through our Lord Jesus Christ amen four soldiers tonight amen so let's let's endure hardness his soldiers they man I could I could good enlisted man should we're not victims but we're fighting we're here we've reported for you I was reporting for duty tonight amen as you stand to your feet we're reporting for duty tonight amen listen uh if I get hurt a little bit that's all right I just hit him back twice as hard by the grace of God god help me to get rid of that wishbone get a backbone thus all our listeners every tooth of my body falls out I don't want a gum the devil to death hey man I want to be able to say it

their credentials and their boast about how spiritual they're you know what Paul said I'm gonna Gloria my infirmities a little bit let's not suffered for this church I ain't kind of difficult see I was imprisoned I was beaten I was shipwrecked that's what he could boast um I was willing to suffer for the people of God Daniel had to suffer he could go first and things but think of what it was when it coming on the other end what a testimony in that wasn't overcoming that's what I want my life amen he never promised me a trial free existence so I might as well quit trying to live one and
