bad for missing my service okay make sure you make them feel bad don't worry I'll do enough of it on my own amen no they go to they go to literal life so they're allowed to go to their church I guess too huh but they miss my service brother you know what I mean no I'm just kidding ah it's just man I feel so good amen amen if you have your Bibles we wish you open up to uh first John 4 it's really lovely to see you all amen and we're just here to try to be a blessing and a help to you this morning amen first John chapter 4 first John chapter 4 and we're going to start at verse 7 by his grace 1 John chapter 4 and we're going to start at verse 7 1 John chapter 4 and verse 7 the scripture reads beloved let us love one another for love is of god everyone that loveth is born of God and knoweth God he that loveth not knoweth not God for God is love this was manifested the love of God toward us because that God sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him and here's my text hearing his love not that we loved God but that he loved us said his son to be the appropriation for our sins we bow our heads for a prayer most gracious kind Heavenly Father Lord I Just Want to Thank You Lord for this morning God Lord the last couple days have been gloomy and and just seemed like a little depressing but Lord this Sunday morning your son Shone Lord God and as we're in this fall season as we were driving up here Lord it it was just nice to see the leaves and so forth brother B taught us when his mom was dying trying to comfort her his sister saying when is things most pretty is in their death precious in the sight of the lord of the death of their Saints and Lord as I came up here it was just a nice drive and it was just oh Lord just just a wonderful Sunday to come in the house of God to Worship You Lord Lord God it's so much beautiful when we die to ourselves and allow the resurrected Christ to live inside of us oh God Lord Jesus no doubt we all have testimonies we all have different stories of how we ended up here but Lord we ended up in the same place in The Bride of Jesus Christ in your in your bride Lord God destined for these last days Lord God and now we're here gathered under that mighty name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and we pray now God according to your grace and your mercy may you take this time and speak to our hearts Lord we commit ourselves unto you as unto a faithful Creator we're trusting and believing now in the name of thy son our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ the bride say together amen God bless you you may be seated I'm going to give you my title and then we'll get into a little bit and it's I really struggle with the title but then I really like this so I'm just going to go with it anyways I'm going to call it an unconditional Covenant needs unconditional love an unconditional Covenant needs unconditional love and how I kind of came up to this it's actually kind of interesting it's actually from a testimony um I just heard this week I uh took a young couple out to dinner last Sunday and so forth and we got to talking and and um he shared with me how he came back and so forth and he says something that was so intriguing to me it just got me thinking over and over and over again about it and you know it's amazing sometimes we forget we we look at these Bibles stories and we're so appreciative of these Bible stories and these Bible stories can teach us lessons and things like that but we have to remember that we have stories too amen remember the the book of Acts doesn't have amen at the end do you know why because there was more book of Acts to write and so I like using our examples and showing that through our lives we're expressing the word as well we're expecting expressing Christ through our lives yeah so as I was sitting down with this young couple um I started talking to I said listen how'd you come back this this young man uh um you know he was kind of out in the world but kind of not he was going to a different church and so forth he was just trying to discover himself and and so forth like that we all have different walks and we all different things that we need to go through amen and he met this girl and so forth at this other church this girl knew nothing about the message this boy was raising the message and he knew some things about and so forth like that and so and so they started talking and he end up going into a relationship with this girl and everything like that and when he's finally start feeling the pull to come back and so forth cuz he knew what was right he knew what was correct um this girl didn't know anything about this stuff amen and so when she first discovering this she was kind of getting Shell Shocked you know what I mean and and that's fair you know what I mean I mean she didn't know anything about it she didn't hear about this stuff as far as she was concerned she was serving the lord the best she knew amen amen but what what intrigued me about their story what was so amazing about it was was his attitude towards her the entire time as she was coming along and now they both go to our church and she's just much as much believer as you and I are amen right straight out of the world Amen and I but I loved his attitude towards it amen he told me he said listen brother Stephen I never doubted I never doubted because I knew what was in inside of her and I loved her he said I loved her and I knew she was going to be okay so she was wearing pants or something like that didn't bother him one bit and I got to thinking really that didn't bother you at all he said not one bit I knew she was going to be okay I just knew and it didn't change what she was doing didn't change how he felt about her I don't ain't that something and as I kept thinking about it and thinking about it I got to thinking you know that's what really changes us is that kind of unconditional love amen that see what he did was he had an unconditional Covenant with this girl that he just met out of the world Amen plucked her right out but she he had enough faith in her and that's what changed her life ain't that something amen as we think about this unconditional Covenant do you know what that means unconditional actually brother's going to tell you it's that first quote in 65 I heard you Roan don't worry I want to let you know he had a covenant with AB Adam the first man on earth and that Covenant was on conditions if you do so and so I'll do so and so Adam would have had something to do in order to keep the Covenant alive before God keep that in mind he had to do something to keep it alive so that means if he didn't do it it was dead amen he had to walk in God's way keep all of his word not breaking one word boy that seems tough it is tough do you know Israel went through 4,000 years of History to prove to you how hard that is remember Israel blindness in part happened to Israel right uh we know that uh uh the Paul taught us that the law came to teach us what was right and wrong to teach us us that we were in this condition and he sent those Israelite people through all of that history just to tell you you can't do it amen not a matter of work can make it into heaven amen he couldn't break one word if you broke one word it was all off woo that sounds oh that doesn't sound good aren't you glad he doesn't stop talking though that paragraph 30 but then he made another Covenant amen and that was with Abraham this Covenant was not on conditions amen but was unconditionally God gave the Covenant to Abraham no strings tie do it at all unconditional not I will I have I have already done it amen see that's that's what unconditional mean it means the opposite of conditions so what's the opposite of conditions it means no [Applause] conditions God spent thousands of years trying to rip conditions away from us and we keep adding them on Amen oh I'm not worried oh I can't do it and things like that what does an unconditional Covenant need it needs unconditional love do you understand if God gave you an unconditional Covenant that means he loves you unconditionally that's how much he loves you hearing is love not that we love God but that's how much God loved you that he took no conditions on the promise he made to you glory to God oh I feel like shouting amen when we sit here all depressed and tired thinking we can't make it we got to put it back into our hearts that there's no condition to This [Applause] Promise he never told Abraham if he told him I have he never told you if he told you I have who glory to God hallelujah aren't you so thankful for that that's what we want to talk about this morning this Covenant that we're talking about is unconditional but in order to receive an unconditional Covenant you have to be able to receive unconditional love it's so contrary to us too ain't it so contrary to human nature brother Bram says that in case you're wondering we always got to put something on it we always got to put a price tag on things amen think about it like this let's say you do one wrong thing okay let's say you did one wrong thing and you go to the Altar and say Lord I did one wrong thing for the next two weeks I won't do anything wrong anymore do you think those two weeks would get rid of that one wrong thing do you think all a sudden it just evaporates into the sky now because you were so good that it erased that bad thing you did of course not amen of course you don't do that amen so you see sometimes we're putting price tags on things that God's been ripping price tags off he's been he's been sending he's been a clearance uh he's been sending a clearance through the store amen there ain't no price tag on this it's if you want it you can have it you see why we're talking about this it's more than just knowing it's unconditional it's you when you pray it's you when you act it's you when you talk that you understand that the Covenant is unconditional spending so much time on your sins you know what I mean just wallowing in your sins and wallowing in the pain and and oh I just fail all the time you're wasting your time doing that do you understand that you are wasting your time oh I wish we stopped wasting our time you know what I mean redeem the time for the days are evil amen it's time to redeem our time you're not going to make it because you're better than the other person in the Pew this morning you're not going to make it because you are oh yeah you s in the same pew see and you make it a church every single time you're not going to make it because of that you're going to make it cuz Jesus saved you from your sins you're going to make it because of Jesus Amen I like that a little bit better amen oh that's when you start really understanding what it means to be a Christian amen I'm going to tell you something that's what's going to change you unconditional love has the power to change you [Applause] Hallelujah it'll change your attitude towards one another who preach at brother Steven I think I will amen it makes you look at people different amen when you have unconditional love one to another for God is love and if he put no conditions on you how are you putting conditions on others well here we are I hope I get called next time amen here we are anyhow amen did you know if you you received unconditional love one of the evidences of doing that is extending it to others in the Lord's Prayer Amen in Matthew the Bible tells us forgive us our debts as we forgive those that are indebted to us brother b stand in perfect faith faith is based on forgiveness amen you can't believe you are forgiven unless you have the ability to extend it to somebody else preach it brother Steven well we're here okay bitterness is the worst thing you can have in your life there has never ever hear me Church okay you hear me right now there's not one Grudge one bitterness one thing you've held on like that that has ever been worth it in your life you need to die to it get rid of it amen it's never worth it never worked I hope you hearing me brother said bitterness can drive the Holy Ghost farther from you than anything else do you know why he say that faith is based on forgiveness if you can't forgive you can't believe do you know you forgiving is way more important than you doing everything right Hallelujah I tell you what I say we kill legalism this morning amen that's all that's doing amen aren't you scared people are going to do whatever they want nope not at all no amen you know why the Bible says the grace of God teaches us to an ey unrighteousness but you know what also the Bible says the Bible say Godly sorrow leadth thee to repentance it doesn't say Deliverance is Deliverance good absolutely is Deliverance needed absolutely does God give Deliverance 100% but you know you're still going to mess up if you if you could ever live your life without messing up why did God have to bring you an unconditional Covenant do you see think about it like this okay you look do you know why it's so hard for you to believe in unconditional Covenant you're always thinking what does God get out of it you're thinking oh it only benefits me how does it benefit God what do you mean how it benefits God what does God want then God wants you to know him and in order for God for you to know that he'll love you despite it all despite any condition he's still going to love you in order for you to understand that he put you in this situation right now so you can know him in the fullness of it that is Bible in case you're wondering and I'm going to scroll down it's in uh it's in Romans 5 watch this Romans 5:1 the scripture reads therefore being justified by faith do you hear that therefore being justified by what fath faith faith in who you nope mine's well you're wasting your time with that remember when Jesus cursed the Fig Tree they came by and said boy Jesus that went really quick what' he say oh well make sure you're going to church every Sunday morning pay your ties and things like that you're not as good as me that's why you couldn't curse fig tree did you oh that was actually pretty good wasn't it that's a lot deeper than even I realized amen he didn't say act like me he didn't say he didn't say like you know what I mean like oh it's just because I'm farther than you what did he say he said have faith in God that's right not in yourself that's right amen have faith in God and you could say to the tree be thou plucked up amen didn't mention anything you did just told you to have faith in God therefore being being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ verse Two by whom we are also we have access by faith into his grace where we stand you know you have access this morning amen this ain't no VIP thing you know what I mean you don't have to have a special card you just do you believe you believe then come on in you say brother with all my sins bring everything you have you don't want pause it right there we'll finish this you know one of my favorite testimonies brother B ever did is that guy who smoked I love this testimony so much I think it's so it's such a it's such a great story to correct our attitude a little bit Amen brother BR met that guy who smoked he said I don't know if I can get baptized I still smoke he said quit looking at yourself oh that was the problem he needed to quit looking at himself how you guys doing today huh spend some of us spend too much time in the mirror don't we amen looking at ourselves don't we he said quit looking at yourself and look at what he [Music] did amen and sure enough he did and he got baptized he said that guy got saved ended up that guy got in a wreck or so forth ended up in the hospital and he started crying I need a cigarette I need a cigarette and and uh brother Bram heard it and he said hey go tell him brother BR go buy him for him guess what that guy didn't smoke a cigarette after that and got delivered from it amen see I hope you understand the the Covenant is unconditional when he said it's unconditional did you know he meant that and why is it unconditional God's trying to show you something which is in this scripture here verse Two by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in the hope of the glory of God I tell you what when you get justified by faith you get a little more happier than you were before well we're preaching this morning I hope you don't mind amen we're going to be all over the place amen legalism will never make anybody happy never has never will but when you really understand the grace of God all you can do a smile I don't smile that well amen but my dad said why don't you smile and I just get a straight line on my face you know but I'm happy don't worry I'm happy I'm real happy amen doesn't matter what I look right here in my heart I feel happy amen doesn't matter what I'm doing on the outside in my heart I'm still happy [Applause] amen i g tell you something you know how important Joy is in your life you know how so important it was to David one time when he got caught in sin what he did with basba and it was pretty bad you think you're bad look what David did amen David David took one of his most trusted loyal thing loyal followers and put him in the front go kill him so he can marry his wife because he already laid with her and so forth that's that's pretty rough and he went down in the dups and what did he pray he said restore unto me the joy of my salvation you are not here to be all depressed all the time amen God didn't give you salvation just to be sad over here here amen you can have joy when you when you get justified by faith you can rejoice in the Lord You're not rejoicing about yourself you're rejoicing about what he did look despite what I've done I'm still here aren't I glory to God I'm still here I'm still pressing on Lord I'm still here repenting crying out to you Lord I said we start rejoicing amen God is still on our side amen he's never left you nor forsaken you amen he he never he never has there's no price tag on this that's right he paid the debt in full amen hallelujah quit putting a price tag on something he stroke it off said clearance it's all free this morning Hallelujah man this is better than five below amen glory to God and you get some pretty neat stuff there can't you amen but this story ain't got that's all free I pay for it by my blood amen you can walk right in the story as if you own the place amen the Bible says approach the throne of grace boldly amen you can walk in you can drive right up to the door as if you own the place amen and you can just get whatever you want there's no conditions on this Covenant glory to God why did he do it verse three Romans 5:3 not only so but we glory in tribulations also knowing that tribulation worketh patience patience experience and experience hope and hope making not ashamed because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given to us do you understand an unconditional Covenant needs unconditional love if there was no unconditional love then there can't be an unconditional Covenant isn't that something that's just so neat ain't it just think about that for a second amen how could God put think about it without unconditional love what would God get out of it then he would get nothing out of it see and that's what you struggle with sometimes like I said before you're wondering what does God really get out of unconditional Covenant do you know he actually get something out of it you know what it is the Bible says in Hebrews 12 for the joy set before his face he just he endured the cross despising the shame what was the joy what we so happy about what was he going to get out of the deal Hallelujah glory to God wait you were that much to him you were that much to him hallu and he needed you to understand just how much he loved [Applause] you he needed you to understand it amen and in order for you to understand his unconditional love towards you glory to God he sent you an unconditional covenant What does covenant mean it means Testament what does testament mean it means a promise it all means the same thing amen it's a promise and attached to this promise is no strings attached and what does God get out of it you know how much he loves you here he's going to say it right here for you we're going to get to it don't worry I want to read verse five again cuz I was so good amen and hope make it not ashamed because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us for when we were yet without Strength In Due Time Christ died for the ungodly he died for the ungodly ungodly we were not godly people were we and yet even in that situation he still chose to die for you it's the greatest love story ever told amen glory to God I say hallelujah and he sent back the Holy Ghost so what the love of God is now shed abroad in [Applause] you so he did get something out of this he's actually benefiting from loving you you remember something this amen love is extremely subjective amen we all love different things you know I got girls at home and so forth like that I got a family sure I can love you but I don't love you like my family why it's Rel relationship based it's subject based and things like that and other people look at this book and go that's a god of love those are pretty funny accent I didn't mean to do that that's a god of love matter of fact I'll give you a little uh you know um Oprah riff me I don't mean I don't mean to mention celebrities and so forth but you know she she was actually raised in a Baptist Church in Chicago matter of fact her mom wanted to name her orpa from The Book of Ruth but she misspelled it and mixed the p and the H so that's why she's named Oprah renfrey okay and she said one time the reason why she doesn't believe in God anymore because she was reading her Bible and she found out God could be jealous and she's like wait a minute God could be jealous well wait a minute I'm can get jealous and she attached humanality or like that kind of a thinking how could God be like me hallelujah how could a God be like me and that's what took her away she read the same book you did right amen and she's thinking how could that be the god that loves how could that be somebody that loves me I'm insignificant he can be I'm looking at him as being so much greater and like this false image of God the Bible talks about Frost Christ another gospel amen that's good but when you read it what's happening the Holy Ghost is showing you something and what's the Holy Ghost showing you how much he loves you oh I say he in this love not that we love God but God loved us amen that's the whole point of [Music] it oh hallelujah oh I tell you what that's when you really start getting some victory in your life when you start believing in an unconditional love in your life oh my goodness see it's so anti us is isn't it this flesh this flesh wants to do something remember kades barer brother mam told us that was the greatest failure the Israelite people had is when they wanted to attach a price tag to Grace he said Grace took them out of everything Grace gave him a prophet Grace took him out of Egypt Grace split the Red Sea Grace fed him Grace took everything Grace Grace Grace Grace Grace but then they added a price tag to it amen and that's what was their big is failure amen you know what church I say we start believing in an unconditional love here he's going to say it right here for you I really want to get to the end of this because I want to tell you I ain't making anything up amen it's right here don't wor he's going to say it for us amen verse six for when we were yet without Strength In Due Time Christ died for the ungodly for scarcely for a righteous man one will die yet pre- adventure for a good man some would even Dare To Die see you could believe something like that somebody was an okay kind of guy you know what I mean somebody was just average you know what I mean people would probably die for him some you will probably die for somebody who you know took care of their bill one day helped them out or something like that somebody would probably die for some of these why cuz it's treating it like a favor hey amen so that's what he's saying right here oh sure for a good man who did me good one time I'd probably die for him he was good to me and I like you know I like him a little bit amen so that's what he's saying right here for scarcely a righteous man one would die yet pre- Aventure for a good man someone even Dare To Die verse eight but God commanded his love towards us so what is God trying to do trying to convey to you what his love extent is amen oh brother stepen though why do I have to go through all this maybe because God's trying to show you his love towards you are you going to believe it or not oh but brother Stephen I've been dealing with this besetting sin for years yeah you probably have so have I amen we all got problems I was tell brother over here it's a nice thing I say where there's people there's problems people love drama too Heen just being real with you for a second all right people love that stuff don't think we're immune to it either all right right listen I've been around church folk way too long for you to trick me all right I know I know that's true okay amen I'm GNA get in trouble I hope brother Samuel calls me again where there's people there's problems guess what church you're going to have problems they ain't going to go away anytime soon they're probably going to get a little worse as we keep going on Church said amen they probably are going to get a little worse so you see even in this condition though God had somehow prove to you just how much he loved you then and how he's going to do it if you put a price tag on it then how far does his love go right does he only love you when you were good think about it how would you know if if if that was the case how would you know how far his love went amen how would you know unless you did something wrong how would you know right here but God commanded his love towards us in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us oh I say hallelujah and I said Thank You Jesus Paul one time said I'm the chiefest of Sinners amen and you know what I kind of know what he's talking about I feel like that sometimes too can you say Amen sometimes you feel like the worst failure I've been there amen you you wonder yourself sometimes and you go how did I do this again you know what I mean you ever you ever been like that and listen it ain't just the bad stuff like smoking and drinking I'm not even talking about it anymore and tell you know how sometimes we waste time oh I'm going to go preach I hope you don't mind amen but you know like Social Media stuff and things like that it can be such a whirlpool and you just drown right into it right amen and you go I was on an hour of it somehow you wonder yourself how did I go it's almost like you enter an eternity on your phone how does that happen said brother Stephen what are you talking about I'm preaching from experience I do it too amen I get a I get a thought and I look up YouTube documentaries on it and then guess what YouTube's got to let me know hey if you like that you like this those stupid algorithms don't you hate them then you like that then you watch that you watch that all a you go where did all the time go you know what I mean and you didn't even pray that day you know what I mean and your heart just breaks a little bit and then you start spiraling well well I didn't pray what point of trying now but God commanded his love towards [Applause] us even think about it he died for you before you were even worried about it think about it why you know why you warpool like that and why you get depressed and then you don't even pray anymore because you're like I didn't pray this time what's the point of even asking you know why you end up in there is because you you do care about what's happening oh and see Satan's such a Slicker get you to think there's no point in trying might as well not even go to church that Sunday morning you know how bad I was listen I know this stuff is real yes sir that Devil is a Slicker and you know why you're down in that warpool though it's because you actually do care otherwise it wouldn't affect you listen before I got saved I listen I got saved when I was 23 years old okay before I was saved I cuss like a sailor of course I did that's what the world did so I did it all the time but guess what when I got saved though and I wanted to do it right guess what I still cuss sometimes I still did for a little bit there I still cussed there was one difference though I heard it every time I heard it every time I did it and I and and I started caring about me cussing now you see so then what did it do it made me want to overcome it can I say this then have you begun in the spirit are you now made perfect in the flesh tell me when that doesn't change in your life oh you sit there you go I failed today there's no point in trying what happened no you have to understand you are loved unconditionally despite all your faults you hearing me Church despite what you think about yourself God thinks differently about you and you need to start believing Romans 5A God commanded his love to you in that before you even cared about it he died for [Applause] you oh Hallelujah I say thank you Jesus praise the Lord God now you have to say you don't even have to you don't even have to guess about it even before you cared about it he died for you anyways and now that you do care about it you think he's going to stop loving you all of a sudden you know what I mean did his unconditional Covenant just change for you now all of a sudden even before you knew it even before you cared he still died for you anyways hallu Hallelujah you know you know uh Jesus one time said you know we got you know we got sheep here referencing Israel he said but I got another flock waiting for me and I butchered a little bit you go look up for yourself amen he said I got another flock waiting for me you know who that other flock was you and me he was thinking of us there too you are just as a real in God's thought and you think he all a sudden you know God can't learn a thing new oh praise the Lord Jesus you know God can't come up with a new thought so you know when he thought of you when he said I have another sheep my sheep hear my voice who heard the voice I know I did amen and so when he thought of you a sheep did you know he can't change his mind about you Hallelujah why don't you stop thinking your thoughts start thinking God's thoughts I think that's a better idea don't you think brother B in the church St book our thoughts aren't like God's thoughts you know he said that you know he said our thoughts are not like God's thoughts why do we spend so much time on our thoughts then you know what I mean brother we waste so much time in our thinking don't we waste so much time in our thoughts and we have these thoughts and then we start believing them and you go what what did I do how did I know more about it than this how did you know more about it than this did there's a brother there's a person one time said the Bible's more than just true it's actually pretty cool way of saying it I love this thought so much he said the Bible is more than just the truth he said it's the precondition for truth what does that mean it means this uh you know this day and age we got crazy people out there nowadays who can't even figure out which bathroom they go in you know what I mean and let's say you get those two people in the in the same room and I think you know what I think boys can become girls and girls can become boys and they're sitting across from each other one person says you know I think boys can become girls and girls can become become boys and the other person says you know what I think you're right I think boys can become girls and girls can become boys and they look at each other and they agree with each other and then they walk away who's to say they're wrong who's to say they're wrong they disagreed with each other didn't they they just looked at each other and said you know I think that's a good idea I think that's a good idea they agreed with each other boom they're right how do we know they're wrong it's because you know more about it than them well maybe you do maybe you don't but this says something different this said they're not there's a distinction you know how that perversion came I'm going to tell you something listen Church there's a reason why you sisters wear skirts there's a reason why you sisters are called to be ladies we thought they thought during the 20s it was just oppression upon you they thought in the 20s that that what with the suffrage movement and what started this whole thing about women can be you know work in the workforce like men and and then cut their hair and wear like garments like men and so forth they thought the reason why they were in that condition was because they were being oppressed and so they wanted be like men and now look what we have today they don't know which bathroom to go in now they're saying you can be gender fluid and all this garbage where did it come from that Spirit started from somewhere there's a reason why brother Brandon preached it there's a reason why we preach a clothline religion you hear me Church listen I could care less about getting getting all social up with the world and so like that we don't spend time with the world we preach the gospel and brother bham said if you ain't preaching a clothline religion you ain't preaching the gospel why was it so important cuz look what they have in the world now amen oh my look at the perversion we have and so forth like that where did it come from it's when people got out of their position amen and that's why brother Bram had a preacher can you say amen that's why it's okay for a man to be a man and a woman to be a woman this is more than just right this is the precondition for you to be right amen how do I know I'm right it's because this said it before you did how was I right when I told you about unconditional love it's because Hebrews 5'8 was written before I said it when I said it then you read it that's the precondition of what I just said and brother Brandon said when you put the word upon your mouth is the same as deity speaking glory to God and Hallelujah this is the precondition for deity amen and it's the same thing with you when you put the word upon your mouth and that said you could say it then stop thinking your thoughts and start believing what he said [Applause] amen who I say praise the Lord hallelujah I'm having a good time in the house of the Lord [Applause] amen God wanted you to have an unconditional Covenant and the reason why is so you could understand his unconditional love watch what brother Bram said I'm going to that quote and identify Masterpiece of God paragraph 69 see the love of God I'm GNA wait till they bring it up for me real quick it's about in the middle of the sermon I'm skipping all over the place that poor girl back there has a deal with me can you feel bad amen sometimes amen we forget about the people who run this stuff sometimes amen you remember this do something nice for you musicians amen listen I have a I had a I had a Daddy who played guitar he still plays guitar in church goes to Brother Steve Delaney's church still plays guitar that stuff ain't just an accident that stuff takes work my mom plays church and uh play piano in church and so for like that and we have a good service sometimes and they'll be up there playing for an hour or two hours amen and guess what amen when when that brother right there I I I was surprised I didn't see a nice cold bucket of water out here because we had to cool them off he was so on fire today you know what I mean but do you understand when you're playing doing this for an hour can get tired and that anointing on them still working and things like that you remember your worship team you remember the people who work back there amen do something nice for them amen this stuff ain't an accident amen paragraph 69 watches see the love of God oh brother Stephen I do want to see the love of God he's going to show us the love of God right now amen let's see the love of God after man had fallen and deliberately opened the door to the enemy and come in and Mar him and set death to him still God was not willing this to be defeated still God was not willing to be defeated he came down and started all over again he was going to make that man again he put Adam on a covenant do this and not this this and not that touch not handle not taste not but we find out when he started again he started with Abraham he started him on an unconditional Covenant oh I tell you what that's how he started him on an unconditional Covenant do you know the things that happened to Abraham was not for him alone did you know that you know what I think I think you need to read it I felt that just now I say we read it it's in Romans 4 go and turn to Romans 4 with me uh I don't know if this is in the notes or not so we're just going to turn to it real quick it's in Romans 4 oh I did have it praise the Lord there it is Romans 4:20 watch this here Romans 4:20 you forgive me for that church I just feel so happy sometimes you get lost in the happiness you know what I mean I think that's all right sometimes don't you budddy yeah I think it's okay to get lost when you're happy sometimes you know that happens to you sometimes sometimes you still think you got to know where you're at when you're happy you don't need to know where you're at when you're happy just be happy make those other people you know you know it's all right people see it be happy don't worry about everybody else don't worry about that stuff oh man I'm G give you a testimony here real quick okay keep it at Romans 4 we're going to probably we'll read Romans four and then we'll see what happens okay one time I was at a uh I I used to work at a place called DM DMP Defiance Metal Pro it was a weld jop and um it was a robot welder and you had to go on each side of the robot welder to do the job so I was going alongside the robot weather this way and all a sudden I got to thinking one night this when I was first saved you know brother R said oh the days when I was first Saved I just got saved and I got to thinking I just read in the scripture that the second death will not hurt me and I got to thinking one night this is about 2:30 in the morning I work third shift and I got to thinking man I won't be hurt by by the second death I got you think I shall not die but live and I'll see the glory of the Lord I'm going tell you something I got so excited that night I started running up and down that weld shop right by my machine just shouting praising the Lord I just started going glory to God and Hallelujah I'm not going to be hurt I had a good oldfashioned Pentecostal service that night population me and I wasn't going to let a bunch of you know listen welders aren't necessarily known for being the greatest of people in the world okay amen but I wasn't going to let him stop me I had a good time that night and I started praising the Lord worshiping God I said Thank You Jesus didn't matter I was happy that night amen you hearing me church it's okay to be happy even if you get lost sometimes go ahead and be happy oh you ought to thank God for this morning this is free right now in case you're wondering amen maybe sometimes you're looking for permission to be happy you don't need no permission to be happy God gave you an unconditional Covenant you're allowed to believe it you're allowed to worship God because of it I'm going tell you something it'll do you some good amen when you're depressed you don't have to be like that God gave you such a love he committed his love towards you and that while you were yet a sinner he died for you anyways how can you be depressed when you start believing in that and I start praising the Lord I I win you know that's what I was thinking I win I don't lose I win glory to God I got so happy that night and you know I came down from it you know I was thinking the Lord and I got to the end of the Welch the the machine and I looked at somebody one of my co-workers you know what he did to me brother Brian you know what he did he looked at me and went that's what he did to me that's not nice is it that's what he did I'm just being real with you you know what he was doing he was mocking me that's what he was doing but you know what you're allowed to be happy despite the situation I don't let the devil put a wet blanket on me how about you when you're happy when you feel can I say something here when you feel that unction quit killing it amen [Music] what a waste of time to kill the unction of the Holy Ghost I say we quit it in the name of the Lord amen when you feel the fire burning amen throw some more fire on it can I say something church too when you start seeing the fire of somebody else you throw some fire on there too amen don't worry about the naysayers you know what I said I looked at him when he was making fun of me I looked at him I said wait a minute is he provoking me to worship God some more you know what I did sister I said I'll go ahead and do it anyhow I started running up and down praising the Lord again amen I think sometimes we do when you get a little lost you know what I mean not so much that we try you know brother Ram said when you approach God you don't him with the blank mind and so forth because you can invite any Spirit you bring the word with you amen but he said the word not you you know what I mean oh you bring oh you got to do this you got to do that listen listen sisters I have to tell my wife this all the time too whether whe you know even you go pray something like the dish is going to be there and guess what when you wash those dishes that's what's going to happen the dishes are going to show back up don't they they don't ever stop do they and then and then and then you wash those dishes and guess what there no dishes again little dishes will be there don't worry about that stuff so much you know what I mean get in the spirit of God that's what's going to be more worth it than the dishes oh I'm G to preach now I hope you don't mind don't use that stuff as an excuse you know the you know the parable of Mary and Martha I can never remember which one's which so you forgive me for this amen but remember Mary was doing the dishes wasn't she and Jesus was in the living room with the other Martha or Mary I can't remember with the other sister and what did Jesus tell the other lady she said look at all I've been doing I've been doing what I was supposed to be doing right I'm a homeowner I'm a housewife I'm doing what I'm supposed to be doing look she's not doing what she was supposed to be doing what did Jesus say she picked the better thing you husbands you need to know that too sometimes your wife needs a vacation oh oh man [Music] I'm did you notice I had to say that my wife's not here amen she'll see this though later just don't tell her yet okay give me a couple more days of Freedom before she brings this back on me cuz she will do not worry but it's true anyhow do you see what brother Steven's saying amen those dishes will still be there after you pray that laundry will still need to be folded when you're done seeking the Lord when you're having your L Lan time with God it'll still be there so why do we let that stuff stop us listen listen it's not even the big things you know what I mean it's sometimes it's just the cares of Life get in the way you know what I mean God help us can you say can you say amen God commended his love towards us and that while we were yet sinners Christ died for the ungodly ain't that a great scripture oo I hope we think about that throughout this week amen you remember put that in your heart amen when you're struggling God commended his love towards me even before I cared he did oh Hallelujah I hope you can I hope I hope you can feel the sermon heart this morning that that this unconditional Covenant it was God does get something out of it you're you're not wasting God's time believing in an unconditional Covenant you see you make it so like it's it's it's your human nature that's getting in the way of believing it it's your human nature that wants to put a price tag on things it's getting in the way of you really entering into this thought that you are going to make it in a Rapture not on anything you've done amen but because he commanded his love towards you and that's why you're going to make that's why you're making it now that's why you're going to make it 10 minutes from now 20 minutes from now that's why even when you don't pray sometimes you're still going to make itall even when you're failing God don't worry God ain't failing you God commanded his love towards you that's why we're talking about this to get this really in our heart can you see the love of God I'm so sorry to keep jumping on you guys back there identify Masterpiece again I want to go to paragraph 71 but we find out when he started again he started with Abraham and Abraham he started him an unconditional covenant not if you will I have I've already done it I've blessed you and you and your seed do we got an Abraham seed in here you know you are right in case you're wondering it remember this is the precondition of Truth before I said it did you know in Galatians 3:16 and 29 it already called you Abraham seed so before I called you Abraham seed before I said it this already said it about you amen so you didn't just become Abraham SE because I said it just now that's right you were already that before you heard it just now this is the precondition of Truth Lord so you are you are Abraham's seed amen not if you will I have I've already done it I blessed you in your seed and so forth after you it was an unconditional Covenant he started with Abraham you know what if you forgive me who praise the Lord I just feel good this morning amen I keep looking at that clock getting a little nervous but then I look at my notes and I get excited again I love you guys so much amen this is great amen you love the Lord amen you love the Lord I'm going to read one more quote and we'll be done this morning but I want to read this quote and it's kind of a long one amen it's an unconditional Covenant that God made with his with his people in 54 brother back there paragraph 174 but if you got the Holy Ghost you're God's child you're Abraham's seed you got an unconditional Covenant Written In Your Heart by God Almighty self who can't take it back oo I say thank you Jesus he can't take it back he can't take me back Sorry Lord amen Here I Am Lord I'm just giving you all can I give you a little suggestion don't hide from God you're bad at it do you know how bad you at hiding from God guess what nobody can amen you can't really hide from God you might be able to hide from me might be able to hide from Mommy and Daddy might be able to hide from the Pastor you ain't hiding from God so when you go to God don't hold your baggage in your back bring all your baggage with you cast all your care upon him for he carth for [Applause] you you know what I mean you you know what I mean I think you know what I mean amen spend too much time giving God your religion you're wasting your time bring your baggage you got problems you know I have person one time told me if you're having trouble with a brother in a church or a sister in a church you know what he told me to do I said it's kind of hard to love him and he said fake it till you make it can I give him my opinion about that I think that's some of the worst advice you could ever give anybody do you know why and and it's because God never faked it till he made it I'm not saying ain't going to be hard sometimes what I'm saying is though you got to be real with God cuz you ain't hiding from God anyways he knows you ain't actually liking that person so tell God about it tell God you know use be very specific in your prayers use names amen God knows you're using it in your head remember when when brother BR went in the cave what did God tell him he said your thoughts are louder than your words so you're not hiding it so be specific in your prayers tell them I'm having trouble with this you know what I mean I hope you understand what brother Stephen's saying it's going to help do you some good lay it all out with them bring your baggage bring your trials bring those things that aren't christian-like cuz they ain't he ain't surprised by it before you were doing that he still died for you did you know all your sins are in the future of Calvary everybody's sins in this room happened after what he did even before you knew Christ and after you knew Christ all those things are future sins that already happen he already knew you're going to do it he knew the end from the beginning didn't he and guess what he still died on the cross still called you a [Music] joy I say thank you Jesus amen so you see what I'm saying you didn't surprise God before you ain't surprising God now it'll do you some good get that weight off you that's why you're so hunkered down sometimes you can't barely get up in the spirit I'm not even talking about in here we're having a good time in church this morning can you say Amen but listen it's easy to have a good time in here I'm talking about when you're at work I'm talking about when you're deal dealing with the unbelievers I'm talking about real life that's when you're going to need this right here amen okay Lord have mercy I'm going to really try to get through this quote who can't take it back amen he sore that he would do it Hallelujah he sings Every promise in the every promise in the Bible is mine every chapter every verse every line I am trusting in his love divine every promise in the book is mine God's children unconditionally you don't deserve your healing tonight ain't that something to say I love how brother Bron breaks into this this is such this is real right here I oh man something about how he says it sometimes can you say Amen that man was a prophet of God Amen the way he say things sometimes my goodness he hits you right to your core don't forget to hear his voice can you say Amen Church make sure you get in those tapes sometimes you're going to need it amen God sent you a meage behold I send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day the Lord uh listen he didn't send me I had somebody asked me that one time say What's the difference between you saying it and brother bandam saying it I said' that's easy I'm not Malachi 4 what what are you talking about he said behold I send you Elijah the prophet that's William Brandon that's Malachai 4 he fulfilled I didn't fulfill that scripture amen I'm just quoting what he said that's my position in the right hand of him that sits upon the throne with Seven Stars it's not seven plus you listen it's okay to have a prophet listen he ain't Jesus don't worry about it we're not praising him you know he needed Jesus just as much as we needed Jesus he even said that look he's even going to say it right here now I think about it he does say something in this quote that's pretty good he said God's children unconditionally you don't deserve your healing tonight there's not a one of us in here deserves to even hear the gospel there's not a one of you deserves the grace of Jesus Christ my my my none of us we're all together well I guess that includes brother brandom amen but God by Grace has did it anyhow thank you Jesus even when we didn't deserve it he did it anyhow that's right there's none of us of you deserve your healing every one of you ought to die me too all of us we're not deserving to live on the earth that's right we're not deserve we're not deserving to look on God's creation ver paragraph 176 but God has promised us and he cannot lie he swore that he would do it healing belongs to us amen salvation belongs to us amen the Holy Ghost belongs to us Heaven belongs to us now we're the sons of God now we're sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus there's nothing that can harm us ain't that something you didn't deserve it but he did it anyhow oh my that makes me feel I think I said it a while back that makes me feel like a million bucks amen I hope you feel like that too that makes you know what I mean when do you feel that just now when we start getting into that atmosphere and we start reading that and we start believing that with our hearts what just happened to you you feel a little lighter feel the soldiers move a little bit you're like yeah I it is mine and when you start believeing that in your heart what's happening oh you're getting stronger feel limber you feel taller a little bit do you know this will have the same effect on you tomorrow if you get in that same atmosphere believing the same word guess what's going to happen when that Devil comes and tries to make you depressed you get back into that word guess what whoa I do feel good yeah I can do this heyen you know what you know what we're going to stop that quote I'm going give you one more testimony I'll be done this morning let me give you one more testimony um one time um this is when I when this is when I got voted out or I stopped pastoring there in cville and so forth and um I was looking for a job and so forth ended up getting a job and I started working but this

little bit a little insight into this okay he said Stephen you ain't stupid he said Stephen you're not dumb why don't you go in there put your head in the game and do it and I said I don't know Dad I don't know I don't know if I can do it or not he's like Stephen of course you can do it you got two hands and a brain right get in there and go get it done I got off the phone with my dad you know what I said I ain't dumb am [Laughter] I and I went back to work and I started working in those air meters my whole attitude changed all the anxiety and guess what I fix some air meters that [Laughter] day now I said that to tell you this if my Earthly father could change my attitude what about your heavenly father's words I'll end with this as I call the musicians up let me end with this what are those words you see you see why a lot of times we get depressed do you see why time sometimes we just get bummed out sad do you see why it happens sometimes it's not because of the situation it's not because of the situation you're in you hearing me church I hope you're hearing me it's not because of that why are you getting down and I'm saying sometimes I know there's remember the Bible even says there is a time to be sad so it's okay to be sad sometimes but a lot of times why we get depressed and listen there's a difference between sadness and depression oh you you go pray about that at home amen that's a whole sermon amen we're not going to say for another couple hours I won't do that to you but that's a pretty good thought amen you go take that home and pray there is a difference between sadness and depression why are you getting depressed all the time anxiety nervousness why does it happen it's not because of your situation right is that you have forgotten what he said Peter said said stir your minds by the way of remembrance remembering what what he said God commanded his love towards us in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us can you can you put yourself in the word this morning Christ died for me while I was yet a sinner Christ looked at me and called me a joy remember this church and I got a whole I got another sermon on this when he was in that Garden in consent me you remember Jesus didn't want to go to Calvary right that's right you remember this Jesus was a man just like you and me the only difference he was the fullness of the godhead bodily in him but did you know he had the same nerve endings as you I mean look look at your hands you say how your hands have five fingers on each hand did you know Jesus's hands had five fingers on him too you know he had five toes on each foot you know he had two legs he was just like you and when he started praying in that Garden the Bible says he started sweating blood and what did he pray for he prayed for the cup to pass from him yes sir he prayed for the opposite of God's will but held them there think about it all of God's Jesus's human emotions wanted to separate from Calvary but something kept him there what kept him there I'll let you know remember this said it before me I can tell you what kept him there it's in Hebrews 12 1 and 2 the Bible says for the joy set before his faceall he endured the cross despising the shame what held him there it wasn't his feelings it was you that held him there oh can I just say something that's why we can worship him this morning God commanded think about it what you held him there in all your sins in all your faults all your mistakes he still called you a joy that's how much you were worth Hallelujah we got to start believing in this kind of love can you say Amen this this is agape love this is going to this is love that's going to change your life it's going to change your attitude it's going to change your
