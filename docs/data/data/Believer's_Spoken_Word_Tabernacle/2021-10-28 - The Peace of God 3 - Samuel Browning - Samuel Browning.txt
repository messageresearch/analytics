of a request from our heart amen that we just desire that not only we thank god for the change that he's brought in our life but to also know the grace of god that accompanies to mold us to shape us to change us brother brahman said it like this he said god will take the sons and he conforms us to his image with nail scarred hands it's tremendous how god deals with our lives and works with us molds us and you know the the reality of it is as as sons and daughters of god we want to be more like him we want to be more like him once that that change has taken place in our life and that desire to want to be more like him is is is is is that of god moving with in our life and the only thing we have to do is yield more and more and you know that's it sounds very simple and it is but sometimes there's so many things that get in the way so many complexities but you know there's only one that can resolve that and that's him the one who's calling for it he's the one that can bring that about in our life to where we can rest because there's not one of us here that can make the word come to pass there's times that you all know we fellowshipped about things you wanted maybe something me too wanted something to go in a certain way or maybe we prayed about this or you know whether it was healing whatever it is and it and it wasn't anything that we could do i mean abraham prayed and asked god to let ishmael live before thee is that right and god just moved right on over top of that as though he didn't even hear it and he spoke directly to regarding isaac is that right the lord jesus prayed and said let this cup pass from me three times aren't you glad that god didn't answer that prayer i am without that where would we be tonight but you see what were those prayers all about god shows even in these things for you and i that god would even allow to show that in that to relate to you and i that there are times that even that what we ask for it deals with things about our humanity are you with me the lord jesus he he knew he knew what laid before him brother bannon put terms like this in souls in prison now he said jesus even prayed to dodge the cross those are exact words now his desire and he knew did he not know the purpose he was called to he knew the purpose he knew the purpose all along and he stated that all along but knowing the purpose did not make it easy at that moment to fulfill it but aren't you glad that god would sow condense into such a place that he could experience that that you and i could know what it's like that he could know what it's like when we could go to him and say father i'm struggling right here lord i need help i want to come into that place of committal that place of surrender you say brother samuel even as a believer as a believer as a believer amen to continue to just trust the lord i i'm so glad about that i am so thankful for that that we have that of our high priest who can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities amen so don't ever let the devil tell you anything other than that we have one who understands us amen when he raised on that easter morning he took back the human body now the human body as it sits there on the throne of god so what what is that god relates to you and i is able to move and relate to you and i through understanding what it was like to walk in humanity oh aren't you glad for that i said god i'm thankful for that let that same understanding work through my life amen let's just pray tonight let's go to him in a word of prayer you have a need upon your heart let's just let's just put it before him tonight father we want to say lord we love you and how we appreciate you lord we're gathered here dear god in the name of jesus christ you said of two or three lord would agree as touching any one thing it shall be done the lord we're believers our faith lord united together and if there would be one lord that would be a little weak we unite our faith together that lord that that pulsation of the faith of god might strengthen lord even that of weakness lord god for lord we know how much that means lord when we've been weak lord and we thank you for your mercy o god lord we're looking to you for you are still the god who made the promise and has fulfilled it time and time again in circumstances i am the lord that healeth all thy diseases by my stripes we are made whole oh god you lord bore our infirmities you bore our sicknesses lord you are lord the ever-present god you are oh god that same god tonight lord no matter the situation you're still the same god who sweetens the waters of moral lord may your eyes see you lord may recognize you and lord bring you to the situation we can't change it but god you are the present god that when placed in that situation you're the god who sweetens it you're the god who brings healing you're the god who brings deliverance lord so we just invite you to come lord i pray you just minister to every need god that's been uplifted right now through the prayer requests lord different needs over the internet lord need setting right here tonight oh god we're just inviting you and asking that you'll come lord as we lord with all that lord that we can can do within ourselves to lay aside oh god every part to lay aside lord any preconceived idea any thought just to lay lord that need upon the altar of god and just to look to you lord that lord jesus you're the god who comes and fulfills the word and if there's anything lord out of place in us lord that would need to be remedied lord that that need would be fulfilled you don't play hide and seek with us lord you're very very frank with us oh god because your desire is to come and to minister to our needs lord to speak to our lives and to fulfill your word so lord we just invite you tonight for you're the great physician o god and we just lord ask that you come lord in the power of your holy spirit o god and speak to our hearts and our lives lord we pray lord have your way o god may the spirit of god just moving o god father not only here in this building but lord across that internet lord in other homes lord where they're gathered oh god i pray that you'll just take control lord of every circumstance lord god for we place you above every every circumstance lord in the name of jesus christ amen amen and amen god is so good isn't he amen turn to hebrews chapter 7 with me and i'd like to continue with our thought here this evening of the lord will just help us for just a few moments on that of the peace of god and i want to go here in hebrews 7 and verse 1. for this melchizedek king of salem priest of the most high god who met abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him to whom also abraham gave a tenth part of all first being by interpretation king of righteousness and after that also king of salem which is king of peace without father without mother without descent having neither beginning of days nor end of life but made liken to the son of god abideth a priest continually now consider how great this man was unto whom even the patriarch abraham gave the tenth of the spoils and verily they that are of the sons of levi who receive the office of the priesthood have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law that is of their brethren though they come out of the loins of abraham but he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of abraham and blessed him that had the promises and without contradiction the less is blessed of the better and here men that die receive tithes but there he receiveth them of whom it is witnessed that he liveth and as i may so say levi also who received tithes paid tithes in abraham for he was yet in the loins of his father when melchizedek met him amen may god bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated you know brother branham would take and he would speak two messages with uh the the name of melchizedek in it and we you're familiar with that melchizedek great king and and and and great king and and um and prince and then he would come around in 65 there and speak the message who is this melchizedek and you re brother branham would start within it there's many there's there's many parts within both of those messages and i just feel drawn to that here within looking at the peace of god because when we are speaking of the peace of god and one thing that i realize and i believe we realize as believers is you can't take the word and separate god from his word for god is the word and it and the letter alone will do no good without the spirit but it's the spirit that gives life to the word it gives breath gives inspiration puts the word into action into motion and it it reveals god to be the same brother brandon picks this up with this of melchizedek and he speaks of how this is a much uh there's much dispute about this person of who this is and brother braham said there's many different schools of thoughts he said there's one school of thought that claims he's just a myth and he wasn't actually a person and the other would say he was a priesthood brother brahm said that part about a priesthood would seem the more likely he said but in in but in reality of where he says it's spoken he says he was a person not a priesthood because he was a man and his soul is a man so not he's not an order but he's a person so when we see this when we look back into the scripture if you think back to the scripture we just read without father without mother without descent having neither beginning of days nor end of life there's only one person that that description fits and that is god himself is that right so it's a very the very person is eternal and this is why it could only be one person and that is god and so we recognize that within this that this was the pre-figure of the lord jesus himself and we could pick that up in psalms and go through that and i want to take us back into a scripture to even how that isaiah was picked up in the spirit and not only did isaiah see the offering up of of the sacrifice wherein that god himself would come down and and god would would pay there would be the price that would be paid for you and i in redemption but yet isaiah was also lifted up to be able to see the condescension of god himself coming down to where god would take upon a human form and how that isaiah would record it in isaiah 9 6 that he would be called his name would be called not that his name is but his name would be called you know it's just like how you could refer to somebody and you know somebody might mention their name and you say well that's a lovely person but their name's not lovely you're only speaking an attribute of that person when their name is mentioned and then in other times you could say oh that person's critical you're only speaking an attribute that comes out when that name is mentioned and so here are the attributes that isaiah is caught up in by the spirit of god that would describe that of of of the lord jesus he's wonderful he's a counselor my goodness i mean to be a counselor you know when you look at a counselor isn't so much a talker a counselor is a listener is that right you know sometimes we we fail so many times we're ready to try to we want to solve problems but solving the problem sometimes isn't saying anything it's simply being a good listener hello he's a counselor he's account he knows how to bring counsel how to console our lives he's so his name is called wonderful counselor the mighty god the everlasting father and the prince of peace and of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end now to recognize how god when god came down and he's you know as he makes himself known to abraham here in this place as being a pre-figure of the lord jesus here here it is it has god himself is coming down and he meets abraham and i want you just to draw from this a moment he meets abraham before abraham gets back home and it's after the battle is over and all of those types come into there in that place remember it was on because he serves him bread and wine and it was there at pentecost i'm talking about back in acts 2 this is where the bread and wine came in as god himself here the lord jesus was seated on the right hand of god with power and authority and he sends back the holy ghost the same jesus now coming into the lives of the believers but remember how they were in the upper room they themselves had fought the battle and now after the battle they are receiving the bread and the wine that of the holy ghost that because the holy spirit remember and the word are not two separate things we're talking about god that word the living god become wrapped up in the lives of his children and here at the end time it was necessary that this revelation be made known because before the church gets back home before the church is raptured the church would return to the original power that was at pentecost that god would once again reveal himself in the fullness of his word bread and wine and he wasn't giving it just to anybody but he gives it to abraham remember abraham was offered there were many kings around at this time and abraham is tested he is tempted he is uh you know let me give you the goods for going down here and bringing back the captives but abraham rejected any of the spoil because he said my life has not been lived for material or earthly goods i have lived my life to loosen captives that prisoners might go free are you with me he he came in contact with that of ladies here where lady osea is right you've got to write for certain things we have rights for things listen the prophet had a right to be a trapper he had a right to do that but you see as a sheep of god we're not so much interested in what our rights are as far as well i can do this and i can do this let me just say it there's a lot of american rights and privileges here in this nation that contradict the very rights of almighty god you know a person can live in sin smoke and do everything else and that's an american privilege there's a freedom to it but that's not the freedom of god the freedom of god calls us from bondage because that's not real freedom real freedom is only in the person of jesus christ you see this is why that even people now as it's heading into a weekend right now you know how it is many times this is where people start getting their jump start on on a thursday of heading into a weekend and they'll have the reprieve of what they're looking for this weekend some even going and doing things that they really don't want to do and know it's tearing down their lives but they'll go ahead and do it but what a contrast of the believer we are not sitting here tonight against our own will we are here tonight worshiping god we are living for god in a true liberty it's not something that we have to make ourselves to do oh sure the flesh gets weak the flesh gets tired sometimes but there is a resource on the inside where we have been set at liberty in jesus christ and we desire to please him so you know brother branham talks about this of where her god how god had come down and he reveals himself to abraham and i want if you look at the setting hear the setting all the kings everything is taking place right there in that time remember the war was over the slime pits the oil fields all those things there was contention all around at that time all these kings are present ruling powers but right there in that moment it's as though there is a tent of meeting with abraham and melchizedek it shows that a believer can be so isolated in the presence of god to where lady osea and every other king is not able to affect or penetrate your life i'm talking about a privilege that you have as a believer that whether wherever you're at you're able to have a meeting with this melchizedek the living god and abraham notice abraham the scripture would record how abraham he reckoned abraham recognized who this was out of all the other kings there abraham never paid tithe because the tithe when you traced it on back it was that of an honor it's recognizing the presence of a great one that that they would do that in the lands but to notice abraham never he never divided up his tithe and said well i'll give some to sodom i'll give some to this one i'll give some to this one but he reserved the tithe and remember the tithe is that ten percent it might be a small part but remember god is taking a tithe out of the earth are you with me what is that tithe that tied in tithe is his beloved is that right when he descended in revelations 10 he had a little book open the book was opened but the little book meaning that of the lamb's book of life that this word would call forth to the sons of faith in this hour that they would recognize melchizedek almighty god appearing in his word in the fulfillment before we get home and to recognize our time of departure is nigh because we have met melchizedek the living god before we get back home so to think that within this uh this greatness of how that you know that the surrendering of our lives and you see remember as we read last week regarding the peace of god remember and in the book of um uh in the book of of hebrews it speaks that the god of peace that brought our lord jesus from from the grave you see it was the god of peace god peace and once you think of the word peace it's harmony harmony can you imagine up here tonight i mean you know let me just go over here and you might want to plug your ears just for a moment but can you imagine if here i am just up here and say let's let's sing amazing grace and you'd say i thought it's supposed to be how sweet the sound i mean it sounds like a mess right why there's no harmony but harmony is where things blend together you say brother samuel oh that takes the holy ghost i agree but the bible says before the holy ghost came verse one of chapter two they were all in one place and one accord before the holy ghost came how much more for holy ghost believers to lay hold on a promise that if our lives can be brought in such unity and it has to be in order to receive the promise of god the holy ghost it has to be in order to receive any other promise that we have need of we have to come in unity and harmony with god oh don't let the devil try to sell you short as though that oh my you need some super power and something to come down and do it for you all we need is the god that has already delivered us brought us this far to help us to turn ourselves loose to where he can go ahead and do what alone he can do if abraham could recognize in the middle of this you think abraham when he approached us with his servants this battle you think abraham was going about it casually not at all he he gathered his trained servants and armed them is that right but god was letting him know he was pleased because the battle the battle that he engaged in was not a battle of ill motives this battle was about remember he pursued the bible says unto the utmost of dan and the prophet takes it in the hebrew series he said he went to the lowest parts of hell he pursued down to the lowest part in order to deliver and bring back every captive or you know what it shows it doesn't matter how far a person is gone or how far they think they've gone you can't outrun the reach of almighty god surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life it'll pursue after pursue after me so here we find this piece of god in romans 5. this is where this piece of god residing within our hearts it's that same piece of god that brought our lord jesus from from the grave is the same god of peace same god of peace that brings forth sons and daughters of god from death to life is that right amen now notice when we look at this here romans 5 1 says therefore being justified by faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ justified by faith by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in hope of the glory of god ephesians 2 14 says he is our peace and this is a peace that the world cannot give the world talks about peace remember even in the days of of there of israel in the in in uh the heading into judgment where jeremiah is standing there remember hananiah and all the rest of there were many false prophets that at that time that were standing up and wanting to proclaim peace to the people now i want you to understand this they looked at jeremiah and the rest of them you guys are troublemakers but they weren't troublemakers what it was is they were going to battle against the enemy that was taking peace from the people of god sin doesn't bring peace sin brings confusion and bondage and everything else that accompanies it you attack everything every every every situation doubt and everything else that accompanies sin but what accompanies righteousness peace remember in the old testament a man was made righteous by doing righteously or doing what god said to do it really is no different today except by the new birth it's not us doing it's us yielding and it's god fulfilling his word so this this eternal peace this is what this this this piece of god is it's an eternal piece of the soul that brings a son or daughter of god back into full harmony with almighty god it doesn't mean that there aren't times in our spirit and in our flesh where we can experience fears we can have troubling times that can come up to try to trouble us that has nothing to do with the eternal peace of almighty god that is there residing in our life that's in our soul you say what brother say now how can i be out here paul wrote of it we will have fears within and without is that right but you see how paul paul could to speak of where uh you know here we are we're cast out but we're not forsaken see everything is balanced right out we're talking about the circumstances but i'm not alone god is present god is here a god that's over this circumstance let me tell you something god wants you to be his helper but he doesn't want your strength he wants you to be your his helper but he don't want your help he wants us to yield to him and now we become like the glasses on his face we become like the glove on his hand we become like the shoes on his feet we become his hands his legs his feet upon the earth because he is the vine and we are the branches you've been ordained as a channel of god sure circumstances come up sometimes things and listen things take us by surprise but remember within that time this is where the eternal peace of god where you come and you fall right back up on that because that is your grounds of victory it is the victory that will master every circumstance every situation is the peace of almighty god brother samuel i'm a sister you're still a priest in the army of almighty god brother samuel i don't know this much here it doesn't matter what you know is you know god and a life that can yield it can invite child to come on the scene god's not moved by how many quotes we know how many scriptures we know how much we can put it together god is moved when there's a heart that says if i can backtouch the hymn of his garment i know that i shall be made whole yes oh my because it's in him it's in him that our purpose becomes clear abraham recognizes when he meets melchizedek blessed be abram of the most high god abram began abraham receives a revelation that your your origination or origin is not in time it's of the most high god and abraham just so you know it you went down there and you went and there were kings that were whipped but remember your motive and your intent you have followed my voice you've followed my word you left the land of your nativity you've come out and you made a separation now notice oh man i'm gonna preach why it's coming as he had separation there and lot was gone from him he had power as a son of god don't you see where the enemy wants to try to bind our lives is to try to get us to mix up with the world and i'm not talking about going out here i'm talking about even in our attitude sometimes our thoughts about things sometimes oh god help us yes because we've got power as a believer when we're separated unto the word of almighty god abraham had power and lot had no power to withstand the present-day conditions is that right but it was in here melchizedek unfolds is unfolding the mystery of abram's life so this shows to you and i this shows that you know an effectual life is lived when we have confidence in what we're doing yes amen because we're living out the will of god when you know you're in the will of god you can have confidence you can have things that even that i mean let me just you know there's many different other testimonies and sometimes and you know you can we can fellowship on this that at times when you know you're in the will of god and everything isn't laid out i stood behind pulpits and here i am i i just have you know little things laid before me not a lack of study i'm talking about other places when i've gone out to minister god what would you have me to do or i have just a you know a little title a little something wrote right here lord you know you know the needs of the people you know you know what's taking place you see just to know that i'm in god's will just like you know you're in god's will you may not know what's going to come next but you know right now i'm standing in the will of god so whatever comes god's got it amen because i'm not alone i'm not alone you know so when we find this i want you to think about this in our lives the way has a scripture would declare this and it would speak there on how god becoming flesh the condems sending down as brother braham says in that stage where he met abraham where he was he's still condescending and later became jesus christ and so here is his condescending and notice notice now here as paul is writing of this same one the same god who became us this was a god think about how he met abraham he did not meet abraham as a judge he met him as the priest of the most high god because you and i didn't need a judge we were already guilty we needed a priest we needed somebody that could stand on our behalf and melchizedek was god was revealing himself there in the form of melchizedek is i am the one who's standing on your behalf as a matter of fact abraham i've been pulling for you from eternity oh there were many forces that tried to influence you and turn you around from leaving your land of nativity but there was a greater attraction and a greater pull abraham what was that pool that pool was the living god coming together with a believer so here's tans the lord jesus and i want you to remember here he is he rises as paul would write it after the similitude of melchizedek now it wasn't the earthly veil out here but god god created that veil that he could come down and step into just as much as you know it's a very it's not a very good example but just as much as this is my my jacket this jacket is nothing without me are you with me but a jacket when i put that jacket on the jacket the jacket itself that is samuel browning's jacket he is clothed in that jacket and this is how brother brown begins to talk about god unfolding himself down through these stages and revealing all the way through now when he become flesh and to think he's made the lord jesus here is a priest a high priest made after the similitude of marquette what kind of assemblitude are we talking about paul writes of it he was made not after the law of a carnal commandment but after the power of an endless life amen are you hearing me he wasn't made after a carnal commandment let me tell you you weren't made a christian by a church creed you weren't made a believer by recite this and do you believe brother rem's a prophet and do you believe this and recite this you were not made after a carnal commandment but because a carnal commandment has no power to create but only god himself can create and the same way that god became flesh in the person of jesus christ is the same way that god becomes flesh in you as a son and daughter of god oh my we were once a creature of time but now that the holy ghost has come we have been made in that same semitude after the power of an endless life what are we talking about the king of righteousness the king of peace so the new birth brings us back to the divine order of god to have that the power that inherent that word is the dunamis the inherent power that is possessed in our lives and i think we could fellowship on this i won't dwell on this but i think we could fellowship on this point is god help me to live and continue to live in a place to where that same power that picked me up and changed me that that same power can flow because all that i have need of you packed it within me and the holy ghost is there to bring it to pass he has made us the bible says in revelation 1 this the prince of the kings of the earth he hath washed us he hath loosed us he gave of his own life to wash us to lose us you see right there at calvary brother branham tells us all the way through the message clear up through 65 but even back down in here in the in the late 50s in questions and answers brother bram says when that death took place on calvary he said god reckoned you dead at the same time you right there you were dead the penalty had already been paid because you are always a part of god you are always a part of the world so the gospel is not telling you something that you aren't but the gospel is calm and the power of god has come to speak to your life and let you know you're free you can walk free the peace of god belongs to you everything that you have need of it belongs to you because he hath made us he did not a church not a carnal commandment he hath made us kings and priests unto the church no unto god oh my so he's the first of many brethren god condescended becoming one of us and the same holy ghost remember as it descended and coming down out of the heavens god screaming as he was coming down how this is my beloved son and whom i'm well pleased to dwell it was it took them the devil god to identify the sacrifice to john so the prophet was resting in the same holy spirit that had come to him and revealed the word that this is what you're to look for and he waited for that announcement and here came the dove of god and what is the dove of god it's the holy ghost and the dove itself is the symbol of peace the symbol of peace this is why the dove coming down upon the lamb humility will come to humility it'll dovetail together and i want you to see this it's the same thing within our lives but this is where satan works is to try to pull back and keep that coming together not just in the new birth but even after the new birth is come so this is where the notice this accompaniment that comes it's king of righteousness and king of peace and i want to say this to you those are not attributes that's who he is he is righteousness he is peace this is who he is now i'll say it like this then as as brother branham would say it how he was he revealed himself in that stage of creation when he came to abraham and revealed himself as melchizedek in the form of melchizedek as priest of the most high god and then later became jesus and now ascended up on high he's the high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities he is sitting there with the bloody garments on he is there the bible says hebrews 9 24 he is there to appear for us in the presence of god we need that high priest right now and i'm not talking about because of a sinful life you and i at one time were ignorant and out of the way and there are things you might have still been ignorant in but the high priest is one interceding on our behalf he's one that even in our mistakes in our failures there's one who intercedes on our behalf it doesn't matter if you have failed five times 50 times he still stands there just as faithful amen man can't make people faithful like this a church can't do that but god can and god does so deceive this of how that he become into that place remember there will come a time there will come a time where the sanctuary will become smoky there will come a time where as it speaks in the book of daniel that him that's filthy be filthy still right is that right when the rapture of the church is gone as it speaks in first thessalonians floor uh uh or hear the catching away of the bride of jesus christ i'm telling you there is no blood then upon this earth that's why brother graham said people will still be coming to altars and everything else thinking they're getting saved why because even right now now listen to me we believe in emotion but i'm what i'm trying to point to is you see things where people sometimes are worked up under emotion and then they can get them maybe to a commitment or maybe they're singing a certain song and my they get the feeling a little bit or or whatever and they come up but it's not a right conviction they're getting them a thought of a grandma of an aunt or or they're putting a thought of way out there and then just take taking it out there instead of pointing it out that the god who condescended he paid a price but that's not it he paid that price so he could clean your life up that he himself could come and take charge in your life with a real relationship they don't preach the relationship are you with me and melchizedek reveals relationship blessed be abram of the most high god and he brings substance oh my god as that will be culminated so at the change of the body when he steps and he changes from lamb to lion it's time for rapture when he changes his vesture our atoms will be changed because as his garment is changed so ours be changed it will match the change that's going on see he has everything arranged everything's already been prepared so but in the meantime praise the lord in the meantime as he as brother branham could put it there in in the church ages his present office is high priest he's still interceding until that last name is splashed beneath the bleach and brother brand puts it like this and souls in prison has been thoroughly redeemed with this turtle when the baptism of the holy ghost has come to quicken and make redemption a revelation then we go so in the meantime here we are let's go matthew 5 9 blessed are the peacemakers if he listen if you and i we are called blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of god we are identified as a peacemaker but it's not peace like the world gives it's the peace of almighty god remember melchizedek king of righteousness king of peace then if that same peace the god of peace has transformed our lives then our lives are peacemakers that's what we are to be called blessed are the peacemakers now a peacemaker is one who's peaceful in character and even in motive is that right now we can be very honest here we've not always fit that description oh i said brother brown brother samuel how i thank god for the blood and the new birth i'm talking about even after the new birth right sometimes our motives in the holy spirit would check us because of our motive it wasn't necessarily what something was said it's the motive behind it is that right blessed are the peacemakers now notice in second corinthians 13 11 finally brethren farewell be perfect be of good comfort be of one mind live in peace i mean believe this is possible right how many believe you're called to it amen i'm going to believe it whether i feel like it or not i'm going to make a stand on that word i'm called to this now there's no way that we can can look at this in ourselves and say be of one mind that that that is impossible when it comes to merely just us as humans it can sometimes it can go for for a period of time remember there was such a unity down there when they begin to build build the tower tower of babel right but look what that unity led to confusion it's a confusion that filled the whole earth but yet unity itself wielded great power but it matters what you're united around [Music] is that right notice the admonition live in peace and the god of love and peace shall be with you so look at this word peace that's used here this meaning you know you have many that are there let me just go to the second part of it it means not to make peace but to cultivate or keep peace harmony to be at peace live in peace so god has entrusted us as peacemakers right attributes sons and daughters of god that have been brought from death unto life by the very god of peace that our lives we would live in peace is that right this is our responsibility this is not god's this is our responsibility now watch look at this condition live in peace and the god of love and peace shall be with you so to live in peace then it invites the accompaniment of god who is the god of love and peace you see it's it's standing in that place living in peace to where you're going to cultivate that and you know what the cultivation as you'll see here in just a moment isn't out here like paul listen i want you to do this and do this don't disturb my peace i'm trying to cultivate peace no no cultivating begins here this cultivation's here here are you with me come on friends if we're sons and daughters of god and god god is calling us to a place to control the elements we got to control these elements first right here this is what the new birth brings us back into the divine order under melchizedek that we have we don't allow the enemy to sell us anything short of that notice as a peacemaker that is set forth by the indwelling of the peace of god there's there is a love for peace as a child of god amen there's a love for peace it's something we we strive for even when there's things sometimes it has to be maybe sad correction i can just speak for myself as a pastor as a minister i don't love those times a matter of fact many of those times i dread those times if god allows me to know it before a service and then after the service is over oh i i don't you know you you only see one part of it but that's the same thing with for for you as well we we are we are made people to be at peace now that doesn't mean going up to somebody and says i'm going to tell you off i really don't want to do it but i'm going to tell you off no no we're not talking about the same thing the intent what's the intent behind it see a peacemaker is one who has the right intentions are you hearing me remember the antichrist spirit daniel revealed the spirit of god takes the cover off of him and says he will come in by flattering you is that right flatteries what is that that's false peace so this this is genuine so this is our responsibility to cultivate peace in order to invite the god of love and peace how many want how many want to invite more of god i want the god of love and peace i want god i want to cultivate in such a way that god is able to come down i'm not talking about when a situation is going my way i'm not talking about all when a person is in agreement and i'm not talking about that but for myself i want the accompaniment of the god of love and peace you say why would you why would you desire that if you have the peace of god in your life because we are called to live in peace cultivated and sometimes in the midst of battle it can get weak but when they when my life can be lived in a place that will invite the god of love and of peace you see the one of the greatest tricks that the enemy puts on people is they go to look for other resources of peace [Applause] and listen there's nothing wrong with certain outlets but brother and sister let me tell you something gardening might be all right hunting might be all right fishing might be all right some of those things that you can do maybe little outlets maybe it's just going and shooting guns or or something like and that can be something that you you would like let me say this to you that will never ever take the place never take the place of cultivating peace in your life like prayer will turning on a message and listening to the voice of god oh brother samuel i come and hear you read quote shame on you you ought to be in the message you should be listening to we are going to give an account we've got it on our phones on our tablets over the center i don't understand everything like that remember put it on and say god open my understanding lord i want my life to be a vessel that's open to the enrichment because this is not the voice of a man these are not william branham's thoughts these are the thoughts of almighty god you would pay a minute to go to the top doctor sometimes when your doctor says something you say can i get a second opinion let me tell you something we need a second opinion instead of stop taking the devil's opinion or our own opinion or our neighbor's opinion we need to go to the god of the amen we need to go to god and say god what do you say amen amen cultivate by drawing from the fountain of his own life draw from the god of peace cultivate it you know cultivate right now that's where you actually prepare ground for crops it's where you prepare ground for seed you know even satan works to try to hinder that cultivation right let me just step back for a minute here god allowed it to be showed in the scripture a man by the name of elisha was all out of sorts he was a prophet ordained by god to hear from god be in contact with god but here he was brought into a situation are you hearing me he was brought into a situation that he could look at he could look at ahab look at look at them and say you know what if it wasn't for jehoshaphat standing here i won't even look at you you know why elijah said you ain't a believer right right not just said all you want you just want to take up time are you hearing me you see sometimes you see what it was now here's where elisha he has to take authority in that situation he's either going to let that dominate the situation because there's needs are you hearing me there were needs there was a jehoshaphat there there were needs that were there he cannot let that one individual affect everything so what he does in humility it says go get a minstrel right right what's he doing cultivating peace and sometimes you and i are in those places because we're still here in this humanity sometimes we get all twisted up and tore up and and everything else and you know you sometimes you might feel anxious or this or that and we say god i need a refreshing amen i need a minstrel all right i need to as brother baby said put on some good gospel music oh no lord i i'm going to put on a reading of the bible and that's all good you should i'm going to put on a message and you should there are times that i've done that as well but then there's other times that i can sense that maybe things are so tore up i have nothing to prove to the devil that's right true i am a son of god because god has declared it with his own spirit you are a son of god a daughter of god because god has declared it personally to your life there is not one situation that dictates who i am remember he brought jesus upon the mount if thou be the son of god what do you want get him to try to clown for himself we don't clown for the devil it's not us proving to the devil he'll have us chasing here chasing there chasing here chasing there chasing here chasing there no elisha invites it says bring a menstrual i like that brother richie because i can testify to that you know what he saw he recognized his weakness he said i need help he didn't remove him from being a prophet he just needed help in that situation this is where the cultivating of peace sometimes sometimes friends we're aware of it in our lives you're aware of a time but you know what there's a time to say something and there's a time to be quiet there's a time when we're not even in the right place right well just gonna it's absolutely the truth these are this is parts of mature sons and daughters of god mature sons and daughters of god isn't oh every single time i step out there and i speak to the mountain and it moves sometimes the mountains are out there the mountains in here this is where the real mountain is this is where the real mountain is [Music] let me let me try to wrap this up here this part second corinthians 13 11 let me read the same verse in the amplified bible finally brethren farewell rejoice be strengthened perfected completed made what you ought to be let me say lord i want to be perfected i want to be completed i want to be what you want me to be i want all of the virtues of jesus christ to flow through my life faith knowledge patience temperaments i want to grow old lord god as a stature and the living god right so i want to be what you what you've called me to be i want to be that be encouraged and consoled and comforted be of the same agreeable mind one with another live in peace and then the god of love who is the source of affection good will love and benevolence toward men i'm talking about the fountain i'm talking about the fountain that's open in the house of david i'm talking about the fountain live in peace remember brother bram said what causes the dove to take its flight is when we start getting a little bit like a wolf we're still getting huh i've got brother bram said even when we think we've got a right just our thought about it entertaining that thought just entertaining the thought can cause the holy spirit to be grieved but samuel a thought let it pass on through as soon as you catch it for what it is bringing in obedience bring in obedience remember your source of strength comes from the lord if you're not feeding on the word you're not in prayer like you should be you're weak and thoughts themselves listen we deal with thoughts but you see your source of strength is from god himself that even when you feel like i'm not getting anything but you know you're doing his will when you're in prayer remember prayer isn't just your prayer closet the bible said pray without ceasing praying at all times as paul would write and and and getting into the word getting into the message listen to the message the message should not be a foreign thing to you so brother samuel i want more of god get into the message and pray and ask god to reveal himself to you don't allow the enemy to try to block it out like it's it's some great algebraic theory it's not algebraic theory it's the sovereignty of god who comes and reveals his word that's what it is and isn't the mind of a pastor it isn't the mind of a prophet this is not the mind of a man god let you and i see it he didn't even complete seventh grade are you hearing me god let you and i see these things these are things that did not come from the mind of man it's from the mind of god what should i do i'd say let's take of this bread and wine i'd say let's take of this communion i'd say taking that communion in and cultivating peace in our lives is who this melchizedek is the god of love live in peace and then the god of love who is the source of affection good will love and benevolence toward men and the author and promoter of peace will be with you no wonder paul could write in ephesians 6 15 and your feet part of our armor brother richie part of the armor is shodding our feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace because remember we we are as was prophetically described in isaiah publishing peace and that peace is our god reigns but no matter what is taking place in the home our god reigns our god is supreme our god reigns no matter what takes place our god reigns because our feet are shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace let me close on this verse mark chapter 9 verse 50. salt is good but if the salt have lost his saltiness wherewith will you season it have salt in yourselves and have peace one with another so salt we know what salt is but yet how we think of it salt many times we think of table salt we think of all kinds of salt and we look at this of where that this scripture would write and has in the other parts of the gospel how could salt lose its savor salt in its purest form salt not like what we've got as table not necessarily table salt and these other things but salt in its purest form i think it's sodium chloride as that comes together it will never corrupt on its own are you hearing me salt will never corrupt on its own but there's two things that can impact salt and that's conditions where things themselves can come about and dilute it and water it down or they can shoot an electrical charge into it that tries to bring about a chemical change to try to fragment that electron i i'm not interested in trying to understand all that but i took those two things and looking at it that's conditions conditions that would try to come about or additives when things is added to salt and it's called salt but if it's got an additive in it it has an expiration date because the additive not because of the salt the additive is what makes it non-effectual what is it what is the salt the salt of god is the holy ghost we're to have salt in our lives and be at peace among ourselves see this is where as brother branham would take care of how you know he said you find things he said were testimonies and lives and how our lives as believers let me just read you a few of these statements here or at least refer to them of how that our lives and his and in our very own lives there's got to be a contact no they'll take salt and they'll put it on meat and it'll preserve that meat now obviously you know you've seen it it's not just a sprinkling of salt you got to cover that thing with salt is that right but it's got to be a salt that isn't diluted or there's not been a chemical change a salt that has withstood the conditions that has withstood things from around it because when it makes contact it's the salt that will save or savor and that's why brother branham would take this scripture and run it through the message over and over and express of how that our lives are our character should be so salty anybody anything salty i know some of you thinking you have something sweet and they need something salty you're like i need something sweet did you some street well i need something salty vicious cycle speaking from experience but what happens when something's salty uh you've been to restaurants i've been to restaurants anymore you get thirsty i've had certain things from when i was a teenager 13 14 years old i'd get woke up in the middle of the night with thirst and i began to realize there's certain places that i i didn't want to eat and if i did eat there i made sure i started drinking a lot of water and ate it earlier in the day so i could try to get all that quenched down i won't call off the names of those places sometimes you get packets of that dark colored sauce and put it over the nice rice and you're gonna pay for it high and sodium right what happens it comes to a certain time you find yourself you think goodness man i don't know why i'm so thirsty tonight boy i'm so thirsty you put it down i mean you're walking around thirsty because the salt in that food has created the thirst that's the same way with the salt of god in our lives it'll cultivate peace it'll create thirst in the lives of others brother brown would say it like this concerning the people may the holy spirit that has given new birth to every one of these children of god by faith may they be so salty tonight in their faith that the unbeliever setting here would say oh amen that's the way that's the end that's the way i believe christianity so their life becomes the way revealed right you hear me be so salty to where prameda could look at the life and say that's that's how it is that that's the life that's it right there it's a salty life the graham said god wants his church so salty that the whole world were thirst to be like him he said he well you know as he goes on he says that's the way you make the world or draw from a draw he said the way they get thirsty is be salty is to act like that your testimony brother bram says oh there goes a woman oh she's not fussy at all and she's she's a man she's so sweet and this and that same thing about a man see the testimony the test understand the testimony is what prevails over everything are you hearing me because every one of us tonight if we look at that tonight thing fussy brother samuel there's some times i've been fussy as a matter of fact i was kind of fussy in the tent before i came tonight god came to abraham and sarah's tent and they just had had a fuss that morning what did brother ram tell us is anything too hard for the lord he said well it was was satan was trying to block the oncoming visitation but the testimony is who you are now see if the testimony's here and fussy is up here then fussy is the testimony are you with me so you see this is where be salty and make the world thirst for you brother bram says may we live such lives till our spirits this is powerful we'll contact others not necessarily our flesh but our spirits why because who is seated enthroned in our spirit the lord jesus the the god of peace till our spirits will contact others and make them crave to be the people and live the life that the holy spirit lives through us oh my i i don't know about you but i look at this and i say god let my life let me live continually realizing the responsibility that i have i believe we realize it but i think sometimes we we can get so caught up and we can look at things but to realize the responsibility we have to live in peace and living in peace it invites god it invites god the god of love the god of peace to come on the scene so that salt we we want our lives to be salty our lives too but i don't want i don't want to be affected by the conditions listen there's a lot of things where people have become you you get to looking at the wrong things entertaining the wrong things listen sometimes you get around the wrong people right and you think oh i'm a believer they're not going to permeate my shield i'm sealed by the day of redemption oh really nobody's we're not we're not talking about the seal on your soul but we're talking about even that of your spirit you hang on you hang around critical people you become critical is that right see knows what he's doing what's the whole objective to try to hinder the working of god oh my let's pray father how we lord we stand in need of you once again this evening lord jesus this is the very prayer within our lives having salt in ourselves and being at peace among ourselves lord i believe lord as paul when he would write that where we've been preaching from that charity does not behave itself unseemly lord we realize that every behavior every action things that come out it starts inwardly sometimes lord thoughts being entertained things lord being built up over time and not really taking it to you to really lord consider you i think of how that paul would write this consider him i wonder lord we could tell everybody else our problems we could go to this one and complain we could go to this one and complain we could talk about this or that or maybe lord it's a situation lord that the healing lord in the body maybe lord it's for a life right here tonight that's in need of a full deliverance [Music] but lord regardless of what the need is may we take that counsel consider him may we consider you lord god who's in our midst consider you lord god and that our lives would be cultivated cultivated [Music] lord jesus no wonder satan battles wanting to try to take lord and put all sorts of things lord in front of prayer having time lord with you and getting our lives so cluttered up lord sometimes it's not cluttered up necessarily with things that's sinful or evil but lord it's just things that it gets in the way and satan's desires to try to take from us that contact with that inner man where we're living with the peace of god flowing through our lives lord every one of us here is children of god [Music] there's times lord god where a thought could come into our imagination and paul tells us you got to cast that imagination down but lord no matter what it is oh how we know lord god what strength comes lord god from you where the peace of god just flows lord into that gate of imagination from out of the soul and would just permeate into that court that's out there lord god it would affect lord take over the reasoning take over lord god that gate of affection that's out there in the spirit to where that that love part well it might want to pull back this one did me wrong or this one said this or this but the peace of god the love of god we could just say lord flow through me lord flow through me the peace of god would flow to those gates or god help us lord tonight forgive us lord for living beneath our privileges forgive us lord in the times that we've looked and here we are we're looking and saying god i need peace god i need peace and yet lord god you've provided right for us lord god where our lives can be cultivated in peace there's a source there's a fountain and that fountain is you lord god lord you said you never leave us nor forsake us but you be with us even in us to the end of the world may we draw from the god of peace the same god who changed our life raised us up and made new creatures out of us lord may we draw from that same source for our homes for our everyday life lord god if i had a choice that you would give me a choice and say samuel would you want to be known as a peacemaker or would you rather to be known as a preacher [Music] or as one who lays hands on the sick and i've come down and i've responded to their faith and they've been made whole or one who would speak in other tongues and prophesy and many other different things would you want all of that or one of those or would you rather be known as a peacemaker lord i don't need to pray about that i want to be known i want my life to be known as a peacemaker [Music] lord jesus knowing that many times in our lives sometimes the lord to make peace sometimes we have to act dumb lord to hold things together sometimes sometimes the lord it requires taking blame it requires in order to hold things together in unity that's just not myself lord as a pastor that's as a husband that's as a father that's as a brother all within the economy of god [Music] but help us lord help us lord to realize [Music] because in order to make peace this peace that we've received you became me [Music] that i might become you by grace the bible says you opened not your mouth neither was there any guile found therein help us lord i do not believe lord god that this is attainable within my own humanity nor in the humanity of any of the other of these people but i do believe lord god that it is [Music] attainable in the dna of a son and daughter of god i do believe that that strain lays within this tree of life that i've been brought into lord but you'll never overpower me you'll never say samuel get out of my way i'm gonna go make peace no but lord god you've called and you would deal with my heart deal with the heart of others lord god [Music] peace makers peacemakers blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called or regarded as the children of god help us lord things come up lord god divisions come up things the lord can come up people on the job want to run down the boss help us lord help us not to join in with that lord may we recognize may we cultivate peace in our life to where we'll not join into that nonsense help us lord to realize that's only a trap of the enemy to hinder the peace of god from moving in our life because it might be one of those people it might be somebody that that i would meet in the next moment that they need a visitation of the peace of god in their life i want to be a channel i want to be an instrument i don't want you to have to look down and say my goodness who can who can i find well i've got a group of believers down there but right now i don't know i just lord i we don't want that we want to be channels that's available to you help us lord help us may we take of that bread and wine and continue lord to eat and eat and eat and eat as your prophet would tell us lord he said you must feed your experience the holy ghost he said does not feed on emotion it feeds on the word of god and if you don't feed it it'll die the lord that can that can pertain to no matter where a person is at in their walk with you but if that person has ever been sealed by the spirit of god they don't lose the holy ghost because the holy ghost cannot die but lord it's where our lives are not as effectual as you intended them to be how many would say tonight with me lord i want to be effectual i want my life to be an effectual effectual instrument effectual witness amen that's my desire i got both of my hands up lord that's my desire that's my desire lord help me help me to recognize the devil at every one of his tricks help me how can i do that by feasting on the word of god so that my senses might be exercised to discern good from evil feasting on it doesn't mean that i've got to sit there in front of it and my hands are folded and i'm setting up right in the chair no you can put it on in your car put it on as you're laying there in your bed put it on as you're ironing clothes put it on as you're going about your daily duties just say lord god my life lord is an open sponge speak to me lord god let me draw from the god of peace let me draw from that bread and wine in my life granted lord tonight i pray in the name of jesus christ hallelujah what song are you playing i want to live the way the way he wants me to be i want to give until there's just no more to give [Applause] no love for i could never ever oh until there's just just no more to give there's just no more love for i could never ever the way that he wants me to live that i want to give until there's just no more [Music] i never [Music] [Music] hallelujah thank you jesus thank you lord god thank you for your mercy lord jesus you know i just think of how brother branham when he preached that message in images of christ brother branham said it like this he said as this church is having a revival you know it was a special time they were getting ready to head into special meetings special services and brother ramsey referring to that oncoming time there at the tabernacle and he said while this church is having a revival i want a personal revival and he said what it is he said i want more of the holy ghost to take over more of william branham he said i don't care what plane i've got to come on to have it i want more of the holy ghost and he makes his statement he said i want more of the holy ghost to make me more of a servant like he was because the holy ghost is power for service this is our desire sometimes the service that we're called to do there's a lot of things that if god said can anybody go with anybody go out here tonight and on the end of the the the boat ramp there's going to be people out there and i need you to walk on the water i'm sure tonight we say lord you know i i'd be mourning i'd do that lord no problem but then what if one of the lord said you know what i need someone that's able to express love i'm gonna have somebody say something against you i'm gonna have this or my dad but i need someone who who would like to have and and let that be a testimony and let the holy ghost operate that service through you well lord i i i walk on water no no no see we all would want that but those are those those times those are the times that i don't want to say are few and far and in between but you see the power for service if that's all that our life was as believers walking on waters miracles after a miracle as i heard one person say if it was every time we prayed it was a miracle it'd no longer be called miracles but that's the holy ghost is power for service it shows itself when it comes time when there's disagreement when there's disunity this is where it shows when when peter writes of those seven virtues the statue of a perfect man he's not writing about oh you get all these things and you set back they're in you they're all ready it's like inside of this bible is packed every promise inside of every seed of god is already packed every one of those virtues and the same god who packed it in you is the same holy ghost that opens and unpacks it as it's needed when you need virtue when you need patience when you need temperance [Music] that's what the holy ghost does and what does it do being that of a pyramid it reflects that city that we are of it reflects that city oh my this that's my desire that's my desire that's your desire tonight amen hallelujah amen let's sing this as we're being dismissed remind you of the fellowship dinner on sunday hear the lord willing right after the service the details are out there may god bless each and every one of you amen if you want to stay in worship you're more than welcome to let's just take the word of god with how many more determined say god i'm determined i see what is available what is right here before me the bread and wine let me cultivate my life with the eternal things of god it'll have an effect amen god bless you you're dismissed in the name of the lord jesus who has broken down every one [Music] is our peace [Music] who has broken down every one [Music] our peace on him you [Music] he is our peace peace [Music] who has broken down everyone he is our peace [Music] he is our peace he is our peace [Music] for you is our peaceful of your cares on
