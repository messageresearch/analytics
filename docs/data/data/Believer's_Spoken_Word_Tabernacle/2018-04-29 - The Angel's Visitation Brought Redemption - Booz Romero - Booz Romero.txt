honor to be here with you I was leaving the hotel this morning and it was kind of sad there was this guy he was on inside of his car he was fighting you know like with somebody on the phone I was like well that's crazy you know it's like fighting and cussing and all that and I was like well I am so grateful that my morning didn't start that way I am grateful that my morning is start thinking about the Lord thinking about his grace thinking about kids goodness amen how many can say that this morning Lord I am grateful this morning for your grace for your goodness for my life amen because if it wouldn't have been for before grace it means before the grace of God you don't you imagine think about yourself where where would you have been this morning amen so we're so happy to be here and receive greetings from your pastor by the way he texts me this morning and he was like great the people for me so I am bringing music readings from here pastoring in men and also I well many of you know my dad so he also sends his greetings he told me I told him that I was gonna be speaking here and he was a well create the people for me and so I'm also bringing the ingredients from my dead brother Marcel amen and so now we're here in the house of the Lord so let's bow our heads Heavenly Father we just want to give you think this morning father because you're good and greatly to be praised father we're so grateful father that we are not in a in jail this morning or we are not defeated this morning father if we're here this morning is because you live father and you say because I live you shall live out so father we are so grateful father for this resurrection morning father these this time of that we can have a fellowship of fellowship with you father you know just around the word father but in the world with you this morning father bless your children as they have common they have put in their hearts to come and worship your father in to hear from you father it is what I want is more that you speak to to me and you speak to them this morning father because if it is a man just standing here this morning it is not a prophet not anything father but if it is you this morning father speaking to your children this morning that is what we want this morning father in your precious name father we present ourselves father if there is something that you have to forgive us this morning father we want to ask you to forgive us father if there is something that we have to confess this morning father we want to confess it we want to put it under your precious blood father and as you taught a woman that was found in an insane father day all the accusers were there and they wear with their stones father but then you ask them like whoever is not seeing whoever is sinless this morning you can you can cause you're a caster stone and no and they all left father and what happened when you use turn and use knew you were there just with that woman you asked her whether they died accusers and she's and his and she said they have they have left Lord and you told her Lord neither do i condemn you but go and sin no more so that is that is what we can say this morning father that you can forgive but but also you are telling us this morning go and sin no more bless your children father bless up brother Samuel as he's preaching in Virginia father may you be with him and sister Keehan father and may you be with your children here father may you speak your hearts whatever it is coming from your heart father to our hearts father it is gonna be to the edification or to edify our souls or bodies our spirits in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we ask you all these things amen and the church can say Amen so if you have your Bibles we can go to the Book of Joshua chapter 5 verse 13 to verse 15 and we're gonna go out so to the book of Hebrews chapter 11 verse 30 and 31st and also to the book of James the second chapter verse 25 and 26 and it says and it came to pass when your show was by Jericho that he lift up his eyes and looked and behold there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand and Yasha went unto him and said unto Him art thou for us or for our adversaries and he said nay but as captain of the hosts of the Lord I am now calm and Joseph fell his face to the earth and did worship and said unto Him what saith my lower unto his servant and the captain of the Lord of the Lord's host said unto Joshua lose thy shoe from all times food for the place whereon thou standing is holy and Yahshua deeds so you may have your seats now we go to the book of a Hebrews chapter 11 verse 30 and 31st it says by by faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they were compassed about seven days by faith the harlot Rahab perish not with them that unbelief that believe not when she have received the despised with with peace amen now got the book of James chapter ii chapter amen and it rates ladies it says live was also was not Rahab the harlot justified how it works when she can't received the messengers in had send them out out another way for as the body without the Spirit is dead so faith without works is that also amen may God the blessing to the reading of his word and so we're happy to be here in the house of the Lord and certainly happy to be here it's been I think it was almost a year at the last time that I was here speaking for you but these this time like we're gonna see what dollar has for us this morning in men and as I was saying before I prayed it is always a privilege to be here and that is a Christians privilege to be here and and to speak to his children amen so I was thinking you know by God's grace I would like to title this Rahab the Angels visitation brought Redemption gray have the angels visitation brought it brought or either started Redemption or he brought the redemption in men so but before I go there I would like to I was thinking about something and brother Branham II speaks and you you know the ones that read the message he speaks about a specific like me and his name was Oscar and he was he was part of he was an Indian amen so one time brother branham went and he went to the you know the Indian Reservation and then Oscars mom was sick amen so she was sick so they they asked the as brother branham could you come and pray for her mother and brother branham when the airing he pray for for for for the monday the mother of oscar and she was healed amen and but there was some there was one more thing it wasn't just oscar there was his sister she was Lewis yeah her sister was Lewis Louis Amen so and she was there as well in and when brother Branham was praying you know she kept the praying the prayer in what once that that was happening you know the next day brother Branham came and told her well you know she was she was also praying the Lord sprayer in brother Branham told her well you I just want to make sure that you understand that that we have to pray we you don't have to we we don't just have to say the prayer the Lord's Prayer in key talking because he told her because we're not Catholic and then she was like yeah and then this is this was hit her answer she said we know more Catholics she said we believe like you believe and we want you to take us all you and we want you to take all of us all of us in baptize us the way you baptize we want the Holy Ghost that was the first thing and then her brother Oscar he lost some of his horses and then he he came to brother Adam and said can you pray so that then I can find my horses and Imbler Elam was was like you know what where they are they are in a place where there's a lot of us know even in the middle of the summer so you may not be able to find them but he said if he God was able to heal my mom he can also find my horses so now I want to connect this and then brother Branham says these how you know internet talking about the horses he says how they leave nobody knows but at this time of year brother Lewis is speaking now there is some what he's talking about the snow and everything but he found his horses because the prophet of God saw a vision and that he was going to be able to find his horses so he found his horses saying he says but now it won't trade off with a denomination I mean it is only trade with the word or it is only in agreement with the word but there is some people in the world believes that that that word you will take a not to grab the ride out of here Amen it is true it is true for the bride and the broth in the bride and the bridegroom they are one and the God is one in the world in the word is God Amen you have to be traded with the word and it will draw the bride out of these denominations but I want to go I want to go a little bit further here so brother Billy Paul was giving a testimony back in I think was in 1999 and he said he's he's speaking in Tucson Arizona and he says speaking about this Indian boy and his sister and then brother Perry was also there he says and and they brought the horses to wench they found the horses she brought one of the horses to brother branham and she said brother Billy I want to let you know of the great husband a a sore ass her she told she's cheap told in the in the letter to brother Billy she said I want to let you know of the great husband God gave me she said do you remember when you brother branham brother Perry came to our camp and she said when you came by we stuff but you you stopped by us and pray for my mom that was dying and she was and she was healed and we're brother Branham it was leaving my art tent I told him brother Branham I'm going to college and then brother Branham asked her why are you going to college and she says brother Branham way I want to get husband and brother running talk her you don't have to go to college to get a good husband he told her stay with your mom and your dad and they are all help them and God will give you a good husband sister she said brother Branham I don't think God can't do that and brother I never asked her why and she said because of my past how many can say I have a past and brother Branham talked her do what I have told you and God will give you a good husband she told me brother Billy now sister sister this sister is sending a letter to brother Billy or two rather Billy Paul in and she is telling him now I have a good husband amen but I want you to focus on something else that is coming up here brother Perry was there when brother Branham had the conversation with with the sister which is your Lois and after she left in her horse he asked brother Branham what about the past life of Lois what does that mean brother Branham said whatever he under the blood of Jesus he doesn't even show it to his prophet you will get it this morning if you have a past this morning that is kind of accusing you this morning I did this I did that but if introduced under the blood of Jesus Christ it is not going to be shown to the Prophet it is not going to be shown to be discerned because it's already under the blood how many are happy to know that this morning amen you guys get the point you brothers and sisters did you get at the point if you have come and you and you have confessed and you have ave the word if you have put it under the blood then nothing can be against you this morning brother Branham says he gets sweeter each day it is something that happens and when Christ comes into your private life he changes all your life amen do you welcome him in your life this morning amen this is in the message Jesus at the door is what I just read this and the other one was a testimony from January 22nd 1999 so but now I want to focus on on these but at the end I want to bring this testimony again when I finish this these little talk to you this morning but if we look and now going back to your shrah you will look in chapter 5 of the book of Joshua once they went on the other side of Jordan they got to Jill go in that that is a circle of stones it is what that means and and there were some ordinances by the Lord that they have to do there one of them was to circumcise the ones that were born in the wilderness do you remember that when when they were in Egypt after they left even Egypt then God asked them to circumcise the first time and then the generation that left they also they all have do perish in the wilderness because they were not agreeing with the Word of God amen and the circumcision is to cut the surplus is to cut whatever is kind of remaining in men now in the spiritual is to cut whatever is a surplus in our lives and that is not pleasing before the Lord and his presence and this morning I want to ask you as yourself morning is there still something in your life that the Lord have to come and he have to cut it this morning nothing they were there in the wilderness but there was a new generation that was born in the wilderness amen in that generation needed to be circumcised amen brother Branham says and if he has never circumcised you yet by the Holy Ghost he hasn't received your faith yet that's right he said that's right that is the circumcision of the heart and spirit it is not just something natural but it has to be in the heart and in the spirit of the person the Lord has to come and say you know what these desire I have to cut it but you have to be willing to do it you have to be willing to do it at this sister she said she obeyed the word of the Prophet and that brought her a good reward and in that is the prophecy that also came to the Prophet because it has been your your choice a greater victory a victory in love divine is waiting for you on the other side but but it takes a decision from the heart of the deliverer to say Lord I want to serve you this morning Lord I want to love you this morning Lord I want to forget all the things that live it that are behind me and I want to go and press towards the mark in Jesus Christ that that should be your desire this morning if not let me tell you one thing then you're wasting your time this morning brother Branham was speaking if he was talking he was like when they were in the meeting Billy Graham's meeting great meetings and he was they were just coming and yet we're giving their heart to the Lord but that was it he said like twenty thousand were given their hearts to the Lord but if you will come the next year there was just twenty people as to serving the Lord why because it was something on the surface but I don't want anything on the surface I want something deep in my heart I wanna change in my heart this morning I wonder Lord to come and say and reveal me what is not right before his presence how many can say amen to that he said now if you stop believing and is crumbling around and just believe God he said God will circumcise the heart yaws belief team she says only believe all things are possible and that costs all cuts all the unbelief ether come sizes the world in all unbelief away from you and then you stand the word alone brother pour me pastor but he was preaching in in church he was saying now he it was the first coming on the Lord that was Jesus Christ but then an angel came and then there was a second coming of the Lord and he was asking then who is a coming of the Lord now that is the bride that is the second coming of the law why am I saying this because now it is the world being very flesh in the first of the believer Christ in you the hope of glory amen how many can say amen to that it says if you abide in me and my words abide in you then ask what you will and he will be given to you what is your desire this morning her history hurry right what's your desire this morning and she said the salvation of my two children in he said I give them to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and they came but he you and you need something this is something simple just believe in him but the prophet of God says so we need a circumcision to cook the whole thing away to cookie called the world away from my life my desires my mind my thoughts everything or coming circumcised this morning my desires not wanting to come to church Lord common circumcised that desires not wanting to worship or no one not wanting to lift off my hands Lord coming that is warning me when I leave this place father maybe may I live refresh in my heart saying wasn't my heart burning when the world when the breath was being broken before me but I can say no I am NOT what I want to be but I am NOT what I must be but one thing I know that I am NOT what I used to be that should be your testimony this morning Lord I know I have a past but guess what God is looking at your past that is looking at the present that you have with him in an eternal life is waiting for you there you know that that is eternity is already here now where is that eternity now it is in my heart it is in your heart I was preaching in Mexico and I was telling the people you know why that enemy is so bad with you every single morning do you know why not right now because when you were in heaven he was doing all that that is pleading up in heaven and what is he and what did you do there you didn't follow him to rebuke him and you say you cast him out you were fighting there with Michael with that great mighty my angel Michael and you cast him out of heaven that's what he knows now that you that you are not part of him he's trying to he's making all his best efforts to try to destroy you this morning and one more thing you know why as well because your name is written in the in the Lamb's Book of Life and because when those names were written were being written what was happening he was looking at that so he knew what was in the book but he couldn't take the book he couldn't take the book and where is the book right now this morning it is in my heart it is in my hands now little junk come and eat from that book he will be bitter in your in your it will be sweet in your mouth but he will be bitter in your belly but common prophesy again one more time so he knew that he knows that your name is written in the Lamb's Book of Life that's what he's making he's trying all what he came to come and destroy but guess what you're yours kokanee in the palms of his hands and he cannot touch you this morning I mean you're grateful this morning the enemy can touch him that's why Paul says Christ it means to lead into thy is to gain if I say praise the Lord if I leave praise the Lord how many can say praise the Lord to that I hope when you leave here you live with a different song without different mindset and say Lord thank you for your words thank you because maybe this morning I was a little bit defeated father but who were have coming how it gives me giving me courage to go forward to cut to this coming week you're just a with the word God made a promise God keeps his promise he can't do anything else but he keeps his promise but he can't do anything else but Keith but keep his promise and remain God amen so as the Lord this money Lord is there something that has to be car coming caught it this morning amen now in the book of Joshua chapter 10 verse 12 it says and the Israelites in camping juggle and they kept the pass and they kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month at evening in the place of Jericho and on that same day they ate the produce of the land on living cakes and in parts grain and the manna ceased on the day after they ate of the produce of the land and the Israelites have manner no more but they ate of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year so now now look at this after the circumcision and after their bodies were healed they had the company have communion they had the Passover oh what a great thing to know when his Holy Spirit has circumcised our hearts now we can have communion with him now we can come boldly into the throne of grace that we can obtain mercy and find in find grace to help in the time of need that is communion communion comes in when you have community here in church it brings a strength to your body his brain says strength to your soul it brings a strength to your spirit so it was a Passover it was a it was a first for sorry first it was a communion sorry first was a circumcision then was a Passover and then there was something else in Joshua 5:13 it says now when Joshua was near Jericho he looked he looked up and saw a man standing in front of him with a drawn sword can your showing up to him and asked him are you for our offer or for our enemies neither he reply but as a commander of the army of the Lord I have now come then yoshua fell face down to the ground in in rivers reverence and asked him what message does my lord have for his servant the commander of the Lord's army reply take off your sandals for the place where you're standing is holy and Joshua did so now if you if you read chapter five it is without without us knowing what the angel told Joshua he just saw him take off your shoes that's it that's a message take take off your shoes the only thing that's the only thing we know and that was the same instruction that was given to Moses in the when he was before the burning bush he says loose loose off dive lose thy shoe from off my from or die foot because you are standing on holy ground in other words we can say this that was a type of humility that was assigned to put away their ego or the eye of from Moses amen and after Moses he took take a to cook it took off his shoes God revealed himself to Moses and give him a message of restoration what was the message to bring for the children of Israel are out of the out of the line of Israel or each of each Amen there was a message from from for for Moses but if you think it is start with with the burning bush something unbelievable now a burning bush is talking to here but there was a season for that time because everything has to come in the season of the word and now if you see to your show was the same thing take off your shoes but nothing else was said to Joshua so could we say that the things that were said to Moses were not written amen a type of the seven field Moses came and is already out of the scene amen now the loire have come to reveal himself to his people in a personal way that is the Seventh Seal the Lord himself shall descend a man Jesus have come and have left amen but he has sent the comforter that have come to reveal him in secret to whom to the bride as John 14:15 says all things that the father huh our mind therefore said I that he shall take of mine and he shall show them to you that was the same way that it was with you're sure nobody know what was said that is the Seventh Seal speaking directly to the heart of the believer and the heart of the bride given unto her by the Prince of the host of the army of the Lord our Lord Jesus Christ now if you see here brother Brennan says the man is Tuvan and he drew his sword he was just a man he looked like a man in your shop her heart being achieved a warrior he draw he drew his sword - you know because when you're a warrior will always be ready with your sword he walked to meet him and he told him are you with us or are you with our enemies and the man he lifts up his soaring he says no I am the captain of the host of the law of the God of Israel in other words who was this angel the captain of the host who was his captain of the host the product a prophet of God says he said wrote the Joshua reached down and he take off took off his shoes he fell on his face before him and said what will the Lord have with me so now this was the same the very lord jesus christ why because when you go to the Book of Revelations and you see John he was there he Bob about himself before the angel and he say no don't worship Me and it was an angel he meant but the angel that was here yo she was worshiping because that was the Lord Jesus Christ Oh brother Branham says it was the captain in other words the leader of the hosts of Israel and that leader was none other than Christ himself and what was keep your singing he was first seen as a pillar of fire he was there in the cloud but I don't want a pillar of fire I don't want a cloud I want to say the very large Jesus Christ this morning before my press my face because those were shadows those were types though those were for the people back there but what is it now for me this morning but the prophet of God says now the pillar of fire have become a man I hope you know what I am talking about he had me call my man who is he he is the Lord Jesus Christ it is not brother Branham as people have confused him and they have said that he his his Jesus Christ no it is the God the God himself he came in a he brought a message to a man but it was God using the mean that in that is the same now the prophet has is already out of the scene now there is a faithful ministry that is taking this right to the other side amen that is the bride now is the bride's ministry now it is no longer the face to be waiting for a prophet now it is the faith it is the system to have the Word of God in our hearts to say Lord what do you need from me this morning like Mary said Lord be it unto me according to your will and she was before the angel the church was before the angel and the angel disappeared and she conceived in her womb what is the word being considering your heart this morning in your life this morning yoshua alone by himself that was the purifier that Hal led them as an angel there he stood and cloak himself the captain of the host he was the unseen one and he's still the captain of the hosts of the Lord they don't sing when the invisible one they are militant one here tonight just as real as he was a standard air he wasn't standing there against the walls of Jericho you can say that this morning he is here why am I saying that he's here because you're bringing him with you your heart is mourning not because I'm here because I am nothing but if you're here with a clean heart with a pure heart then he is living in your heart then he is dwelling in your life amen the same Lord Jesus amen prevalence says he was the mill kiss he was a pair of fire he was a Rose of Sharon he was everything he's everything to me this morning amen he wasn't in a cloud or in a cloud or a pillar of fire anymore now is the very Lord Jesus Christ now is a manifestation of the Son of man in the bride you and I he became me that I might become him by grace and we always hear this thing all what what the power the father was was was was poured in took in to Jesus Christ and always was in Jesus Christ now where is it we said that now this morning it is in the bride he man I hope you're understanding me I believe that what the angel didn't say on chapter 5 was revealing the sixth chapter of the book of Joshua the word was open to Joshua go and destroy Jericho but spare me a bride Amen praise the Lord the city of Jericho needed to be conquered first it was a main entrance to the promised land now remember the battle is not yours the battle is lost the Lord led the Lord to conquer your Jericho your walled cities I mean you can say amen to that Lord come and conquer my own life my own desires my all what I am and then in the book of Joshua chapter 6 verse verse 1 it says now now Jericho was straightly sure shut out because of the children of Israel known went out unknown came in brother Paul was preaching in church and he was talking specifically about Jesus creature scripture and he said why why what are we supposed to do with our enemies if not if nobody was able to go out or go in is because the children of Israel that were around that city and he said something that I really like he says because then if if not if nobody was able to go out or come in then they wouldn't be able to feed themselves and as I just said the city of Jericho was the main entrance to the promised land in other words what can we say here that when you are right when your enemies around you you either feed your enemy or you or you put your enemy to start until they your enemy die you can keep feeding your enemy nobody went in nobody went out what was happening there what they were doing they were putting them to fear first of all and also they were they were asked they were putting them to be starving amen and that is what we are supposed to do with our enemies this morning whatever your enemy is is now how can can you say Lord I'm fighting with this thing and then you go in front of the very same thing that you're fighting against that's feeding your enemy amen amen so stop feeding your enemy this morning amen now then the next verse it says and the Lord said unto Joshua see I have given into thine hand Jericho and the King Durov and the mighty man of Valor and ye shall come past the city all you men of war and go around about the city once thou shalt do thou dot you shall do that six days now if you read this chapter here seven Church ages were open and at the end of the chapter a prostitute receives a fulfillment of a promise that was given to her because she kept the secret so if you read this chapter six they were going around and we were gonna go to chapter six six a little bit but now when they walk around the city they were walking in silence silence doesn't it tell you something about the opening of the Seventh Seal that was the silence for the space of half an hour what was happening during that silence the Lord was descending he did Lord the Lord had descended and he has come to fulfill his promises in his children it have come to dwell in them as I said you said before Christ in you the hope of glory remember the seven fields will reveal rupturing faith to the bride I can tell you rapture in faith one calm rapture in faith he is already here i many believe that this morning now look even though the city was going to be destroyed great have had a token what was it token now it is the person of Jesus Christ in us or maybe we let the Holy Spirit destroy our world series full of pride full of anger full of the pride of life and the pleasures of this world is mourning may we let the ray half the desolate one they bearing one to produce the fruit of the hour let her be free let the one that the Lord has purchased with his blood let her be free this morning remember total obedience will give you the right to the token that is the promise of God that is what the prophet of God said in other words if you truly surrender to the Lord and you come in a humble manner he will guide your steps and in the choices of life he will lead you in how when and what to do but you have to be humble because many people come and seek advice from the pastor but there is already something in their hearts and they want to come to the pastor to tell them and kind of say pastor I need these or I'm gonna buy a car so you're recovered in your heart so why are you asked your posture if that is not reading your card just do it because when you come to talk to your pastor seeking for advice come with an empty cup and say Lord what you see that you want to get but you want to give me and then you and then you have to you have to have this mindset if whatever your servant is gonna tell me that's what we're gonna be doing because it is the advice of the Lord see that in prayer amen now Joshua 6:13 it says the seven priests they were carrying the seven trumpets carrying the seven trumpets they went forward marching before the Ark of the Lord in blowing the trumpets the armed men went ahead of them in the rearguard follow the Ark of the Lord while the trumpets kept sounding so on the second day that they march around the city once and return to the camp they dot DVDs for six days and on the seventh day they got up out of a day break-in they march around the city seven times in the same manner and as but that day this day circled the series seven times the the first six days they were just one and then where they went back to their camp but the seventh day they went six seven times he meant the seventh time around when the priests sounded the trumpet the trumpet blast in Yoshio commanded the army shout shout for the Lord has given you the city and when the trumpet sounded they army shouted in at the Sun the sound of the trumpet when the men gave a loud shout the wall collapsed and so every day everyone charged Australia it straight in and they took the city look in these verses they were playing the trumpet every day they were walking around the city now look in the Bible a trumpet is a message coming forth look your stuff you could catch the message there see glorious this morning just a few were catching the message can you imagine for the rest of the people that was just noise all these people is around and he they are very noisy but for ray - ray house and care hospital it was a sound of life he was the sound of life when this word is spoken to you to you it is the sound of life it is not the sound of defeat it is not the son of death but is the sound of light this morning all I can say this Bible it has brought life to my heart because we come and you look I can see my life in this book before the opening of the word the word it was your stock history book but after the opening of the world the pages of this book they have now been made flesh in nylons how many can say that every time when I go and read the Bible all I see myself myself day when I go and read your six I see myself there I see a woman a harlot but she was forgiven and all her sins were forgiven and cast down in the sea of forgetfulness and it says that it is forbidden to confession it is not a history book anymore oh how many can say lower more of you less of me this morning or lift up your heads because your redemption is drawing nigh oh the trumpet the trumpet sounded and just ray have the church knew what they meant I was reading Joshua chapter second the second chapter of Joshua the spies came in the in day and she had to brought them off to baihe they had a Pentecostal experience because she dropped he brought them to the awful room and she was asking the asking he was telling them telling them there we have heard all what you have been doing you cross the Red Sea you know she was speaking about victory and the children of Israel in their house we're speaking about defeat the Gentiles we're speaking about victory and the Jews that the children of Israel they were just defeated they were seeing all the wonders and everything and he was just defeated but she went with them and she was talking she told him but you know what she told him if I want the salvation of me and my house and they said they told her okay we're gonna give you the salvation but you have to keep a secret you have to keep this as a secret it is just for you and she said can I bring my mom they say okay stop it's okay here and they say can can I bring my father and they say yes and she said can I bring my children and in the end of two spies they say yeah bring them in can I bring my aunt or my uncle and she said they said whoever you want to bring in just be ready just be ready and now that message is for you this morning whoever you want to bring in on their that token just claimed that this morning whether it is your father your mother whether it is just plain them this morning bring them under the token oh praise the Lord so now she had a church she may be she may may may have been displaying the tapes because she they what there wasn't a pastor but that was okay because the message was coming oh that was at the trial that trumpet sounded and just Rahab the church they knew what they did those trumpets they meant they meant life oh she was in a countdown we're waiting for the last the sound of the last trumpet was the first one the second one the third fourth fifth sixth and then she was like well the seventh day they say they were going to be going around and they're going and then they're gonna shout and then they're gonna there's gonna be a trumpet and the wolves are gonna fall down she was under expectation and that's the same thing with the bride this morning she is under expectation waiting for the the physical coming of the Lord because there is already something in her heart that is telling her be ready be ready oh praise the Lord seven times the judgment of God came to the city but only in the seventh in the seventh round a shout came worried through seven Church ages the judgment of God have come but the seven church age is the only that have come with a shout in this age we have a shout we have a voice and we have the trumpet of God to the people of Jericho the shout the voice and the trumpet they meant judgment but to write half it meant Redemption and salvation what does this word mean to you this morning it is not just another book it is life to my life this morning it is in the book in the volume of the book no it is written other mean in this book it says that I am an overcomer in this book it says that I am forgiven in this book it says that all my sins were forgiven before the foundation of the world what can we say to these things he God is for us who can be against us this morning how many rejoice this morning that's why you cannot read your Bible your Bible and pray because there is life in this book it is not just words written thereby by all those writers that they are all they wrote it any ideas matched perfect he wasn't just written by coincidence coincidence it was written for a purpose enjoyed the purpose you are the purpose this morning amen that's why in this book in that sound and all those things that there was to Rea have it meant redemption and salvation so he was counting okay he's a six-time and then oh he is a seven-time and then the shout came and then the trumpet and then those walls came down or to the world the coming of Christ is judgment and tribulation but to the bride it is Redemption and salvation how many can say amen to that the word is inspiring about so many things but who can be the next president who can be the next the next congressmen who can be that who can be who's gonna win that then the next World Cup or who's gonna who's gonna lead them that the nations in the next deal nuclear deal whatever they are fighting for that because this is their kingdom but we have come from a kingdom that can never be defeated a kingdom that cannot be destroyed this morning now 1st Thessalonians 4:16 in it says for the Lord Himself I just love this scripture people saying that it's brother Branham the one but if you read here it says the Lord and what is their next himself not a man not a church when I'm not a denomination but the Lord saw discern from where from heaven with a shout with the voice of your kingdom and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first and I can say that death also in their sins and in their trans passes they have also they have already Ray Rice and amen amen the first thing is a Trump when a trumpet or a no it's a shock and then a voice and then a trumpet and Branham says shout is the messenger getting the people ready the second is a voice of the resurrection the same voice that loud voice in st. John 11:30 844 that cold letters out of the grave that is the same boy is not that has been brought to the right it says getting the bride together and then the resurrection of the death seemed to be caught up with him now now watch the three things take place he says now the third the third thing is a trumpet which always at the Feast of Trumpets is calling the people to the fist and that would be the that will be the bride's supper the lamb supper with the bride in the sky you see the first thing comes with a consort with the message calling the bride together the next thing is a resurrection of the sleeping right the ones died the ones that died back in the other ages they are cut off together and the trumpet the feasts in the heavens in in the sky why that is the thing that takes plague that that is what is taking place a place friends he says we're right they're ready now they only think the Orlan the church is coming out but he has to lay before the Sun to ripen amen so now there was a shout there was a voice there was a trumpet for a half and now we had received the same thing this morning and it says did he send a son did he send another one like like like came unto us no he came himself that's why I love this scripture the Lord Himself it says he came himself to redeem that lost son that's what we always have heard this is not the work of me and he's like Ryan wrote that song this is not the work of any meal you know hallelujah God did not entrust his plan of salvation to another but he trusted only himself are you happy this morning to know that he came himself and he himself is this morning among us bringing life to the believer bringing joy to they believe her brother anima says did you ever meet a person that's me that's that has been there where in the Holy of Holies he says and it has been tasted and living on this manner or has tested they tasted the manna he says he and that person is living in this on this manner you can meet him on Monday he says you can meet him on Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday or Sunday cloudy day bride a gloomy day no they things going right things going wrong he is always sweet always full of love never a talk or to do anything wrong why because he is living under the glory of God he never gets it gets hungry he never has to go to church to get built up he's always full of God why because now that person is living before the presence of the Sun he's been ripen every single day I mean he can say praise the Lord to that we are we getting something out of this message this morning now your show 6:17 it says the city and all that is in it are to be the destroyer they are devoted to the Lord only Rahab the prostitute you know what all the things who all in all who are with care in her house shall be a spare because she hid the spies we sent so what was going on here the Lord was fulfilling the word that was given to the true day today to meet those two men amen now God has sent his message saying destruction is upon you but those that display their token they will be safe can you imagine the people walking around her house and saying why do you have that thread out of your house it is right why do you have it usually well you know you will not understand it that's what when people ask you why do you have sisters why do you have to dress that way you're like well if I explain you you will you will not understand it and instead of that you're gonna be criticized for me so you know what just lets you leave it that way right well what happened they were making fun of her because she had a trach but there was a confidence that that they told her if you keep that token there everything that is under the token is gonna leave just those that display the token they will be saved she kept that talking until the appointed time and what what's an appointed time do you have a date like you want you know the ones that are getting I'm getting there by the way those that are getting married but you're in the dating time or stuff like that you set an appointment okay you know what I'm gonna go and visit you this time and we're gonna be doing these and that so you a point of time and then what their point of time comes then you get there in English all right all right ma'am so that was the same time the same thing for Rahab they talked her when you hear this sound if you go and read the book of Joshua 2nd chapter they didn't tell her the message but they made it well they talked heard the message but he was kept secret the only public thing that they told her was like just display their token but the message that was told to her the destruction is gonna come a trumpet is gonna sound how did you know the message think about it how much he rejoicing if they didn't they didn't open the message they guess I did but it was a secret it was Ray Kappe secret now it is the bride's secret this morning she knew all the message the message that the angel came to Joshua and gave it to Joshua she knew it by revelation because when when she heard the sound of the trumpet and all that noise she was they all my Redemption is coming my salvation is coming amen she kept a token until the appointed time only those that have that had the token given by Joshua's messengers will be saved if you read Josh's the second chapter yours too were sent in Moses before he sent twelve and two of them where we're bringing a good report and the other ten we'll bring in about report so that's why it isn't this time like the messages is in a shorter time with a few people fewer people why because if you bring a lot of people there gonna be a lot of ideas and that would cause confusion so those just two were sent in the in those two we're in one Accord when we're in one mind in one Accord are they they all in the New Testament they are in one mind and in one Accord and now they are in a coroner in one mind in one accord with the message of the hour just those that have received a token the Holy Spirit through the revelation of the message of the hour to the individual will be saved from the tribulation nobody else I was thinking about the baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that is the one of the steps to be saved I can give my heart to the Lord amen I can I can I can say to the church I have given my heart my heart to the Lord but that is not enough the Bible says repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost so think about it this way the nominations out there I've been thinking about I'm pondering but there is nothing else the denominations out they are doing great jobs you know like bringing a lot of people to Christ but they can they can be they can repent perfect praise the Lord but if they are not baptized as what the way the Bible says so amen so they can they can say that they are full of the Holy Ghost I will ask them have you been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and if they say no so I'm like from which spirit the Azzam are you they asked those guys though those disciples if you are not baptized in the name of Jesus Christ amen and you know because it's like God cannot say just to some of them you're gonna come this way and to you you're gonna come this way and we're gonna get to the same place that that is not the way it is the word is very simple you have to repent you have to really you have to repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you will receive the gift of the Holy Ghost that's why the prophet of God says there is good people out in the denominations why because he saw that they were being they were repenting themselves and that they were baptized in the name of Jesus Christ that's the key amen Joshua's and again not singling out anybody or not you're saying oh that's what we are the ones no we're just following what the Word of God says acts 2:38 it says repent amen and you said to the two men who had aspired out the land go into the prostitutes house and bring her out and all who belong to her in accordance with your oath to her in other words a God honor the oath that those two men gave so the young men who have done this buying when spying went in and brought out brought out Rahab her father and mother her brothers and sisters and all who belong to her so the message wasn't just for her the message was like to whom ever will it is for you for your children and for the ones that doll or me they made shall call they brought out her entire family and they put them in a place outside the camp of Israel if we can say this thing God's times and seasons are perfect if you look at when grey having her family were taken from Jericho and United to the people of Israel they were taken to Jill go and and I'm going to tell you one thing it was a time of purification she didn't come in the time that you wanted I don't come to Christ or to God whenever I wanted I have to come in the appointed time whenever he wants me to come I will come so she came in the purification time they came out in that in the time of beautiful purification oh what a beautiful picture disease we have come in the time of purification and what can wash away my sin what is the time of purification it was a time when they were when they were offering all those their offerings to the Lord so they were they were a are toning or at all or all of these things from the people and not just for them for us but also for the bride what can wash away my sin nothing but Lord Jesus we are saved by the blood of God the eternal God involved a mortal body in order to take to take away my sin he became the lamb in order to shed his blood and enter into the bail with brother branham's he says this in the book of the revelation of Jesus Christ in other words how beautiful disease that she didn't come at any time she came in the appointed time purification time Uniting time or the other right she came when it was at the time the marriage the the the the marriage of the land she came at the time when that earthly bride was gonna be getting together with who with that heavenly bridegroom that was it nothing else Joshua 6 24 and 25 it says and they burned the whole city and everything in it but they put the silver in gold in the articles of bronze and iron into the treasury of the Lord's house but Joshua is spared Rahab the prostitute with her family ain't no clue belong to her because she hid she hid them in Joshua's cot sent as a spice to Jericho and she lives among the Israelites to this day in other words she obey the word of the prophet that's why I can say these this morning that sister that I was talking at the beginning she obeyed the word of the Prophet she didn't go to college which is nothing against it but the prophet of God saw her in a vision she may have seen her you know what if she's going back to college he may go back to her her past life so it is better for her to stay a comment take care of her or her family or her Darrin mom and then God is gonna give her what they desire of her heart she obeyed the voice of the prophet that was the same thing for Rahab she obeyed the voice of the prophets amen now Joe shall destroy the city with fire but Rahab was safe this world will be destroyed with fire but the bride is already saved and if you if you see here everything is sided with the Angels visit a visitation to Joshua he obeyed the message and everything finished with the rescue of the bride and now again think about that young lady the Indian one she obeyed the word or what a great responsibility responsibility this morning we must of a God in order for his message to come forward because brother Branham says God doesn't have all their eyes but your eyes he doesn't have all their hands but your hands he doesn't cover their feets but your feet he doesn't have all their mind but your mind what am i doing this morning in my obeying what God is telling me or am I just taking these for granted and saying well you know what that's for my brother that's for my sister but this is not for me this is the end of the matter a bride she did her part she kept a word that was given to her in that that is what I want you to take this morning whatever word you have been given if even if it is just one word live with that word until the next service or until your good morning devotion so whenever you have time whenever you make your time available to pray with the Lord and say Lord what is next for my life because sometimes you may feel yourself you know what I'm stuck here I'm not going forward you don't know where to go but that is the time when you have to say Lord where do you want me to go it has happened you know it happens to ministers happened to me but you get to a point is like what Laura what is next and when you start asking him Lord what is next then she's gonna say this is next for your life friends I can say that is a key keep his word keep his Commandments he cannot be ashamed whatever he has promised he will come to pass whatever don't we sing every promise in the book is my every chapter every verse every life we sing that I was thinking the other day like singing like all songs and I was like wow like sometimes you we used to sing them all the time but now they can't they have a different meaning to me and now when I sing every promise in the book is mine I say every promise in the root position amen so how many are happy to know these things this morning Lord you hid all these things from the wise and the prudent and have given them to your little children and then it was because it was your own pleasure Lord to give these things to me this morning this bride she obeyed and if the was a bride that obeyed in the time of Yahshua there will be a time a bride that is going to be in the time of the Joshua Commission certainly the Prophet is gone but the word is here now being made flesh in the heart of simple people in the heart of the relievers this morning how many company can say thank you Lord this morning from when you can say Lord I I thank you because like I didn't know anything about this but now you have come with a shout you have come with a voice and now you have you have come with a trumpet of God father you have caught you have called me from darkness into your
