god bless you this evening we want to just turn right into the word in Genesis chapter 21 tonight Amen good to be in the house of the Lord good to be with each and every one of you amen and you know just so thankful for the mercy of God once again amen it's so good to be together and we just want to just look here in the word just one verse of scripture and will let you have your seats Genesis chapter 21 and verse 1 and the Lord visited Sara as he had said and the Lord did unto Sarah as he had spoken let's read that again and the Lord capital L capital o capital R capital D visited Sarah as he had said and the Lord did unto Sarah as he had spoken god bless you as you're being seated just like to speak tonight for a few moments Sarah's visitation we know that what we've just read here as we were looking here's some time a few weeks and last week we were dealing with this in Genesis 18 here in Genesis 21 were we open in the scripture this is that which the Lord had said while using human flesh to speak it it was not the human flesh that would return back but it was the Lord Himself that would come make a visitation to Sarah the flesh would not ride the trail again but the Lord Himself would ride the trail again so there were seeds that had to be sown and in order for this to take place remember this itself as what is mentioned here in Genesis 21 his promises that were was already made and as the journey with Abraham continued it began to become more clear even to where that God would express it in Genesis 17 at the latter part of that chapter that Sarah indeed shall have a son according to this set time within the next year and I will establish my covenant with him and so God at all God was very it the the promise itself and the clarity had become more and more clear and within it becoming more clear at once it is just to see this these this is word that is being sown even in that time to where that in this chapter of chapter 18 where the visitation takes place to where that Abraham has seen he as witness God appear in dreams and lights and God is you know made himself known in various manner before but here and in this time before they promise for being an order before it to come to pass God makes and manifests himself through that of human flesh and remember it was when this coming down that Abraham himself he recognizes that there is something different about this these men that are coming down through here Abraham did not just look at them as just you know that well it was something that seemed to be different as far as on the outside but what it was it was something there on the inside that Abraham was in tune with God and I want you to think of this now he was already in tune with God and each step even through all of Abraham's failures even through all the misunderstandings of the promised God's Word was prevailing in Abraham's life sometimes it would have looked like that Abraham well you know surely God would have cast him off or God would have wrote him off but you see God does not choose flesh that would be flesh within itself that would be strong in that the flesh would gain glory but God chooses that with words within weakness if weakness itself is displayed but you see that weakness is only an opportunity and a channel that God can make his power known through that weakness so through everything that had taken place it was a great triumph for even Abraham to be able to take the promise of God and even to triumph even over every one of his failures but now when you we come into this to see of where this visitation will will come to Sarah here we come back into the scripture here in Genesis 18 in this time of visitation where remember Abraham himself recognizes this is a day of visitation when we finally open here in verse nine if we can just refer back to this where where we read from our text the Lord visited Sara as he had said and the Lord did unto Sarah as he had spoken in verse nine it says they said unto him where is Sarah thy wife and he said behold in the tenth and he said I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life and so and lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son and Sarah heard it in the tent door which was behind him now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women now notice here's the conditions you see when you when we look at things many times you can hear a story you can hear a testimony but unless you know the background that testimony doesn't stand out as great as it does if you know the background and so when you consider that even the background on things is very important even to where brother Branham would take the the text of Psalms 27 and he would refer to that text he says we're gonna read this text as a background for the rapture and the background itself is a setting it lets you know the setting of which the bride is going to be caught away in rapturing grace it's not a setting of something that is easy but on the contrary she is and we are surrounded by the enemy but yet within the midst of it there is a place that has been reserved that you and I would be able to stand in this hour and that stand is not our strength but it is God's provision that it's made a place for you and I in this hour where you and I can stand the Bible said he has set me up on the rock in the secret of his Tabernacle in his pavilion he has hidden me there in this time of trouble so God has already made a provision I I'll say it like this tonight when we look at that and see that in the word I believe if we can really take it in and not just leave the word out here but to see that in everything that can come our way even in this life to recognize he is our provision God is not left to you and I to be Franek to be anxious to be digging around as though that you and I are the one that's got to come up with the answers he is our place of safety he has always provided for his people and the way that he provides for his people the greatest thing that he could ever do is provide himself has the place of refuge and the Ark of safety for his people that's the greatest provision our challenge many times over and over is our own anxiousness and why are we anxious because we get our eyes on the conditions which is exactly why this is included in the scripture right here they were aware of their conditions this is why Abraham in the previous chapter laughed when God said you're going to have a son by Sarah he laughed you know why he knew the conditions of his body at one time he produced in his mouth but a stream of life was gone Sarah's womb was dead she had been barren the whole time hallelujah so think of this God allows the conditions to be recorded here for you and eyes to see that the conditions were not favorable for the promise hallelujah but the conditions were what was needed for God to declare himself as the Living God sometimes our conditions we look at it and say God shoulda gave that promise to somebody else the conditions would have been it would have been more favorable but those conditions are opportunities for God to come on the scene and make himself known because this is not a work of power or Mike it's the work of the Holy Ghost hallelujah any healing that's taking place it's because of the Holy Ghost faith that arises in our hearts it's because of the Holy Ghost deliverance it's because of the Holy Ghost amen is because of him or repeated on our conditions we'll always look unfavorable now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age in other words they had they had they had already had their golden Buckeye card for years they had already had senior discounts and senior privileges it's letting us know the condition when the word has come the Bible says in verse 12 therefore Sara left within herself not allowed in herself in here she laughed saying after I am waxed old shall I have pleasure my lord being old also and the Lord said unto Abraham wherefore did Sarah laugh he didn't come out of that Sarah why are you laughing he went into her atonement how'd y'all would we'll get that in a little bit he went there to her atonement he asked the question to her husband come on now I can't read that quote yet I got pages ahead of me now but he asked the question he's directing to her head this is why it is the blessedness to be under the headship of the word amen because when questions arise it's directed to the headship and if we are baptized into the body by one spirit we are under the headship of Christ amen and the Holy Spirit deals with our life to work all things out to where if there's any unbelief it works to cast that out and the Lord said unto Abraham wherefore did Sarah laugh saying shall I of a surety bear a child which am old the word the word standing in her midst discerned her heart let me just say it to you like this as far as and I'm gonna read a few statements here in a minute as far as a son a man coming and revealing v son of man Genesis 18 in that respect is history but the word is still here the son of man himself is still here in bright form and that word is still discerning hearts and lives there's not a man that can know even when brother Randall say it was not brother Branham who knew what was in the hearts of the people that's not what a prophet is but a prophet is that a one who is in tune with God a special gift that is given that God Himself would be able to transmit his secrets and his secrets then would be declared to his people the rest of the world writes it off as just another ministry and whatever else they want to classify it as but it has a meaning to that of the elect believers because it's it's not because the tiolet are super smart it's because of sovereign grace if it was not for Sovereign Grace you and I would miss it I want you to think about this all the way down there men that worse collared men they knew Moses message they studied it out they could quote it forward backwards let me tell you something they were fine people come on somebody they were flying people they were people you couldn't put a finger on their life but they didn't recognize the God that they have been reading about they couldn't recognize his visitation hope you're with me it takes more than recognizing quotes to recognize God amen you need to recognize the Living God that spoke there let them quote supporting youto without recognizing God you miss it you can have a fistful of quotes and Miss God we can have a fistful of scriptures and miss God God comes to fulfill his word hallelujah we don't know him by letter to know him by letter used to know him in the flesh but we didn't know the person of Jesus Christ heat him down let me repeat that again he didn't die he's the same God right here among us he's the same God living in his prime he's the same yesterday today and forever that's God's Word hallelujah he's the same God tonight the same that he ever was and that word discerned Sarah's heart let me tell you something the word is on your side the word is on your side he had already God had Sarah in mind the whole time it just began to come forth in this moment but here Sarah was a part of that word and now here comes a living word and what's that doing discerning the very intense and the thoughts of her heart why because the Bible said as a man thinketh in his heart so is he you get to thinking that I know good ain't no count I know this I know that you watch how your testimony you watch the atmosphere that will come about your life well I always fail and I always do this so now this and that and whatever more you know what you know what God already took cussing out of your mouth and you need to forfeit the devil's language because a negative testimony is Devils language come on somebody you see what God is doing he's changing her language because out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh what's he doing housing on a changer language he's got to so word and that word being showed in her heart that word itself as it's taken in her heart it's watered in her heart by faith he casts out doubt and unbelief and fear the repeat of God hallelujah what's he doing he's giving Sara the visitation the testimony of who God knows her to be the word is a discerner no doubt going through this congregation right here Brigid we could spend days right here of times whatever vessel that God is used but how many times were you've had questions on your heart you've had needs in your life you've had situations I'm gonna just tell you right now if God is so mindful about that to speak out of I don't care if it was five people you mean to tell me god is that mindful to speak to you in your need you know what God's trying to let you know I care about you I love about I love you I'm thinking about you I will actually turn this service around to speak to your knee hallelujah he manifests himself that he cares Amen he came there to the tenth door with one thing in mind where is Sarah thy wife and the word is there to come forth and bring a transformation in her life to where it's casting out all unbelief Oh glory be to God he's announcing his coming he says in verse 14 is anything hmm I just love that is anything too hard for the Lord nothing at the time look at this at the time appointed I will return unto thee according to the time of life and Sarah shall have a son then Sarah denied saying I laugh not for she was afraid and he said nay thou did his laugh you see the covering was taken off now I want you to think about this here for a moment here in the Old Testament where we stand it was prophecy within the life of Abraham of that which would in this visitation that would take place in that time when God himself would take upon a virgin born body that he had created and God would manifest himself in the flesh and come in order to pay the price for redemption and then through the praying of that price he would release now that life that we were intended to have he went out through the opening of the blood cell now sin that same life now back into the Church of the Living God or upon the seeds of God in order to raise them up in that newness of life it was a season and I want to say it like this where we are standing in the sound this is a season of the fulfillment of God's Word it's a season this is this is bride time you see it was an announcement that was being given these messages that God brought within this hour these are announcements it is seeds that was being sown seeds of the word and what seed you sow that seed will come forward but that seed must first be sown so there had to be a sowing of seed that is identified for this power that these are the promises that belong to us and the Spirit of God is the one who picks up those promised seeds and actually begins to sell those seeds and those seeds themselves find their mark in the hearts of that of the children of God and in the time those seeds come to life by the same God who showed him in the heart he brings a harvest in the life it is all his doing you see when we look at this visitation and looking at this in Genesis 18 remember Bill Graham will tell us and he'll dramatize it in his then the message is anything too hard for the Lord brother bran would ever actually say that even in the tent that morning there had been a fuss some of y'all now and just turn around in black the devil's right there had been a fuss in the ten blood ram even said in the tenth before he said Sarah had got to notice and some of the you know some of the fashions going down into Sodom he sent dinner or other things he said was coming up he said but you know what all that was it was he said it was when you see things like that arise he said it is only Satan bringing in our position because the promise is on the way [Applause] so when you feel like sometimes in math it seems like opposition is rising you go ahead and get in your tinting door because your visitations on the way opposition arises it's trying to hinder trying to turn you aside and at that very last moment listen this is where you discern it and say God you are my strength Lord you made the promise Lord and I'm going to look to you and not the circumstances Amen help us Lord amen I believe the Church of the Living God is rising in this I believe that was all my heart amen the ministry think of this it's the minister it was Abraham that caught that visitation it was Abraham that caught the visitation that was present and told Sarah you know go make three hoecakes and and sent two young men to get the fatted calf and brother Bram tells us he said it was Abraham that got Sarah and said Sarah this is what God promised this is our day of visitation you see God had to have some eyes on the scene come on somebody God had to have some eyes on the scene that could catch the day of visitation you and I would not have caught it on our own hope you understand what I'm saying you see it's the continuity of how God works it ain't quitting brother ran him in a place that God didn't pudding but it's recognized the Lord God will do nothing but he fairs revealing his secrets to his servants the prophets and better this was some secrets that was to be made known these were things that were wrapped they were secret and sealed within promises there but when those seals begin to be broken their names begin to be called names would be a change and Jehovah himself was coming down and planting his name his life his power in the life of Abraham and in the life of Sarah you talking about a mighty visitation and Abraham said this is our day you see Abraham is split and Sarah know this is the day of visitation this is your time this is the moment you recognize that's why God had the ministry that he did in this hour of Malachi 4 Luke 17 and 30 revelations 10 7 don't let them just be buzz phrases to you that was God's promise word in this hour and that will select you and I know of our day of visitation what was that seeds that were shown for right now when that latter rain is falling hallelujah where is Sarah thy wife brother brems said it like this and proving his word in 1964 he said now we say he's raised from the dead I didn't say it the word here said they said he raised from the dead he says he's the same yesterday today and forever you believe that he promised these things to happen in the last day that the same son of man will be made manifest now remember that was not Jesus talking to Abraham there that could discern the faults of Sarah's mind behind him that was not Jesus he had not yet been born but it was a man in human flesh that Abraham called Elohim the great Almighty you see Abraham was able to discern who was behind the flesh Abraham wasn't worshipping the flesh he knew who was behind that flesh Jesus said as it was in the days of Sodom now what's closed in the days of Sodom see the conditions nobody can argue here we're in the phase of sana we're living in the days of Sodom that was promised its conditions so will it be at the coming of the Son of Man when the Son of Man is being revealed not no more as a church see not no more the bride is called in that day the Son of Man will be revealed what to join the church to the head unite the marriage of the bride let me just tell you you can't have a wedding without a bride and you can't have a wedding without a groom a bride ain't gonna marry a picture seeing gonna marry a piece of paper a bride marries a person come on somebody they meant so in order for there to be a marriage that has to be a summoning and an awakening that this is the time of the marriage of the lamb has come but they just had long forward to it but the declaration in this hour a seed that lay within the world now that seed is picked up and it's spoken and prophesied and declared over this generation that the marriage of the lamb has come and the bride the Lambs wife she has made herself ready and that declaration declares to you and I that it is the fullness of Christ Himself the son of man who is in all men just as much as it would be insanity for a man to marry a little girl it would be insanity for a woman to marry a little boy you say what do you say I'm saying the marriage of the lamb is not married to a little boy it's Jesus Christ the Son of man in our midst that same one has had him could say she's bone of my bone flesh of my flesh life of my life it has been building down through seven ages and now here is the bride called forth in this hour to be united with him this is the taking of the Gentile bride the bridegroom call will come right through this when the Son of man will come down and come in human flesh to unite the two together you see these these were seeds that were being sown it's identifying the day of visitation listen many men had tried to pick up scriptures they had tried to figure things out by charts I'm telling you very smart men you even read in some of the things even in Scofield's notes and other things like that you realize these men were in tune with God the difference is when God comes on the scene to declare the word for right now that's the difference when God is declaring the word for right now these promises were preached and they were looked forward to but you see the difference is is now with the vindication of the Holy Spirit standing press and it's no longer putting promises in the future but it is declaring I am the direction and the lie that this is the time for he who made the promise is on the scene to fulfill the promise remember Satan's trip if he can't get people from looking back he tries to push him ahead but it comes down to unite the two together who the Son of Man and the bride the church has to be the word and he is the word he was the Living Word where he was signs followed where he was demons trembled come on somebody where he was the sick were healed there right where he was there was deliverance where he was there was life and he's the same today don't misunderstand that if God's given you a promise of healing that's as good as if you had healing standing right here because remember the same God that does it here is the same God that gives you the promise it says it's finished it's over this is my promise a living God and and he is the word and the two unites together and to do that it'll take the manifestation of the revealing of the Son of man not a clergyman he said see it's the Son of Man Jesus Christ will come down in human flesh among us and we'll make his word so real that it unites the church and him as one the bride and then she goes home to the wedding supper she's already United this is already a uniting that takes place before there ever is a physical uniting between a man and a woman there already is a uniting there where in their hearts beat as one is that right it is where that same life the life of the bridegroom moving behind the flesh of the bride this bridal tent that he's come to unite in hallelujah this bridal tent that he came to unite in she's already united we go to the wedding supper not the marriage they meant the marriage takes place here it mantid through that marriage we're looking for him there is a literal Jesus that's coming that's what believers believe that's what we're looking forward to oh no you can't spiritual Isis coming like that hey man he has come in the fullness of his spirit and he's coming that he came down and manifests himself through that other of a gift of a prophet and then God coming now in that of his bride but that is what makes you and I aware and looking for the physical return of the Lord Jesus Christ amen but the rapture is going to the wedding supper when the word here unites with the person and they to become one then what does it do it manifests the Son of Man again not Church theologians the son of man the world and the church becomes one whatever the son of man done he was the word the church does the same thing you see how the Spirit of God is placing this it's not leaving this revealing of the son of man in the Union back in Genesis 18 it brings it on down into that in that visitation to Sarah to where there is a uniting of the two together and so if the church does something different from him they're not the church it's not the bride of Jesus Christ it's an imposter come on some I don't care they got quotes or whatever they got it's an imposter if it does not stay with the said the Lord you can't cut out parts of the word if God had ministry they're a powerful ministry the same son of man in the Church of the Living God has a powerful ministry now they had non spiritual gifts back there he has not spiritual gifts here it's the same Lord Jesus I don't want no hybrid form I'll only enjoy and delight in the original Out Boy of the Holy Ghost because I know it brings results Amen we don't need any tampering with a formula the Prophet didn't tamper with the formula he was a true prophet of God come on somebody he didn't tamper with things he preached that word seeds were sold and there's a crop on the earth tonight when the Holy Spirit visiting that bride and is raising that word to life in you and I I'm a Regis something here about love sit on the plane and can't go into Canada I know little things make a lot mean a lot to me but Lord God be merciful quickly Lord shake them let them not look at flesh that same flesh that God dwelt in disappeared in a little bit after that it vanished because God only used it so will the flesh that is using now will vanish one of these days it'll go back to the dust of the earth if Jesus Terri's but the Spirit of God will live on forever that [Applause] flesh went back to the earth Cosi was only using it if you Terry or I Terry if God Terry's pretty soon this flesh that is using now we'll go to the earth but the Spirit of God will live on forever because remember this is not a man's work hallelujah oh my as that prophesy rang out when the Prophet was coming up to the platform and that prophecy rang out and said there is a man coming to the platform now whose message will forerun the coming the second coming of the Lord and brother Ram said did you notice what it said it never said the man it said the message will fall around the second coming of the Lord a man is not the man that was promised to return to us but it was the Lord Himself his promise to return in a visitation to you and I when that flash went off the scene the world had been delivered seeds have been sold now it's time for Sarah's visitation this is bride time glory be to God so Sarah would receive seed on the second ride he come riding his trail again come on somebody not brother Adam but the Lord Himself the life giver they men the same Lord God that used the human flesh of a man and afterwards vanished that same God visited Sarah and performed his word that he had spoken concerning her Oh God we can just let this drop tonight what he said he performed what he said he performed he is the performer of his word everything would be in the right time the right season here they were waiting on the day of Pentecost he told him go wait in the upper room until your endued with power from on high they had to go wait there I'm saying you watch God's precision it was there at the feast of Pentecost it was there at the outpouring of the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost when the day of Pentecost was fully come God keeps every word right in his season right in his time they just deal with this here just a little bit times getting away from us but genesis 21:2 for Sarah conceived and she bear abraham a son in his old age at the set time which God had spoken to him I want you to look at this parallel here in the scripture it's the parallel the hour in which were living it's the same parallel when our Lord Jesus was walking here in that virgin born body made in the likeness of sinful flesh I want to I want you to look at these scriptures in John 14 verse 16 he tells the disciples and I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but you know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you so he was with them he's identifying the day of visitation it is the preparation for them to be made ready for him to come in them and he shall be in you I will not look at this I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you it wasn't a corporal body coming on the day of Pentecost but the eye he who was speaking here behind the veil the vessel that was speaking here the Lord Himself said I will come to you hallelujah this is the day of visitation yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but you see me because I live ye shall live also out that day your know that I am in the father ye and me and I in you see these are words seeds that's being sown you know the Bible with that dwelling on it too much here this evening the Bible declares there is the Mora that of the former rain the sowing then there is that of the latter rain which is the maturing rain the Bible speaks that now that both of those rains will come down together is that right and to recognize that the same one that does the sowing is the same one that brings the material it's the same one all the time he said I'm the Alpha and the Omega is that right now to think about here were promises that were sown promises that were made through the Church of the Living God in that hour you know the Bible tells us in Joel chapter 2 verse 28 there was the promise where it says in the last days brother man picks it up like this and mighty God he said in the last days there would be a latter rain poured out upon the people in the last days he said the Greek word there is kenosis which means he emptied his self out this is not trickles this is empty in the bottle not in the way that we would say like something was inside of somebody that he emptied how but he poured himself out he changed his in more faith he changed from what it was to what he is he never changes his nature but on the day of Pentecost he changed himself from being the son of man to the son of God he came not with the people he came in the people the same God to carry his ministry on through in this great age it's Christ in you the Holy Ghost that packs the message hello but same god emptying himself out you know what he's gonna have vessels that are emptied up that's what he was doing to Sarah he was emptying her up so he could fill her up he was casting out unbelief the word cast out unbelief the word cast out doubt that same word here tonight that discerns the very thoughts and intents of the heart where God would know your need right here tonight even from something that could have been studied here weeks ago but God knew you would be here tonight God knows the needs you would have in your life God knows the effect that he would have through his word in our life you do not get snow accident the word is a discerner what's he doing he's emptying of Sarah so he can pour himself in you see that's why you and I are his workmanship well I'm gonna clean myself up save your time let him clean you up I'm gonna do this save your time say Lord I give myself to you Lord if you see something there that's in your life maybe it's a little bit you say Lord wash all down wash all unbelief wash out loud I want to be filled out with God I want to be filled up with the fullness of God in my life every area of my life every door of my life every avenue of my life I wanted to be filled with him because the call is to finish the Great Commission the profit has come the profit is gone the message has been delivered that same message is being preached seeds that was already sown seeds that we saw come to maturity well you know what you do with seeds that come to maturity harvest them eat them and so back come on somebody that's why even looking at the word I could know that pull older ones right here tonight veterans right throughout here brother day different ones you know it'll be a different ones throughout this congregation and if I asked you the question when does this winter the message itself does it mean more to you now or did it mean more two years ago there's no doubt you could sit right here and brother Dave and different ones that say it was precious to me in the hour that I first believed but it's become more real and more dear and more precious as the time is gone by it's become more real things that I thought I saw and now seeing a greater life it's more personal my faith is rising even to a level I've never even thought of before why it's the work of the word in our midst his work in our lives I'll tell you you can't take this word in your life and remain the same I'll tell you this right now you can't feed on this word and remain the same I said feed on it you can't feed on this word and still remain the same what I do keep eating the word pray over that word amen as constant Lord take out all unbelief wash out all trash out of my life Lord God I tell you invite him in like that that's what he wants out of our lives because it's the day of visitation that word has transforming power hallelujah that's why brother BAM could say and who is this Melchizedek he said if you have not given yourself to fully feed on the world will you do so now that you might be able to fly above the things of the world and say your don't you take anything don't you let the devil put one thing over on you you stand on your job given rights are you with me tonight and done right here but you stand on your god-given rights as the son of God as a doubter of God you stand on your god-given right Ukraine what belongs to you you got a need in your life you claim what belongs to you if you need the Holy Ghost claim what belongs to you as a son and daughter of God it belongs to you the promise is to you and your children add as many that are far off as many as the Lord our God shall call he's called you claim your god-given rights hallelujah this is our
