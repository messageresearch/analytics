don't you turn around and just greet someone and went to the house of the Lord good to be in foreign good okay I'll let you have your seat just for a moment here right here okay okay think of the first line of Faith as the substance I see they're getting some new gadgets for recording where the brain's always in on this this part of it this is the there we go um I want I want to just briefly just kind of go over I mentioned to you before I think I announced it here just on Thursday um be known by the Barry coffee and asked brother Berry to come and last year there was a little bit of breakdown there between us and I totally take that and he was pretty busy with everything with uh Poland and everything's going on with Ukraine still is very busy with all that but uh what I what I'm I'm asking is and I want to just kind of give you an overview of what it is on Saturday I'm just really asking for that part if we could just really save the date we've got about two two months ahead right here and we've really been in in what's wrong you can't hear there's no mic I'm on am I on now either I was on or you thought you needed hearing aids right that's a good thing now you're like wow thank you Lord you know I didn't see people going like this you know and checking their batteries so yeah you would but um so with with brother brother Barry coffee coming here and I it just it's going to be just a little bit of a unique time and we'll have on Saturday and that's what I really want to talk about is the Saturday uh Gathering because he'll speak for us on Sunday morning and then we'll have a youth meeting like we just had here on Sunday evening and brother Berry will Minister that for us and he's been gracious to do that and this um this date I'm just asking you to save the date and I'm going to go through some of the parts about it so that you kind of understand what we have in mind the brothers that's been like to the men's meetings and things like that you'll you'll completely understand when we say the word sessions it's not going to be preaching there's just going to be a lot of interactive and teaching and and so forth that's going to take place um so and this is going to be the this is the whole subject is the Christian family and um that's what everything is going to be centered around here and I'm going to give this to you it'll come out in in an email even what I have the slides here and if there's any questions you have for me feel free to ask because you'll probably continue to hear me bombarding this whole thing because to me it's an investment that's how I look at it I'm going to just be very honest with you I don't care how as God as long as God allows me to live here upon this Earth if even after my kids are long and gone out of the house if I hear something is going to be spoken on with family You Can Count Me on being there I'm going to be there because I continually I want to grow and to learn because if God carries my responsibilities don't end when they leave home it continues to unfold into another Realm is that right scripture is loaded with that of for that of grandparents and so forth so this is really the layout of the day um I don't know why this isn't responding here okay so this is kind of the layout of the day um it's just and this is going to take place at the Heritage Presbyterian Church not here so it'll be a different uh the you know we've been out there to that uh the fellowship hall out there at the Heritage Presbyterian church and so it's going to be very informal uh the whole setup so uh you know you won't be seeing me in a suit and tie you'll probably see me in a flannel on my boots and my jeans it's just that informal and that's how informal I want it to be because we're not we don't that's not the focus here the focus is is we just we just want to gather everything that God has for us I just want to just be a moment it'll be you know with questions and answers and interactive and these are the sessions there's actually the sessions that are planned out um the first session will be from 10 to 12 and then we'll have lunch and no sisters will not be cooking on that part of it at all so these are some things that we just want to make it all focused on this session two would be from 1 to 2 30 and then session three from three to four Thirty and that's that's that's a pretty packed day in there and that's actually a light day for those that go to men's meeting when you when you come out of that uh because we're clear in until 10 at night uh these are the three sessions these are these are what we're going to be uh the dealing with is establishing the Christian household and then the second session will be the four uh corrective pillars of discipline spiritual verbal behavioral and physical and then session three independent years and I tell you as I said I I'm going to be gleaning from all of it but I know also where I'm where I'm standing right now I'm very much in session three whereas where where my children are at and uh so when I look at it I still to me because everything you look at in the economy of God it always has a spirit there's only the spiritual application is where we pull down into the natural and that's just exactly how it all comes together you hear that through the ministering of the word here you hear it right through the message of the hour and uh I believe that the word of God is meant to be a very practical it's meant to be practical and applied to our hearts and our lives and um I certainly don't feel like in any way and brother Berry we were talking about this I certainly don't feel like that I have a doctorate or a high school degree or anything in child rearing I feel like I'm continuing to grow and I'm continuing to learn and and that's exactly where where that I'm at within that so who is it for and who should be there because I I want to address this because sometimes I've heard statements like even when it came to the men's meeting and everything else and I want to address fears because sometimes it's almost like well I got this or I got and and we want to really look at who is it for you know because perhaps when I started just mentioning some of those things in the beginning I trust that nobody checked out and said that's not for me so who is it for and who should be there and these are some things as brother Barry and I were dialoguing uh regarding this right here and this is really where it's at any single that is at least 20 years old so if you're not if you won't be if it's below that then really the singles it really wouldn't be advantageous but at 20 years old and above uh it'd be very advantageous to be there um and couples that are currently involved in child raising or will be and then grandparents and like I I I was going to just put slides just involving grandparents and I don't have enough room and we wouldn't have enough time I just preach on grandparents you know because the scripture is just just filled with it because you know sometimes we look and say well discipline but you understand that borders themselves it's just like when uh one thing that I wanted with my parents um I just did not want my children to go over to their house and that their children that my children were just like well there's no boundaries I wanted my parents to know this is what our boundaries are so whatever they are at our house I want them over there too so the real reality they're not going to grandparents because it's just like Grandpa and Grandpa don't care what we do but we've got a responsibility by the scripture said teach that children's children so it we have the opportunities and different things and I know like with my boys just they have members remembrances of conversations and times uh with with my my dad and and my mother um who when they go over and stay over my mother's house right now we pray for her because you know she's going to be up late and a lot of times they'll sit around and they're they're just talking they'll talk about the things of the Lord and they have questions and and things they'll talk about I think that's awesome I really think that's awesome and because you know what we're all together on this it's not just one one part you know and that's how I look at it with even with children we don't bring our young people to church and say okay brother Samuel do your job or drop them off at a youth meeting do the job we're taking a Sunday school do the job no that's that's not we we work together we work together we work together and that's the thing that's that's the we've got a vision we've got a goal and I think I think it should be one of those things that remember when Pharaoh was trying to get a compromise with Moses and just said look you're an adult you're older you just be focused on this that you're all wound up and twisted up about just it's an adult thing you be focused about it but Moses with a burden of God and knowing what God had called him to he says no we're not going to leave our little ones behind we're going to bring them with us right every everyone has to have a fresh experience with God is that right but there's no need for our children to go back to Egypt is that right they all got across the Jordan but there's no need to take them back to Egypt we'd come out of Egypt why we don't have to send them back there that's not the experience that that that's needed so I I just encourage that that really that falls almost to the entire assembly and uh I just really when I say and just asking you to save the date I'm just going to make a request and you may not think very good of me but I'm going to ask a requests that if you've got to take a day of vacation it's going to be worth it there's it's an investment that is here and that's what we're looking at and now remember whether you have children yet or not or you will these these are some good practical moments right here to even ask questions or even in dealings with things of grandchildren things that will be out there and how we're working together um so and I'm going to ask I've got a sign up sheet because I'm going to have to know I'm not opening this up to the any other churches right now it's this Saturday is strictly if if I can't open it to anybody else that's fine it's focused and I I'm going to be very selfish with this right here I will open it up if I we have spots and space available but I'm very much focused on this right here for our assembly and I wanted to because I want it to be to where we're able to very uh in that manner to be questions or able to be asked able to be interactive and it isn't just all of a sudden questions where you're just everybody is listening at your question there will be questions submitted and brother Barry will be there even on the side and things like that and uh so I'm going to ask that you would RSVP and I have a sign up sheet and that's going to be put out there on the prayer request table and that table over there if you just would sign up there we have I have to know the number uh because there's things that I have to make copies of that will be coming to me and then also for the food and things like that so all of that I have we have to get that together that's a kind of a big thing and a little bit uh different but there's things that we have to do but it's going to be worth it it's going to be worth it and I'm grateful to God that we have an opportunity and and I'll just say this too if you have maybe you have a spouse you say whether you know my spouse doesn't come to church hey you know as brother bear and I were talking he was really we were very clear it's an awesome wonderful opportunity for an Outreach too because you're not going to be preaching Hellfire and brimstone this is teaching so they can kind of see but see the character of God's always applied and so it's a it's just a great opportunity to reach out so I would say for you that are connected right here uh it's just a just a great great opportunity for that and um I don't think there's anything else that I am forgetting with this right here but um I just to kind of reiterate that before we shift our directions it's the same thing with the family and I I look at it like with marriage I I remember years years ago I asked the Lord I said Lord I want my marriage to continue to Blossom I want it to grow I want to continue to learn and God brought things across my pathway and God began to open those things and and you know what I still I still feel that way even now I want to continue to grow because the very moment that I I don't want to grow that's the moment that I need prayer right because to you know backslide isn't all together to go back it's just failing to move on and I just want to say Lord I I want to go on I want I want more and I just said it like this if I wasn't if we weren't hosting it and I could get in somewhere else and brother Barry or maybe you know one of the other brothers where someone was ministering on this with the Christian family I'm just going to tell you and I'm just saying this from my heart I would be making the sacrifice to do that because I have done that in other instances you say brother Sammy but your kids you know that but I I want I want to grow because I'm also not only as a father I'm a pastor and I want to grow because there's things that I'll be able to see that man it comes right down into our spiritual walking regardless if somebody has kids or either out of the house or what there's such an application and I just I want more of God all that he has for us and anything that we can do and things that we can help along the way we want to do that and that's what that's what this is all about it's a it's a moment so that there's questions and things like that of things to be helped um so I think it's a good opportunity for us to just have a good start with that right there so this right here uh Zachary will you come get this and just put it out there on that table maybe give it to Brother Carlos if you don't know where to put it out there on the table where we do the prayer request so I don't know how to get out of this are you going to switch me off let's stand okay am I off okay praise the Lord thank you musicians if you want to turn in your Bibles let's turn to John chapter 17. it was all kinds of surprises this morning poor brother Trevor I felt so sorry for him on after the was that at the end of the Sunday morning service where I mean it's he was made it was a memory made for sure but I tell you what in the services were when you come down to it wasn't the service was just wonderful last weekend just wonderful and um I I text brother Trevor here this week because I've just just been meditating and there's just things there's there's just things that how God says things at a certain time and I told brother Trevor I said I'm just glad I was there when he was saying those things I'm glad you know I felt I felt like Peter and them they're on the mount Transfiguration it's just good to be here because there's things that God was saying so uh so clearly and um especially in that part where you know it you mentioned with Aaron and the way that God phrased that in that in that time and so and brother Trevor said well I'm just glad he was there when he was saying it too so it just so so uh so so good to be in fellowship and I just appreciate you for also the uh the support within those that were coming in here for the for the youth meeting and just being accommodating helping out all those parts and sometimes I know what the parking and things like that that can be you know an issue and different things we're working on and just making people feel at home and other brothers and sisters and because most importantly is it's a it's about lives being affected by the Lord Jesus and that's what we want more than anything is that right amen so if we could let's just let's read here in John chapter 17 verse 1 and certainly covet your prayers here this morning John 17 verse 1. these words speak Jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven and said father the hour has come glorify thy son that thy son Also may glorify thee as thou has given him Power Over All Flesh that he should give eternal life to as many as thou has given him so notice the scripture that he should give eternal life to as many as thou has given him so the imparting of eternal life is that God has already is a predestinated plan of God so the whole counsel of God the whole word of God the program of God is a drama that's being unfolded so it's not anything that's new it's God just simply unfolding himself in his children's lives and so as we see here in verse 3 and this is eternal life that they may Know Thee the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou has sent so what is eternal life that they may Know Thee the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou Hast sinned I have glorified thee on Earth and I have finished the work which thou gave us me to do and now O Father glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world thine they were and thou gavest them me and they have kept Thy Word now they have known all things whatsoever thou has given me are of Thee for I have given unto them The Words which thou gavest me and they have received them and have known surely that I came out from thee and they have believed that thou didst send me I pray for them and I pray not for the world but for them which thou has given me for they are thine one you know just a side note with on this we always find one thing prayer is always and should always be according to the will of God well Jesus is praying about and interceding is according to the will of God so he's not praying for something that's just you know reaching out here but he's praying according to the will of God and that that Simplicity comes down to God when God speaks to our heart personally and speaking to what uh in this hour he's letting us know this is what my will is and these are the things I want you to pray about these are the things I want you to ask for isn't that wonderful yeah so we're not guessing of what what should I be praying about God's letting us know personally what we're to be praying about and he Delights in that he Delights in that because prayer itself even is an act of faith and submitting to what the word is calling for in our life powerful right verse 10 and all mine are thine and thine are mine and I am glorified in them let's just pray Heavenly Father Lord we're just so thankful Lord that you have made a way for us to be gathered together this morning now Lord we ask that God is you Lord have come right here among us we pray that Lord that you'll help us Lord together speaker and hear that God we can just be able to Step Beyond and laying aside of the cares the thoughts worries so forth of this life and not just to lay them aside to pick him back up but to put them before you Lord and we ask that you'll just come Lord in a special way may you anoint us to gather Lord that father that you can just Lord have your way father in this service Lord I just Reserve myself to you I pray that God you'll drive away all weariness and tiredness Lord just for these few moments Lord as we would enter in Lord into the your presence May the word of God just find its place in our lives Lord we love you and we thank you father in Jesus precious name amen amen God bless you as you're being seated if you would I'm just going to skip some verses uh I'd like to read them but for sake of time let's just go straight to verse 20 if we could and hear the Lord Jesus he says neither pray I for these alone but for them also which Shall Believe on me through their word that they all may be one now here he's laying out the the full conditions and the criteria this is what the prayer is about that they all may be one how how is that here amongst a group of individuals take for example the apostles we can go through the scriptures even before this right here and at one point they were arguing who's going to be the greatest in the Kingdom you're also seeing just the snapshots before that they're all very different Peter's much different from Andrew you get what I'm saying they're all very different so how are they going to be one because that's a question we know the spirit of God through the message in this hour has addressed that question because that very statement has been made of well we got to get all the churches together but that's that's not what he said that's not what he called for God's desire remember Redemption is to bring back restore what's been lost and this is what he said that they all may be one as thou father are in me and I in thee so as the The Living Word of God almighty God the Holy Spirit dwelling there in that life but it was all showing as it was there dwelling in that life of the Lord Jesus his life reflected every promise that was spoken for his life is that right so it works because when the Holy Spirit fully comes in it puts us and places Us in the word so then our life becomes a word life that's being expressed from the root of our desires it's expressing the word so how are they to be one as thou father are in me and I and thee that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou has sent me and the glory which thou gave us me I have given them that they may be one even as We Are One i in them and thou in me that they may be made perfect or complete in one and that the world may know that thou has sent me and has loved me as thou Hast has loved them as thou Hast loved me I'd like to just just begin speaking here just a a thought when we begin to look at it and and there is quite a bit that I'm just going to just say to you from just meditating on things that were spoken last Sunday and then from the previous Sunday certain things that begin to touch into how the Lord was directing on with identified gifts of God and I just there's just certain things that it just is meditating on it and just couldn't just couldn't get away from it not that you want to get away from it but you know you're laying it before the Lord and Lord what do you want and and it really I'll tell you really the phrase I hope I can say it correctly because I didn't have time I've got the minute marked uh when brother Trevor uh the Lord spoke it through him but you know he wants to be he wants to be as he used you Aaron he says he wants to be Aaron but he wants to be Aaron as Jesus would be Aaron so whatever your name is like he wants to be Samuel but he wants to be but he wants to be Samuel as Jesus would be saying so we put our so that that's really you understand that that's really the basis of some things that I just want to start working with and just kind of moving with and that is I want to deal with the working of Oneness with God in you the working of Oneness with God in you and you know to see it then within the body to see it in our families to see it working because it's the Oneness of God and that program and that that pattern that's laid down and I just say it in this way God does nothing outside of man God chose men he could have chose anything to preach the gospel but he chose man when God came in Redemption God came he became man he became one of us God created apart to become one with his creation God God created himself a body to step down into and I say that very slowly with this intention because Jesus was not a separate person from God because with that thought line it leaves you separate because who do you have in you if you have the Holy Spirit you have Jesus which we know who is that that's God you have a portion is that right so when so when we're understanding this that's why Satan has attacked that Revelation and in this end time that's why you'll hear the Holy Spirit picking up through the message even to the black brother who wrote the song uh back in the 1900s this is the evening time oh I can't remember uh the the path to Glory you will surely find that's how he wrote it that we you know we somehow got a hold of and got slowed down you know but that's really how I was wrote and and he wrote that out of the inspiration because they were wanting to split up the godhead and he locked himself away I'm talking about the 1900. he locked himself away he was not going to receive the counsel of the church at that time and it was just a burden what was it it was God laying that upon his heart think of what was wrote in that hour did he understand everything that was wrote I dare say he didn't understand it all to the degree and what you and I have had have the privilege of not just understanding but walking in and having it working in our life where we're singing it the path to Glory you shall surely find we are singing it we Are Witnesses of the path of Glory that's been revealed if this is the evening time we are the evening time people right so God moving and he operates he works through man and it's gone now I want you to understand God does not it's not that God needs us but yet he uses us what he needs what God desires and what God moves upon is that word that he's already sown and been placed in our life and that's what God brings forth which is actually himself so the new birth is actually God giving birth to himself in you it's God being born in your life okay so now we understand that this and end now everything is an individual Affair between us and God right we can come together as a family but but a family just being part of a family just being in a church doesn't save us it does just just that it has an individual Affair between us and God right and this is why when we see that in coming back into this place right here brother Brown will make the statement God is identified by his characteristic and right before he says that he says you are identified by characteristic now how many of you have ever had somebody mention someone else's name like for example they said Ray okay now if somebody's gonna you know they're talking now they might ask Ray who Joy who why there could be a lot of Joeys right I mean there could be a lot of or others of that name and the reason what they're asking for is what's the surname what's the last name now we know I mean you know internet and things like that you can look up and there's multiple Samuel brownings and you know and and so forth you know but they're all not as good as me you okay brother so and and but when you think of it you see that's why you can look this all up and somebody else can say oh Sammy a brownie now it may not be me that they've met or they know right it might have been another Dave Kress right I know there is actually another Dave Crest but that's a bad example but if you understand that that's why there's times where things that you ask I've asked them before somebody mentions a name when I was teaching school and they said you're going to have so-and-so so and so who what's your last name you know why because I know as soon as they say that last name oh Lord prayer and fasting now this summer why because it could have been many times or you know Larry's or whatever but as soon as they put that last name there what is it what is it that I'm groaning about not the name that they are expressing as far as saying Larry it's the character that's been expressed that says oh no they're not in my class surely not Lord be merciful so you you and I are identified by characteristics I mean you know this with business there's some people that you hear certain things about business you're like not having them here right you you we understand we understand that that characteristic becomes the display so you we've got that now God is identified by his great characteristic he cannot change he can't his masks can change but he can't right Jeremiah Elijah Elijah his mask but not him in Malachi 360 he said I'm God and I change not he absolutely doesn't change his characteristics are the same so it comes down to its almighty God working through the individual by an individual experience of the Holy Ghost that's the new birth yet God comes in many different forms as we just mentioned God he came to Abraham in many different forms right but he was the same God all the time what do we mean by the same God all the time his nature Remains the Same when he makes himself known it will never contradict a prior revealing are you hearing me it'll never contradict a prior revealing because it's him all along is that right so now as we come to it God drawing down into into our lives in First Corinthians chapter 6 verse 19 Paul writes of this declaration know you not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you which you have of God and you're not your own you are bought with a prize therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit which are Gods so the price the penalty that's already been paid for there's there's no excuse because the penalty's been paid for and see the holy spirit is ministering to you and I this is not only our rights but it's what God has desired for you and I then my body was not meant to be an expression of sin my body was meant to be a display of the king of glory [Applause] right you can go to the store and buy picture frames is that right when you buy that picture frame you might display your family or extended family one or more but if I have that same picture frame who am I going to display my family is that right and that's the same way in our lives our life is that which is framed by God's grace to display His Image in this time and that's what the Holy Spirit calls you and I too that's the water of the word it calls us to that reality that hey there's something higher there's something greater there's the purpose of God for your life what you've been longing for what you've been craving for that deep that's yearning on the inside he is the satisfier of that [Music] but Brandon picks this up in the Ephesian age he says Man was created for God man wants to be the temple of God the place of God's rest the holy spirit that place of rest was man the temple now let's hear in Acts chapter 7 just this is as the prophet has this laid out here here here here is Stephen remember Stephen is declaring to uh the Pharisees the religious in that day of the Fulfillment of this word who found favor with God and desired to find a tabernacle for the god of Jacob who put that in David's heart well David was just a good old boy no who put that in his heart who put it in his heart to where there wasn't enough enemies around to take it out who put it in his heart that he spent the latter part of his life he would never see the temple come to pass but he says as long as I'm here I am going to be found working for the Lord I'm gonna lay up what's needed you know why because it had been revealed to him and that's why he said that very thing I'll pray for that's why David was moved upon bringing gold in bringing wood in bringing those other things what was it he was a burden of God that was moving upon David did David have it right every time like when you know they were wanting to bring the ark up no but he received correction right when they had another they had others mother men trying to bring the ark up and remember the man was killed because he was meant for the priest to Bear the ark over the heart but you see David had a burden but what it is is that burden had to be channeled through the word of God I'm grateful that God didn't leave you and I to our own devices you hear me I mean there's Christian bookstores that make this building and everything else look like just like a little shed filled with books and I'm not against books but you see no matter whatever that we desire to do God always he'll send his word through his prophet right David won a Revival but you gotta come to channel and that channel is the word you can't get outside of that and expect a Revival so here notice but Solomon built him a house how be it the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands and saith the prophet Heaven is my throne and Earth as my footstool what house will ye build me saith the Lord for what is the place of my wrath hath not my hand made all these things now I want you just to think of this a temple not made with hands now when you think how Paul has placed us here your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost and remember you your body it's three parts flesh Spirit soul the Tabernacle in the wilderness every Solomon's Temple on and on it's always three courts because that's man right then we go on and on with that that triunity it's man and how God's desire was to dwell inside of man so though God's real Dwelling Place I just ask you what's God's real Dwelling Place My Flesh is that the primary no no my spirit no what's the primary place so that's the temple not made with hands father and mother were moved upon this came forth right it didn't now this came forth not according to the perfect will but the permissive will of God so just so you know sorry when we get to the other side I'm not going to look different you're not going to look different I can't get there today because we're not all going to be the same on the other side are you hearing me so what is that Temple that's not made with ants it's that soul that came from God that that predestinated seed that part is a place and brother Branham even placed it like this it's God's faith moving into that place in our life that it actually receives himself into there so it's not even you and I say it I received the Holy Ghost no remember how brother Brown tells us he said I don't think you should say that I think you need to declare the Holy Ghost has accepted me right because that's what it's all about so it's God coming in into that place and it's God preparing it to wear everything that first nature is lining up it begins to agree with the word and then God can kill it and then here he moves down to raise up that new man but through the temple now let's look at this through that temple on the inside through the uppermost seat his glory was reflected into the inner court or holy place and on out into the outer Court it was all called all of it was called what the Tabernacle of God right so the token we don't just have the token in certain places in our home hello somebody we don't just have the Holy Spirit applied just in certain places of our life because that's not a true application the token applied is where his life it's come on to the innermost in of the inside by the new birth that's why Jesus said you must be born again notice this in First Corinthians 3 16 know you not that you are a temple of God and that the spirit of God dwelleth in you now as he goes on to say know you not that your bodies are the members of Christ shall I then take the members of Christ and make them the members of a harlot God forbid what no you're not that that which is joined to a harlot is one body for two saith thee shall be one flesh but he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit so think of the Tabernacle in the wilderness that was was a heavenly vision Moses was caught up and even Hebrews declares that Exodus declares it he was bitten by God and here he comes up comes into the cloud and he receives the heavenly vision and what he sees there there is already material on Earth that can be and is to be assembled so the reality is the vision from heaven will be reflected in Earth and the Earthly material that comes under the divine order as it's surrendered to God so the Earthly material everything that's had the black onyx stones and on and on order yet but the vision from that heavenly vision when it comes forth and is declared something grabs the hearts of the people and those that have a part that goes into that they surrender that part and what does it do it comes under divine order for it to be placed in a certain place those who had the black onyx Stones did not get to decide where they go God already had that determined you and I did not determine what age we would be born into we did not determine the message that we would walk in that has already been determined before the foundation of the world so where does it come to you and I when the heavenly vision is being declared because remember you say a vision I don't see a vision brother REM said every time you open the Bible you see a vision that's good Hallelujah the word of the Lord came to Abraham by vision there's an understanding it's something that grips our life and what is it it brings us to surrender I don't know I don't know I don't have to figure out where I fit in I just know I belong to him he will guide me [Applause] so God's desire has always been to be one with his creation as he had it in Eden and what Eden was was a reflection of what God had in his mind where God fellowshipped with his thoughts remember he asked job you feel like you've had laid all these questions and everything else I'm going to start out with one question and I'm just gonna and God just floors him God don't stop asking questions but he starts with one question where were you before the foundation of the world when the morning Stars shouted for joy where was that at that was in the mind of God right the Bible says in Revelations 13 8 the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world for all the names that were on the book is that right that's a scripture so this is not we are not speaking of anything that's haphazard we're speaking of a Divine Assurance it's God unfolding himself in his children so it's God's desire what Eden was was the reflection of what God had in his mind and you and I are an attribute of God that God desires to fellowship with God is wrong let me say this to you you think you're longing or I could think my longing let me tell you where did you get that longing from well I was a good Sunday school student that didn't do it it could stir things up but that didn't do it come on Friends you can't it's not a Works unless any man should boast thank God for good preaching thank God for youth meanings thank God for Godly Parents but it is not a work of man it's a work of the Holy Spirit what is it it is Mama Eagle knowing she's got some English and she's searching for them and like you take a magnet and a magnet moves right down through a place what will a magnet do it will only draw and attract that which has properties to be drawn upon now you might be bolted down with sin and you're filling the pool and the enemy trying to bolt you down he might be trying to come and you know tighten you down with a with a pressure hammer and things like that but if you belong to God Hallelujah they're in a boat strong enough there ain't a devil big enough he said I will not lose a one I don't care what it looks like I don't care what it looks like in your family I don't care what brother so-and-so I don't care what it looks like he said he won't lose the one [Applause] well brother Samuel but I don't know if they are or not why would you even entertain that thought shame on you you claim them you stand on that it belongs to God doubt is not welcome here unbelief is not welcome here this picture frame only is here to display one thing the same Grace that found me and picked me up and changed me it's my life to display that same Grace that the world may know that thou Hast sent me um Philippians 2 5. let this mind be in you he ain't talking about this matter up here but we need his mind his life to come in to help us not only to change us but we need to live by that we'll still have this but we need to live by that and we need to let this influence this when this Rises up wait a minute here that's not according to this probably brother Samuel somebody's seen you like that they'd lock you up oh don't look at me funny now I know probably every one of you have a special person you talk to why did you do this why did you let this go I'll tell you knew hey who are you talking to oh nobody nobody nobody you know what I'm talking about now we we ain't gonna go down that alley but you know what I'm talking about right now think of it here within our lives these are things that we can look at it and say no I ain't going that way nope I ain't going that direction nope not gonna do that and Satan can sit there and try to feed you everything but you got to write to and you got this and they did this or this and this and this but there's something on the inside what is it it's God's mind working greater is he that is in you then he that's in the world and let me just let's just put it on notice the world that's even including the first birth greater is he that's in here on the throne I am ruling by that of the of the very life of God who's Seated on the throne you know what he's told me he's told me I'm a son of God he's told me whatsoever you bind on Earth I bind in heaven Son of God daughter of God so now let's look at this this scripture here who being in the form of God fought it not robbery to be equal with God now I like this this word here this word robbery think about this he fought it not robbery to be what in other words he wouldn't just the Lord Jesus you'll never find anywhere in the scripture where he was tiptoeing around as a matter of fact he would say I'm a father of one he wasn't saying that to brag that's his confession that was a confession that was true this is this is how it is now the writing remember there's oh thou blasphemest well what was the whole plan of the Messiah coming what was the whole purpose of redemption God to become flesh to pay the price right that his life might return come back into you and I bring that ransom for us so now it's probably not robbery to be equal with God and I like this this of the robbery you might have it in the middle of your a Bible there in the in the margin but this is this is the reality of this word robbery and this is what it means he thought it not robbery or robbery meaning a thing to be grasped after like oh I'm trying to be a Son of God oh I'm trying to be a daughter of God oh if I can he fought it not robbery in other words me claiming of who I am is not taken away from God are you hearing me it's not taken away from God because I know what he's done in my life now it's true I may not be aware I should be and where I want to be but I cannot deny what he's already done and it's not robbery [Applause] and I'm not grasping off I can just be a daughter of God if I can just be good enough someday or if I could just see that's what the devil wants he wants to constantly right here okay and grasping that is not the Holy Spirit let me just put it on notice right now get out of here Satan get out of here we can just open the doors and say go hold your peace and leave let me say it's God's will the will of God as brother Trevor was ministering on that here on Sunday evening finding the will of God we pick those things up even with the young people on Friday night and had a wonderful time of fellowship and discussion just around that right there but it is the will of God what is the ultimate of the will of God well Mary so and so no no what's the ultimate the ultimate of God's will is that he be tabernacled in you that's the ultimate because then when we begin to pray we're not praying with other desires we're praying according to that desire that's within us that's where John 15 comes in it says that you know ask the father anything in my name and I'll do it uh if you abide in me and my words abide in you ask what you will and it shall be done see it's all working it's taking in of the words and so here we find so the ultimate this is why Paul could write now don't be conformed to the world right conform think of like Plato right you push if you push something on Play-Doh on play it takes the impression of whatever's put on it right and Paul is saying look not only don't be conformed to the world but don't even try to take on outwardly just a conforming to the doctrines and everything but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you might prove that good and acceptable will of God that's that God would dwell inside of us that's a real new birth that's a real born-again experience so see it's the working it's the working of the Holy Spirit to bring you and I fully into the will of God let me just say it like this uh some time ago and I just want to give credit where credit do this preachers or sometimes some of the biggest thieves but just hear something good you want to just claim it you know and some some years ago I heard brother Jason Watkins make a statement with the Holy Ghost I thought wow that's tremendous I just like how the placement of the words the Holy Spirit has come and you've been brought into cooperation with the vision so what the quickening power what the new birth does it brings you into cooperation with the vision God already has the vision laid out and we are working in cooperation with it now we know within that cooperation see to bring us in cooperation it isn't that we become dolls like this you know like Pinocchio no we know we've got a battle right we've got a battle but what gives us strength the the Lord is the strength of my life and I'm feeding on that right there and it's just growing stronger and giving me strength to subdue when this old guy wants to get well we'll leave him alone just for a little bit so here we have this notice how brother Brown would make this statement in Christ The Mystery of God revealed ah I just he's bringing it down into what the new birth is he says I want you to listen to this statement here he says Christ in you makes him the center of life of the rest of the Revelation those Christ in you makes him Christ's life in you makes him the center of the Revelation Christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing of what God is trying to do notice what does that not I make it Christ in you Christ in me makes the complete revelation of the whole thing Glory so he says is this coming down he says now what is the new birth then well brother Brandon what is the new birth it's the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you not you join the church shook ahead done something different set of cream promised to live by a code of rules and I don't want to just I'm not adding to the word but I want to just add this it's not even saying I believe brother Brown is a prophet or I believe this message is the truth it's not that's not the New Birth the new birth it's new life it's a new beginning it's a new creation now I agree there has to come the reality because you have to hear the call back to your inheritance and that's why God has sent the message amen God has not come to call us to a church call us to a program call us to a Creed call us straight God has come to call you and I to himself that's the word of reconciliation to reconcile God and man as one glory be to God notice he said and when Christ is being revealed he is the word and when the word is revealed it expresses itself so it's it's not oh I'm gonna let this word be expressed no when it's revealed it expresses itself in other words God says thank you for your picture frame I'll take over from here but Lord my picture frames got old trimming on the outside that's okay I'm no I want him to know that I can be displayed in Cherrywood Oakwood and Maplewood and remind my Lord but mine has you know it has like a red matting around it that's okay I like to be displayed through red and matting white matting green matting but are you understanding me now God's not interested in the form because what matters is when he gets in the form it will manifest himself the same through the form he's in oh glory be to God that was the whole purpose he said of Jesus Christ was to express himself to take his own laws and live by his own laws and fulfill his law by death and Christ died in flesh in order to condemn sin in the flesh that he might bring to himself a glorious bride redeemed back that will believe only in the word of God and not swap it like he did for intellectual conceptions of man that's Christ's idea that's God's idea the new birth reveals this and this is why it's very clear if a man says that he's born again I'm quoting a prophet but you can see it's very clear if a man says he's born again and he'll deny a part of the word he ain't born again he might be born again according to what a church has taught but remember churches do not have authority over the word the real Church of the Living God she is his wife she submits herself to her head she recognizes like Rebecca Saul Isaac and said who is this it said that's him that I've been telling you about she veiled herself and went to meet him she was under the headship of the word and the bride recognizes his headship and that's the only headship that she will recognize and if she goes to leaning toward any other headship she gets in trouble right example in the prophet's life just that little bit with the family we see those things but we see also the grace of God when that as well is that right this is why Mark 16 says these signs shall follow them that believe I I just have to I'm going to read this part of it right here he said so it's Christ expressing himself in the individual whether he's intellectual or whether he don't even know his ABCs and I could you know I could preach we could preach this probably in fifth gear but I don't want to do that I want to speak these things and let by the spirit of God that they drop it doesn't matter the intellect sometimes you know sometimes you I've heard things have said oh you know brother Sonia I wasn't raised in a message or I wasn't this and you know so-and-so was raising the message and this and that okay but that doesn't take away from The Authority that God has given you are you understanding me my wife was raised well maybe she might have been raised around it but she has she been in it when my husband well have they been in it because it's a lot different than setting on a Pew and being around it and it being in you and you being in it a lot different are you with me it don't it it doesn't it doesn't matter if a length of time a number of years and I know this and I know that and I know this and I know that my that that's not what matters what matters is it is our heart submissive to the Holy Spirit is it submissive to the word of God is it that same way that when he came that was prophesied that I Delight to do thy will o God that is within my heart so it has nothing to do with whether a person's intellectual or not well I don't I can't really I can't quote this or I can't do that that has nothing to do with it so that's where you're just able to dismiss it it doesn't mean that we don't give ourselves to the word but to understand giving ourselves to the word you could recite chapter after chapter and not be giving yourself to the word at all you can stand up here and spit out scriptures left and right quotes and everything else and still not be giving yourself to the Lord come on now and there are too many quotes of scriptures I can pull from on this right here it's got to be a heart that's submitted to God because we do not read the word of God that the next time I come across any while we do it we are in the word of God so that our lives might be enriched that it might become a practical at working in our lives right that's what the Holy Spirit was preaching now it comes back to me what brother Trevor is saying my Deuteronomy 2 has got your Ephesians 2 and Future Three what at the end of the day what's what's accomplished that's why the word of God's Not for debating the word of God is meant to be lived it's meant to be lived there's no greater testimony than a life that's lived Hallelujah glory be to God whether notice whether he's intellectual or whether he don't know his ABCs half the apostles didn't know it I'm just quoting here but they knowed Christ Peter and them couldn't read their name on The Box card that ain't supporting illiteracy it's letting you know they took knowledge this is scripture they took knowledge these are ignorant and unlearned men but the goes on to say they knew they had been with Jesus that's what matters amen not that I've been in a message church but have you been with Jesus come on now I know this doctor and I'm not asking you that I'm asking you have you met Jesus Hallelujah mama mama think about this Jesus said no man lights a candle and places it under a bushel is that right now that was not only being implied to you and I that we would have a testimony but Jesus is letting you know because whatever he's asking you and I and expressing to you and I he's letting us know this is how he does it he doesn't light up your life or my life with the new birth and then it's all hidden no it displays itself and you know what he don't have to borrow a Candlestick he's already got the place reserved because he's Jehovah Jireh the place where that light is going to burn that's your kind of light and it's going to reflect itself through our lives is that right therefore that's where it's God's light it's it's him that's inside of us through our surrendered life that's what God God wants I probably won't be able to get to this this morning but that's what he wants our temperament well brother Samuel I'm trying to escape of the of the way that I am well if the sin question is not settled then yeah you need to escape that but as far as escaping your makeup your disposition sorry you're not going to escape that but you can receive the grace of God to rule over it because you know what God wants to use it I remember he won't use anything we still got our hands on it sometimes you know you go to start putting your hands on things again no God just takes his hands back you know what I feel a little ugly let me have my hands on it let me put my hands back on it right that's what God wants is is leading in our lives you think take for example children in a family you have even in a family the children like our like take for example our three boys and they since I'm the pastor and standing here ministering right now and they're part of our family that they have the privilege of being used as an example but I'm not going to call them out personally but it's just to say it in this way there is very much a similarity among all three of them but yet there's a great difference there's a great difference there's a great difference even in the approach and how that I'm I I work with each of them because they don't it's not it's not a Cookie Cutter Way but the same way I need Scripture for that I'm glad you asked John 10 he knows his Sheep by their character by name right you remember the one sister oh brother Brandon I need to know that I really got the Holy Ghost brother Brian I'm just I'm all torn about it my brother that I'm saying brother just just ask God to let me speak in tongues so brother Brown said I'll never teach this out because I'd have people grasping after the wrong thing but he said to help her out well he knew she already had it so he said God let her speak in tongues why because the longer you get she got a place to stand to stand no doubt later on it's been there the whole time see God didn't say draw the line you know nobody whoever draws and red lines never go by him anyhow right some of you get that but under any rate there's things that God don't operate in that way God don't operate I'm glad he doesn't I'm glad I'm glad I'm saying for me and for you I'm glad he does it I'm glad that God's personal I'm glad that though you know brother Dave the way he deals with you he deals with you he may not deal with me the same way but you know what he's my father just as much as you are your father is that right he knows each of us he knows hallelujah oh Gloria I wish I had ours right now don't worry don't get scared but individually not only is you know look you can look at Ben and Paul and Zachary they're physical you know a little different and things like that I don't think any of them took after me but their emotional characteristics you know how it is with parents they can we know how to man never played cards but we know how to deal it out he got this from you just from now that that okay so that part's you and but yeah they shared the same father and mother Paul Ben exactly share the same father and mother and I'd say they're blessed it's free but I'll tell you and I share the same father and mother the word is our father and the Holy Spirit is our mother is that right not two separate people but it's the same God Condon sending down amen so just to leave it with this here this scripture can I have just a couple more minutes let me leave this scripture I'm dying to get to where I'd like to get to with all this but I'm not going to and I don't want to rush anything but let's just leave it like this in Romans 8 29. for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren brother Trevor was really bringing that out and pulling it in from Hebrews there moreover verse 30 whom he did predestinate then he also called and whom he called them he also Justified so see God working all along what's God doing God's working under that of a finished product it's it's finished in the mind of God this is just out working it's God working it's God unfolding himself right and whom he justified them he also glorified and brother Brown picks this up if you haven't listened to the message images of Christ I just couldn't get away from that right after the services last week and I just went into that message begin to just just drawn to it with certain things I knew brother Brown had mentioned and he's dealing with images of Christ and you think in this hour that we're living in because the term Christian and Christianity can be thrown around so easily right you know you can have things where people say oh yeah I've seen this I've seen this Sports Talk boy they're Christian really how you know that well because they were across they don't mean anything right right well you know they kneel down that don't mean anything well I know so and so it now I will grant you this there's a great difference in a Christian and a Spirit-filled Christian yeah but just because somebody says you know God help me score this touchdown God you think God cares about a touchdown God help me with this basketball you think God cares about basketball you think God cares about oh you know God help me get this goal for soccer you think if you think God God's wrapped up in all of that that's when you look at what they're and you realize I'm not trying to put anybody down but friends listen this age has been so under such a deception to where it's almost like they said God help them do it approved right but remember there's one setting in the temple of God worship ask God right he's exalted to the throne of worship and man Satan doesn't care how that he's getting the worship even if it's coming through God's name are under the name of Christianity he doesn't care how do you know him because he opposeth himself to all that is called God who that wasn't a notes so many friends I wish we stopped back there it's free though so what is a Christian REM said sometimes we limit it to joining a church is that a Christian because we joined a church no someone who takes up affiliations with the church but REM said I believe that Christians should do that but I don't believe that's Christianity that's what a Christian does after he becomes a Christian some say well it's going to church and serving Declaration of creed you know I promise to raise my right hand and left hand and whatever more and promised I would do this or I signed the book and I I did all this and I'm not making fun of those things I'm just trying to say that we're here and the duty that I have is to preach the truth that has been revealed those that is ordained to that life will come to it it won't be me I've never brought it's not me bringing anybody it's God himself drawing he said if I be lifted up I will draw all men unto me not under Samuel unto me if I be lifted up right so notice loyal to a church no uh maybe packing a little something a little Cross or a little sign of a Christian I'm quoting perhaps maybe if they burn a candle or some kind of penance or they're immersed in water or they do some kind of sacrifice or some good to the church or they help their neighbor they buy some coal for the Widow or some shoes for the orphan those are all good things right those are all good things but that still don't deal with the root of the problem that's the soul purchasing a piece of coal does not birth your soul helping the Widow across the street does not give you a new birth right no more than just coming to a church the new birth is of creation of God where a life has died out to themselves that's the acts that a Christian should do but that doesn't make him a Christian well some said you know if you pack an image of Christ in your car on your wall well that's the sign of a Christian I mean maybe you've got the picture in the from Houston Coliseum that don't make you Christian come on now well I've got all the books that don't make you a Christian getting tight now that's not what does it I believe there's help there if you can recognize that the same one who had his picture taken there in Houston Coliseum he had his picture taken with us and he's here with us and his desire was is to dwell inside of you and I that's why brother Brown could say I don't believe being an image of being I don't believe that being an image of Christ uh I I believe let me I believe that being an image of Christ makes you a Christian it's not what we do outwardly it's what happened inwardly now I know someone right there you could take that and I could become a favorite quote and well it don't matter how I dress but remember it says it in the word of God and if the spirit of God's on the inside of here it will not reject anything here amen that's a real criteria for a uh what the real New Birth is and if that's not there you understand when those things are ministered in that way you're not the holy you know what that is that ain't a man trying to get you to conform oh don't wear your pants and don't do it ain't a man trying to get you to conform that's the word of God because on the other side there won't be no pants wearing and there won't be one make it there wearing pants there won't be one woman going the Rapture with pants on find it in the Book of Revelations where find it see if they were adorned in pants they're not adorned in pants it's not fair man has made that up seminaries and men and backslidden preachers false prophets have cut away at the word of God to try to do what appease the nature in man instead of dealing with it and saying you need to be born again because if you still got those desires you're not going to make it oh oh I won't have a man to rule over me like that that's what the scripture said when the sun came oh I don't have to do that I don't that's true nobody has to do that but for the Bride of Jesus Christ for his bride she loves to please him Hallelujah we love to please him that's our desire if there's something that's out of line I want to know about it I want to know about I want to please him I want to serve him in every way so it's not just something I put on outwardly but it's got to be something inwardly and if he's our image and the likeness and we are the image and likeness of members of his body we should be images of him let me just skip this on down here he says then it's not what's reflected the image of Christ is not reflected in our church joining packing a crucifix or our emotions but it should be in the living presence of the Living God that's being reflected through our life now I'm closing here look at the Lord Jesus we see the Hoffman's head of Christ right we see the the Garment right that he's wearing we see the beard but you see God God's desire was not that we would reflect the outward God's desire wasn't that well every one of us you know we've got to we have to have a beard I know that sounds very simple but I'm reading exactly and sometimes the very simplest things because it's not something that we we don't have to it's not something being put on out here you and you don't like put-ons I don't like put ons right you can tell when somebody's a put on right because when it's put on it can be taken off and if you catch it at the wrong moment you're like whoa whoa where'd that Wolf come from it was beneath there see that doesn't mean we have to grow a long beard as the artist pictures him having and neither does it mean we have to grow long hair as the artist pictures happening or to wear a robe as he wore for we're living in another day we don't we we don't necessarily have to be that to reflect his we don't have to reflect his physical image but we must in our souls reflect his Spirit image and his manner of life I don't believe Christians consist of joining churches or Creeds I believe it's a reflection of Jesus Christ in a human being for we are his members the members of his body and we bear His image now just as you and just as me I have hands fingers eyes ears used to have hair so forth all of these everything even what you can't see my heart liver kidneys all those things all that together works cohesively together as a unit that I might be displayed because you've not really seen the real Samuel Browning you've only seen this right here that displays Samuel Browning that's what you've seen right that's why we're coming back to the very point at the beginning the message when you hear about somebody's name and you realize oh that's the person I was thinking about oh Lord what was it what was it you're saying oh Lord about it's what's been expressed you're not saying oh Lord because of their nose or their ears or their mouth or their you're saying oh no because of the character that's been expressed so the members of my body are the visible part that allows the invisible to be displayed is that right what'd you think of this right here how many remember the quote brother Brown says if I had the spirit of John Dillinger if I had he said I would you know own guns and shoot things up and go rob if I had the spirit of Beethoven right right now here's this one thing and I'm stopping here today you'll never find him in a quote saying if I had the spirit of John Dillinger I would dress like him I would I would you know I would I would you know act just exactly like him no the manner of life that would be displayed is one who's a bank robber I might act a little different than John Dillinger but if that spirit is within me it's going to be Robin Banks the spirit of Beethoven is within me I look different than Beethoven I'm living in a different time I dress different right I don't know where those you know them what do they call them you know with them big long stockings and everything else and you know them wigs and things and so no no but if that spirit that was in Beethoven was in me what would I be doing writing music now I might be writing maybe sometimes you know maybe with some of the music and but I'll be writing music right I look different I might even be a little bit more pleasant more of the time than what Beethoven was sometimes but what comes down to it is is what manner of life is on the inside and I end with that here this morning the working of the Oneness of God in our lives it's different forms it's different personalities but it's the same God doing the same Works through you and through me and let's just stop there that's God's idea that's God's desire God's desire is not you conforming to me or me conforming to you God's desire is that we be conformed to the image of his dear son because there's only one to be lifted up and exalted and that's the Lord Jesus might be different colors different forms and so forth remember he changes his masks but his nature is always the same glory be to God let's pray Heavenly Father Lord thank you Father for your your word this morning Lord a little bit Lord I know a little bit of a different gear of things and just waiting Lord on you and Lord just I appreciate father these things have just been Lord You're So riches we've looked at them Lord over the time and just Lord as you even last week how you spoke that in such a way and and just coming down and looking at this Lord your desire is to come and to work through us Lord Jesus to take our lives as vessels and to work through US Lord but that same manner of life is reflected through our lives because that's the true Oneness is that Lord we would be one with you by that indwelling of your life in US and through that that places us in the word so then it's a word life Lord throughout this journey there's a lot of dying a lot of dying to ourselves a lot of Lord letting down of our will to the will of God there's a lot of molding there's a lot of shaping and Lord we ask you oh God that you would just Lord give us more grace Lord more grace Lord is moving in our lives God as we would receive that Lord to take it in our lives being changed and transformed Lord pray God here this morning if there's one Lord where that Lord is something that they can recognize and say Lord I want you to have the uppermost seed in my life I I want you to have that that place I don't want you just Lord just let it be in my mind or where my spirit and that but I I Lord or something I do outwardly where I will I do the part but Lord your desire because that's a miserable life your desire it's miserable because it's not something that's coming from an inward Delight it it's it's a law but your desire oh God is that your word would be so displayed in our lives Lord father I pray this morning if there's one Lord that they can recognize that in humility to your word and your presence that they could just Lord invite you and say Lord that's what I desire Lord I I just Lord I lay my life down I Lay My will down lord father I pray that Lord that you'll move Lord I know you will Lord you'll move for every sincere heart dear God throughout the building Lord here this morning hear Lord you are veiled in many different forms Lord right here setting Among Us Lord as a people of God Lord I think Lord of even Lord even I can look in my own home Lord my wife and I Lord just just to look at us and yet we're so different there's things that were like shall she can know what I'm thinking and I can know if she's going to respond someone could ask me if she liked this or she I know that I've I've been I've been there with her enough I know that I know what she I've taken I that's an interest to me I know what she enjoys I know what she likes and vice versa but Lord we're very different but yet there's a Oneness that we have between us Lord and father that's just not in the natural marriage I'm looking at that Lord in the body of Jesus Christ that God so so different but yet it's the same God working the Lord and that's the Lord this morning that's what we want to be sure of and that's what we want to Lord surrender ourselves too that's what we want to yield to we want to yield to the Holy Spirit Lord because you're not you're not Desiring us to try to be like somebody else Lord I could pick out anybody's name here you're you're not Desiring Lord that Lord that brother just wait that he would be like brother Samuel you don't want that you don't want that if you wanted that you would have made him up just exactly as I'm made up you didn't want that and neither did you want me being brother Joshua you didn't want another sister being of another sister I think if there's anything that ought to draw Lord in our lives this should be to say I just want Christ to be reflected in me as he's reflected in her or him and who is it that we're drawn to Christ who is it that we need in one another I need Christ in you you need Christ in me it's Christ in one another it's in the body Lord help us I pray help us in our own individual part as you just started Us in looking at this Lord help us father help us Lord that we can just continue to step aside that the image of Jesus Christ can be displayed granted Lord we pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen I'm sorry this morning if it was so broke up but I trust he's been able to put pieces together I always trust that sometimes you feel a little bit you know the minister sometimes you may feel a little bit morally you feel like you've done anything but you understand that it's just it's it's something that God would make known so real to us and has he even passed by our way here last Sunday the way things were said and I began to even think about the previous Sunday we remember we were talking about identified gifts of God I was talking about those tribes of Israel and I said if God give me an opportunity and I'm not saying that this is that opportunity but to be able to show you if you've brought up a problem and you put all the 12 tribes you'd have 12 different perspectives are you hearing me yes but but it would be one heart and that one heart is is that they want God to be glorified but it would be 12. because why every one of them were different every one of those tribes were different is that right God even positioned them differently in the land one was a corn razor one God put their feet in oil some were great you know with the pastries and things that God has all that they were all set up so differently so you mean to tell me if you brought all of them to a table and sat down that they would all maybe come at it though they maybe wouldn't all come at it the exact same way it's think of think of it like this think about how God has such a diversity let's just leave it like this of the ministry and the body I mean like brother Trevor last week I couldn't even think of questions to ask like that that but he's been able to surrender himself to the Lord and that gift in his life and God uses it that way different perspective or different approach but it's the same after the same goal you see it now it's it's same it's coming but it's the same goal and that's why that God's not interested that everything he's not trying to make us all all that we're all like that's not the Oneness the Oneness of God is that he would be in us we in him and then we're part of the same body and God uses the uniqueness the differences the things about us like you said little Aaron regarding you he wants to be Aaron but he wants to be Aaron as Jesus would be Aaron and you can put your name in I can put my name in there that's how he wants to be and I think the greatest thing we could say is his Lord I'll just say for me Lord be Samuel how you would be Samuel but anybody want to join me too Lord and you put your name there right be Rey as you would be Ray Lord be be Stephen as you'd be Stephen Lord I want you to be Samuel as you'd be Samuel that's what I want you to be in other words you know what you're saying you're welcome I want you to feel at home I I I'm taking everything off in other words Jesus you don't have to just come in and stand on the welcome mat I'm free to go you want to go in the refrigerator go in the refrigerator yeah right I want you to be Jesus that's what I want be Samuel has Jesus would be saying now not as Samuel because Samuel Samuel's made a mess out of being Samuel but Jesus he knows he knows could we just stand let's just worship Him go ahead and sing brother Brown let's sing what's on your heart Hallelujah amen if you'd like prayer this morning we'd be happy to pray with you go ahead and sing I'll look back
