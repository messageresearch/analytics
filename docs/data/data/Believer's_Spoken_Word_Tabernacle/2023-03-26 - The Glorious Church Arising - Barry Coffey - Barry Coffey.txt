uh you know it's uh there are a lot of Ministries and a lot of helps within the church that just make things work and make things flow and and I think it's good to acknowledge uh the help that's given and uh we appreciate them very much and our musicians and deacons and everybody that helps make it make it happen I appreciated the Gathering yesterday appreciated the brother brought me coffee all

take your places there this morning and um if you don't mind we'll we'll just take a uh we'll have you stand just for a moment here and and have a word of prayer and we'll read the scripture because then we'll place that right up front and I think that's a good thing I bring you greetings from my family my wife is here sister Becky and uh it was a wonderful opportunity for us to be able to travel up and and come back through Ohio this is old stomping ground for us uh I see uh sister Christy here and who else is from Logan anybody else here from Logan and look at hey look at that the Palmers are here look at that wonderful great to have you that's that brings back all kinds of memories good to have you here I pastored in in Logan for 16 years and uh here in Ohio in Hocking County and proud of it and live to tell the stories and uh so it's great to see them and uh great to be back my wife and I got a chance to come up in 77 it's been a long time since we did that and uh years and years ago we would travel up to Albion Pennsylvania and be with brother herb Smith up there and minister in the old days and uh back in the 80s and it was great a Great Fellowship that we had so it's really an honor to be here and be brother Sam's Sister Kim and and all of you and see so many familiar faces and to be able to join in yesterday in the in the meeting and it was a real blessing so we just feel great about being here today and I just trusted what's said over this weekend will be helped to you and edifying because that's uh that's why we've come so let's read in the scripture in Ephesians chapter 5 and we'll read a very familiar passage here just to capture a phrase Ephesians chapter 5 verse 25. husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of Water by the word and this is the intent now verse 27 that he might presented to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish may God add his Blessing why don't we pray this morning Heavenly Father we counted a grand privileged Lord to be gathered in this house today with your people and trusting Lord that you will just move in on the scene and take complete control father we ask forgiveness for anything that might hinder the moving of the Holy Spirit and pray that your presence Lord would just come and take over father I have notes I have this presentation here today but Lord that's that's really unimportant compared to what you may have to say and Lord you know the needs of the people and I pray that you would just uh just lead me and guide me and father just take complete control of the gifts and talents you put inside me that you might edify and bless your people today Lord you be the minister and you operate the gift I pray in Lord just when we leave here today may we say it's just been good for us to be in the house of the Lord we love you and we thank you Lord I ask the blessing of the presence of God to be with my assembly today Lord and pray that you would be with them and father our families and our loved ones we commit them into your care now in Jesus lovely name we pray amen and all the people of God said you may be seated this morning God bless you um this is us we had a wedding a year ago and uh this was uh this is our family all gathered together and uh my four boys we decided to stick with boys as I told you yesterday and uh these this is the whole family gotten together this is a it was a rare event for us to have a picture like this done and my father-in-law on the very uh right hand side there 96 years old and he has preached the gospel longer than I've been alive and uh now just in his August years and this is our whole family and the grandchildren and uh just excited about that I I like to say that I believe that grandchildren are the reward you get for not killing your own foreign now if you don't mind this morning I asked Brother Sam if this would be all right and I'd like to I'd like to just take a little a few minutes this morning to talk about what's happening around the world with vision books and and I know that you you have a great interest but Sam is well known around the world and uh you folks have been very supportive of this work with vision books and I wanted to just give you a visual uh of some of the things that are happening I have pictures here that I wanted to show you and and some of the exciting things that are taking place and I even have a little video clip here that's embedded so hopefully we'll get it with volume and uh I uh we're excited to see what God's doing and this is really an effort to find the last seed because that's what that's what this is about we're just interested in reaching the bride of Christ with the best message that has ever struck the face of the Earth and we're excited to play a small part in that and uh recently we were in Africa and did a documentary there that documentary is available on my website and uh in Hickory Bible tabernacle.org and it tells a story of going into the uh jungle up there in a place called loliondo and I've got a little uh trailer that I'll show you this morning here but brother Branham said in a message a guide don't travel your denominational Roots now he said stay behind the word because you have not passed this way before and the word will lead you across because the word is Christ stay behind the word yes sir stay with that guy don't get in front of it stay behind it let it lead you he said Don't You Lead it and Joshua said now you've never passed this way before he said you know nothing about it so Vision books is a is an answer to a need uh where uh there's nobody nobody was doing large-scale printing in the world anymore of the message and yet the need was great in places where uh villages don't have electricity they don't have internet connection they don't have many people don't have phones or uh they live in mud Huts they didn't have access to the message at all there were many countries that we sent books into where people felt like they had been forgotten by the rest of the world the bride had actually felt like they had been forgotten nobody nobody brought any materials they were they felt like they were disconnected and out of touch and so Vision books exist to meet a need to help provide the materials that are necessary for the bride of Christ to have the word of the hour ministered to them so this is an older man who just got his first book ever it's a church age book printed in Spanish and uh in Nicaragua and he was very excited to have that and somebody took that picture and there are currently needs for millions of books and bibles that uh uh that are necessary and and desired all over the world I had a a gentleman as a pastor in the country of Malawi and he did a little video clip I don't have it here with me but he he made a little video clip and he wanted to thank us for the Bible that he had received and he said that for 10 years he's been a pastor and he preached to his people with his phone and on his phone he had a Bible app and ministered to the people for uh the 10 years that he was a pastor but after seven years his phone broke so he had no message material whatsoever and no Bible and preached for another three years after his phone broke didn't have enough money to replace his phone and he said now somebody's given me a Bible in my language and given me the message in my language he was so happy and so excited so he sent me that uh little video clip there just to thank us for that and so uh there are believers like you that are all over the world they look a little bit differently sing a little bit differently but in this case this group here meets under a tree and they moved their chairs as the sun moves across the sky so they're not sitting in the direct sun and they do that until they go home they are people just like us believe just like us and love the message of the hour for sure so basically this is very simple we we use translations that are either on the message Hub or translators that work for us and and Supply translations in various languages we do printing overseas we do it all of it in China and in India and in both of the factories where all of our material is printed they are both the largest Bible printing companies in the world and all major publishing and printing is done now overseas like this and so we found that the quality was very good and the prices were extremely good so that we were able to provide lots of materials in large quantities and we summarized it this way every language Every Nation so we can do every language on Earth and we can do every nation on Earth and it's just been a blessing so I'll show you a little bit of this translations are done from the message Hub and then also from individuals this top pitcher is brother Anwar Javed who lives in Queens New York and he translates in the Urdu language for Pakistan and uh he coordinates all of the distribution of material in Pakistan does a tremendous work he's a great friend below that is the translators in in the Venda language and these are the people who live on the border of South Africa Zimbabwe Mozambique in that area and there's about two million people who live there and speak that language and there's about 30 000 Believers they've never had anything in their language and these are the translators who are doing that and we just recently last week finished the church age book in the Venda language and they're very excited it's on its way now in a boat there's some of the printing operations there and like I say all of it's done in China and India except for Pakistan Pakistan is a Muslim country so we cannot import Christian materials in the Pakistan so we print inside the country and uh it is a wonderful blessing because we have no shipping uh process or anything like that no shipping charges and uh it it goes directly to the people there so they're uh they're working with brother Anwar and get all kinds of uh materials available to them very quickly in the country of Zambia was there a couple of years ago they speak the bemba language and there's about 30 million people who speak bimba and there are again something like 50 000 believers who speak there and this translator had translated all kinds of books and never had anything never had anywhere to send them I never had anywhere to send the translations and then I show up and uh he said well he said I have all these translations already done and he said we have not had books printed and he said about 25 years and any material so we went ahead and did all of these books and there's a bunch more that uh now single sermons that are on the way to those people over there let me tell you they're excited once the books then arrived in in the country and this is something that sovereignly happened uh we we will manage to get them across borders through customs into the hands of the Believers there but then these Believers take these books and bring them to all the neighboring countries and all the areas in a nation where Believers are and we give them out without any uh without any con you know a restriction uh if they're Believers they're entitled to get books uh in in their in their language and it's wonderful to see the ministers uh you know being so excited that they'll take these materials on their own I have pictures of uh Believers taking books in horse on Horseback they'll take them in saddle bags and ride over the mountaintops in Nicaragua and Honduras and places and get them into Venezuela and all kinds of all kinds of Nations that I would never have access to but they know how to do that and it's really exciting so this is Honduras and again this is how it happens the books arrive and then they divide those up and send them around the countries and get them distributed to the Believers there and let me tell you they're excited they're excited in those Nations where now they have all this material available that's our blue truck there and uh it's parked in Malawi and we'll fill that up and go into Mozambique and South Africa and Zimbabwe and Zambia all the southern part of Africa and they deliver books that you see prints there we just did the Hoffman head of Christ and the Rich Young Ruler and did that for all the Believers in in South Africa South America or sorry South Africa and all the southern part of the continent and uh it's it they're just they're just really excited these are Church age books that were sent to Haiti and the the conditions are so dangerous and so bad in T they've had to give them out just sparingly just a little at a time but they were they were very glad to receive books in the French language over there here's some Believers in Pakistan and they are uh like I say they're a nation that is 97 Muslim and uh yet the message has been spreading and growing over there and they're really uh really excited and very thankful to be now having uh their own books over there in that language here are believers in Ukraine giving out materials in the Russian language and Believers in South America in the uh they they speak a form of Spanish uh they're called Emira people and they live in three different countries on the western side of South America and Chile and Argentina and so forth over there and uh these are people who most of them live in the mountains they're Believers just spread out all through that area in the north of Africa Nigeria and Ghana in uh in Liberia they speak the Yoruba language over there and these are all messages and church age books that are coming in uh in that in that part of the world so they're very excited about that but this is what's really neat is that now evangelists are able to travel and move around and give new converts books and bibles in their language when they come into the faith and they're witnessing to people they're witnessing to their families and uh excuse me they're traveling around and spreading the message as well so we're seeing a flurry and having reports of all these people being baptized in villages and towns that we never knew existed I mean we never knew there was Believers there and to me that's exciting because that's that's what's supposed to happen and now that they have materials to give out they're able to do that so it's really wonderful and uh in in uh in some of these areas let me tell you it's it's just uh it's just been life-changing for them to now come in contact with uh with believers who are able to supply them with the things that they have need of all right so we went to Tanzania and uh this is hopefully we can do this here um do we have sound are we all right for sound we don't have sound let's put a microphone here because this is this is uh worth listening to this is only a minute and a half okay can I do I'll do this here and this is a this is a little trailer that we did for the documentary and again the documentary is uh available on our website sorry let me go back here and let's play it all of this footage is ours we use drones and other technology here to capture this but this just gives you a sampling of where we went uh on this trip there were 10 of us [Music] [Music] [Music] that's the trailer keep me the documentary is available on our website and it tells the story of what happened in oleando and it is a Maasai area it's a messiah Village and there are 60 villages in that little 60 little communities in that area of what's called norangoro and that's where the Serengeti is and all the big animals and all of that and uh to a brother a brother from Arusha the the last church that we saw there went to that area as a worker for the government and witnessed to one of the Messiah people and he embraced the message and then he went and told his people and then they went and told their people and it spread all through that community and now there's 36 people in that uh in that church over there and they're just on fire for God they all live in mud Huts none of them have electricity or Internet or anything like that and most of them just wear a simple blanket that's all they wear and so we had this opportunity to travel there and to minister to them and bring materials in their languages Bibles and so forth and uh let me tell you they were really excited Olivia was one last image and this is a redesign of the Seven Seals book uh you know brother George Smith had done the seven Church ages and did a redesign it's a nicer to read and better paragraphing and so forth and uh we we print that for uh people in many different languages he recently just did the seals book and it's redesigned so it's nicer to read and uh we printed it first in Spanish so these are Spanish books now that are arriving in South America from Mexico City down and also in the U.S here and uh that's that's been done and it's been a great blessing to the people in South America we are wanting to print now hundred thousand copies of these uh English books the English one is done it's at the printers and we want to do a hundred thousand so that we can distribute that in various countries that speak English so this is uh this has been a really great blessing and you'll see those books now arriving in a couple of weeks they'll be coming over here you'll Brothers George will have some we don't have a store we don't have an outlet so sometimes I have some books available to give people and most times I don't but in third world countries it's just a wonderful thing to see Believers here who contribute so that everyone in third world countries can get them free of charge and it says right inside the cover of the book that nothing can be sold everything can be reproduced and uh just to spread the the intent is just simply to spread the message of the hour and so that's what it's about so thank you for giving me just a little opportunity to share that with you and there are literally thousands and thousands and thousands more pictures like that of people around the world who are just excited to be getting materials now in their own language and again it's just an honor to be able to play a little part in that and your church has as well and Brother Sam has it we certainly do appreciate that support but let's turn to the word if that's all right and uh let's tackle a little subject this morning that I trust will be a blessing to you and I'm going to title this to Glorious church so we're going to take that little phrase out of verse 27 here in Ephesians 5 that he may present it to himself a glorious church now you might want to keep those lights off if you don't mind because we're going to use this screen the whole service here and uh I'm going to go through some of this quickly because some of it's going to be very basic here but I want you to catch a couple of principles that we'll uh that we'll use here now first of all I love this little statement in 1957 when brother random talks about the promises and he's talking about the promise of healing here and he says be merciful this is his prayer be merciful and heal the sick and afflicted for in this thou has atone for it calvary and we feel it is our personal property and I love the way he speaks about the promise here he said this this promise that he's made the thing that he's done for us he said we feel it's ours we feel like God has done this for us and and it's okay for you to feel that way that God has done this for you he died on the cross for you right and and by his stripes we are healed that's us he's talking about and now father May the Holy Spirit take the word open the book loose the power of the spirit in the word and may it find its resting place in each heart for we ask it in Jesus name and I think that's a good way to approach it this morning that no matter what your need is God has a way to resolve that need he has a way to meet it and we should embrace that promise as our own personal property and don't be afraid to do that because that's why he did it and I believe if we don't do that he could say to us at the end of the road why didn't you embrace it like it was yours I I paid I paid the price for it that you can have it and it's a shame for us not to embrace it like it is ours now I want to just drop this in as well and this was just on my heart that uh you know in in this life and we've talked to parents yesterday and we talked a lot about family life and the challenges of raising a Christian family in a very ungodly world and there are lots of lots of challenges and there will be increasing amounts of challenges as we go forward but I believe this that God never allows you to go into a battle unless he knows you're prepared to face that enemy when you go into a battle it should let you know that there is a victory ahead because God does not allow you to go into battle unless you're prepared for it now you'll find in Exodus chapter 13 and it came to pass when Pharaoh had let the people go that God LED them not through the way of the land of the Philistines although that was near and geographically it is very near I've driven that path from Egypt to Israel uh in a vehicle and it is quite close to go that way but God didn't let them go that way because God said less per Adventure the people repent when they see war and they return to Egypt so in other words we're not ready to enter into that battle so God brought him around it but when God LED but God led the people about through the way of the Wilderness of the Red Sea the children of Israel went up harnessed out of the land of Egypt so they went another way God LED them another way because they were not meant to go into battle so quickly but over in Exodus chapter 17 you find then came amalek and fought with Israel and refered him and Moses said unto Joshua choose us out men go out now and fight with amalek four chapters later God says all right these folks now are ready to fight and the you know there had been things happen between Exodus 13 and exodus 17 and God says hey we now we have an enemy let's fight let's we're not going to go around this one we're going to fight it and and if God allowed them to go go face that enemy there was a way through that enemy so in the same way some of you may feel like well I'm fighting battles that's a sign that God sees you're ready to face that enemy face to face and so you shouldn't be afraid when you have uh struggles and you have enemies in your life and you have problems and so forth hey God would never have allowed that unless you were ready to face it and we should look for victory as we as we move on forward is that okay all right now I began to a little study at home uh several months ago where I was looking at this particular scripture for their shall arise false christs and false prophets and show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect and I thought wow how close is this going to come how how how close is this how false is this going to be now the best kind of Falls if that's if that's a an allowable statement the best kind of faults is really close to the truth it's really deceptive if it's really false I mean if it's if it's really going to be effective and so therefore I was wondering well what what kind of qualities do we need to possess what do we need to have to have I mean we know we had to be born again we know we had to be filled with the Holy Spirit right we know that but what what kinds of things are we going to need to have in order to navigate through a season where they're going to be false christs false prophets signs and wonders everything laid out to deceive the elect if possible it'll be so close that everyone but the elect will struggle with this in this season and so what is it that we're going to need to get through this and I began to look at that and as I as I began to study the scripture I found that uh you know there there are things that God has given to us in this age that that no other ages had access to and I realized well God knew we needed what we have in this last day and brother random says in the conduct order and Doctrine book he says we do have today by God's help the perfect interpretation of the word with Divine vindication now we all know what what Vindication is Right Vindication is God removing any doubt that this is God when God removes any doubt that this is God that's Divine vindication and that's what God did in in sending this message isn't that right do you believe that God Vindicated this message when he sent it he removed any doubt as to whether this was God or not truly I believe that God sent this message I believe that brother Branham was that Prophet that fulfilled Malachi 4. he was that individual that did that Martin Luther said and I've read this in Martin Luther's writings where he said he felt he was Malachi 4 because he was Leading the People out of the Catholic church and he felt like my Ministry could be that to turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers and you know what he made a good argument but he wasn't right it was almost right but he wasn't right because it wasn't a season it wasn't the right time for that and even though he did a great job at reforming and brought a truth to the church there had to be someone to come and when he came when brother Branham came God Vindicated that and said this is that which is spoken in the scripture and he removed any doubt as to whether this is God or not and and that is what we mean by Divine Vindication but think about this statement here either brother Branham is very right or he's very wrong one or the other there's no halfway with a statement like this there's no sort of right I mean he's telling us that we have by God's grace and God's help the perfect interpretation of the word so therefore there's nothing nothing really that we cannot know and nothing that we cannot understand correctly because God made that available to us in the last day well we know this that faith comes by hearing doesn't it and hearing by the word of God so therefore your faith had to be right you're sorry your hearing had to be right in order for your faith to be right and God decided what we were going to hear in this last day and he gave us a perfect interpretation of the word because we're actually going to leave here without death we're going to transition from here to the kingdom without death do you believe that we're going to leave here alive and I believe that God knew we needed that because that's what it was going to take a perfect faith and a you know a perfect Deliverance for the people of God so brother Branham tells us in the breach he said that the lamb broke the seals and revealed them to his church to collect his subjects for his kingdom that's the bride page 139 he says I no longer call you church I call your bride and he said he wants to and this is this is what God's actually doing now he wants to bring his subjects to him now he wants to bring his subjects to him now this is no longer moving them from one stage to another from one age to another from one truth to another this is actually we're going to shut this down we're going to take the bride home we are going to leave here now we're not going to reform this world we're not going to reform the government uh we're not going to we're not going to carry on for ages and ages now that's done that's over we are going home now we are going home now and that's that's what this is about you're not being conditioned to live here you're being conditioned to live here and that's biblical because you remember before Moses left a scene he taught the people how to live in that land while they were still in this land he gave them principles and truths that they needed to apply beginning now so that when you get there you'll realize hey the same word we live by here that's the same word we live by over there if you love God over here you'll love them over there if you love the things of God you over here you'll love them over there if you love the people of God over here you love them over there if you don't like the people of God over here you're not going to like him over there matter of fact you're probably not going to get over there to dislike him so that's what's happening and then brother random says never before in 1963 never before since the early church was the pillar of fire ever among the people and never before since the early church did they ever see the things that we're seeing today and this was made possible when God opened those seals hey he's either really right or he's really wrong one or the other and I'm gonna you know I feel for those people that bet the firm and the fact that brother Brandon was wrong and built all kinds of websites and propaganda out there that are trying to prove that he's wrong when God said no I want the whole world to know that is my man that is my prophet and this is my message and you need to understand this is not brother branham's message and this is not your message and this is not brother Sam's message I got news for you this is not even brother Sam's church this is God's church he died for this church he purchased this church and he's going to take this church and that's what's happening now he's actually taking his subjects to him now we're on the way so God is now loosening up don't you love these definitive statements of brother random they're so great he said God's loosening up the church everywhere getting in order now and got to give it rapturing Faith before it can go God is actually loosening up the church I thank God for that you know you know I think about the uh the Jews over in Russia and many years you know we were unable to uh to to bring the message in or to minister over there and Jews were not able to get out uh for many many years that happened I mean if you were if if we were living in Russia and I wanted to come to visit brother Sam's Church uh I would I would if either living in Russia under the Communist Regime before the Iron Curtain fell I would have to have applied for a Visa in order to leave my town to come here and that process probably would have taken three or four months in order for me to go if I wanted to go from here to Toledo if I wanted to leave this County and go to another County I would have had to have a a Visa issued by the Russian government and I would have had to uh write down where I left from where I was going to stay how many days I was going to stay there who I was going to be with when I went there and then the dates that I was going to return and that would take months and months to get those kinds of Visas so they were completely locked down I mean they were held tight but God in his sovereignty allowed the Iron Curtain to fall and the Soviet Union to break up so that so that two things could happen number one so that the Jews could leave and freely go back to Israel in their Homeland and also so that the message could come in and God loosened things up in order for that to happen and you know what God is still loosening things up God loosened us from drugs and from a sinful life God loosened us from denominational systems God loosened us from the bondage of this world and the ties of this world in order to set us free so that we can worship Him in spirit and in truth and he whom the son sets free is free indeed so therefore we see what God is doing now he's loosening his church because he's wanting to take them home with him and in order to do that God's given us an infallible word he's given us a perfect interpretation of the word with Divine Vindication hey we're a blessed people and and we've seen this it's been Illustrated Through the Ages here in the symbol of a pyramid from the early church to the bride age all the way to the very end and this is what brother Branham said in invisible Union the word that fell on the day of Pentecost will not work for this day that was for Pentecost thank God for that word but that's not my word that's not my message today this is for the bride the going home of the Bride this message that God sent is for the going home of the Bride do you believe that this message is for the bride leaving and we've got something different the Pentecostals represented that again he says but we're in that bright age and this is for the going home of the Bride so God in every age I I like to illustrate it this way you know I'm in illustrator uh God God sent out the message in every age as a reformer here's the message here's the here's here's what they have need of in that day and God probably watched and supervised the distribution of that over all the ages there because he was you know wanting to reach the elect and then in the last of it before the message came out God says hey hold on with that hold on with that I need to get something first before you send that out and he takes he takes rapturing faith and he says I'm going to pour that no other age gets this any all right let it go God reserved that for the last age because this is for the going home of the Bride if God had given that to every any other age they would have been raptured probably at the end of their time but God did not intend for that to happen because you needed to be here but in the last day God said I'm going to put something in that that I've not put in any other age and that's going to change their bodies that's going to get us out of here we have a perfect interpretation of the word with Divine Vindication we no longer see in part and that is literally in the Greek it means that like a jigsaw puzzle have you ever done a puzzle and at the end of it there's three or four pieces missing ah I mean it's a total failure it's a disaster even though you got everything else almost right but now that you got three or four pieces missing you're like hey sweeping aside I mean you know how you feel when you get when you do that who took these pieces of the puzzle right and what a joy it is when you find them and you put those last pieces in there oh yeah now we got it right now we got it done that's exactly what God did Through the Ages there were pieces that we never had there were parts of it that we never understood there were things that people probed at and they wondered at and they got a lot of it right and they wrote different things there and in the last day God sent a prophet who put all those loose ends together and he took a scripture over here and he took one over here and he put that together and said these go together and he took another one here and another one here he went back to Psalm 27 and he said uh you know in the time of trouble I will hide you in my Pavilion and he takes that and he brings it over here to first Thessalonians chapter four and he puts that together and said these relate to the Rapture that's what that's about and then he goes over here in Matthew 24 and he goes over to Revelation chapter 5 6 and 7 the seals and puts those things together he said it's not outside the book it's inside the book but you needed somebody to put the loose hands together and that's what we had in this last day and now we can stand back and say we got the perfect interpretation of the word with Divine Vindication you know why God did that because he loved you he loves you now Joshua said now you're going to see the glory of God for their their hung the pillar of fire over them but he said don't let it get out of sight in this part of the journey here crossing the Jordan going into the promised land he said don't let it get out of sight because you've never passed this way before and I believe he said there's an experience for the church he said to you people tonight let's move out towards Jordan and God's here leading you and that's what's talking to your heart and telling it to you is the holy spirit so he's signaling to the church you are here right prophets Orient us prophets Orient us you know how it is when you go in the mall and the first thing that you do is the first thing I do my wife doesn't need to do this but I need to do this when I go in the mall I look at that directory and I'm looking for the Red Dot right everybody know what the Red Dot is what does the Red Dot say you're here and without that without that you could be anywhere and you don't even know right you don't you really don't even know but the Red Dot helps us immensely because then we know ah if I want to go here then I I start from here right prophets bring the Red Dot and they put it on the timeline of God and they say you're here that's what prophets do because otherwise you really don't know where you are you could be in the Reformation think you're in you're thinking you're at the end time but prophets say we're here and he says now we're crossing over and he said I can see the people as they went marching on the angel took Jordan first and he said the angel will of God will lead you every step of the way what I like about this is what it doesn't say it doesn't say William Branham will lead you every step of the way you don't need to hang back and play tapes and wait for some plane to come across the country with brother Branham in it let me tell you I believe we'll see brother Branham again on this side but I believe it'll be in the resurrection but he says the angel of God will lead you every step of the way now I'll say this I say this quite honestly if God wanted brother Branham if God wanted William Brandon would be standing here in the last day to bring the bride across brother Branham would be here but he's not here because if brother Brandon was here we'd all have our eyes on him but I believe this a greater than William Branham is here [Applause] [Music] and God wanted us God wanted us to follow him by faith to follow him by faith not William Branham God wanted us to follow him by faith and he says now sometimes you think your trials are hard but he said God ain't in a hurry you're the one that's in a hurry and God let the Hebrew children go right in the fiery furnace and he let Daniel go right in the Lion's Den before he ever came but he said just rise up and start walking by faith rise up and start walking by faith and I I began to think about that and I thought well you know we have to have whatever it takes that we would not be deceived but we also have to have this kind of faith that allows us to be able to rise up and walk and we are following him who is invisible to a place we've never been that takes a that takes quite a measure of trust if if that's all right to say because we're following him we cannot see what our natural eye into a place we've never been through a channel we've never crossed before we've never been raptured we never we've never had our bodies changed right I mean I can't even lose five pounds I mean it's very hard for me to change very much at all so I want to I want to deal with this little subject of Faith here this morning just very simply all right forgive me for being simple you can put your theological guns back in your ecclesiastical holsters this morning and just follow me here in Exodus chapter 4 I found this to be an amazing little passage of scripture Moses answered and said but behold they won't believe me no hearken unto my voice for they'll say the Lord has now appeared unto thee and you know what this is in a way this is Moses kind of arguing with God I mean I don't mean to be disrespectful but God says all right Moses time to go down we're going to deliver the children of Israel hey hey hold on really uh they're not going to believe me and I thought Josh I thought why didn't God strike him dead I mean it's not a good thing to argue with God generally I mean that's not a good practice generally and he says uh no way and they were going to say all kinds of things they're going to say well the Lord didn't send you and who do you think you are and all you can't even speak right and all the other things here and and God says because God's conversing with Moses and he says what do you got in your hand I stick throw it down watch what I'll do with the stick and Moses throws it down and becomes a serpent and whoa that's pretty good because you know what God doesn't need great things to do great things I said God doesn't need great things to do great things I believe that's why he chose a lot of us brother Bill in the last day because he doesn't need great things to do great things and so he says now Moses uh picked that up and Moses picked up and now you got to watch because you got to pick up a snake by the not the working end but the other end right you gotta he picks it up and it goes back into a stick again whoa and you know what God is saying in the in the Hebrew language what God has actually was trying to say to Moses was look Moses I got this this this is not you here I got this what you need to do is trust me I I can take your stick I can turn it into this I can I can open up the Red Sea I can do I can do all things that Moses hasn't even heard of yet and God was simply assuring Moses in this conversation I got this I got your back I'm not sending you to do something you can't do that would defeat the whole purpose right but look I made a promise to Abraham and I'm here now to bring this to pass so this is not really about you this is about me using you to fulfill my promise to Abraham I made hundreds of years ago hey trust me buddy now I'd like to say this this morning and I hope you can hope you'll uh Embrace this in the right way I believe that faith and the faith we need in the last day sits on the shoulders of our trust in God it actually rests on our trusted God faith comes by hearing we believe that but you know what you'll have faith in something more when you trust the person who's telling you when you trust the source you're going to eat more easily have faith in someone isn't that right so this is that conversation and I'd like to summarize that and say this that Moses never had a problem with faith in God's existence hey he's in the presence of God he's seen God all through his life he's heard the stories of the exploits of God and all that he did up to Moses time he he's a he's a person who believes in God and I would I would venture to say that every one of us here today probably have a good solid faith in the existence of God you believe that God exists right that he's real even though we can't see him but that God is real I think I don't think we'd have any argument there and I don't think we need to spend any more time on that I think we all believe that God exists but the kind of faith I believe that God is asking us in the last day is can I trust him for me will God really do that for me I hear how God does things for prophets and for other people and might be Brother Sam you know or whatever else but you sitting there in the Pew the average person who the believer comes to church can can can I really trust him that God's going to do this for me and that's the debate if you like that's the conversation that God is having with Moses here as Moses say Lord I believe I believe your word I believe you and I believe you're real and all of that but I mean okay can I trust you to bring this to pass God says yeah you can trust me trust me some of you are looking at me kind of funny but I can handle that let's look at this let's develop this just a little bit here in the Book of Ruth chapter three this is a story of how Ruth goes to be with Boaz and she spends that night you remember sleeping at his feet and when she goes back to Naomi she's got her veil full of six measures of barley that he gave to me and she comes back to Ruth or sorry to Naomi and she said this is what he told me he'd go down empty to thy mother-in-law go back and then Naomi said to her sit still my daughter until thou know how the matter will fall for the man will not be in rest until he have finished the thing this day in other words there's nothing more now we can do Ruther there's nothing that you and I can do now to to complete this process you know what it all depends on Boaz we're looking to Boaz we've done everything we can do we've done everything we know to do and uh We've made ourselves available we've fulfilled everything we need to do but you know what this all rests on Boaz now and you know what we're going to do we're going to rest in what Boaz has promised to do we're going to rest in what Boaz is able to do and we're just gonna we're just gonna trust it he's gonna do it he's got this do you understand what I'm saying he's Naomi is assuring Ruth here this is not necessary now for you to fulfill this you can't redeem yourself you cannot uh I mean you're not you can't be a kinsman redeemer it has to be someone besides us and so therefore what you need to do is rest and I'm saying this to you this morning as the bride of Christ there's nothing more we can do to make ourselves more eternal there's nothing more that we can do to make ourselves more bride we are bribed by the choosing of God we are bribed by the predestinated plan of God he put her name in Lamb's Book of Life a long time ago and let me tell you something you know what we got to do we gotta rest in in God we've got to have trust in God that he's actually going to bring to pass what he promised me that God is actually going to take me across that River he's going to take me into that place and he's got a body for me and he's got a place for me in the lamb supper uh over on the other side and you know what you got to do bride you can't make this happen you can't speed it up you can slow it down you just got to believe that he's got it he's got your back you can trust in that does that make sense now there's a scripture in Luke chapter five brother man refers to this many times and it's it's the the scripture about putting new wine into Old bottles doesn't work don't try this at home you shouldn't have wine at home anyway else the new wine will burst the bottles and be spilled in the bottles will perish you got to match the right can I say this you got to match the right Revelation with the right age and the right people otherwise it's not going to work right because that's what wine is it's a stimulation new wine must be put into new bottles and then both are preserved now brother Branham says this about that scripture and he's using this as a teaching uh lesson here he says now people will say our school teaches different our denominations say that he said that's the old dry cowhide so that's inflexible it's dried you put something in there with life and you know what it's gonna it's gonna break that wide open and our teachers and our Pastor said these things are finished the days of Miracles are over but he said if it's a new hide and it's got new life it's flexible and it gives to the word and here it is the spirit supports that word the spirit of God supports the word of God the spirit doesn't necessarily support your point of view the spirit doesn't support the fact that you've been in the church a long time some people think well I've been around a long time I'm qualified to do this I'm qualified to say this I'm qualified to preach whatever I want hey how long does that take to get to that place I don't know about you but Sam I got my 44 year pin I've been serving the lord 44 years in the light of this message does that give me right to say whatever I want to or to feel like I have some Authority or something else you know what the spirit supports not my seniority the spirit supports the word and when you make a stand on the word the spirit will support that when your pastor obeys the word and makes changes in the church it might be like uh you know Nails on a chalkboard but the spirit will support that sometimes you as fathers and mothers you'll make changes in your house you know in relation to social media or whatever else and your kids may look at it like rubbing a cat the wrong way ever done that and you rub a cat the wrong way my goodness uh it may not be easy but the spirit will support them because the spirit supports the word the spirit does not support your point of view it doesn't support your attitude he doesn't support uh you know the amount of money that you give he doesn't so he's not saying you know what they're not they're not completely on the word but they give a lot division books so you know what I'm going to give them a pass how's that going I'm dropping these things in here because I want you to hold on to them the spirit will support the word and and he says when they when they come into a new bottle when the inspiration comes into a new bottle and say well somebody got healed the cancer last evening people will say well let me see what the doctor says and let's wait for a year from now and I can't believe it but the new hide says hallelujah to the lamb you can't put new wine into Old bottles there so the principle you always have to understand you young people that are here this the spirit is not going to support you trying to find a husband or a wife the wrong way there is a right way to go about that there's a right way for you to worship there's a right way for you to play music in the church there's a right way for you to conduct yourself in life there's a right way for you to conduct yourself in your marital relations between husband and wife there's a right way to do that and when you do those things within the confines of the word of God the spirit will support them he'll bless that but don't expect God to bless something that's contrary to the word he's just not going to do it all right now let's just take these principles now of trust here and just apply them Daniel chapter three you all know the story of the Three Hebrew children they said to the king hey we we're not we're not careful we're not worried that word in the Hebrew for careful means worry we're not worried at all to give you an answer we have an answer as to why we're not bowing to this image here even if it is our buddy if it be so God whom we serve will Deliver Us From The Burning fiery furnace and he will deliver us out of thine hand but if not be known unto the king that we will not serve thy Gods nor worship the golden image which thou has set up so we we really don't know what God is going to do here I mean that's in his hands we really just trust him but we want you to know what we're not going to do and that is that we're not going to bow to this we're not going to bow to this God and we're not going to bow out of your system of worship here so we do know that but they had no word we at least we don't know that they have uh any kind of indication that God was going to rescue them I mean the scene is pretty drastic because it says that they heated up the fire more and more and even people who were standing next to the fire dropped over dead because it was so overwhelming and God brought those three Hebrew children to the edge of impossible he brought them to the edge of impossible where now it was impossible to go forward and God said take another step is that what happened he brought them to the edge of the impossible now I mean under normal human conditions it's not possible for anybody to go any further and God says take another step and in order to take that step you know what they had to do they had to trust him they had a trust that somehow God was going to make this happen and but they were resolved in their hearts that if God did not do anything they still were not going to bow to that and they were they were winners either way because if God did something great but if God did nothing they were still winners because they'd be over in glory they never compromised at all I believe I believe that before this is all over I believe that God will bring us down to the edge of impossible and then tell the bride take another step and trust me I got your back trust me I'll see you through come on 9 11 proved to us that the world can change in a day and we've had lots of indications since then that our world is not very stable that there's all kinds of things that can happen really quickly and there are all kinds of uh you know issues in the world that can make it a very dangerous place in a very short period of time and there's a lot of people not going to have a whole lot of time to rethink things when all of that happens here and I believe when we come down to it there will be only one thing to do and that is to take that step with God to walk all the way because it may not be logical and it may not be clear like it's not logical to walk into the fiery furnace and just you know just keep walking that's not logical and it may not be logical for the bride to keep walking in the time when our bodies are about to be changed but I believe that God's not afraid to bring us to the edge of impossible and then say take another step and watch what I do take another step little bride take your leather step Ruth and just watch what I do for you and I believe that's what we're coming to and then Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said wow he said you've even you've even changed the king's word it says as you read down through this verse here you've even you've actually even changed the king's word and he says uh you know this this God that you serve is absolutely amazing um let me give you another little example here and I I love this where in in the book of First Samuel it's a story of how the Philistines are all encamped in the high place in the mountain and Saul and 600 soldiers are down in the lower part in the valley and they're over here uh you know facing that enemy and things are out of stalemate nothing no one's going nothing's happening no one's going anywhere and uh Jonathan Jonathan looks at this situation and uh he says to his armor Bearer by the way who I think is really the hero of this story he says that armor bear hey let's go let's do something and the armor Bearer says sure and he goes to it he goes with Jonathan and they're crawling along they're moving along behind the rocks and they come to a place where they're looking up at the enemy they're looking up at the Philistines they're hiding behind big rocks back there and they're looking up Jonathan says to his armor Bearer he says tell you what I'm going to do I'm gonna jump out behind this Rock I'm going to jump out and I'm going to yell at them and I'm going to say hey Philistines we're down here and if they say if they say well we're going to come down and kill you these are like dogs we're coming after you he says and we'll take off because that's a sign the Lord's not with us but but if we jump out and expose ourselves and and they say hey come up here you Israelites come up here we'll deal with you up here he said then the Battle Is Ours Victory Is Ours okay you know what the armor bear says sure he's a hero I mean he's just he's a great guy I'd love to I love doing you know I think in heaven I'm going to look for him and so Jonathan steps out and he says hey hey you Philistines up there look who it is it's us we're right here down below you and they look down they said hey come up here you Israelite dogs come on and we'll finish you off up here now the Bible says in verse 13 there that Jonathan climbed up on his hands and his feet now don't try this at home this is not how you win a battle brother Bill this is not how you this is not good strategy for taking the enemy when you're and if I if I could get up I'd get down but but it takes too long I don't have that time they're going up the hill on their hands and knees and they get to they're crawling up and they get to the top of the hill and then they stand up and you know what happens the Bible goes on and tells a story of how that they uh you know there was there was a confusion that took place and and they started to fight one another and then that got so loud that more of them started to fight one another and then the Israelites down here in the valley they looked over with their binoculars and they said hey yeah and I mean there must be some sort of enemy over there and uh you know they took off after the Philistines and the Philistines took off and the people who were hiding in the Rock Soul came out and it was one of these big confusing scenes there and Jonathan and his his armor bear are just kind of standing there in the camp and there's nobody left they're all gone and it says it took them three days to actually gather the spoil and bring it back to Israel again and the armor Bearer is just saying hey yeah well you know what I trust you it may not be logical it it may not be sensible but they came to the edge of impossible and God said go ahead and take another step and he did and when when you obey like that you watch what God will do so one of the characteristics of this glorious church is that she's obedient as a matter of fact here's what brother random says what a promise he said because of obedience patriarch Abraham 1964. what a promise he said obedience is what God wants a big church nobody says a lot of money famous preacher for a pastor nope obedience is what God wants what does God want from all of us he doesn't he doesn't want you to you know preach sermons that unscrew the Stars he does not want you to have a following he does not want you to accumulate a lot of wealth or whatever else he wants you to just simply be an obedient he wants you to have an obedient heart it was once said that obedience is better than sacrificing to obey the Lord is better than any sacrifice that you could do now a lot of times in reality a lot of times we feel like obedience is kind of a flat thing I mean it's not really a very exciting thing and a matter of fact you can think that you're in the slowest movement in the world because it may seem like nothing's happening and I'm here to tell you that's not true I believe that God is doing great things and I want to illustrate that just in a scripture here just as a footnote because remember now what God's looking for is obedience in the time of Esther you remember when she was taken back with the with the women uh the all the virgins in the land so that the king could choose a new Queen remember that story right and in her company looking after these women were just eunuchs and other women who were there were Servants of the king in other words there was no men healthy normal men allowed back there where these women were and they were back there for a period of a year they were there for a period of a year now in Esther 2 we read Esther had not showed her people nor her Kindred for Mordecai had charged her that she not showed that she was a Jew and Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women's house to know how yesterday every day he walked by maybe to get a glimpse of her because nobody had access to these women nobody could be around them at all and he walked by every day just to try to maybe see her and wave and uh you know hoping maybe he could get a glimpse of her and he did that he said to know how Esther did and what should become of her like what's happening there's nothing happening it seems like there's nothing happening here verse 12 and now when every maid's turn was come to go into the king of hazarus after that she had been how long 12 months I love the way scripture takes the mystery out of things watch she had been back there 12 months according to the manner of women you know what that means is that the king required that if he was going to have an offspring it had to be his seed and in order to prove that it was his seed he's going to isolate this woman for a period of 12 months to make sure she's not carrying another seed because within 12 months another man's seed is going to manifest itself so we're going to let these women stay for 12 months to make sure they don't have any other seed in them what is the Bible telling us you may think nothing's happening you may think well we've been all this time since brother Bam's gone and nothing's nothing's gone let me tell you what's happening God has separated the bride and if there's another seed in you it's going to come out it's going to show itself before this thing is over before we go and join him in the wedding supper if there's a Pentecostal seat if there's a uh you know a lustful seed if there's some other kind of seed that's in you in other words you've been dabbling in the world or you've been messing over here or something else you know what over time it's going to come out because that's what happens according to the manner of women do you understand what I'm saying if you want to find out whether a woman's received another seed let her sit for a year and see if anything happens and if nothing's happens now when she gets married to the king we know that the child that comes now has got to be the Kings because there's no other seed had manifested itself do you understand the point so you may sit there and think well nothing's happening I beg to differ I think A lot's happening and for you to be standing there after all of these years and just I believe the word I love the word I believe God sent a profit I believe we've got the perfect interpretation I believe I just tried to be obedient to the word of God and I've stayed right here and I've been here uh 20 years 30 years 40 years 50 years I believe you know what that's God saying to the world you look at this virgin-born bride of Christ they have not received the seed of any other system or organization or doctrine or teaching or anything else they are reserved for me and me alone God is doing a great thing in the delay in the delay that's where this happens you know what God's after he's after obedience everybody everybody okay with the whole subject of obedience everybody feel like they're relatively obedient relatively I'm not saying perfectly I'm you know I know you're all being humble and you all know when to say amen and when not to I get that but let's just throw it out to a test okay there is a story in judges 19 which I'm not going to go into because it's one of the most heinous stories in all of the Bible where a man has a concubine and she's taken and and abused and uh mutilated and it's a terrible story you can you can refer to it when you get home and it happens in the Book of Judges it was done by people in the book in The Tribe of Benjamin right and the children of Israel were under orders according to God and according to the law on Moses that when such a sin occurred in the in the land among the people they were to get that out they were to purge that sin out blessed effect the rest of the nation of Israel and cut off the blessings of God and so they knew that this is what they had to do this was the will of God this was what God told him to do aren't you glad you're not in the Old Testament the living by the sword like that I mean that's how they dealt with things in the church you know they take them out back and kill him and then move on right I'm kind of glad we're not there you should be really glad we're not there so I want you to I'm going to pick up the story now from chapter 20 and all the children of Israel went out and the congregation was gathered together as one man even from Dan in the north to Beersheba in the South with the land in with the land of Gilead and the and the Lord unto the Lord in mizpah so they they agreed to gather in the city called mizpah and the chief of all the people even the tribes of Israel presenting themselves and the Assembly of God 400 000 footmen there were four hundred thousand soldiers who were gathered now on that day and the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel were gone up to mizpah and then said the children of Israel now tell us and they asked this man who his concubine was killed they said tell us what happened and he tells the story in detail here now you got a picture of this scene I need you to picture it there's four almost a half a million soldiers who were standing there with swords and shields and everything they need in order to go to war this is serious business Judges chapter 20 verse 15 says in the children of Benjamin were numbered at that time out of their cities 26 000 men that Drew the sword besides the inhabitants of gilbeah which were numbered 700 chosen men so we have 400 000 over here and we have 26 700 over here that's the way the battle shapes up I mean duh this is not this is not rocket science here four hundred thousand twenty six thousand seven hundred eleven tribes One Tribe these guys are right they're in the will of God they're doing what the law says and we're going to purge that out of the out of the camp lest it defile the the whole camp and these people over here are being stubborn they're they're being defensive about this whole thing because they realize wow this you know some of our people are going to be persecuted or judged for this so now again this is the way that things are stacked up here in this story you can take your Bible and look at this but I've got the key scriptures on the screen here which say that on the first day this is what they did the children of Israel arose in verse 18 and they went up to the house of God they began their battle in church and they asked counsel of God and they said which of us shall go up first to the battle against the children of Benjamin and the Lord said Judah shall go up first well that's right Judah means Worship in the Hebrew language so you know what the singers and the musicians they go first they prepare everybody and they set an atmosphere for the battle so this is right and God is not saying to them don't go I did not send thee he's not saying that he's saying here's how I want you to go this is the order of the battle and he's very specific he says now Benjamin uh sorry the the musicians go those singers go and then the soldiers will go after that this is how I want you to go you know and the Bible says at the end of that day the people the men of Israel encourage themselves and set their battle again in array in the place where they put themselves in a ray the first day and the children of Israel went up and wept before I'm sorry I've missed a screen here the children of Israel went up and as they as they approached these group of benjaminites twenty six thousand seven hundred four hundred thousand at the end of that day there were 22 000 of the Israelites laying dead on the battlefield it doesn't say that any of the twenty six thousand seven hundred died but 22 000 died of the tribe of Israel over here the tribes of Israel the 11 tribes and they go home and they're looking at each other and they're all saying the same thing now God sent us God sent us tell me again what God's looking for in US obedience what God's looking for is obedience God sent us the next day the people of Israel encourage themselves and set their battle again in a ray in the place where they put themselves in a ray the first day they go back on the battlefield now the second day and the children of Israel went up and wept before the Lord until even they spent the whole day in prayer and weeping and asked counsel of the Lord saying shall I go up to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother and the Lord said go up against them are these people in the will of God I'm asking you are these people in the will of God yes they are God sent him the first day God sent him the second day it's not unclear God said go up against them and here they are going up against the children of Israel again and they're going across the same Battlefield they went the day before and they're saying ah this is where this is where uh elazar died and this is where Abram fell and this is where I picked up Joshua and picked him up and brought him back to the tent and they're going across the same Battlefield and looking and at the end of that day the Bible says that there were eighteen thousand more that died on the second day wait now did God send them yes he sent them were they in the will of God yes they were in the will of God did they have a righteous cause yes they did have a righteous cause what were they doing they were simply obeying God because that's what God told them to do but you know what they had to do now they had to plan 40 000 funerals because they had 20 22 000 and 18 000. now they have 40 000 funerals and forty thousand widows and a whole bunch of Orphans now that they had to contend with because God sent him in the battle and they were obedient and the Bible does not record anyone is lost over here on the side of twenty six thousand seven hundred you're getting quiet but I hope you're listening it's amazing it's really amazing that they went back the second day I mean it really is amazing that they went back at all the second day and asked God should we go again and then when God says they went when God told them to go they actually did go and they're not doing this insincerely folks understand me they're in the church all day praying and weeping and fasting and looking to God and saying should we go Lord direct us order our steps here now and and we will do your will if you tell us not to go we won't go if you tell us to go we will go whatever they're in the neutral place where they should be and they wait all day on God and God says go go up against them but that's not the incredible part the incredible part is the third day because on the third day to me this is one of the most Sam it's one of the most fascinating scriptures in the Old Testament then all the children of Israel and all the people went and came up into the house of God and wept and sat there before the Lord and fasted that day until even and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the Lord and the children of Israel inquired of the Lord for the Ark of the Covenant was there in those days and Phineas the son of Eliezer the son of Aaron stood before it in those days and said shall yet shall I yet again go to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother or shall we stop here think about it shall we go the first day yes sir 22 000 die shall we go to second day yes sir eighteen thousand die 18 000 die on the field and he asks again the third day they're going back in there the third day I say God give us the spirit of those men on the third day Lord give us that kind of spirit give us that kind of of determination to to do the will of God even when it doesn't make sense even when it's not logical even when it does not I mean who in their right mind is going to go back and ask God again should we go when we have 40 000 funerals to attend next week who who in their right mind would go back to God but they did because they were the people of God and I say something about the bride of Christ even when it doesn't make sense I say God give us that kind of faith that we can and that kind of trust that we can trust in God even when it doesn't make sense Lord should we go again shall we press on shall we go forward I will guarantee you that I don't believe every step from here to the Rapture will make sense but I believe it will be because we trust him I believe it'll be because we trust him and they stood there in the church after all day and and by the way they're all there I mean the Bible is very clear it uses very clear words that all the people went up and came to the house of God all the children of Israel went up there look at the first line all of them came there was not a group of them over here saying well I don't I don't mean I don't believe that Joshua was meant to lead us in the first place and I don't believe that Moses should have said this and I don't think that that's right and you know what I never got to play the piano and I don't get to sing specials and I don't do this and they got murmurs there was there was no evidence there was no talk of murmurs here they're all in church they're all doing the same thing they're seeking God in one harmonious unit here and they're all looking to God to hear what he's going to say because what matters is what God says not what anybody else says what matters is what God says and they have enough trust down deep that they're going to wait on him to hear what he has to say now today is a new day today we're going to go back to church today we're going to ask them again we're going to do because you know what we're in the will of God we know what's right we're standing for a righteous cause we have the word be beside us here we don't have God discouraging us we have God telling us to go and you know what if nothing else if nothing else we trust him I I never knew it would be like this but I trust God we never knew we'd have a pandemic you know what we all had to do besides pastors they had to become Ministers of Health but we had to trust God for that didn't we we never tell me what made sense in the days of the pandemic tell me what was sensible no one was making sense but you know what to me the bride of Christ we're not depending on the department of health or a government or something and no disrespect I'm not being disrespectful here you know I thank God for good doctors and all the rest of it and now you know all of that but you know what during the pandemic I believe probably for the bride of Christ our trust increased in God and Lord you know what the only way we're probably really going to get through all of this because we don't know what tomorrow holds but we trust you now when we look back at it that's really been our success isn't it that no matter what happened no matter what goes wrong in our lives no matter what happens in in life no matter what life brings you and no matter what happens in our countries and in other countries of the world there's a brine sitting there that says this doesn't make sense and it sure ain't pretty I mean we got 40 000 coffins stacked up over here but Lord I trust you that's a testimony of the Bride that's the testimony that's who we are we are a people who trust God that glorious Church trusts God and Phineas stands there and he simply says shall we go again Lord if you say no we'll stop here and we'll mourn those that are gone but if you say go Lord we're going to go and he's standing in the center of the church and they fasted and prayed and wept all day and you know what God says the Lord says go up for tomorrow I'll deliver them into your hand tomorrow the victory is yours tomorrow is going to be a different day at the end of the day tomorrow is going to be a different day but you know what they didn't know it would take three days they didn't know and it was going to take that long they didn't know that that's the way that it was going to come out they didn't know that 40 000 of their comrades would die in the will of God they didn't realize all of that was going to happen but you know what brother Branham tells us this very carefully and if you don't take anything away from this weekend take this away obedience is what God wants obedience is better than sacrifice and to obey the Lord is better than any sacrifice you could do you may feel like you want to travel the world and be a missionary you want to give out books or you want to give money or you want to do something else or start your own church or whatever else listen there's nothing nothing as important to God as your heart in obedience and in sync with God and trusting him for the next day whatever you do wherever life takes you and whatever the spirit of God indicates that you're to do you do it obeying God do it trusting God and I'll tell you that's how it's going to come out right that's what God's looking for in this glorious Church he's looking for a spirit of obedience and a humble heart that he can use he can mold he can change and that's what God's looking for we're not commissioned to figure it all out we're not we're not commissioned to make all the Mysteries more plain than what they are or you know whatever else we're not we're not commissioned to come up with a new message we're not we're not commissioned to make another profit rise up here or something else you know what we're commissioning to do is to believe what God has said is going to come to pass we're trusting in that we're trusting in that every day that we go forward even when it doesn't make sense even when God brings us to the edge of impossible and says take another step go ahead just take another step and watch what I do trust me and let me lead you here brother Graham said at Abraham believed it and that's a believer Abraham said Abraham believed it that's a believer let me say it again Abraham believed it that's a believer you know what believers do they believe that's the best thing they do we may not do a whole lot of other things well but Abraham believed it that's a believer May the same faith that Abraham had made rest upon us tonight and how are you going to do it Lord he never asked the question Abraham didn't sit there with Sarah and say now look how are you feeling and let's kind of Google this let's figure it out how's God going to do it well it's going to be a full moon or whatever hey he didn't do that they didn't ask they never asked the question how's God going to do it they only the thing that registered was God said it's going to come to pass we are going to heaven Isaac and he's going to stand here one day and I will tell you what Abraham said that's going to happen he didn't ask the question he didn't sit there and argue with God he just believed it because that's what believers do God said he would do it and not settle it for Abraham are you ready this is coming into that third pool I don't see anywhere where and I don't know I'm not saying that God won't do this but I I kind of have a feeling that uh we're not going to be people who are speaking squirrels into existence and speaking things out of existence because if we had the power to speak people out of existence the church would probably be half full and that's not what God's after at all that's not what he's interested in you know what we just believe that it's possible With God all things are possible Right we're coming now to that Perfection because the people has to come to this in order for the Rapture and and and and that's what that's exactly what uh I believe is is the if you like that's what's happening in the season that we're in here now the bride is being matured and brought to a place where hey God said it we're not asking the questions about how God's going to do it we're not debating about whether it's going to happen this way or that way you know what if God said it it's going to come to pass because that's what believers do that's what believers do friends obedience is what God wants obedience is what he's after to obey the Lord is better than any sacrifice you could do foreign sorry to have kept you so long I I just I think about that glorious church this glorious church is not going to be the most beautiful or the biggest or fancy is kind of not in our binocular wealthy popular no but if we're characterized by only one thing Let It Be obedience where people who trust God we obey God we believe that whatever God says that's what's going to happen we're not going back on that that's that's what believers do and we're believers do you know that little course Falling In Love With Jesus the best thing I've ever done falling in love with him and just just walking with him every day every day we're walking with the King well I mean what a what a beautiful place God has brought us to like Esther he brought her to a place where hey we know the purity of this woman we know we know the sanctity of this woman here we know that if she brings forth a son that's going to be a son of the king God has brought us to this place where hey we're not interested in all kinds of other stuff out there we're interested in in the word of the king we're interested in his Fellowship we're interested in his embrace we're interested in his love and his word that's what we're interested in so we're going to fall in love with Jesus here this morning let's

your purpose in this very last day Lord I believe you're going to have a people that are in line a people that are in harmony with you Lord not asking a bunch of different questions that really don't matter but Lord there are people who are willing to obey even when it doesn't make sense facing the impossible is not a challenge for us Lord because with you all things are possible and there are no Impossibles with God there are no incurables with God there's no situations Lord that are too great for thee and Lord there's no battle we face that you have not led us to and so in the name of Jesus Christ I commit the people now into your hands and I ask and pray Lord that you would just give us that willingness to obey the willingness Lord to walk in harmony with you Lord even in the face of danger even in the face of disappointments Lord in the in the times Lord when we don't really fully understand Lord I pray you give us a spirit of those men on the third day that went back to the temple again of themselves with a willingness Lord to do whatever you told them to do father give us that kind of a spirit that kind of a willingness to face the future it's easy for us to say in our church here that we obey and and we agree and everything else Lord but when it comes down to the real matters of life when it comes down to the real situations we Face Lord and some of them can be very tight and very difficult father we want to obey you with all of our heart even in the not so easy times I pray Lord you would take a simple thought Lord and may it just drop in the hearts of the people that that you truly are a God we can trust and faith rests on the shoulders of a quiet trust in you we depend upon you Lord and ask son that you would bless the balance of our time here and

what he says where is where he's [Music] always [Music] amen can you say Amen to the word of the Lord amen what a comfort for the Holy Spirit would minister to our lives I think that's one thing that God not only said it but God manifested that even in this hour of even in his choosing it has brother Berry even started with that God doesn't need great things to to do great things all God needs is yielded vessels that's all he needs yielded vessels and vessels that's yielded to his voice I think how God made that so clear even when it doesn't make sense but we trust him it's learning to trust him to trust his voice not our feelings because our feelings will lie to us I feel this way I feel that way I feel this way this is an age of feelings right everybody's got their feeling and that's automatically with a feeling what that must be the leading of the Lord because I feel this way no there might be a change in temperature might be indigestion see every must come back to the word of God and sometimes it's not that there is a scripture that says not to do this or to do that sometimes where you have to go back to is the very character of Christ himself and judge it by there looking at our motives looking at our objectives and you know we look at many things you know all of us would alter out this building every life there's things that no doubt you're praying for asking God for you're wanting to see Lord I want to see more of you in my life the greatest compliment and the greatest thing we can do is to obey what he has said do there would have never been any fire come down on Mount Carmel Elijah was God's Prophet but it wasn't going to come because he was God's prophet that's not why God came God came because he had spoke to Elijah and when Elijah's everything when it came down to it what invited the fire was Elijah was able to tell God I have done all of this according to Thy Word Elijah was able to say I was I've obeyed by your grace that has let me know how to walk and prepare myself so that the fire can come amen see God only comes where he's invited and you think one of the greatest invitations the greatest thing is obedience simple obedience isn't that wonderful and it's something that goes to see just like in a service like here today it goes beyond just just right right here we see that in each service each moment it's that word coming in and it's a valuation going on in our life is that your desire I I if if I leave the word here and that's where it ends right here and I walk out of here and I say man that was a good service and I walk out of here and that's it then I have failed to do my part because God just didn't want me to come here this morning and amend the word of God but he wants to be the Amen in me and that this word because there's a lot of things you know we can we can look at ourselves and everything seems pretty good but if we let the word continue to examine Our Lives are you with me we let the word continue to examine Our Lives say God I just want to be more pleasing to you if there's anything that's out of line let this word just continue to comb through my life and God it's that's God's molding it's God leading us it's God moving and that's his desire operating and US responding back to it I tell you that is very very precious you know what's precious is to have a heart that looks back to God and says yea Lord because we're living in an age that tells God has rejected him I don't need you I don't need anything else to do with you all I need is church but the people of God says Lord I need you I need you Lord without you everything else is meaningless amen don't you love him this morning amen what a what a what a word from the Lord and how we just think amen thank God for his for the word that has been delivered Amen to our hearts this morning and I just want to remember the service this evening here at five o'clock for the youth meeting and invite each and every one of you back and um I know there'll be others that are coming in as well so you know what a wonderful day this is a day that um I just look at it my wife and I were talking about the other day and I said you know what it is it's just another opportunity to be in the presence of the Lord man I think that's that's pretty awesome another opportunity to be in God's presence and I just I so enjoy that the presence of the Lord amen so let's just bow our hearts in a word of prayer amen as we're being dismissed heavenly father as we just want to say thank you Lord this morning oh God your word is so Lord precious Lord as David could describe it it is a lamp unto my feet and Lord we desire God to make footsteps Lord where the light has shown father you Delight only shows upon the steps that we must take presently and that we will take those steps presently then Lord that same light as it leads us step by step by step of the way until we stand on the other side oh God we want to be like as it was described when we think of Joshua and Caleb Joshua type of the end time leader a type of the Holy Spirit and Caleb a type of the believer that's staying true to the word and we look Lord at what Caleb means his name means a dog and I think of it oh god of how Lord within that the simpleness it wasn't just speaking of a gentile but I believe it was speaking of the simpleness of obedience oh God help us Lord that in everything Lord that God in the even Lord for it's been the smallest things that you take Delight in Lord in the details and we ask oh God that Lord just as Esther was being prepared in that moment Lord oh God May Our Lives Lord in that preparation in that moment Lord where father all as we read in other writings of where Lord all of the stench of where they maybe would have come from throughout the land was Lord he was being also worked out of their pores and then oh God that time of purification then when Lord all of the myrrh and everything was added that God he would everything would be just right Lord for that moment but how beautiful Lord this morning this Lord even that other part that you placed in there thank you Father for your mercy Lord may we be Lord if we the other examples Lord how we've ministered on them Lord we've heard him spoke on but that today Lord in judges 20. Lord I just raised my hands Lord God and throughout this congregation that's the kind of Lord believer I want to be Lord we preached on Genesis 22 Lord that that was a reoccurring theme Lord in the prophet's message many times but Lord that in judges 20 as we see that that even when it doesn't make sense Israel continued to go they were perfectly in the will of God 22 000 and 18 000 fell but they trusted you Lord trusted you enough Lord to say should we go up again Lord oh God that is how we want to be Lord is when things don't make sense when it's contrary to our feelings or our thinking but lord it's under your leading and with the word that's our desire Lord that's our desire help us Lord I believe it's that simple as a an example that Lord you spoke here that maybe doesn't stand out would not have stood out to be ministered on a lot within that thought but you pointed it out today and letting us see it's these things right here that matter the most help us Lord I pray in the name of Jesus Christ be with your people Lord watch over us and bless the upcoming service this evening can you say praise the Lord amen don't you enjoy that I tell you I really really that in judges 20 I really really enjoyed that it's what I say God that's the kind of believer I want to be that's the kind of person I want to be God bless you amen Shake hand to one another five o'clock Amen to see me all the way I'm going all the way yes I'm going all the way with the Lord for I've made my decision and I'm going all the way [Music] I made my choice [Music] [Applause] [Music] all the way I'm going all the way yes
