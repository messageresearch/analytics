whoa [Music] Oh [Music] holy Oh blessed be the name of the Lord amen we certainly want to just read each and every one of you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and I just want to say we so appreciate all of the prayers and your support yesterday in the service that we had there the memorial service for brother herb and I certainly there was a lot of many things that we could say at that time and her brother herb that was not it was something that we all want when it comes down to if broad carries and our crossing we want our life the funeral to have already been preached it makes it very easy because then when that is when it is done in that manner then it's remember when the Holy Spirit has come into our life he's come for a purpose and that is to anoint the word in our life that it might be expressed jesus said that all men would know that you are written epistles of me Paul would say that that revelation that's in our heart in our heart but God has put in our heart that same revelation has been preached and as moved into the body so it's it's God that is working in our lives and let me just say it clearly just as much as we can take examples in the scripture of the different ones of Gideon of David on and on remember they were mortal men subject to like passions such as we are what it is we take confidence in is that a mortal that even those who were looking and living under a sacrifice by revelation looking unto that sacrifice which was to come but yet they live in the victory of by the revelation that was given to them in that time they were also missiles that we can take and weakens point out the gospel living in their life and that's a blessing this is the same thing that within our lives we want our lives to be that of written epistles we are where we're not as we say Gideon did this Daniel did this Paul did this we want to be able to have our name there because it's not us that's doing it the excellency is not of us the excellency is of the power of God that dwells inside these earthen vessels so we're not glorifying flesh we're glorifying God but as to show that the same God that is Jehovah of the hold is Jesus of the new the same God in the past is the same God in the present you'll be if there is a tomorrow there's another hour so we we take those times in that moment there's a life that has been lived here before us and we thank God for the testimony of Jesus Christ through the life of brother herb so much that he has meant to us as an assembly as for many just as the Lord would allow allowed us to do for brother Bill and sister Mary and be able to point that out they didn't ask me to do that but I think it's fitting in those times and even with brother herb I was just really being pressed in that way because there are things that these were lives and when I look at it you you you brother's going to be seated just a moment there's not a whole lot it's just a couple of brothers that are here but the thing is is that when we look at it I just was just really meditating on the things because if you watch the funeral yesterday you hear the things that was brought out about brother herb ancestor Joe together because they were one in that vision and that that burden and I believe that's an example from that and that I had preached not only from ecstatic to those examples that I see but from the experience in my heart you want to be united to be married to someone who shares the same passion in the things of the Lord when you're not gonna marry you know my wife didn't marry somebody was perfect she didn't marry somebody that only that you know as always maybe the you know everything is just easy here and there and neither deny we are we are different people but God put us together and within that it's the same thing that God it's together we are helpers together to serve the purpose of God in this earth and that's the real blessing and so when we see that I look at how God put things together like a great puzzle I was thinking we're brother Bill and sister Mary if you took brother Bill and sister Mary and you took brother herb and sister Joe and you tried to look at them you would say well there's certain things brother Bill and sister Mary did and brother herb and sister Jo it wasn't exactly in in that manner but you see when you look at the Tabernacle in the wilderness not everybody had Onyx stones not everybody had goats hairs not everybody had the deal him nope not everybody had Jasper not everybody had Onyx not everybody had those but who had him when the vision came remember Moses was caught up in that cloud in the vision and when he came and unfolded that vision there remember it was to make a place for the coming of the Lord that his coming might come right among them by his presence and when that happened then we find that the people the what God had already placed in their hearts then under that vision that inspiration that's coming out it releases what is in there and you just find places just coming into its position this is why brother Bram would tell us in God's gifts always find their place he spoke of how that each one of those kings coming from the different places and they were walking under the vision and of Revelation that Daniel had expressed to them when Daniel was there and they were coming and how that they brought their gifts and every one of their gifts go all three of them were different but all three of them came together for one purpose and that was to glorify the Living God that was in their myths and that's the same thing when I look at this of how God puts a body together it takes God to put a body of believers together it takes God to keep us in harmony with him and harmony with one another because we realized the enemy is always at work to try to break harmony trying to break unity and the Satan is always at work and we can never ever let down our guard upon that but I think that it's just such a a great a blessing when I look at that and there's many that you know that where I can speak of these things but some that I have that the Lord has just inspired on my heart these were not just pillars in the Assembly where as solid foundation and others can look to in their lives and see Jesus Christ solid people but it's also those that were part the foundation they were right here within the the vision and the burden really from the beginning God putting things in their hearts to do and I know there's many when I I think of it over the time it's getting fewer and fewer those that were of the original ones that were here and we never we never we would be we would be hon when trying to find the words we would be completely wrong if we tried to feel somebody else's shoes but to remember it's God who gives the burden and the God who gave the burden God's work God will always give the burden and he gives the strength for the work to continue on until he comes and so I think God when I you know I think God when I think around and I think these things have to be expressed at times we need to know it's not lifting anybody up but it's for a you and I if any of you have not taken in that consideration and asked Lord what would you have me do let me say this first of all first of all make sure before you ask him what you would have me do make sure that you know it is him that is in you that's the first thing the first thing God would have you to do is surrender your life let him be the lord of your life because you just don't want to be a worker because salvation is not based on words Redemption is not based on words the love of God is not released to us based on words but we want to have that real faith that living reality on the inside and then as that moves in our hearts remember the same God that moves in our hearts is the same God that Commission's us and directs us to be able to fulfill whatever purpose that he has called us to and that in itself will be even an expression if Paul would express it in different places of that it is Christ that's working within us Paul would say he worketh in me mightily there are times that no doubt that for every one of us there's times where you when God has put a burden in your heart there's times the flesh doesn't feel like doing it but when God puts a burden there the it there is something that is greater than all flesh and it prevails there's always the the pressure and the things that come around it like we know and brother branham I I read in the different places in the message where brother Branham himself he was gonna call up to Chicago and he was just going to let brother Bo say no I'm not gonna be able to make it and brother Branham I'm just reading this in the message this week brother Branham he he finally he said you know there was just a war going on and he said what I what finally is he said it dropped he said that inner man on the inside it said but you told brother bulls a you would be there and so brother Branham said I just got in he left after midnight it's so pressing you know he was settled in during the day I'm not going but after midnight they kept moving in his heart you see what it was it was God moving because there are no that would be people who would be there brother Branham was the channel it was not brother Branham that that moved to heal them our healing was already done before the foundation of the world Calvary just just allows even the further expression and bringing that real to us that's what the message of the hour come to do is unfold the revelation of Jesus Christ where where the vultures and buzzards had picked it away and picked away the original sacrifice but God in this hour in the promise of his word there is a son of Baberaham a seed of Abraham that rises up and through a rushing mighty wind it comes down and shoes away the vultures and the revelation of Jesus Christ is restored to the Church of the Living God so this these sometimes those battles and the things that we go through yet you find that what it is God it's God's purpose being served and worked out in our life and and every one of us there's not there's no big eyes there's no little use and so I want to say you know for each and every one of you please continue to keep the Keithley family in prayer sister Rita and and and those keep them in prayer and we just want to say we love you and we we certainly miss each and every one of you we've just with my heart I I miss I mean the anointing has not been any less when I've been ministering or preaching the word as a matter of fact it's been a very great anointing that has come down in these services here but I I miss seeing you and even even in the part of not just you sitting in pews but I just missed the part of what we're able just to set and talk and and fellowship and just to see that's the thing that is in my heart to me if it's the hardest thing the hardest thing is not about that I can't go to a restaurant and anything else that that's not it at all it's not that my coffee shops not open that you know those things are not in what it is at all it's the people of God and that's truly where my heart is at and I think I think God that we have a great provision and I want to admonish you as it as an assembly there are things that have already been reading over different things of certain guidelines the government and different things they're putting out and just trying to find the leading of the Lord looking at some of those things but I want you and I want I want you to be very much in prayer and I want you to be very much in prayer and and be wise about this I want you to be in prayer that God would inspire them to come up with a treatment a vaccine and you say why would you say that well we know that all healing comes from the Lord but I want you understand there's people that would never come to a place and ask prayer and even if we did say the Lord Jesus Christ he heals all our diseases they would say I don't believe in that but God in His love would still provide medicine and yet it's not the medicine that heals you see even for the atheist who doesn't believe in God life is the healer in his body it's already there it's already standing there there's already testimonies even of the atheists or infidel that gets sick and it gets a cut and then it's in and then it is restored what is that that's a testimony you don't have to look at a tree don't have to look at birds don't have to look at nature it's right there in his life if he only can recognize it life is the healer but we know that these things that I've asked you to pray for and I remind you brother Branham was very thankful when they came up with the salt vaccine for polio he thanked God for it because of all the death that had been going on brother Branham would also tell us he said the doctors are God's agents he would also go on to tell us within there of how that he prayed every day he said for medical science and for cure I'm saying these things like this because sometimes these aren't quotes and statements that every that that can be said but you know what those statements are not any statements that lessen faith faith is that you know where you're standing faith is not something we're trying to put on a show or prove to somebody it's where we know where we're standing and so brother Branham would say that he would pray that that would move because why when we're looking at this here without them having some ground the government's and the other agencies and others other things you find that some of these restrictions and tightening and all those things it some of it will not be loosened and relaxed and I want you to keep in mind as a congregation you know where I've stood you know what I've ministered here and I admonish every one of you don't try to link quotes and things together if God hasn't entrusted you to handle the word in that way then don't try to do it just be a simple Christian believing the Lord loving the Lord and watching for God's word to come to past because as long as we're here remember we're not praying for Sodom we are praying that God would relieve lot out of Sodom judgment is here are you with me see this is what the wisdom and the understanding of the love the revelation of Jesus Christ it does it's not just an unfolding of of their of just of doctrine and Justin it unfolds the very nature of Jesus Christ and that was one of the things that the Prophet would speak in 1962 the message all things he said that the coming and the opening of these seals he said what will it do it will unfold the very nature of Jesus Christ to us and that's exactly what the opening of the seals have done it has unfolded the very nature of Jesus Christ who is the true atonement who is our Passover lamb so much has been said I've not even begin to preach yet this morning but I just wanted to share those things with you I have just a great a burden upon my heart that we would pray with in that manner I've been talking with different ones that here among us that have worked some of the brothers that work with in the medical field checking on them asking how they're doing because I know they're in the front lines they're seeing these things every day they're having to go in upon these things dealing with cases and so forth so we want to continue to remember each and every one in prayer and our faith and our confidence is in the Lord Jesus Christ I believe with all my heart that's soon and very soon we're going to see the king amen you know you might say a person could say but Samuel they were saying that 25 years ago but it's closer amen our salvation as Paul would say in Romans 13 our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed amen Abraham you were saying that same thing 23 years ago but I'm closer now hallelujah oh my in the Lord wonderful amen well we we just want to say we love you I I just we really just miss you I can't I just can't wait to be able to see each and every one of you and we just want to come around the the word of the Lord this morning and just to see and and look that God would speak to our hearts we've got with we have have needs in our lives and some of these things that we're going to speak on here this morning and we're going to read I feel I feel in my heart that these very things as we move in on this a little bit it's great it's very pertinent to the moments that we are in the gospel is always relative because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever but when I look within these times and situations and I just meditate upon many of these things that I've had before me here over the months and I thought now God is just it opens to where to speak on this but I believe this morning if the Lord will help us you will see and I trust you would inspire it to your heart I trust that if there's any life that doesn't know him you will be so compelled in your heart to surrender your life to the Lord let him become the lord of your life and I trust that for each and every one of us that within the challenges that we are facing and will face that this message would be a message of direction it would be a comfort it would give us leadership for even those things that we are currently facing and will be facing so without any further ado here this morning I'm just going to read scripture and it's just out of Ephesians chapter 6 we are dealing with that of the whole armor of God the admonition of the Spirit of God from the Prophet he when he expresses the thought in the Philadelphian church age Jesus comes in the time of trouble and right after that that particular paragraph he goes in to say let us hold fast those things which he has given behold I come quickly and remember he said take unto you the whole armour of God use every weapon that he's given us and use every gift that he's given us verse 17 of roman of ephesians 6 and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God heavenly father we look to you this morning we ask that God that you would come and just anoint our hearts and ears to hear your word is already anointed Lord we just ask that God that you would come and make it alive or God and and just unfolding to us Lord those very things that we have need of and may we recognize God your presence may you visit every home visit every heart Lord visit every life we pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen we want to look at that thought and take the helmet of salvation now we've looked at this a few different services now and it's been very much spread out and but I want to just move into this here and the Lord will help us try to close this part of it up here this morning if we could say it like that you find that Paul where we had been the last time Paul was dealing with where as children of light versus that of within darkness and and Paul would write of this of the coming of the Lord and he would write it within this manner and say in first Thessalonians five six therefore let us not sleep as do others that means be slothful we're and even in our minds everything just yet is kind of numb you're not awake to the awake to the realization of what is among us but let us watch and be sober this is these are things we've got to be intentional about for they that sleep sleep in the night and they that be drunken are drunken in the night and there's a darkness that's upon this earth now it's a darkness like it was in the time of Goshen where it said it was a darkness that could be felt you can feel the powers of darkness that are around us but he says let us who are of the day see the Spirit of God in our hearts it is the Herald it's heralding them the day straw has arose in our heart it's heralding there is a new day dawning let us who are of that day of the revelation of Jesus Christ walking because of his appearing to us he says be sober that means be calm collected in your mind putting on the breastplate of faith and love and foreign helmet the hope of salvation for God hath not this is where look at this for God hath not appointed us to wrath that's not our destiny but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ who died for us that whether we wake or sleep we should live together with him if I could summarize those scriptures in one verse it would or in one statement it would be of this expect victory and there is no losing or lost to a believer because in Christ there is no loss so we expect victory so just as we are to walk from faith to faith that's how God's righteousness is revealed just as the the the word is unfolded by the Spirit of God from glory unto glory so in our lives are we to walk from victory unto victory and these are things that we realize as the admonition by the Spirit of God we are not saying it in terms that we can just be careless about it no you see that in the land when Joshua and them went in the land the very moment they got a little relaxed got a little careless didn't check things with the word the way they ought to they end up making peace pacts with people that they should not have made peace pacts with they got a little relaxed and got well we don't need everybody for AI well we don't if they forgot in a minute you didn't feat Jericho because you had a great number of people God came on the scene and moved down for Jericho you see sometimes it's our own the fresh man around us where you sometimes we can get so confident yet it's we know it's God moving through us but let us always remember God moved through us because we were able to get out of the way it's not because we were doing we were doing it we were conscience I need to decrease so the Scriptures go on within this a victory and I'm just going to run through or read now some scriptures and I want you to take these things and let them be compiled as as admonition in your heart in John 16:33 here is the Lord Jesus here on just some time before his departure he says um these things have I spoken unto you that in me you might have peace in the world you shall have tribulation it's a paradox in that you're in the midst of tribulation but yet you're in him in peace it's a paradox but be of good cheer ah notice I have overcome the world now that same eye that was welling there behind the veil now expresses John 4:4 here of God little children and have overcome them because greater stronger mightier is he that is in you than he that's in the world in 1st John 5 for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith remember without faith it's impossible to please God God works on our faith but the random would say it in different times he says let God coming up a rate on your faith and raise it to the level it needs to be remember it is our faith jesus said I'm for the healing be it unto you according to your faith you see he comes to strengthen our faith lifts up our faith and so it is now his faith that moves behind our faith brother Branham would say he said when you can get your faith and my faith he said and then we can get an agreement then he said the faith of God will move behind our faith and will bring the results this is where the results as Paul would write in Galatians 2:20 I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not i but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God it's important now he didn't live a different life but now it's different by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me in Philippians 4:13 I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me Romans 8:37 nay and all these things we are more than conquerors gaining a surpassing victory through him that loved us Hebrews 10:23 let us hold fast the profession of our faith that word faith there is the same word hope of salvation the same word hope it's that of an expectation where we have received a deposit there and the faith is looking and saying it's already mine and so there's an expectation so let us hold fast the profession of our faith which it's the word hope that's actually used there in the Greek without wavering for he is faithful that promised who is he is now in that scripture that we read and take the helmet of salvation brother Brandon would pick this up in greatest battle ever fought and he says now that's the mind in here the head it covers over the head that's what the helmet does he says now how are you going to let this helmet it's a protection what is a helmet made out of brass and I want you to take these things will be moving upon these here a helmet is made of brass brass can't even be tempered it's hard harder than iron brass speaks of judgment there's got to be something of the protection in our lives that's stronger than anything greater is he my dear is he stronger if he that is in you a brass a brass headpiece the salvation knowledge of knowing this this is not knowledge as far as just facts but it's a knowledge of knowing this knowing means by experience the Greeks look at knowledge and want me to say Gentiles look at it it's accumulation of facts that will never do it's got to be unknowing knowing meaning has it is wrote there and express that thought of knowledge among that of the Hebrews of the Jews is to be one know something only when it becomes a practical at working in their life that's what the knowledge we're speaking of we we wreck it's got to be something that we know down on the inside knowing this my healing comes from God my salvation comes from God my experience matches his word not the church's idea the word and man he said you know covered over with the protection the helmet of salvation its deliverance why would you need deliverance because we come into situations time and time again we need deliverance in trials and tests Paul we remember we we ministered on this the last time Paul never in the ship Paul was in tests and trials in the prisons three different times he was there in in situations arising but God brought deliverance and Paul would bring it to such a place he didn't name off the name he said he delivered me out of the mouth of the lion and he that delivered me shall also deliver us see as a believer and once you've been delivered how can you not expect a difference because you make which you have received that of the new birth and the Holy Ghost has accepted you you have received the paramount of deliverance it is by that deliverance that you expect every other deliverance because you realize that though we walk in this world I'm not of this world and the forces and the pressures that we face around us this is supernatural and we need the supernatural God in our lives that gives us strength and to expect delivered I no matter what the situation looks like we look to the Lord your deliverance notice what he says now take that take what knowing this then go marching forward oh that's what we're supposed to do so this reality of the Living God as a helmet of salvation you see it's not just about knowing the word we need to know the promises of God that belong to us there's certain things I remember when years ago about eight years ago or so or seven whenever it was it went down there and I had purchased a car and around the cat in there after an area a used vehicle and I went in and you know to me it was I was looking at at the price with the price that I wanted and then where the mileage was at and the guy handed me a little key fob and on that key fob well I know one unlocking lock means I know okay this I could see it says open the trunk got that what's this little button up here and the guy looked at me he said here let me have it so he took it and he walked right over there and stood at the window and he he said now watch this he beat the horn twice in a row and then he pressed on that button and it came on I said you mean that has an auto starter on it now for me you know I was teaching school at the time and that was a great blessing in the wintertime because I could look right out my window and go dig deep room started up so for me I didn't know I had it I could have been looking at something but I needed somebody to take something that was already there and make it real to me that's why we need the operation of the Holy Spirit this is why the Prophet would take such tests such pains and I and I'm saying it was brother branham's huh his will but I'm saying God moved him to instruct in the revelation of Jesus Christ to say you need to pray for revelation more than anything else he said if it seems to be beyond you look up and ask God for it we are meant to walk by revelation so it's where these things are made real to us and this is why that you and I the pulsations that move within our heart is that his salvation is perfect and complete he is my deliverer no matter the circumstance or the obstacle even when I cannot see I have victory come on now he doesn't say let the redeemed of the Lord read so let the redeemed of the Lord think so let it said let the redeemed of the Lord say so this is why Paul would go on and say for the son of God Jesus Christ who was preached among you by us even by me in Sylvanus and timotheus was not yay and nay but in him was yay now what should catch this now not yay or nay the real gospel of Jesus Christ does not say ya hear and nay over here yeah this is a real promise and I don't know about this that gospel doesn't do that and if the gospel be in you that same life and you will not say ya hear and nay over here but within you it says yay and amen amen this is what we're talking about with the helmet for all oh say it right there in your living room all the promises of God in him are yay and in him Amen unto the glory of God by us God helps to prove his word he can't prove it through unbelievers or make believer he proves it through believers and every time God proves his word it is where the odds if I could say that word are stacked against the believers they are odds where people would say whoo-hoo-hoo just oma just cover your eyes it's going to be over in a moment home ah there ain't no way this will be able to take place that's how God loves to move and work in situations that is absolutely impossible for that of us as mankind but this is where God loves you know he loves to show his power and his love to you and I you know this is why that God he tells us He loves us and we should believe that we should be resting upon that but as brother Branham would tell us he said he said he he loves to get us in those places where he can tell us and show us he said because he loves to show his love and his power to his people because he's not a show-off he knows that his people love him love to see him working notice Paul would go on in second Corinthians 2:14 and Paul's testimony said thanks be unto God which always causeth us to triumph in Christ and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place the Savior that I'm here it is it's coming forth it's coming to pass the word is working within the word is virtuous remember the word is not a doctrine the word is not a letter the word is the person of Jesus Christ are you with me so you recognize this so it's just like when a person says well I've been born again if you've been born again and you make that declaration then what you are saying is my life is identified the anointed word of the hour come on now that's exactly what the Holy Ghost comes to do it comes to anoint the word for this hour and make it live and we are a part of that word so this where Paul would say that it is God thanks be to God which causes us to triumph in Christ your defeat there's no defeat you say well brother Samuel um you know so-and-so uh passed away or so-and-so died in that defeat we're not kept from death we're kept in death yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil oh glory and Joshua chapter 1 and let's blade these things to heart now gwon is instructing Joshua Joshua has heard these things you read in the Book of Numbers you read in the book of Deuteronomy Deuteronomy these statements strong and courageous and courage these things are mentioned in multiple chapters because you will know why this was the heart of the message that came when God met Moses their God never changed the message the Commission has never changed Joshua was only the further unfolding of the word that now had been spoken through Moses Joshua is the one that moves on the scene to perform there in a body ministry the word that has went forth now is to be unfolded as sons and daughters of God are coming into their inheritance and position in the land though different in our temperaments and makeups and how we perceive in our angle and perception on things but yet in Christ in Jesus Christ we are positioned in our inheritance and it's Joshua that unfolds and divides out to us it is him that releases to us our allotted portion girl repeater garden boss Philip region verse seven only be thou strong and very courageous courageous then thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee turn up from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest you forsake the word you forsake victory you forsake the word you forsake the strength and the courage that comes with the word that's exactly right before you can ever receive the lie of the devil you must first turn down the truth this book verse 8 of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth I want you to catch this from how I can't dwell on this one here a lot but it goes from buck to mouth are you with me the word that had been delivered the word that was spoken that had come in book now that word is not to depart out of thy mouth what is it he's saying let what's in the book become fresh in you you become a spokesman this should stay on today but now notice this is where it comes in notice notice but thou shalt meditate therein day and night how do I get the word in my mouth it's gotta be in your heart first as a man thinketh in his heart so is he are you it's me you first you've got to take the word in and let that word be anointed meditate on it dwell on it you know brother battle I'm a witness of this and so when I you know heard this over the years brother man said you go to thinking on him he said he steps right out just like he did on the road to emmaus and it can be a little something from your devotional something from the service today or something you know it just stretched and moved and you just start thinking about him and all of a sudden another man says you feel that presence just sweep right over you he said what is that that's the evidence of the resurrection it's the same Lord Jesus that stepped out of the pages step out of the shadows and types stepped out and begin to walk with them so before and ever remember before it ever gets to the mouth you got to meditate on it that's the same order but we read Ephesians 6 and take unto you the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit it didn't say take the sword of the Spirit and then go get the helmet of salvation no you've got to take the word in it's got to be alive to you so what you surely our speaking is who you are are you with me when doin Satan met Jesus he he you know he flew in to him but what he met he met somebody that wasn't quoting the word he were met somebody who was the word and was quoting what he was and what was made alive to him who let me go on you this morning but thou shalt meditate therein day and night that thou mayst observe to do according to all that is written therein for then thou shalt make that way prosperous and thou shalt have good success so have not I commanded thee be strong another good courage be not afraid neither be thou dismayed for the Lord God is with thee whether so ever thou goest you know what God is saying you make a step I made a step you make a step I made a step you make a step you see we're not to get ahead of him we're only simply to walk in the steps what he has unfolded the Bible says that the thorough steps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord David said he making my feet like Hinds feet glory be to God in the highest this is why in the Book of Psalms he will go home to say for a very familiar scripture but you know if you haven't considered this this portion of scripture that I'm going to read which is familiar to you and I this is a portion of Scripture that the Spirit of God would have the Prophet Lake heavenly on in the restoration to the bride tree many times you find people that are wanting power they want miracles they want all these things but they don't have a personal walk with God they don't want to line up with the word they want all of these things and I want to see this and I want to see that and I want to see this and we want to say that remember power power is not a given outside of the word power that comes outside of the world it lives people in the same situation they were in before that's why brother Ram said when a healing revival comes he said him when it comes and that and it continues on in that same denomination he said that is not of God it's not my words why because the pillar of fire comes not to anoint the ideas of a man the pillar of fire comes to lead us further very men our encampments are not to be isolation but our encampments are to be presenting ourselves before the Lord that our lives might be molded and shaped and we're waiting and watching for the moving of the Spirit of God Psalms 1 1 blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful but his delight is in the law of the Lord and in his law doth he meditate day and night even though his delight is that in the law of the Lord he meditates day and night this is the kind this is what you see about this not this individuals life and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit God's fruit the promise his fruit in his season whose season the season of the messenger his fruit God's fruit in the season that he sends his messenger with that message his leaf his leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper you know what this is talking about the prevalence of life proverbs 4 20 my son attend to my words in crying than ear unto my sayings let them not be part from dying eyes keep them in the midst of thine heart for they are life unto those that find them and health to all their flesh divine healing these are the various scriptures brother Bosworth would give these scriptures right here when praying for the sick and told the people when you're prayed for you take these scriptures and you immerse yourself in the Word of God you know you know as he would express it what I'm gonna say that brother Bosworth would express their it's the same thing you know brother Bosworth old daddy Bosworth and brother Branham they were buddies they were friends and brother brother Bosworth made the statement he said take the seed and commit it to the ground and quit digging it up how many messages go on over and over and over you find the Prophet saying the same thing what it's the wisdom of God that would come down that you and I might be able to tap into in the simplicity God would make it so simple and say give yourself to the word planet couldn't digging it up and see if it's coming out just be settled in it God has said it the promise is gay and a man it belongs to me you let the word come into your cell it's eternal life and that same word that's in there it is also health to your mortal body oh my this is why we must have that knowledge that knowing that the experience we're firmly planted in solid ground no other foundation but Jesus Christ you must become acquainted with the promises that belong to you let me just say if you here for every one of us if the only time that you hear the Scriptures is when you come to the house of God you need to repent the only time you hear a quote from the message is when it's read here you need to repent you need to give yourself to the word of the Lord amen this where God has vindicated it Amen I'm not there I'm just saying it from my heart because of the victory that belongs to you where you can have victory in your own life I'm brother Sam there you know I just I can't set down that long when I go to read a chapter I add this and that you know what you need to call that devil a liar because you're able to sit down and do all other sorts of other things for an hour or more you need to realize say devil you're not loving me no more I want to read about my redemptive rights I guarantee you if you knew an aunt or an uncle somebody died and your name was in there for a certain amount of money or for certain things I guarantee you even if you had problems we're answering around and everything else you would find you a lawyer you'd find somebody you have asked somebody I want to know what's in here that belongs to me why because you know my name is in there there are promises there things have been wrote down for me and that's the way it is to be with the Word of God bread these promises have been rough for you the Holy Ghost is for you deliverance is for you salvation is for you Healing is for you million times what happens were prayed for and then we leave out of here and instead of feeding on the promises of healing we just walk out we say well I've met the requirements you haven't met the requirements you have come up if you've met the requirements there's nothing standing between you and God the Bible said the prayer of faith shall save the sick and God shall raise them up they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover but you need to place yourself in that of the word remember what God doesn't hear it's your and responsibility and my responsibility to keep weeds out of that garden and I think I'm speaking to every one of us there's times when I walk around I walk around my flowerbeds it gets to that time of the year or I'll go around there's so many of every other so many mornings in the week and I look in there early and you know what you'll find a little weeds growing how did they get there I didn't plant them when brought them in some of those seeds were already there certain things begin to germinate I know if you ever noticed this or not to me it's just really inspiring in one sense of the word there's some times where I've had to get on my hands and knees because there's weeds that actually look like the plant they were growing under yes I mean they leaves everything it looks just like it and then you have to get close to it there's times where we really got to get earnest before God and said Lord if this'll lead that looks like it's part of the plant Oh glory that was free let me just tell you why the enemy is going to contest you on every ounce of ground you'll say everything to you you'll try to bring every charge and accusation against you you're trying to bring scare tactics you'll try to do everything you can to contest promises from being taken this is why Paul if I can just put it very clearly in the book of Ephesians Paul begins by inspiration of telling us who we are in Christ Jesus lets us know what we have claims upon then it's unfolded in our walk in our life and he moves to a place where he admonishes us to take upon the full armor of God and that we're not fighting against flesh and blood principalities rulers of the darkness of this world what's he dealing with we were chosen in Christ we are we are blessing where we are to reside us in heavenly places and let me tell you something there are battles battles that you and I must fight and we are called to contest within these spiritual battles this is why Paul would bring it so much together there in the book of Ephesians in that way think of this now this scripture here have quoted it many times but I would say over a year ago when things of just studying and just throughout the course of the year studying on Israel the redemption and moving through the scriptures with it this scripture which we are very familiar with out of the Book of Isaiah we've heard it quoted and and and we've applied it but it is a scripture and let me read it first it says in verse 3 thou wilt keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee because he trusted in thee this scripture is a part of a bank of scriptures that is actually it's a promise that we can draw from but this same scripture refers to win the baptism of the Holy Ghost the gospel is preached to the hundred forty-four thousand and here they are moved away and a fulfillment into the wilderness their and here they are in the taking in of the Word of God remember the Bible says in Isaiah says in Zechariah that they will in compass of Mountain Jerusalem this the pressure is coming down why will the pressures come down on Israel in that time because that is where God is moving why is God so intent and against the bride of Jesus Christ remember every demon power that's been released against the bride of Jesus Christ why because that is where he is at presently but here's the promise David said a host and come about me let Jerusalem encompassed about I see things all around me but the promise is I will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on me because he trusts in me then we move over into the promise where it says in Philippians 4:7 the peace of God which passes all understanding and I can say amen to that because there's beyond this how that moves in donnelly in our soul but how it moves in our life at times how the piece of gorgeous emanates to our life to move upon situations here's what I shall do shall keep that means to be garrisoned in like a military guard to prevent hostile invasion he shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus finally brethren verse 8 whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just pure lovely of a good report you know Paul has given here these are all criteria it must meet there's a lot of truth that don't even need to be thought about lot of truth that don't even need to be entertained then send preach it Romans for the Bible said and that Abraham who hoped who against hope hoped what was the expectation mat body's going to keep on breaking down but he said I have an expectation that is greater than that reality of my body breaking down there's an expectation by a living promise that a living God made to me that we are going to have a son this is what it means there's a lot of truth that can be around but there's a truth V truth that is greater than truth are you with me when they saw the giants the giants the ana comes true their giants true they're big boys true they're in those cities true but there's another the truth and the truth is said if you believe so the truth Trump's truth how's that for truth in facts if there be any virtue notice here's another part of it if there's any fetch you in it brother Samuel you are tearing my Facebook account apart praise the Lord you realize the things that you can read when you study on many of those things there are things that people can read one little thing when they get up in the morning and it can set the rest of their day if there be any virtue if there be any praise we're gonna send them with this thing right here you know there's linen on a virtue and really any praise in it then let me just tell you don't entertain it this is what your to do if it meets all those qualities and then has virtue virtue means strength I can do all things through Christ who enables me if it doesn't have virtue and there ain't any praise in it don't think on it but if it meets that then think on those things really the only thing I can think about that that's the Word of God this is why listen to me now the brass speaks of judgment remember now I'm coming into this part of the head piece it's brass brass speaks of judgment wants you to hold that judgment meaning as Paul would write in second Corinthians and he would speak of how that we are not walking in the flesh we're warring we do not war after it but the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations we don't we don't talk away we cast them down the rebellion in heaven cast out you find in the scripture we're not asking Satan to leave cast him out they shall cast out Devils what a mean cast him out throw them out and every high thing that's every thought remember that whole thing I think remember this first birth came by an exalted thought of the high thing come on that's why Paul said neither height nor depth or things present nor things to come he's talking about spiritual circumstances Satan took Jesus upon the mountain heights took him up upon the temple heights sometimes Heights things look differently but this is why we need the reading of the Lord even those high things things that some what if there's anything that then is exalted every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ Wow so before it ever should come out of the mouth it ought to already be scrutinized come on we got to balance this out you can say well you know you know brother Samuel you know Isaiah just spoke you know has yeah I know that but Isaiah was lifted up into the mind of God and you're not gonna tell me you're lifted up in the mind of God and tearing down somebody else he was lifted up that's that with that he spoke things he was lifted up by the Spirit of God so this right here pulling into captivity every thought what's it talking about it's talking about this is the helmet of salvation bringing bringing judgment and and judging that thought oh my I just say oh just let me just stay on this here now let me bring this down and I'm going to come into this part and by the help of the Lord just close here on this bringing this down into an example with David and Goliath here I may just refer to it instead of reading the the scriptures but here was Goliath making his boast and the scripture is clear to point out that the lieth had on a helmet of brass if said he had on his whole covering was brass he had a coat of brass he had leg guards of brass he was covered all over remember brass speaks of judgment goliath was had the judgment of god upon him because why he was uncircumcised do you realize without the token or the baptism of the Holy Ghost the judgment of God is upon you he had a helmet of brass his whole body armor was brass you're still under the looming judgment you say how do we see that still being under the looming judgment look how if a life would walk in darkness a life walks in condemnation the Bible says there is there and therefore no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus we've been made free the inner man is free the lever the world has gone is passed from you from all time and eternity now the difference now here's Goliath but here stands David David is not under the judgment of God but David is coming to meet him under the atonement and the Talmud has listed him above the judgment this is what David is expressing in Psalms 27 he hath lifted my head now above mine enemies so David had on the helmet of salvation remember david was a type of Christ in Isaiah 29 when he has as the Lord Jesus come it said he would have upon a righteousness as a breastplate salvation as a helmet it was one there was one focus it was one purpose there was one goal and that was to satisfy and redeem or mine so David had an issue of the helmet of salvation now remember Goliath's helmet is very visible Damon David's wearing the helmet of salvation you can look at David and say I don't see no helmet oh no brother he had a helmet oh no he he had a helmet on you see what David had on and they just let me just refer to it this way what David had on but the RAM said he never prayed a prayer he never offered nothing he known he was anointed he was anointed and that slingshot had proved the right kind of thing he had faith in his anointing that's what the token does when the token is come you got faith in the token the purchasing power the fool assurance that there is nothing present not future there are things to come nothing shall be able to separate us from the love of God nothing confidence in one that's why you've got to have the sacred sands that's why you've gotta meet God face to face I want you understand even those you out there you're streaming I'm not talking down to you I'm trying to tell you what's available to you so you can walk in victory wear the sandals not your victory the way I preach is not your victory the victory is the absolute of the one who speaks through me it is that absolute that moves into your heart that's why the Prophet said it must be a man that's got the absolute of God and hold that absolute over the congregation that the congregation comes to that absolute I'm telling you then you've got victory [Applause] he had faith let me finish reading this he had faith that God could direct that rock right straight in the middle of that helmet there are you with me now David look everybody else said this guy's covered over with armor you ain't never going to be able to pierce it - David David saw the most vulnerable spot he didn't have the seal of God come on somebody come on now he didn't have the seal of God are you with me now he didn't have that David said he's an uncircumcised philistine David didn't say he's this big or he's got this on his got that on David's head he's uncircumcised oh my feel like preacher right now he had faith that God could direct that stone notice he no listen to me now he knowed he was a good shot blocker preacher I've got to preach a month we could preach on that a while he knowed he was a good shot this was not David puffed up in himself David knew what God had done through his life I'm not a very good Christian oh I'm not why don't you stop talking the devil's language God took cussing out of many of our vocabulary and yet we walk around with this sanctified swearing well I'm not a good Christian oh I wish I had more faith I wish I wasn't this I wish I was at that that sanctified swearing you need to have a positive confession at all times I am redeemed he is my deliverer I am loved of the Lord I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me for the bad so when you talk negative you're talking the devil's language that don't mean then my wife can't tell me that she's got she says honey I've got kidney problems I don't walk up to her and say stop talking the devil's language no no brother we're talking my wisdom here I don't walk up and say don't you talk about that she might need there might need to be something address something in our home of one of our children you say well then how do you balance it all out it's that we're looking to the Lord for healing we're not going to make space for that to dwell come on somebody we're talking about faith he knowed he was a good shot he knowed God made him that so David knew my skills from the Lord oh ma you know ma this is why when the Prophet would pick it up in the token I don't have time to teach you to read it to you but he said when that token has come he said Satan will try to stand there and he'll try to tempt you he said I want you to remember he said when you have that token you walk with the confidence that you are in Christ hallelujah and we expect we expect dividends from the sacrifice from this life that we are in he has made us a good shot hallelujah he has made us a good shot Oh glory be to God in Christ there is no death no sorrow no weary no sin no sickness no death he said if Satan tries to hand you something like sickness you just take your token and apply it brother slander I applied my token and I still hidden it upset keep applying it the token was not a guarantee that this body wouldn't feel sickness this body is a bondage of corruption it's a pest house this body is sin but what the token said is that if he allows sickness to come he the promise I'm the Lord that takes sickness away from you whoo glory be to God brother brems said he tells you he'll say to you this other token message he says when you die you're lost he said but you say you're wrong I have the purchased product I am a purchased product I have the token oh my he said how that he would come around and try to bluff well who does that it's an old devil now remember when David came David you know people started rehearsing David's words to solve so I'll say who is this guy who is this big guy his comment he must be a very a very big man where's he at I'm surprised I can't scene because certainly he'd probably this guy's probably head and shoulders above the rescue I didn't know we had any giants in Israel now you don't have giant men you got a giant God you got a great big hog who comes in small packages not the size of the dog in the fight size of the fight in the dog here came dad David ready beautiful countenance come on he was one that the Prophet would have even looked beyond but God through the Prophet the Prophet was sensitive and God said put the anointing oil upon him David shows up David dude against to testify and I'm just moving through these scriptures you can read them later and know you've read over David goes out and David speaks up I went out I smoked that of the lion of the lion delivered I delivered the lamb out of its mouth he rose up against me I caught it by the beard and slew him that servant slew the lion and the bear verse 36 and the same this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them you see what David was under he was under the anointing of God the word was always in David's life just like that word that seed was always laying there in our life but what had to happen it had to be anointed and when Samuel went there to anoint David or to anoint that which would be King which was chosen not by man but by God God was whole God was unfolding his children his choosing of election through the prophets message and the words that he spoke I have sought the out a neighbor and is the kingdom it shall belong to him those words this prophet went with that word and it was the word anointing that was put upon David - where in David's life it would reflect God's choosing hey men you cannot help but reflect the word of this hour you are ordained to reflect and manifest the word for this hour this message is the inspiration of the Holy Ghost that is poured out upon the believer we are under a world anointing or as the Prophet said he said it is the word in you anointed takes its position David was already acting like a king hallelujah he wasn't in maybe sitting on the throne yet but God was already seated on the throne of his heart David said who is this uncircumcised philistine he realized he was already a king let me tell you what the Holy Ghost does he made us kings and priests unto our God remember David just said I wouldn't did this I wouldn't did this I went and did this the next verse verse 37 moreover the Lord that delivered me out of the Paul the life how did the Paul the bear he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine what was David say God used him as an instrument and David brought it all around it was the law moving through me so Saul said wait here a minute verse 38 Saul arm David with his armor and a puttin helmet of brass upon his head also he armed him with a coat of mail brasses judgment saw had this knowledge of the word but Saul was not fully under the atonement are you with me so here under this helmet of brass he looked at David and it looked like David needed Armour but David had on the full armor of God he had on the full armor of God amen David had a direct issue from the supplier himself this was not somebody in the barracks or or near the plant near the you know they're near the mess hall or whatever more that said oh I mean another set of btus hey I need a helmet I need another cartridge for my rifle I need to know this no sir the same God who has designated this armor he himself is the one that hands out this armor brother he's the one that personally gives this to you and I threw the Holy Ghost we have every part of the armor and we must use it the helmet is this not something that's well it's just there we're not in our dress blues or our dress grains we're in a battle there is fighting that's going on we're in the greatest battle ever fought the Scriptures tell us here in verse 40 you know David he couldn't take that armor I can't do this I haven't proved it you know what David was saying I got my own experience and that's what I got faith in you got to have your own experience have faith in the anointing David took his staff in his hand just follow me here just for a moment please give me your attention and chose him five smooth Stones out of the brook and he put him in a shepherd's bag which he had David knew where to go get these stones and he had a place to put him when he got him because he was gonna need them these were not rough edge stones these were stones that the living water had flowed over these are stones that the living water had prepared and his sling was in his hand and he drew near to the Philistine now I want you to think of this when powers come to me anytime down through the down down through the history throughout the world and things like at a time even when you look even at even in Nebuchadnezzar's dream and there and you see all the different time empires and every one of them you realize there were different tactics that came about within those kingdoms and different tactics for war and different things like that and wherever the these these powers or when armies would come together they would come together in a place that's called no-man's land no-man's land meaning you don't belong to nobody that's where the powers are tested that's the battleground and listen now that battleground is in the mind Satan comes and he battles now I want you to listen to me I want everybody listen to me you say brother Samuel so the devil comes telling me this and telling me that the first thing that you've got to know is you've got to have the soldier down on the inside to know that the love of the world is gone and if it's still there then let me tell you something there is one who is for you if God be for us who can be against us you need to let let the Lord Jesus Christ Himself let the banner of the Lord go to work for you let the zeal of the Lord of Hosts perform this now let me just be clear about this that don't mean for you to sit back and say well God I'm just waiting on you to do everything it means for you to rise up and you say I want this promise and I'm gonna give everything there's nothing I have in my life that is even comparable to that life that I mean come true you've gotta be willing to die to give it all I'm trying to down your victory lives it don't do away with the battleground but when he comes you got the soldier on the inside and this is no-man's land because decisions are made in the human mind this is where you take in you receive or you let out and the enemy comes there it's a mutual ground and this is where the fight is is right in the mind so I brother branham with tells of people he says you sitting there in that wheelchair he said don't you think that you're hopeless you're not he said think on things of a good reports virtue and praise on through the message on and on so many different places have God on your heart be praying be meditating on the Lord he would tell him be thinking tonight's my night tonight's my night what brother Samuel I was there last night and tonight one man and that that night wasn't my night then you show back up and say tonight's my night cuz he which was which is and which is to come time don't change him he said they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover he never said in a certain amount of time he just said they shall recover this is where the battle it starts it's the place that's between two hills called a valley I hope you're with me now a valley is a place where the armies come down and meet one another it was in the valley who has just read that scripture of David right there it was in a valley that David walked down into that Valley to meet Goliath you don't meet Goliath on a mountaintop you meet him in a valley hello now the battle seems real easy when you're on the mountaintop but God him remember defeat defeat as far as defeating to life it comes in the valley when I am weak then I am strong hallelujah they come right out there into the valley but I want you to know where he went to I want you to know where he went to before he ever went out there and come there to that place with Goliath he was facing Goliath he was on his way to meet him but brother he had a stream of water he was gonna have an appointment with first you know David before he was gonna battle he would ask the Lord should I pursue after him should I take after him brother there is a fountain open in the house of David there is living water and just incidentally I'll have the link in my notes when I send it out I watched a little video because I had heard this statement so I thought I want to find this out I heard a statement about there is a multitude of stones in this stream I thought well I want to go check that out and write on a video here's a man standing right there right in this very spot where David would pick up the five smooth stones that place was loaded with stones you say what does that speak of in Christ there are many promises the promises are not sparse they're not hard to come by come on somebody promises they're laying there what do I need to do make an appointment in the living water and when you get ready to meet the enemy take the Word of God and get ready to meet the enemy because in him every promise is yay and they men the living water anoints that promise to us the living water makes it alive and real [Applause] that's why you want to feel your heart and mind with the promises of God earn his battleground David comes out there he's already had discouragement from a church member he's already had discouragement from a message theologian I'm gonna preach he's already had discouragement from critical stuff but David realized you didn't call me all right now you didn't call me so you can't fire me God called me David realized where his anointing was that his strength was in the anointing of a secret meeting David had been in that little room he got anointed come on somebody he came out of that or they came out of that little room the third pull was living the opening of the word it had been unfolded in his life he had been hid away and the message was no longer in but brother it wasn't fresh so david says murga lieth rather says ain't nothing but a young guy they said he disdained him what am i a dog that you send this guy out here where you think I am you understand Goliath was known as the champion of gaff is that right but remember there was the call you send out your champion that word champion right there in the Hebrew it speaks of one who stands there in the gap one who feels the breach hallelu where can beat a team to my promises amen God sent down what you and I had need of blacks should be the name of the Lord and here was Goliath you ain't nothin but a young boy maybe I could say you could say you ain't nothin but a daughter of God you're a young daughter of God yura you're just a young man you're just the Spirit of God said Paul said let no man despise thy youth what David what David had in his heart was a Living God and Goliath was running his mouth Goliath made some promises he said I'm gonna give you a flesh to the fowls of the air and to the beasts of the field you know there's a spirit that comes behind words just as the Holy Spirit travels through the word Jesus and my words are spirit in life Satan's word come to tear down come on now this is why negative thoughts don't entertain them you can't help them from passing through but don't entertain them let me just read you this right here I know I'm taking a take take in here just just a little bit but this is more than your dinner Satan's army brings diseases this is the very next quote after what I've read about helmet of salvation Satan's army brings diseases that is what Satan is he's a destroyer Satan the whole kingdom of Satan is sickness death and sorrow and frustrations and worry all on Satan but God is life faith joy peace over here so when word comes that don't come from God frustrate frustrations come that don't come from God sorrow that don't come from God death or sickness you see Satan's our destroyer he wouldn't love nothing more than you walk out of a service or out of your living room and then out after dinner or tomorrow he would like to have a punch that would knock every ounce of confidence that the Holy Ghost has inspired in your heart he calculates that how can I hit him once and knock everything out of them that was an hour and a half being put into him come on now this word that's being ministered it is the revelation of Jesus Christ in Revelations one he is ministering love courage and ability it's showing you and I that Satan is already I've defeated being he destroys he wants to take away confidence he wants to take away any any confidence that God has instilled in you Lord I'm said that's why I said the man of God he said on that Monday morning he said Satan is there waiting on Monday morning to knock every ounce of confidence out that the Holy Ghost has put in him the day before not just a man of God but we need to take this as a whole assembly Satan is here to try to knock out this confidence why because this confidence is not a pep rally it's not a man-made confidence this is the word of the Lord be strong I never good courage hallelu God is life faith joy peace he said here's those two great forces that's coming together right now they're battling they're battling right here in the building right now seyton don't pay no attention to no tresspassing out there okay they're battling they battle day by day with you every force both seven I have been battling do you know what that says you're cold you're cold because the enemy is out to destroy confidence because if the enemy can move your confidence away you don't have any confidence to rise up and take ground let me just stop here today if he can bring up things from your past he can bring up things that she has already been put under the blood of Jesus Christ things that then even that you're even in your your souls not even he up to he can bring up your mistakes then he starts going with that angle then he starts working on you who are you how do you have any worthiness how can you look up for anything I don't have to tell you cuz you know how he talks to you and what I have found out over the years from even those who were much older than me is that he don't ever stop running his trap but we've got to know the tactics come on we've got to know the tactics and where when where must we stand simplicity stand on the anointing that is in your life because that anointing is not a sensation that anointing is the person of Jesus Christ it is the word that's anointed in you look your life has been changed this revelation has been made real to you the love of the world is gone you didn't do that God did that he didn't just clean your life up and make you a good church member no but he came and it has illuminated in your heart there is the love of the father in your life you desire to please him this word means everything to you to please him means everything to you David's walking out here to this battle and he's got the helmet of salvation on he's already collected the stones he knew the source to go to he knew the source to go to and collect those stones I tell you if if if you're able to with the link and things I've got the link in my notes you look on that link if you get a chance for this evening or tomorrow it's just it's about a minute and a half only two minutes long and you look at that that that that that looks like a little Creek a little part of water and look how is just stones laid within it oh it's not real pretty-like landscaping there's grass growing in there and everything else but brother bill is loaded it's loaded it's loaded brother Gomes you know what that means it means this is the full book is open the promises every promise in Christ Jesus every promise it's there we're not looking around saying oh is there any promises is there any promises here no he's the same yesterday today and forever amen Jehovah the Optus Jesus of the new David has approached this battle with the helmet of salvation now Satan has wanted to run his mouth but David has come with the helmet of salvation he's got one thing on his mind is today is your last day this is the last time you're gonna wag your tongue go ahead and get your words out this the last words you're going to say because your day is come I'm here to announce the judgment that's upon you David had the helmet of salvation and then you begin to see here how David begins to speak he begins to use the sword of the word I'll tell you brother and sister he doesn't matter where you're at in your walk with God I'm just telling I would say I would admonish you from the depths of my heart if there is something that has come your way it seems like it's destroyed your confidence let the Spirit of God evaluated in your life if there's something that's out of line let him lead you to a place to where that can be reconciled and put in line if there's something to where that you realize that really down on the inside of my soul but Samuel I need that everlasting that that eternal life I need that experience down there on the inside then ask God for it it belongs to you don't bet you don't have to begging you asking like we preach like we were talking on Tuesday night in our little chat our little chat stream we did there it was not because the man was a friend that he rose up and gave him bread no no it won because he was a friend it's because of the one who was asking was shameless in his asking he was shameless you know it was it showed pride did not have hold him back from asking for what he really needed he said I've got me for bread he didn't let pride hold him back his importunity he asked and Jesus said how much more will not the heavenly father for those that you that asked for the Holy Ghost will he not give it notice ask now beg ask he will give it if there's something in your life to where the enemy has moved and you find yourself low in confidence maybe it's something that the enemy is holding a cloud you you can identify in your life you say but the Sun I know the love of the world's not there I know my heart it beats for God I love the Lord with all my heart but if there's something that's come that somewhat to try to destroy your confidence maybe it's things to where the enemy is tried to point out and try to suggest certain things of I wonder how come you don't have testimonies like this other brother has testimonies are one to wonder why you don't have certain testimonies like this other sister let me just remind you you're not a fool you say what do you say that because Paul said those that compare themselves among themselves are fools you're not a fool you're a wise virgin you're not to be comparing yourself with one another our our stand if David compared himself to Saul he didn't ever went out there but that's not what David was comparing himself with don't allow the enemy to try to match you up with somebody else or I'm not we are a body that goes together my body is not made up of all fingers it's not made up of all toes it's not made up of all of all arms it's not made up of all mouth it's not made up of all tongue it's not made it has parts members that come together because if I'm a part of that body if the Spirit of God comes down and speaks in tongues through you guess what I'm part of the body and the Spirit of God is speaking in tongues through the body prophesying through the body guess what as a minister of God I'm not outside the body you can say you know what the Spirit of God is coming down and working right in the body that's exactly what the Holy Spirit told us through the message of Malachi 4 he said God is with us appearing in our flesh take back your confidence this morning if there's something that's hindering that confidence maybe it's something you have a little feeling against somebody else you can never gain confidence if you've got that feeling because you're no better if our heart condemn us not then we have confidence with God remember the breastplate is two pieces faith and love it works with hope it's got to be all together if there's anything that would hinder confidence get it cleared out and watch God just move restoring that confidence aren't you glad for the helmet of salvation all thank God let's pray father Lord you are so mindful of our needs you're mindful lord of the needs of every one of your children Lord many Lord as they're gathered in homes Lord weather around Lord their tablets their computers their phones Lord they're listening to the word of the Lord Lord to receive to receive from you Lord you know every situation when I think of where that Lord even that we're at we speak of this and realizing in a in a spiritual manner Lord as we see that how Satan's army comes to destroy Lord we know Lord if you tarry even with things Lord that would even be coming up Lord in coming weeks seeing Lord even now if we have to go out and get groceries or wherever more or people are more and more aware of just how close how Lord the virus which Lord we know it's a demon that Lord would have penetrated move Lord around us may we take Lord that helmet of salvation got up free may there not be Lord God fear or worry that would Lord hold over any heart or any life I just read a quote weeks ago where your prophet as he was thinking he was so thankful he said for medicine and he said one of the other things he said I'm thankful for is that the invented hand soap to wash our hands he said I'm very thankful for medical science inventing soap or Jesus we know that there's precautions that we have to take just like in every other time even Lord with situations that are always around us and then we have our eyes on we're trusting you Lord God you're seeing a stone or there's needs in hearts and lives this morning now pray God it by your spirit anything that's unsettled may it be settled maybe they have that confidence to come to you our high priest let it be said this morning father I pray that may you just Lord grant Brett more than three the peace of God granite Lord for every situation Lord of confidence Lord seems to have been removed may they not just rise now Lord in confidence but I pray may they allow the Spirit of God to teach him Traynham Lord how they must stand everything that Lord that you spoke to us even from the beginning of the service it's laying in these promises of God that we would be feeding upon the Word of God taking the Word of God in as your prophet said when we read that verse or that chapter he said after you read it say Amen take it in or Jesus how many times in my own life listening to messages reading in the scripture sometimes Lord God whether it was then or sometimes the Lord sold much of a time later on your spirit would move down and illuminate a promise something Lord that I'd heard and said you know I don't think there was something like this that I heard it wasn't that my mind that I could remember that particular verse or the lore the statement verbatim that Lord that you had made through the Prophet but there would be something about it and you would lead me back to it Lord I know I'm not the only one that happens that way truly Lord many times of how that you begin to build a message but that happens to us as children of God that promise is not exclusive just for ministers you send when the Spirit of Truth has come he will lead and guide us into all truth and he'll bring to remembrance those things which he has said lord help us may we walk like David with that helmet of salvation may we visit the flowing waters may we Lord God allow the waters to flow in our lives Lord God may we not Dam it up with anything Lord Lord God becomes a bottleneck and caused things to grow with fungus and mold but may it be Lord God a fresh experience bubbling up in our life Lord Jesus it's not for us but as we give ourselves to you Lord you are the fountain of living water well you're the one who Lord God brings about those smooth stones promises Lord that belong to us what I ask you forgive us forgive us Lord for times that we've wasted forgive us Lord God when our minds have been filled with a lot of other stuff or lettuce may our minds and our hearts be filled with your promises help us father I pray in the name of Jesus Christ he call all my it's all [Music] his meatballs he said because I live you shall live also two more all my fear is gone [Music] Oh oh when I

stood up fair remembering you know I was right up on my mom when she was praying to play in the piano you know I wanted to sing the song but then I hear in front of the people I wanted to hide but I think about that now as a little boy what I sung about what I could witness and I witnessed the power of God moving in services the tenderness of my heart was to serve him but I can stand here today with my own testimony greater is He that is in me hallelujah I'm not hiding behind Mama's experience not hide behind daddy's experience not hiding behind prophets experience or the plasters experience
