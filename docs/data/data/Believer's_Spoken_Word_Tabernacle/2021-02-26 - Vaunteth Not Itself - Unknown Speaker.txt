greater desire lord than we could have that we do have that's that you would have your own way lord help us to get out of our own way [Music] lord just be so yielded for your way to your way lord your god we don't claim in ourselves to be able lord to do that alone we need the unction of the holy spirit lord it's the desire from our hearts [Music] lord you placed that desire within us you quickened that lord and made it a living reality but lord you're still the longing of our life lord or we're not longing to be born again lord jesus we've been born again by the spirit of god but there's a longing lord in her heart for more of you lord that more of us lord would be surrendered to more of you i pray that lord that you'll just have your way lord may you just come lord help us just to step aside for these few moments the lord what is said what we would hear that your god it's you that lord that you'll come we have an utmost confidence lord that as the word is going forth in this word is created power oh god and as we receive that word we become the word so lord we ask oh god that you would have your way minister to the needs what's on the hearts of your children tonight may you just come in a special way let it be just a real personal time lord between each one of us and you we just lord give ourselves to you as that you would just have your way now in every part that's remaining in the service in the name of jesus christ amen amen god bless you tonight amen let's turn in our bibles to first corinthians chapter 13 verse four thank you we'll just read this verse of scripture and verse 4 charity suffereth long and is kind charity envieth not and it vaunteth not itself and is not puffed up may god bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated you know in in reality when we look at any any place within the word of god there there's no stopping point within the word it only comes to a place that like as paul would give counsel to timothy the instant in season and out of season and to know by the leading of the lord where to journey when enough has been said when to move on so we just we we always look at that within the word because as we see even in this portion of the scripture we're looking at there's so many things that the lord has just been unpacking within this and there's things that as i said we you could you could just continue on and you see over and over how that there are things that as we go through it that there's just always an overlapping because the scripture says it's true that no scripture is of any private or isolated interpretation so it must scripture must come to scripture word must come to word precept must come to precept and that's a working of the spirit of truth that's why the working of the holy ghost in our life by himself is a word experience it brings us into the word to where that our lives themselves are then becomes a reflection of the word to where our our basis and our resting and our delight is upon is in him so as we look at this this portion of the word as it says it vaunteth not itself and i want to just look at that just a little bit more here tonight and see how far we can get with this but it deals with not being boastful or vainglorious or empty glory it deals with where there is sometimes of of a place that as we can say charity itself it doesn't draw attention to itself or if we can say it in this manner it doesn't draw attention to the vessel that it is higher housed in but real charity it seeks to honor and to glorify almighty god and so this is this is really the desire that that really that charity would operate by is to see the lord jesus glorified in all things paul would write of this and just to pick up one of the places here in the book of ephesians chapter 3 verse 20 and paul says now unto him that is able to do exceedingly above all that we can ask or think according to the power that worketh in us unto him be glory in the church by christ jesus throughout all ages world without end amen so in everything that is done within the church of the living god or we can say even in our own lives is to be unto the glory of jesus christ sometimes that isn't always in what we say sometimes it's the times when we refrain from saying anything that he is allowed to be glorified and so we we recognize that it's his power that works within us it's not as we were looking at that last week it's nothing that we can take credit for on our own self when you really begin to look at things you can't even say oh my yes i prayed and and this came to pass and you know i prayed about this and this happened but it wasn't you the reality of it is is god gave you grace to go into prayer to trust him that for what he has already said in his word ask the father anything in my name that he might be glorified in the son of god so it becomes in that in that measure and as we're looking that it all comes back to it's god that's given us grace to even approach things in prayer it's the grace of god that even allows us to examine our own faults and our own weakness and our own shortcomings that's the grace of god so when we look at this i want to go to matthew chapter 17 and here is a setting where we find as the scripture says after six days jesus took peter james and john and his brother and he brought them up into a high mountain apart and was transfigured before them and his face did shine as the sun and as rainment was white as the light this was an adoption ceremony this is a placing ceremony this is a positioning ceremony and and he says behold there appeared unto them moses and elijah talking with him then answered peter and said unto jesus lord it is good for us to be here if thou wilt let us make here three tabernacles i want you to catch this peter peter is here in the moment and he's looking at what's taking place and he's just he's caught up in this reality and here is moses here is elijah speaking with the lord jesus as it records in the book of luke concerning his his death concerning what is to take place because it's a fulfillment of prophecy that's going to take place he must needs suffer these things and to enter into his glory so here you find the word the prophets and the law all that spoke of christ what has spoke now he stands as the fulfillment where the prophets were only a portion but here he stands the full light himself no longer just a portion of a light but now it is the light itself that's been gathered together not just not just that of the law but now here is the very one who is the law giver himself the one who would would come and and fulfill as he said i will write upon the tables of your heart in your heart and in your mind so now here we find the very one that is scripted inspired moses and scripted it and now here he is he's identified in earth in that of the messiah and now here peter makes this declaration let us make three tabernacles if jesus would allow him to do it things would have continued as they were the law condemns you i don't care how many points you keep of it you're still guilty and the prophets are the justice to declare you're guilty and this is what you have coming but when they made this statement here notice one for moses one for life and we're not going to leave you out jesus we'll make one for you while yet spake behold a bright cloud overshadowed them and behold a voice out of the cloud said this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased hear ye him and when the disciples heard it they fell on their face and were sore afraid and jesus came and touched them and said arise and be not afraid and when they lifted up their eyes they saw no man save jesus only you see here when the word was declared the cloud comes and out of the cloud comes the voice that it speaks with supreme authority this is my beloved son who is he he is the word hear ye him hear the word the word speaketh better things the word declares what the law couldn't do here is the one who satisfies the requirements of the law where we could not meet the justice of god here is one who can meet the justice of god hear ye him let the word have its work and as this was declared think of the impact of this vision it's the same thing that took place in revelations 1 where john was he fell on his feet as dead and a hand came forth and said fear not john i am he that was dead and i'm alive forevermore that's what god has done in this generation this right here in this generation is a repeat of matthew 17 where the word itself that has been coming down through the ages now stands in full power and full glory it's time for the rapture and it's time for israel to receive her visitation so now here you find the request is let us make a tabernace three tabernacles and when we when we look at it now when the declaration comes it just takes a very breath it takes the very life they they are sore afraid but i want you to notice when jesus touched them he told them arise and be not afraid the word told them stand on your feet arise and be not afraid and when they lifted up their head they no longer seen moses and elijah they saw it all met in him they saw jesus only they saw the word himself standing there declaring himself i want to just say this to you who do you see in your life declaring himself it's the word taking the word and declaring the word through you it's not you it's not me it's christ it's god being glorified in sons and daughters of god that is bringing into position by his word and we see no one else say jesus only you don't see a church we see no man say jesus only that's what the real revelation of this word does it brings jesus christ from word to flesh it brings a reality down into the lives of the people that is the same yesterday today and forever [Applause] this mount transfiguration brother branham picks it up and it's the rising of the sun and i want to read from this in this point he said we're just like them at mount transfiguration certainly we do not claim power like he says on mount transfiguration they wasn't saying moses saying see who see who i am the disciples say see who i am see who i am you know what happened he said they seen jesus glorified and that's all they wanted to see represented was jesus glorified and so it is today the guy places this we don't try to be some big person listen this is the holy spirit and the word and the prophet and the bride is one with this this is the motive and objective of christ himself working in the word he's not interested in big big names he's not interested in making who's who he's not interested in that remember the world the world looks for things like like like israel look for saul he was head and shoulders above the rest and my he looked this way and he looked that way even when samuel went to anoint one of jesse's sons remember even samuel god allowing that as we looked at it last week he went to anoint the first one by his looks he knew the right place to go come under the sacrifice and come to the house and anoint him but even in that he's still looking i'm in the right place surely this guy's the guy but you see god already knew about david david would not have been as far as stature the people's choice but in the eyes of god he was god's choice and god declared his choice let me just tell you something that choosing of god upon david's life it trumped his size his readiness and all of his inabilities he could rest had been chosen by god there's not a devil big enough that can stop me from getting to the throne i've been anointed for that position i've been anointed to take a rapture are you with me it wasn't david bragging on himself his confidence in battle was the anointing of the word that was on his life he rested in that anointing with situations or else he could say i've been anointed by the word of a prophet it is god's word and i know who i am and i'm going to make it [Music] [Applause] we don't try to be some big person we don't care what the what the people say about us our name ain't nothing it's his name our life is nothing it's his life it's his power not our power there is only one thing that we love to do is see him glorified and how can it be when he's glorified in us by his resurrection that's in us we see him represented again as he was today that's the glory of a real believer is to see christ represented in our life don't read don't don't don't read into this in your own thinking remember god has called you for a purpose and and you're not to compare yourself to somebody else i'm just saying how paul said it that's foolishness we're to compare ourselves with the word what is the word speaking to you what is the word speaking to me so when we see this here him being represented in our life is what is the greatest miracle what's the greatest event that can take place in our life is the new birth it's to where now it's no longer i that liveth but christ that liveth in me it's him being represented he's reproducing himself again in his the womb of the bride oh he says did you get that our desire is not to be glorified our desire no one jesus listen this our desire is not some big name our desire is not boost some church or make more in the sunday school or try to bring in hog tie push in offer a picnic party or bring stars buttons or something like else like that that's not our desire our desire is to see him glorified glorified what not with self-pride but in us our lives to prove he is alive and living in us brother branham has just spoke here in this thing here and he's dealing with as in this particular part of the quote i just read the the avenues even an avenue let me just say it like this having a fellowship dinner what's the motive what's the motive with sisters getting together in a tea party see to not have a balance within this you read it the wrong way the objective is for souls it in the t being drunk that's gonna win somebody's heart but the christ in your life can reach out to somebody they may never tread these grounds but christ inside of your life can reach them and touch them and your life will give them an invitation to say come and see that the lord is good this is why paul said so many times these things are missed the simplicity of it i think of how you know i don't mean to use this example because i i've followed this myself many times but i think about you've heard the testimony with brother jerry and brother tim horner down there in tennessee brother tim i just said playing a flat flat-faced he was preacher burnt he had already seen enough enough preachers he didn't need no other preacher to come to him what he needed was god with skin on it brother jesus showed up at the table you know the story he didn't he didn't give him one scripture he didn't give him one quote there's a time when you need to be the quotes and you need to be the scriptures come on somebody he spoke about rottweilers the whole time you look in brother jerry's dog pen now he don't have a single rottweiler hadn't had one for years i got to thinking about that i thought lord if it was just for that one soul that you allowed him to know enough about that that he could talk to that man and it wasn't rottweilers brother tim didn't walk away from there being more knowledgeable about rottweilers he said there's something different about this man next day was in church by the end of the service he was there he surrendered his heart to god it wasn't the rottweiler that brought him to the altar it was jesus christ that reached out to his life you see if it had been self-pride to say well i've got to give scriptures i've got to go straight in the mouth i got that's self-pride come on somebody it's a time to be the word don't be nothing that you're not [Music] this is why paul could say i though i be free from all men you know what paul said here in the scripture i don't have to i don't have to become weak as they that are weak i don't have to come under the law as day that's under the law but paul said i have done this that i might win them preach somebody he want paul one talking about a compromise he said this i do for the gospel sake that i might be partaker thereof with you let me tell you when it's all said and done and you follow the leading of the lord it's god who gets the glory amen brothers you're in here but i can guarantee you just from knowing in my own self if you were to ask him and say was there a little bit of part about you should i give a scripture now or should i give a quote well sure always sensitive and always open waiting always ready at an appointed time to give something but you see it wasn't what god was going to use in that tool as far as it being spoken here it was what was going to be spoke out from here that would have the effect and prepare and make brother tim ready that was god's grace there was god's grace to what brother jerry could have sat there and glorified all of his understanding his knowledge of the message and man laid it all out and by the time that he wake up brother tim wake up brother tim hear this other part that god has showed me brother tim wake up brother jim he could have done all that that would not have been to the glory of god that would have been glorification of jerry browning bohemian even here and i'm preaching on him tonight but you understand what i'm saying people don't want to know how much you know about the word they want to see the word in you this message never come to make a smarter sharper sharper better debaters and how to take positions that's not what the message come to do the message come that the word might live in the people and that jesus christ might be glorified hallelujah glory be to god hallelujah oh yeah glory be to god in the highest movie i i i can never more testimony but i just got to keep on preaching you see these are things that sometimes this is why we need the balance of the holy spirit coming through the word because we've got a purpose we've got a reason amen we know what that god is in charge now look how brother man makes this statement here uh familiar statement with us throughout the message he said if i can get myself out of the way same quote is the rising of the sun sinkhole if i can get myself out of the way so when william branham not even thought of and you not thought of now notice if i can get myself out of the way this is up this right here is up to william branham this statement here is up to samuel brown this statement here is up to brian hanna it ain't to nobody else oh god you come and get me out of the way no the lord says you get yourself out of the way you yield to me well what brings us about love faith to trust him amen hey if you can see everything you got the p's and q's and i know foreshadow the doubt it's this much effective and this and that they trust but trust is that lord i don't see don't know how i don't understand but i trust you your word see him that's our desire gives us the quickening power and it gives us joy to know that we are with him both flesh and bone of him being the bride of him and seeing his same vindicated methods proving in us that he is now risen from the dead now in reality when when we read that part of the quote brother branham makes that statement many many places in the message perfect perfect strength through perfect weakness it takes a whole a whole service on this we can be very honest right here in this in the part of it that of the quote where it says if i can get myself out of the way in this portion of the quote above i'll just say it like this we theoretically believe it yet when faced with opposition or an otherwise negative experience we are quick to side with myself come on even though yourself is your biggest enemy you pampered that fella or that gal you know has you know and we pampered in a way huh my yeah if i can get myself out of the way and then an experience or something comes and naturally our thoughts our opinions well that's the revelation of jesus christ in the matter i mean everybody should see that we're the ones that's right everybody else is wrong but yet the reality of it is we need to be very honest and say lord help me there's some overcoming that needs to take place right here and lord jesus i believe that greater is he that's in me than he that's in the world i need your help lord help me to die to my thinking my feelings my thoughts in this situation that you can be glorified you see david would pick this up in psalms 44. he said we have heard with our ears oh god our fathers have told us what worked thou didst in their days in the times of old how thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand and plantest them how thou didst afflict the people and cast them out for they got not the land in possession by their own sword neither did their own arm save them but thy right hand and thine arm and the light of thy countenance because thou hadest of favor unto them amen how many want the favor of god amen the favor of god his presence moving by his word to bring us into that place it's a place of his favor notice david goes on i love this thou art my king oh god command deliverances for jacob you know as you read this in a psalm probably as bible readers many of you have already seen this before but it's things that just as astounded me when you look at it you never find this kind of a statement out of saul one time saul never is recorded thou o lord are my king nope saul says i'm king i'm king he never ever places himself that i'm the king under this game come on now see he never is willing to put himself in order oh glory be to god this is why we need the help of the holy spirit that we might be in position and in divine order because when we're not in divine order then divine cannot operate the way it ought to be but everything must operate in the divine order that god has set forth this is why brother iran would take in the greatest bout of fought and he talks about the planets the stars and every one of them in their position now you realize that the jupiter cannot tell saturn get back in position there's not one of them can speak to the other but what they have to do is maintain their position because if one of them gets out of position it'll mess up the whole thing oh i'm grateful to god that the same god who put them in position who put the stars there you know that job wrote read that same bible out there that's in the sky tonight of god wrote his first bible in the heavens job wrote that same bible and god hadn't changed one speck of it he looked at the same same things the maserath orion and all the rest of them and god hadn't changed it one bit it's still the same it's there in its position it has provided and served many down through time how much more has god provided for us and provided for his children in this hour may god help us to stay in position may god help us to recognize you see position and order is not just a state of being it's also that of our heart our heart must remain in the right place this is why the spirit of god would deal with many different things within our life because sometimes our heart our feelings this is what we're talking about vaunteth not itself when things get out of position they get out of order they get out of line but the love of god is there to to bring direction and correction to our life that it might come back in line that the divine one almighty god might operate through his order notice thou are my king o god command deliverance is for jacob through thee will we push down our enemies through thy name we will tread them under that rise up against us for i will not trust in my bow neither shall my sword save me but thou has saved us from our enemies and has put them to shame that hated us in god we boast all the day long and praise thy name forever hallelujah this is the kind of boasting we want we don't want vaunting vaunting that is empty glory we want that boast that is true it's filled with substance and reality and notice this word both that's used here in the scripture it is deals with it's a word that means to be to shine and to be praiseworthy or to flash forth light david would write in this manner the lord is my light and my salvation whom shall i fear the lord is the strength of my life of whom shall i be afraid you see then the scripture would declare to us familiar scripture with you and i of the time that we're living in where the darkness is upon the world darkness is that of of a rejection of light of that of life of the word now darkness has come upon the people a gross darkness but the lord it has risen upon thee where he was held down where the veil had closed him out of man's traditions but now has the lord himself risen upon thee he declaring himself in his same power as same glory and the bible says while darkness is seen upon the people how is that darkness showing up on the people that they don't even know what they're doing it's evil spirits that's at work evil spirits that's crying out to justify sin it's evil spirits that's throughout but the scripture said in this time the glory of the lord shall be seen upon thee that ain't just about us because there's others that are out there in that darkness they need to see that light they need to see a light like a beacon house that stands in the midst when everything else is chaotic and the gross darkness is all around but there is a light that there is illuminated your life it's not darkness you've not been filled with the creeds of man and dogmas it's not darkness it's the light of his presence of his life that illuminates your life to where when it's said and done they may not know what denomination or where do you belong or where it is but there's one thing about it they know that's a christian you got to pray request for prayer take it to them in prayer they'll take it and pray over it because they got confidence in the light of life that's in you glory this is why jesus said in matthew 5 16 let your light so shine before me this is boasting all the day long let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and we're not just talking about we're not talking about going over and getting a you know fruit basket for the poor we're talking about good works good works that are already packed within the seed every leaf every fruit we've been ordained unto good works this isn't working ourselves in it's the expression where the quickening power has come into that seed into that word what's it doing it's expressing the word these are the good words that they might see the good works hallelujah and do what glorify your father which is in heaven let me just say this to you you read through the gospel and there was healing taking place there was things the bible says over and over when as they saw the healings take place they witnessed and they they seen as he was there among them the bible says they glorified god for this visitation they glorified god they knew that it was god among them a man can't do this they glorified god over and over in the scripture how much more that a people could be able to look oh god let it be they could look in our life and listen while the rest of the world is falling and collapsing listen that flash is no different than your flesh but what's the difference god on the inside amen god has chosen you god's anointed you as an overcomer it's not you that liveth it's not you per se by yourself that's overcoming it's an overcoming one within you that's made you an overcomer [Applause] hallelujah it's a voice that speaks from you hallelujah it's not a voice that calls people to a tabernacle that's been erected it's a voice that declares hear ye him the word hallelujah it declares the word has liberty within it this is what peter could say in first peter chapter 2 verse 9 ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation of peculiar people that you should show forth the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light we're not walking by the lights of the heaven we are not walking by the light of the candlesticks but we are walking by the shekinah light this is a light that cannot go out in your spirit your spirit sometimes can get weak it can go out your body can get down under atmospheres and things but there's a light that is inside of you that we read about here that david said in psalms 27 isaiah 60 it is the lord that is the light of your life that even when your spirit wanes or your mind or anything but there is a god on the inside there's a light that's present there to lead you when it seems so dark around you there's a light of one who is present who said yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will feel no evil why david for thou art with me to show forth praises to him now this isn't just a sin glory to god hallelujah it's praises of our life our conduct not just in the good times but it's in those times that are are tough it's in the times that can be rather hard the times as we said that can be so disagreeable our flesh would want to go in a certain direction but the soul says if you do that that's about you now we might as well be honest the times because we all could say this and go through it there's been times where we have we have went according to the flesh and you reap for it and then there's times thanks be to god where there's been a prevailing and an overcoming and that soul has stepped forward to the front and as soon as soon as you let go you know how it is you just feel like yes the battle is already done and you ain't even went to calvary are you with me now you you just had your gethsemane wrestling as brother branham recorded hebrews 5 7 contending with himself glory be to god oh blessed be his name which in times past were not a people you were just we were just scattered here and there we might have been sitting right in the messy church but we still were scattered it wasn't we didn't have any identity in times past we're not of people but are now the people of god which had not obtained mercy but now have obtained mercy we lacked identity even value about our life we couldn't even see i i don't understand i don't see what the words about i don't understand at all i don't do that this and that and then god starts dealing with your life right then things you start looking at things differently what's happening it's the same story brother branham used where a violin nobody was willing to give a penny for it but the master lori who knew how to play that life he walked up and he took your life he took my life everybody said wouldn't give you a penny for him ain't worth nothing but he came forward he took us in his hands he picked us up and he put us right underneath his chin he began to take that bow of predestinated grace and he began to run it over our life now our life had to be tuned up a little bit but he know how to tune it her life was so out of tune with the word it didn't matter how much that we had set in a message church might have known all the quotes but we needed to be tuned by the hand of the master and he picked us up and he started playing and tuning and fine tuning in our life when he got finished as brother branham would dramatize it he said there wasn't a dry eye glory in that auction you took a violin that nobody would bid on but in the hand of the master it became priceless or a bit of god hallelujah there's one who knew how to bring out of that violin the music that was trapped in it can i preach for a minute there's one who knew how to bring the music out of your life he knew exactly how to do it it was trapped in there but god's got a victrola needle there was worm to be expressed trapped in your life and god knew how to bring it out of your life getting in his presence he took your life in his hands and he began to bring out what was canned up in your life you were wanting to let out and he himself gave you liberty to release what was on the inside of you [Music] if i didn't have to preach i'd run hallelujah anybody witness to that hallelujah philippians 2 14 do all things without murmurings and disputings well if we'd apply this this would take care of a lot of facebook posts wouldn't it that ye may be blameless and harmless the sons of god without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation lord have mercy if we're not there we've arrived among whom among whom ye shine as lights in the world don't let your light be clouded do all things without murmurings and disputings do you recognize what that says there are some things that you can have murmurings and grumblings over i don't like this and i wish this wasn't and i listen and we can have disputing so i'll tell you what this and that you might have and we all have maybe our own feelings our own opinions on certain things maybe your opinions are the gospel on it but for the reality and for the sake of the light of god that rest in your bosom do not let murmurings and disputings bring a reproach or a darkening to the light among whom ye shine as lights in the world holding forth holding fast the word of life that i may rejoice in the day of christ that i have not run in vain neither labored in vain notice what jesus said let me try to work here on this part jesus as he is an intercessory prayer this is after the supper now they've come they've come apart they're in the garden and here is the intercession that he would make i have glorified thee on earth i have finished the work which thou gavest me to do now remember the son could do nothing but what he seeth the father doing but you see now as god would reveal to him this what's to be done here this step this stage of the journey this part that he was at it was all god working that indeed the fulfillment of the word the purpose that he was sent for might come to completion and this is the testimony that the lord jesus could give in prayer i have glorified thee on earth i tell you what a prayer this is what my desire is that we could say of an evening when we're in devotion lord i'll glorify thee this day not bragging it's not us bonting but lord i've glorified me this day and maybe if the rest of the family could see it there might have been people that's run you down people that said all sorts of things against you people that's crossed you you know they pushed your buttons your holy buttons you know and yet here you have been able to say god by your grace i've glorified thee today you have lord jesus by your grace i've conducted myself as a son and daughter of god lord it wasn't something that was that was easy as far as on my part but i want to thank you for divine assistance thank you for strength amen hey we ought to thank him as much as many times we ask him to forgive us is that right now let's just look at this here just just a moment remember i read this to you last week remember how paul would write and he would remind the people of god that no flesh should glory in the presence of god paul would write how that what god has chosen god chose things that are deemed foolish things that were deemed weak things that were deemed base base means insignificant things that are not or nothing to bring to nothing the things that are this is god's choosing now god could have chose many mighty people he could have chose all that now paul didn't say he didn't choose son but he's letting us see that the choosing of god you see even with us that would be weak and base and everything else that we can look at god has his hands full with us in us being able to stay in a place of humility it isn't that we want to bond ourselves it isn't that we want the glory but god knows even in ourselves our desire and just as he gave paul divine assistance god gives you and i divine assistance that he might be able to use us god never wants us to feel like it's us or get to a place where it's so big that you know everything's going so good maybe i don't need to pray as much as i used to maybe i don't need to listen to messages much i look maybe i don't need to read as much you know everything just going so good [Music] oh you're starting to vaunt there a little bit but just remember your your victory is in his life is his life in you and it's just like a fire your fire will only burn as bright as you feed it the more you feed the fire the brighter it burns the more that you put in the fire more brother bam said when they were walking around over there in africa and they had well they gave me this little thing and it scared away you know the line brother said it wasn't that discarded away it was the fire that scared away that enemy what is it that would scare away the enemy the fire an enemy will approach when the fire starts burning down what do i have to do keep feeding the fire keep feeding the fire keep feeding your experience feed your experience keep feeding the fire keep feeding the fire is that right well you're not feeding the fire oh i wonder what's coming next just keep feeding the fire get some more hot dogs out get some more marshmallows out don't worry about the enemy just enjoy the word enjoy the effects of the word just keep feeding the fire mean when we would have you know the young people over and i'll tell you especially at our other house my goodness there'd be mosquitoes buzzing around all over the place and we had them you know them tiki lamps lined profits they didn't scare away none of them mosquitoes at all but i'll tell you as soon as they started building that fire up and things like that and josh would help us you know doing that and brian and there they would get that fire going we knew as soon as you get that fire going the smoke from that fire we didn't have to worry about the mosquitoes very much anymore you know what it didn't mean that the mosquitoes weren't out there they were still there but you know what they could buzz all they wanted to out there but we were fixing hot dogs in here having marshmallows right here i think i'll take another bowl that chili i think i'll take some more chips i think i'll take some more of this what was doing that the fire gave us liberty to enjoy ourselves hallelujah and feeding the fire in your life will enjoy you will allow you to enjoy the liberty of the lord in the midst of darkness in the midst of darkness hallelujah you see let me just bring it down into this the baggage many times that we enter into this life we bring you know brother brown would talk about it like a grab bag things that you and i come in with and we inherit we didn't ask there's other experiences in our life that we experienced we didn't ask to experience and you see these are things that really they work for to our molding to our shaping of our character our thinking our mindset in many situations oftentimes it's because of those things that we respond the way we respond are you with me now you you can say brother samuel i've been born again of the spirit of god but remember let your light shine let this mind be in you that was also in christ jesus we go on and on as paul would deal with things through ephesians through colossians and even into galatians dealing with the saints of god to let that new man have the right of way in your life is that right so now this is why because our character we know that our character is molded by the life that we have in us this is why we must be born again we've got to receive the life of the father within us sometimes our upbringing and experiences they can shape the way when we view others or happenings it can still affect us this is why i want you just to listen to this this is why it's just inspiration the lord just moving on my heart this is why let this mind be in you that was in christ jesus who thought it not robbery or rather a thing to be grasped after to be equal with god in other words he was not it was not something that he felt compelled to prove that he was the son of god but rather he relied upon what the father made him when it was time for a further fulfillment of the word he being in tune with his father that was in him in humility would ask the father glorify thou me with the glory that i had with thee before the world began see he knew what god had made he knew where he was tied into glorify thou me with the glory that i had with thee before the world begins now god was already being glorified in the sun he was already being glorified the glory of god was already being made manifest in his life but it shows there was a further glory that was needed in order to fulfill that portion that was left to be fulfilled in his life and he asked glorified thou me with that glory that i had before the world began hallelujah certainly not how the world would think about it the world would look at that like shock and awe i thought no no the simple humble work that would be done in such simplicity but through that would release the glory of god into the hearts of others think of this his purpose achievement of the lord working in that life of the lord jesus as our kinsmen redeemer think of when he stood there in pilate's judgment hall he declared for this purpose came i into the world by worldly standards the world would have said oh really a purpose to die don't you know i could crucify you don't you know right thou could just have no power over me that's right come on this is where the bride is standing accept it be given thee see the bride know where she's standing no power it could not be given you except it be given of my fault he knew his life was in the hands of the father are you talking about good hands brother this is blessed assurance hallelujah he was purposed for redemption and it would take listen to me now it would take the glory of god the capping of his purpose in humility to go to california think of that the capping of the promise came with the greatest submission and request for the father to glorify thou me with thyself it was not any selfish motives or objectives but rather the glory of god the unfolding of the presence of god that is allotted in the word the divine energy in order for the word to be fulfilled through simplicity in a yielded vessel for he was led as a lamb led to the slaughter you see what the glory of god did that he was asking for glorify thou me with the glory i had with thee before the world began this is what that glory did it brought the greatest submission of one who was able to fulfill what was echoed even on matthew 17 mount transfiguration you know this brought this glory don't you see the glory of god being revealed and moving in our life what does it do it brings submission it brings yielding it brings us giving in which allows god to step in jesus said like this i'm closing when he would say in john 17 and i don't have time to read all that i want to go to another scripture after this and then we'll just close jesus said now is the hour that the son of man is to be glorified and he makes a statement that you and i are familiar with except a corn of wheat fall in the ground and die it abideth alone how many know he said it ain't good for man to be alone but except he'd fall in the ground and die he'd abide us alone but if it died it bringeth forth much fruit jesus goes on and he says this in john 13 we'll just try to pick these two here he stands in john 13 the chapter later verse 31 when judas had left judas dipped in the salt and he left i want you to think think of what's taking place think of the setting the word has given judas believe you can go do whatever you're going to do notice do whatever thou doest do it quickly judas went out he had his selfish desire the whole time never took care of that it eventually got him this is why there's got to be a death to self yes and through that it makes way that as paul said i die daily why that he might be glorified so judas is left now jesus said is the son of man glorified and god is glorified in him if god be glorified in him god also shall also glorify him in himself and shall straightway glorify him so here he is god the son of man who who was ordained for this moment ordained for this position is being glorified god is being glorified in him the word itself that is spoke of this moment is being glorified the disciples don't realize it at that time but after his resurrection he begins to reveal to them the word that is glorified in their day and that word will take them into their glory are you with me what look look at this little children yet a little while i'm with you ye shall seek me and as i said unto the jews whether i go you cannot come so now i say to you a new commandment i give unto you that you love one another as i've loved you that you also love one another and by this shall all men know that you are my disciples if you have love one for another this is the son of man being glorified i wonder i wonder when we look at that portion of the word let's just close here is the reality of the god of glory being glorified in the son of man is it is it the lord jesus himself now being glorified in his fullness in the life of the bride yeah but that glory that glory is that he would have preeminence is that right i wonder if it's so surrendered say god let me be so surrendered to you that the love of god has such preeminence in every part of my life in every circumstance in every offense in every testimony may you be glorified and may lord god you be glorified and that i would be glorified not me showing up but that my actions and everything would be word based based in the word amen why because outside of the word is not glorified the only glory there is the only boasting there is is in him amen let's pray i'd say this as we get ready to pray here may the lord grant us the glorification of himself living in the closing hour in the closing moments that is the bride body here he is the mighty god unveiled before us walking living dwelling in his fullness right in the midst of the bride body we being a part of that body by god's grace may the lord grant us the glorification of himself well what is that the equipping of his strength of the divine energy of the vine moving through the branch being able to submit our own will fully to his purpose that he can fully work through us it's no wonder we need to live in his presence he's our liberty he's our all in all think of it many people they'll never read a bible but they read you they read me brother brown would say like this in one place he said you might think nobody's watching your life he said but somebody's watching your life somebody's watching your actions somebody's watching your behavior may god help it help us to be so yielded to him you know sometimes before there's ever action sometimes it'd be all you know it always begins with thoughts sometimes you can let thoughts feelings you can let things compound and accumulate [Music] no matter what the situation no matter what the need the greatest thing that we can do in the midst the presence of our lord jesus is to say lord help me lord help me to be able lord to really take account of myself base weak foolish things that are not let me lord god don't let me look to be upon others but let me lord take a real reflection into my own life sometimes the very things that it hinders god but we want to let god have his way i pray tonight that as we go to the lord in prayer maybe as we would go to the lord in prayer say god help us help me to be very honest help me to look deep in my life help me lord jesus when situations arise help me to realize lord god that it's i'm not the one who's perfect and somebody else needs correction but help me to recognize lord god that i need that molding that shaping lord god in my life it might mean lord god that experienced that lord jesus you moved me through that would help me and teach me by your presence through your word it would relieve lord what a hold may be a hold of a thought a hold of a feeling a perception it would relieve that holy lord god may we lord jesus in obedience to your word through your spirit pull down strongholds lord help us tonight lord you're the one who heals us lord now lord jesus as we come before you tonight lord jesus my hands are up before you my heart lord god those that are here gathered lord those are on the way of the internet lord there's one desire that we have that's to see you glorified it's not any program it's not anything lord of this church it's not anything lord but it's to see you glorified lord it's true you've been glorified is the resurrected lord jesus in us vindicated methods lord your life lord jesus [Music] help us lord god in this moment help us lord i pray may dear god the glory lord that is for this moment is for this season lord may the divine energy o god may it just flow lord god down into the depths of our life lord

hearts lord they're looking lord we look like david lord that was anointed lord with the word i believe lord god not so much that i'm going to make it i've already made it but god help me lord god to yield myself lord help me lord god to lay aside every weight lord every sin that does so easily beset us lord help us lord god any feeling lord anything lord that would hinder lord god you from being glorified in our midst lord god may we just lay it down lord god may we ask you lord to help us lord grant it lord we pray lord jesus we ask it now in the name of jesus christ [Music] amen [Music] and
