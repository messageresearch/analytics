asked you to come Lord for it's your voice Lord that has the words of life and I pray God as we yield ourselves to you Lord that you will anoint us for that purpose we ask it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and to the glory of God amen terms mean your Bibles to John chapter 14 I want to read verses 1 through 8 let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there you may be also and whether I go you know and the way you know Thomas saith unto Him Lord we know not whether thou goest and how can we know the way and Jesus said I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto me cometh unto the father but by me if he had known me you should have known my father also and from henceforth you know him and have seen him and Philip saith unto Him Lord show us the father and it suffice us may be seated what I wanted to minister on this morning is show us the father brother Branham says and the message preached in 53 said let's take God in his universe God in His Word God and his son and then bring God down in his people and see if he isn't here in his people today you know the first Bible wasn't written in Word form God wrote it in the universe brother Branham said his first Bible was in he saw God in nature he spoke and said you know how you have a flower garden and you plant your flowers and they're there for a season and then as the first frost comes and the flowers die the petals fall off the stem dries up and everything's gone there's no nothing there to say there ever was a flower there and he says aniseed those down on the ground and when the freeze comes and freezes about 4 to 5 inches down into the ground the seed bursts open their industry there's nothing left everything's gone except there's a germ of life that no man has ever found and never will there's a germ of life that's laying there and as sure as there is a tomorrow when the spring comes that flower would come back forth again brother Branham said if God can make a flower that way how much more man that we're here for a season and those of us that go by the way of the grave there's nothing left behind physically to show we were ever even here just like the flower it's gone you're gone but just as sure as that flower races in the spring so will you in the resurrection I like that song brother Terry till those things there will be another spring a man will rise again I'm brother brown I'm spoken in a message preached in 53 and he said there was a hybrid man-made seed of corn and he said if you at that time and said if you took that man-made seed of corn and put it to the one that had grown in the field he said you couldn't tell the difference between they both look the same he said if you cut him open they both seemed the same but he said the only way you could tell the difference was to bury him and said when you bury him the ones just wanted they're both going to rot but one's just gonna rot and be no more but the one that has the germ of life in it is gonna come forth again and it'll bring bring forth a stalk of corn and then you take those seeds and plant those and they'll bring forth stalks of corn he was telling this to a preacher one time and he said preacher you better hold my hand because I'm getting ready to embarrass you he said this is just making me very real religious you can take two men both them look alike both of them act like Christians but one of them's got a germ of life which is the Holy Ghost and you'll rise in the resurrection and the other will lay there you know to see the Bible in nature it's not just to see God's in nature because of the magnificence of it but there's a manifestation of God's Word in action in nature remember when brother branham witness to the infidel brother branham didn't quote any scriptures from the Bible brother Branham began to point at God in nature and the infidel then saw God in nature I looked it up thinking about this earth that we live on and I looked it up when the earth is twenty five thousand miles around at the equator and it makes a full turn every 24 hours that means it's traveling at one thousand forty one point seven miles per hour how do we stand in one place you say gravity explained to me showed me gravity they said gravity is produced because the world is spinning around that's what science says but cut me off a piece of gravity and give it to me try to can up some gravity you can't do it to me it's a mystery of God say what keeps us on this earth because we're supposed to be here that's what I say that's where God put us and it don't matter how fast the Earth spins or how slow it spins God put us here we're going to be here until the coming of the Lord it orbits around the Sun at 67,000 miles per hour and it just hangs up there what keeps the earth up there it's God the Creator he put it there by what manner did he put it there by a spoken word he spoke the word and it became the power of the spoken word you know brother Branham said if man could just open his eyes and look around he'd see God everywhere want to read this to you around says he said I looked and the Sun was setting over on the west peeping through that crevice of the mountains like that I thought old great Jehovah his eye on the sparrow how did he stands in the heavens and his eyes look out and he sees every move not a sparrow could touch the ground without him seeing it you see God in his son said can't you see him that way think of him in the sunset or the sunrise and then I happened to look where the Sun was shining against this water and stuff and it made a rainbow across the canyon there and I looked at the rainbow and said Oh glory to God I just love to look at God in his nature don't you and I said looky there you gave Noah the rainbow sign before the time the water had never come this way so the waters the elements couldn't make that colors and now you gave him the rainbow sign that you would never destroy the earth no more by water then I happen to think again that when John on the Isle of Patmos turned around and seen Jesus sitting there to look upon as a rainbow his sardis and jasper stones which was Reuben and Benjamin and the first and last which he is and which is shall come the root and offspring of David the Morningstar and over him was a rainbow with seven golden candlesticks meaning that he had a covenant for the last seven church ages and when the deep beginning to call to the deep rolled down in my heart I said God Here I am way up here it's supposed to be hunting and I got real happy and I set down my gun and rounding around the tree I win just as shouting as hard as I could somebody come up there they'd have probably put me in an institution for insanity but I was having a glorious time and they can say crazy if they want to don't make me no difference I got my eyes on Calvary and I loved him I worship Him I seen him out there and I said God there you are in the sunset here you are in the rainbow there you are in the wolf over there you are in the elk oh where are you lord and here you are in my heart and I said glory to God around around around around that tree I went again well I was just having a big time just kicking up the brush and everything else God out in the universe God all over the earth and he said in God in me in my heart that's a mystery hidden the message to you 9 time ensign brother branham said fish unites themselves before going before the spring run out in the ocean you can find them what we call Humpy's the salmon and when they come up there before the run comes in you'll see them by the tens of thousands out in the sea coming around the round salt salt water but they're actually freshwater fish and here they come right up that fresh water and they go up for a spawning season and they go up there and spawn about every four years and die as soon as they spawn and you know they're going to die and you couldn't stop them for nothing they'll jump fish ladders and everything else getting up there knowing they're going to their death but the law of nature makes them knowing that they go up there and spawn in the old and die and the young ones come off and something unites them together then and out into the ocean they go it's uniting it's a law you just can't be God's law pardon me I looked it up salmon spend about 3 to 5 years in the ocean until they reach maturity as soon as they reach maturity they come up and gather themselves into the bay and they wait there and wait there and wait for the rain to come for the rain to come and for it to raise the waters levels up and then they start going up the stream I thought about that and I thought you know if we would just stay in the presence of the word as it's being preached and just stay there and keep waiting there be patient God's doing the work and he promised you know what he promised he promised he would finish the good work that he started they fight to get back to where they came from where they respond that they recognize the water in the very place by the sense of smell it's the sense of smell in the water how they know where to go they say that salmon that have been raised in the hatchery and let to go out in the ocean will come back and try to jump into the pipe going back into the hatchery because that's where they came from hallelujah there's a sixth sense that the believer has it's called faith and that's how we know where we came from and where we came from we're going back amen hallelujah God testifying in nature and we're gonna go back and we'll jump through trials and everything else nothing's gonna stop us just like it couldn't stop the salmon there's nothing gonna be able to stop this why it's where we came from the devil's got up his traps and his nets and everything else but you know why we're gonna make it because we're ordained to make [Music] [Applause] hallelujah I looked up and studied about another animal an insect it's called the monarch butterfly and I found them to be quite interesting and they eat from the milkweed plant that's where that they'll lay their eggs on the underside of the leaf of the milkweed plant and when the young hatches first eats the shell which which encased it and then it begins to eat on the milkweed plant and the only thing it does just eat it just keeps eating and you know if if that caterpillar had emotions it would say the only thing that makes us happy is eating eating from that plant that's the only thing that makes us believer happy eating of the Word of God we can't go without it we've got to have it people don't understand you for that people that go to church just to be a church member and say that they're a church member and you know better not the preaching go longer than about 10 to 12 minutes 15 at the most I've preached before and and crammed a lot in 15 minutes but I'm glad I don't have to go by that timeframe this morning it feeds for about two weeks and develops into a caterpillar about two inches long then after a while that counter pillar attaches itself to a twig there and begins to weave from a gland that's in its mouth it weaves a cocoon around itself until it's completely encased and then it takes about two weeks in about two weeks time you can see through that cocoon that becomes translucent you can see the outline of that butterfly that's formed inside that could come you know what it's waiting for it's waiting for to come forth from that cocoon and when it comes forth its wings are all wet and gooey in that they're kind of plaster down so it begins to pump blood out to those wings and the wings begin to expand and they begin to to dry in the air and then when blood is pumped all through the wings and they've dried in the air then the butterfly can fly but you know there's something that protects it and what protects it is a poison that's inside the milkweed what protects it is it's protected by what it needs and they say it doesn't need any camouflage but instead it has that bright orange color on it the work can be readily seen and that tells the birds and so forth don't touch them that's just something God in nature [Applause] they'll travel for miles some of them travel 1802 miles to from where they were born in this summer to where they're going to winter at and they don't produce in the winter they have to come back and it's the next spring they winter they come and gather about they said in southern Canada and begin to migrate south and some migrate to Mexico and some others migrated to Cuba sums of the Pacific Grove as well as California they traveled great miles we're traveling on a long journey and we're waiting we're waiting as we toured it what is it to produce Christ turns me to John chapter one John chapter 1 verses 12 and 13 brothers excuse me you're my mouth's a little dry this morning but as many as received him to them gave he the power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of God I wrote some notes down here to myself it takes grace to turn an ugly caterpillar into a beautiful butterfly everything the caterpillar needs to become a butterfly is already in him when he's born he just has to eat there's not really any beauty about the caterpillar you can't look at him and imagine that he could possibly change or transform into something beautiful if the process of transformation of God's sons and daughters you might look at them in a caterpillar stage and say how ugly why these are not perfect they shouldn't be happy and shouting why they're just ugly caterpillars you're right but we're gonna stay in the presence of Jehovah and keep eating the word and drinking of the spirit until one day I'll be even as he is I thought about the bride coming forth from the Seven Church ages it's like a cocoon that has kept the bride but brother Branham said now the whole bride the bride the part of the bride from each age coming together oh there's a great uniting that's gonna happen amen it's not just us or those from our church age that come up in the resurrection with the bride from every age comes up in the resurrection how to loo your that wonderful that's to me to fathom that to fathom the resurrection to begin with is by faith we take it and accept it but then we've heard maybe perhaps most of our lives about the resurrection and about our loved ones coming back but it ain't just them Paul's gonna arise too and it's not just him all those that believe the word he preached they're gonna resurrect to all those ones that gave their lives during the time of the Dark Ages they're going to rise again hallelujah brother Branham said the angel told him to each be gathered to their own and when they come up before the Lord he said will be presented first that messenger and said if he's accepted then all of those that believed his message will be accepted he said if he's accepted said which he will be which he will be and he said there's voices that shouted were counting on the house hallelujah aren't we counting on that honey he said will Paul have to come up and be presented the same way said yes he said well then I preached what Paul preached I Tim preached nothing different he said then what Paul preached amen I don't got nothing to preach yourself what the Prophet preached hallelujah and I'm happy to do it oh my I tell you his grace is sufficient isn't I think about the grace of God in my own life and how did there was times like I could have lost my life once over in the Gulf I stopped with my foot just hovering over a tripwire of of mine and I stopped because someone else saw it and screamed out my name and I stopped mid-step they said don't move I looked down there was it was God because that individual be able to see because that individual was setting up in a truck and I was going to ground guiding and he saw it from setting up in a truck it was God that directed him to see it and call out my name he said why didn't God direct you to see it God wanted me to know that it wasn't anything that I could do to save myself I was running from the Lord that's why I ended up over there I was running from God I was running from the call of God on my life I didn't want nothing to do with it anymore I wanted to be free from it but you know what you can run as hard as you can when God has called you nor danger you'll never get away from him you might leave and try your best to get away but you know what the word that you've said under will keep ringing in your ear and there's something in your heart that never quits pulley and there's a desire that you just can't escape and that's a desire to actually serve God I remember praying when I was over in the Gulf and it was like there was a dark sheet had dropped down it was like there wasn't no God at all no matter what I said when I prayed it seemed like there was no God that he wasn't hearing me then one day when we were crossing the border into Iraq I begin to pray in myself sitting in the cab of a truck we were pulling the command center behind us in this truck and there was another young boy that worked for me that was driving the truck and I began to pray then was in myself and I said God if I went too far I'm sorry and if I went too far but I'm going to go to hell it's because I deserve it it's not because of you I still love you and I said but even if I went too far if you just spare me why I can go back and get my kids in church I'll do it even if I've got to do it and knowing that in the end I won't wake it and then I ask God I said Lord I know I'm here because I was running from me and I said so don't let none of these boys and women and men that's with me don't let none of them lose their life not one of them it was we lost her life when I said that the presence of God is held down into the cab of that truck young man that was driving a truck looked at me and he said what is that I sense the presence of God I said I've been running from God I said now he's answered my prayer he said he started crying he said I'm a Pentecostal boy from Kentucky and he said I've been running from God to things that I wanted to get right so he got right sitting in the cab of that truck His grace is sufficient and the message is super signed brother Branham said when God gave the sign this will be a sign God will be dwelling in flesh you knew that would attract the people it did for as many as received him to them gave me the power to become sons of God and it's supposed to attract the evening light people when the same light shows God and Christ are one Peter said let it be known unto you that God's made the same Jesus whom you crucified both Lord and Christ a sign evil spoken of but the evening light is here there's something that has attracted us in this day and you know there could be many that some we would come in contact with sometimes even family members they would look and say well you're in a cold but I'm not following a man I'm following the message and God had brother and said God could have chosen any way that he wanted for the word to be delivered he could have chosen the Stars he could have chosen the son of the moon said but he didn't he chose man and I believe that's one thing that all people all word they just can agree upon God chose man to do it and I believe that we received a prophet in this last in time and I believe that the message has gathered the people the evening light people brother BAM call us I'm a mess of perfection he said now he knows you he knows every one of you he knows just what you're desiring as many as received him to them gave he the power to become sons and daughters of God hallelujah who did he give the power to to us to become sons and daughters of God do you know what we had to be born sons and daughters of law to become sons and daughters of God the message of mighty God and build he said but when he come Express exactly like the Testament said he would be expressed then all those who was redeemable believed it because they were thoughts of God the attributes of him at the beginning was made flesh and redeemable and was brought back to guard as many as received him to them gave he the power to become sons of God because they were redeemable they were from the beginning in the expression I often think about the woman at the well who was a Samaritan and I like the way jesus said I have need to go by Samaria he told his disciples I have need to go by Samaria I'm glad yet need to go by where I was I'm glad he yet need to go by where I was you god bless you brother crest I was thinking about you on Thursday we certain a song then Jesus came and every time I sing that song makes me think about you brother really crest me y'all maybe you don't know him as long as I've known him you just sing that song and nobody could sing it like he did power of God redeemable that woman that the well was a redeemable thought of God brother branham said in the back part of god's mind he had some thoughts and he says and those thoughts were expressed and became flesh here on earth and those thought because they were in his mind from the beginning they're redeemable redeemable thoughts of God and every one of them will be redeemed no man can come to me he says except the father draws him and all the father have past tense given to me will come to me to the word how can they come unless they were ordained to come as many as received him to them gave you the power to become sons of God see because their names were on the book he come to redeem that that was on the book think about that our names were on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world think about that before your mom and dad before your grandparents before your great-grandparents before your great-great grandparents before any of your ancestors before any of mankind ever came on this earth before there wasn't earth before there was a son before there was anything when there was nothing but God [Applause] your names were written on the Lamb's Book of Life it wasn't at some time later on that our names came on there it wasn't that God looked down and said well I think I liked this individual pretty much I think I'll put his name on there no you were thoughts of God we were already in the mind of God when there was nothing that exists but God before there angels to worship God even brother man said before there was angels he wasn't even God he was just a self existing one so even before he was God your name was on the Lamb's Book of Life [Applause] praise be to God you couldn't help become and there was nothing gonna keep you from the pure truth the common people heard him gladly says in the message of Christ the common people heard him gladly and as many as came to him to them gave he the power to become sons and daughters of God in glory tonight anchored away until a day of complete Redemption the body being raised again or the body change I don't know about you but I have a fight every day with this old flesh I would think by now maybe I could have had this old boy conquered but then I realized the only way you're ever going to conquer this flesh is to kill it and one day the I thought about in the garden how that when Jesus cursed the serpent he said on your belly shot that crawl and the dust shall you eat all the days of your life before the de serpent became something that slid it on the ground he walked on two legs he was a closest thing to man so what changed him how did he change it wasn't magic but because God spoke the word you know we're all made up of molecules and atoms and what they call everything has a molecular structure this desk has a molecular structure that makes it solid water has a molecular structure that makes it liquid and I thought what changed the serpent to be like a snake by the spoken word of God the molecular structure of that serpent changed if God by the spoken word could change the Serpent's molecular structure then there's something wrong with our molecular structure because we weren't created to be sick we weren't created to grow old we weren't created to die God created us to live so all it's going to be is a spoken word of God that will change this molecular structure which we're walking around in now and it'll be a new body I'm looking forward to that new body I have dreams from time to time about getting a new body and there's one thing I always remember about every dream that new body had hair one of these days it's going to be there again brother Brown said he never lost the one of them I heard somebody criticized brother Branham over that I said well then why if he never lost the one why was he bald well all the hairs still there is just something happened that makes it worry it won't it won't grow and stay it'll break off as it grows that's the truth you ask any brother that's lost his hair if his head looks slick on top that's cause he shaves it that's the truth the hair is still there under the skin it just won't grow but one day it's going to be there again I don't get me wrong it ain't just hair I'm looking forward to as I got older I get aches and pains I never had before there's things I look around I see young men in their teens or early 20s and I see things they do and I know I can't do it anymore nice to go out and play ball and play football and all that play tackle Lord I wouldn't want to play tackle today I went out and I tried to play baseball with some young people I limped around for three weeks I pulled something I don't even know what it was this body hurts and it's dying everyday you know we've got loved ones just went on by the way the grave and we're looking forward we know where they are and we we can take the Bible says comfort one another with these words and we can take comfort from that knowing where they are and knowing there's going to be a resurrection but we got loved ones are still here and if we were asked to be honest say are we ready for them to go on and we want them to stay we'd say we want them to stay well somebody's got to be alive and remaining when the rapture takes place we can't all go by the way of the grade somebody's got to be here because that part to God's words got to be fulfilled as well and so I hate to watch my loved ones grow older I know I'm getting older as I get older they get older and I look and I see the signs things that happens to him because they're growing old and I wish they didn't have to grow whole Samuels little boy the other day said my mom's not looking old is she oh I tell you when I got memories that I don't want I got memories I can't get rid of and they haunt me from time to time I know what it is Satan can get around in that realm and try to cause trouble and he'll bring up things from your memory so remember when you're done this remember when you did that and it'll haunt you but one day I'm gonna receive a new mind and the memory of sin the memory of sins want to be wiped away I hate to talk to maybe my loved ones not making it but I know when I get a new memory I'll never remember them as that only ones I have memory are the ones that did make it cuz Heaven's not going to be a sorrowful place where the RAM said in one place that we first get there we'll look around and we'll see what's on so it didn't make it or so and so didn't make it you said but then he'll come around and wipe our memories clean yeah and when we remember it anymore there's not going to be no tears no sorrow I was thinking this morning I asked my mom I said you think dad's made it around to everybody he knew yet as we were talking about so many that we had known that's went on to see the Lord some you don't know him it's some of you here this morning with no I brought mentioned in my mom about brother Hankins and he's done went on to be with the Lord and we got to just mention about different ones we've been talking about it since my dad passed mom showed me a picture the other day it was brother Miranda and my dads together at a fellow shoot I thought they're together again and you know what they're not feeling any sorrow because they've left us here they don't know any sorrow but they're waiting they got maybe more that they'll greet on that side before the rapture takes place but they're waiting on the resurrection just as much as you are they know where they are and they know that there's coming a resurrection and they know that they'll be reunited with their loved ones here but they know it in a greater way than what we can know it being here on this side I believe that it's even greater identified Christ of all ages for the Benham says but the Word was made manifest as many as received him to him them gave me the power to become sons of God and so it is today when we see this great Holy Ghost move made manifest as many as received him to them gave me the power to become sons and daughters of God Christ identified the same by his in every generation how do we know that gods in our mist by the manifestation of the word as it's transforming you and I we're being transformed by the renewing of our minds we're being changed and it started on the inside and it's working its way and working its way and working its way we look in the mirror and we see what living in this falling condition it does to us but we're being transformed we're changing inside and one day the outside is going to change to match the inside I like brother Branham said God took a picture of us when before the foundation of the world think about that before sin had ever touched us before sickness had ever touched us before age had ever touched us and he says this life is just the negative and to get the picture you got to develop the negative but we're going to go back to be exactly like that picture God took of us before the beginning hallelujah do you know what that means the body that we'll be in then will have never known sin well they've never known sin I look forward to that I look forward to that to be manifest in a body that has never known sin I heard minister say many times one minister said he said I want to be there when the Lord kicks the devil in the pit and I thought I want to be right there with you I want to be part of that too I saw my son beginning when they crown him Lord of all I'll be there well I want to be there also when he kicks the devil into the pit at the end of the millennium why because that old boy heads gave me a lot of problems there's been a change in there's been a change in you you know what I know you're glad you're not who you used to be never glorify that old man I've seen people talk about someone's grandfather until in their eyes they became glorified and they talked about the old man before he became to serve the Lord I've become glorified in the eyes of the grandson he said I'd like I'd like to know him when he was like that he wouldn't he that grandfather wouldn't want him to be known that way this and everything we say and do let's give God glory let's tell let's tell our loved ones that are here with us let's tell our children about the change that God's wrought in our lives and let's testify to them there needs to be a change having in them if they're going to make this rapture hallelujah he's wonderful I see God everything I look at around me we see God everywhere show us the father and trust this morning that maybe I've just brought back to your remembrance these things to encourage you it's same God that's all around us is in us this we talk about the universe and how great it is how magnificent Stars hanging in space and so on did you know what the greatest miracle is they say there's a miracle of birth when they young when the child is born it's a miracle you know what's even a greater miracle it's when they're changed when they received the change and become born-again Christians that is a miracle people say where are the miracles that's where they're at we're being changed I'll tell you what friends I want to see all my kids changed and enough time Terry's I want to see my grandchildren come to serve the Lord and I keep before my grandchildren I keep before them the things of the Lord I'd like to see them rejoice in church I know Samuel I can't preach without mention grandchildren one time or two Sam used to always tease me about it y'all know brother David you know his son Michael well Michael gets out and dances just like David does he gets up on the table of the coffee table at home stands up there and he gets older something that he pretends as a microphone and he'll just talk and talking talking talking I say he's testifying he'll just talking talking talking there and then then he'll start singing a song he does exactly what he's seen his daddy do brother David can't get up and sing with that first testifies and I think that's wonderful because God has changed brother David in such a way that that's the reflection that he's having on his son that's the example that's being laid down you know if you take and put them under the atmosphere of the world you'll see that begin to reflect on them but keep them under the atmosphere of God I remember Sammy and I was talking about this the other day I remember staying at my grandmother Browning's house and we would we'd pray a couple of times a day she'd had prayer and when it was time to pray why I had to get down to she made sure I coming in the room and got down to pray too and I remember thinking just a young boy how much longer is she gonna be praying I remember when I got a little older I was out mowing their lawn one time and I was a teenager and I was I hadn't dedicated my life to God and I came in walked in through the utility room and when I walked in there I heard her call out my name in prayer but I slipped on back out the door but I never forgot it I was raised in there Chris Christian atmosphere the Bible says raise a child in the way she should go when it's old you know not the part where as a teenager I had to have my own experience just like mom and dad had I had to have my own experience with God and in the right time it's season idea how does the list and who seem that song open the eyes of my heart [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I want to see you open the eyes of my heart

[Music] [Music] don't you're loving this morning appreciate the word of the Lord let's just thinking Alleluia you know that that that butterfly if it had a voice as far as why you and I have a voice you would thank God for that milkweed it would thank God for the points in it but you know it does have a voice its voice is not like how you and I would say words but it has a voice that is a greater voice than even words it has a voice that expresses the mystery that's in the milk thistle plant through its life because this is not the blood of Abel that says you're guilty you're guilty you're guilty this blood as the Prophet said in a message talking this blood he said you all came it can change Abel's blood can only point out the wrong but the blood of Jesus Christ can say cane I can change you sure is out getting change King because he released his Abel on the inside and Abel on the inside brings Cain subject to the word greater is He that is in you this is the blood of Jesus speaking better things even through our life were living day by day his prophesy we're seeking a city whose builder and maker is gone because we've already met the king and priest of that city a man the prophet of that city I'm not Catholic none other than the Lord Jesus Christ is amen amen the angel of the Lord the Holy Spirit Christ Himself moving in our midst to draw us into that place and give us what we need to cross oh my what a blessed moment where we are standing in the brink of time right now thank God for His grace the only thing that we see the admonition we look at those things at times we can look at the things in nature look at nobody told him it's like the trapdoor spider and those things you know sometimes I I've seen a little moody films I I still looking back from what we're back from the 67 I still look at how those left there with amazement each time and I say you know nobody thought this this baby trapdoor spider nobody taught it that when it hatches eat eat that you know or even that Walsh Meleager that one got to remember the trapdoor spider part but nobody would that teaches that that that wasp when it and he hatches to start eating the tranche Allah that its mother killed and put there in the ground nobody has to tell it start eating this it knows when it's born that's the same thing with houses children of God the Word of God it just rings in our hearts we don't know the full depths of it we don't know that but one more as we're feasting on it we're we're drawing in the strength and what we're drawing in is it's like an invisible substance it doesn't have that color but inside of us it brings forth the color that is in that substance I thought of that when the Spirit of God was bringing that out this morning I thought of revelations 9 oh I love that chapter you say how can you love that chapter it talks about those there's all those that the bit being loosen and all those demon spirits and everything and that tells like scorpions because the beginning of the next chapter revelations 10 verse 1 says and I saw and means I'm not finished I have something that comes beyond this or how we're thankful to the Lord because those spirits they could touch everything else in the earth but it says don't you touch anything that is green well has the seal of God in the forehead are we thankful for the seal of God amen thank God for the sealing angel God came and the man clothed in fine linen oh we thank God this morning don't you just love him say law justice just as that butterflies but the jury was just moving by inspiration that salmon and all of those other things like even the earth to think of it it's not a hill they're like the models we have in our science class you know Anna on a transparent string so the kids are able to see it's standing [Music] to recognize at all all of creation all of those things they're doing what is within them they yield to it and what does it do you see there's another trapdoor spider [Music] you see because one that's seen the image in that same light he keeps bringing forms here we stand 2,000 years later after Calvary about same life being reflected in his children a month what must we do feed let's just feed on the word because within that word is a transforming power amen it won't be overnight but there is coming a day in a twinkling of an eye but you see well sometimes we get in that one God is moving times you don't always hear it but remember when they were constructing that temple there in the days of Solomon there one the sound of a hammer heard but there was still work going on sometimes you don't hear sound sometimes you do hear sound but in it all God is working in it just wonderful to see his grace to sense his moving in our life and says from my harnason Lord I want to be more sensitive more surrendering I believe the word does that for us I can't listen to a message I can't read in the scripture I can't come to the house of God without it coming to that place and say Lord I want to be more surrendered it challenges us this word reaches to the depth of our life let's pray let's give him thanks before we move into a praying asking for his grace to go with us let's just let's take a few moments and let's just Thank You Lord Jesus Lord I'm certain Lord that I can know and say in my heart lord I if I say Lord and would lord I thank you many times

Lord O God I know that we look like we look Lord sometimes it's even hard to say this because there is such a difference even now in the way people look normally not in natural Lord but Lord we are flesh or we are made up of the same elements Lord but O God to realize in this hour there is nothing that can stand this hour outside of that pressurization of the Holy Ghost Lord Lord we thank you O
