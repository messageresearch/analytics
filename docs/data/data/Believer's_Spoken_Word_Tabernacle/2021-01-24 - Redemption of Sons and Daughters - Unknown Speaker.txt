lord you've manifested yourself you let him know lord who he was as that was taking place it revealed his need for you to come and relieve him [Music] lord of that burden in his life and you provided there was a seraphim that flew and took a live coal from the altar and went forth and laid it upon his lips so thou perished oh god isaiah went forth from there he was changed lord we believe we're in your presence where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty we are changed from glory unto glory lord we do not want to be conformed to this world or even as peter would say to the dearly beloved not even to be fashioned again in ignorance i ask god that may your spirit come lord and just search every every part of our life lord if there's anything that's out of order may god you just so come as we would stand as sons and daughters of god there's a desire that our lives would be in order lord [Music] you've put that burden there you've stirred that up father it's your work lord lord we just commit ourselves commit every need we're just gonna go ahead and say thank you for meeting every need lord because father you've already done it all there's not one more thing that you have to do

the finished lord [Music] granted lord this morning we pray [Music] in the name of our lord jesus christ amen and amen amen amen why don't you turn and just look at somebody and say god bless you amen it's good to be in the house of the lord isn't it amen praise the lord for the trevor god bless you amen amen brother brian you're still a spring chicken brother amen i don't think nobody else would call your age out but your son did it but we just thank the lord so appreciate you brother brian mr barb amen each and every one of you amen it's good to be in the house of the lord amen amen so good to know him amen let's just turn to the word and let's go to ephesians chapter two and good to see some of you you know back here with us some of you were away maybe on a trip or other things we're just glad to see it's just just refreshing to see you as the saints of god just to be able to gather together and tell you one of these mornings we're going to gather together but it won't be to come to this building amen we'll be we'll be getting a change of our building amen i believe it's soon and very soon amen amen let's look here and i just have a few verses of scripture that we want to read in ephesians chapter 2 verse 1. and it says and you hath he quickened who were dead in sin or in trespasses and sin i want you to notice the condition that we were in we were dead where in kind past ye walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience well why doesn't it work in you anymore because you're no longer a child of disobedience so if you're not a child of disobedience then that would mean you are a child of obedience obedience to what the word of god and when you're a child of obedience then the spirit of god is what works through your life amen look at this in verse three i like this among whom also we had our conversation that's our character our conduct in times past in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind notice how paul brings these together fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind the mind being the soul and whereby nature the children of wrath even as others but here's the difference but god amen but god who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with christ by grace ye are saved and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace and his kindness toward us through christ jesus for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god not of works lest any man should boast for we are his workmanship created in christ jesus unto good works which god hath before ordained that we should walk in them amen may god bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated i want to just i want to speak to you this morning we've been dealing with operating by the faith of the hour and if you haven't it'd probably be good for you to go back and listen to the message perfect faith brother banham deals with how that jesus walked in a world of perfect faith because he said he knew who he was and brother brown goes on to say he says that he relied upon what the word had made him then he comes back around he says can't we rely upon what the word has made us so it's bringing us back into a place as we were looking at that a little bit the last time how that love itself it takes love to bring faith it takes the love of god working on our lives now our love alone won't do it but it must be our lives being influenced directed and drawn by the love of god this is why even in these scriptures that we have read here and many other places in the scripture we recognize that it's a sovereign work of god it doesn't mean that we don't have anything to do but what it means is that we're not acting on our own but what it is is we're acting in obedience to the spirit of god who's dealing with our life so the reality is is what it comes down to it's it's us yielding and god doing that's the whole work of god dealing with the life bringing it into that of the new birth and then even from the new birth it doesn't stop it only continues on to the very change of the body it's a work that where you or i no matter who a person is can take credit for anything that we've done i like how brother branham says that at the end of god be with us where be all the miracles he said god if there's anything that you've been able to do through us he said it's because that you were able to override our rebellion and move through us now when you you look at that you realize in overriding our rebellion if it was not for god's grace coming and dealing with our life to where that we would surrender our our hearts and our lives we wouldn't surrender but it takes god to come and god to work in our life and that continues on in our walking and our journey and i want to i want to speak upon these thoughts we're just just building and i just how god just seems to be just moving within this and i want to speak on a redemption of sons and daughters because redemption itself as brother branham you you would hear those of you as you listen to the message and you see within scripture redemption itself has two parts to it first of all to redeem means to bring back to its rightful owner now very simply our old nature does not belong to god god doesn't god doesn't want he's not come to redeem the old nature that don't belong to him there's no way that adam could claim that cain was his are you with me but abel was so you see god when he comes in redemption there's a part that he's redeeming which is not the son of james and pat browning not the son of charles and elebrano not the son of so-and-so bales that's not what he's coming to redeem he's coming to redeem the son and daughter of god that is there on the inside but yet not in a living form yet redemption is to claim back your redemption is not how where you know sometimes it's thought to believe they sometimes will just take redemption in just a general term but redemption is actually bringing back what rightfully belongs to one and in order for that to come back to one there must be a satisfying of whatever debt or whatever lien whatever it is that's against it from keeping the owner to fully take possession of it but once that debt has been settled there's nothing to stop the owner from going to make claims on what belongs to him amen this is why brother branham would say it like this in redemption is two parts it says there's a the first part of it and once that i know it's very simple but it's coming out of and then it's entering into listen how he says this first he says you have to come out some people wants to bring the world in with them but you got to come out of the world to enter into christ notice you've got to come out of the world you have to come out of unbelief to enter into faith there cannot be one thing in your way to really have genuine faith you must absolutely leave everything that's contrary to the word of god behind to enter into faith you know sometimes i think these things are very simple we let the spirit of god and i i don't mean to make you understand when i say very simple i'm saying even as i read over this and i'm studying and there's things sometimes i come back over just moments before maybe you know coming out or the days before looking back over all of a sudden the spirit of god every time when he comes to anoint the word it doesn't become it doesn't become complicated it becomes more simple it's the things that god is showing to you and i so when we look at this leaving it behind we recognize how do you leave something behind is when you move from where you are toward and you're going somewhere you you can't stay in the same spot and say well i'm coming out of coming out of you're being drawn you're going somewhere and you've got to get your eyes looking to the one who's calling you and keep your eyes there satan's business is to distract your eyes and to get you looking and everything else but listen if you'll just look to him and you'll walk towards him you will find that the things that you thought to be impossible you will find is no longer baggage that you're carrying but you have left it behind why there's a greater pull that you are yielding to and it's god who's working to remove that in your life this is all part of redemption look when they got out in the wilderness they started to look around tests come every child of god who comes to every son of god who comes to god must first be chastened and tried god deals with our life he corrects us he even as we're coming in the journey and process of the new birth he's dealing with our life get rid of this let go of this and let go of that he's working in our life it's a child training that's going on is that right there's a school master of the holy spirit until we come to the faith so he's working in our life he's dealing with with our with our hearts you see when they got to a spot in the wilderness they finally come to a place they started looking back to egypt oh if we could only go back there oh it was so much easier but have you forgot about the taskmaster's whip have you forgot about the one who made you do things that you didn't want to do have you forgot about that labor and that toil and that servile condition you were in what you say what's happening they're already they're going back into that of egypt but there was joshua and caleb that even when the rest of them looked over in the land and they seen opposition and they seen obstacles joshua and caleb did not denounce the obstacles but they chose to focus on god who had brought them out that that same god was present to take them in this is where redemption it's a coming out of and it's a going and an entering into this is why every person who is sitting here this morning and every every every person must have their true exodus must have a real spiritual exodus within their life wherein that they come out of the world and separate from unbelief by faith and come into the faith of god where you're no longer an old creation amen you become a new creation now watch out the scripture will take this in second corinthians chapter 6 verse 14. notice this admonition paul here he is he's speaking you find in the book of corinthians you find ephesians on and on you'll find where paul here the spirit of god is dealing with hearts and lives that's already been placed has come into this adoption then you also find the spirit of god moving back for those that have not come into that position yet and god is working and ministering and then he also breaks over to in everything the word of god it never takes from you what god has placed in you the word of god only builds the confidence that god has already placed in you by the baptism of the holy ghost it's god this is why this is the true foundation of every believer is the faith of god operating in our life that's our foundation that's how as a believer we face every day life every circumstance we are facing it by the faith of god in our life even when we don't feel him even when we don't know what to do even when it seems like everything else is breaking loose all around us but it's the faith of god paul said it like this the love of god constrains us that means holds us together amen it is the love of god that is shed abroad in our hearts it's an anchor let me just say it's something you can't get away from because it's not something that you did it's what he has done this is why paul was saying this blessed hope we have as an anchor that enters into within the veil words it like this be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness and what communion hath light with darkness and what concord this is agreement hath christ with beloved or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel paul in this these two scriptures he's talking about the company associates you see this is very important because a life that is starting out with god and god begins to deal with that heart you find that when you get this place to say well god's done something it can even listen to me it's even for those who have crossed over into the new birth this is why it's also important that you don't get around and among a bunch of unbelievers they start talking well you know this this is what they're saying about this disease and this is what they're saying about this listen don't listen don't look down on them that's all they know they're bound with the spirit of fear you're not you've not been given a spirit of fear you've been given wisdom to know what you don't have nothing to prove by standing there well i'm going to tell them this i'm going to tell them that there's a listen to me brother man talks about the holy spirit the way even god's working in your life it starts to move like a little buzzer that's going up that means get out of there [Music] get out of there it's company it's associates this is why as god well let me just go on and read here and maybe we'll come to some things verse 16 what agreement look at this agreement half the temple of god with idols what do you do with idols get them out you got to get them out of the temple it's got to be purged is that right for ye are the temple of the living god now paul's not talking about our body he's not even talking about our spirit he's talking about ye that seed gene of god that part that was dead that is the temple not made with hands that is a temple that the lord himself pitched that is where god comes to dwell in that part in that life that is as we've been looking for weeks that's the betting ground that's the virgin ground that's the womb that's the seed for ye are the temple of the living god as god hath said i will dwell in them very important i will dwell in them never forsake them but dwell in them and i will walk in them oh my and i will be their god and they shall be my people wherefore come out from among them and be separate saith the lord and touch not the unclean thing and i will receive you you see how we respond to the word shows our faith in him remember ultimately what is the faith of god coming down it's the circumcision of the holy ghost it's the seal of god it's god coming to a place to accept our faith is that right so there must be a responding you show your faith your faith is shown as you separate you come out from you see god cannot deal with a life or with a heart as long as it's there in the wrong company you understand what i mean by dealing with god will deal with the heart let me just say this to you very clearly some of you might have been sitting on a bar stool but the spirit of god dealt with your heart you never stayed there on a bar stool is that right you're in a different situation but the spirit of god begin to call to you like it did to abraham and you begin to walk away from where you were tell me that the word don't have power in it tell me about that that the holy ghost don't have power on it hallelujah that god would walk right in when a person is sitting at a bar have a fifth of whiskey in their head and the spirit of god could say you don't belong here this is not your residence i'm telling you when jesus goes into a bar to call out children they do never return to that bar they are delivered from that condition he begins to draw aren't you glad he come to where you were i think the brother sing that song he came looking for me wherefore come out from among them and be ye separate saith the lord and touch not so no the first part deals with associates the next part touch not the unclean thing those things that would be present and is around that you're aware of it's not your associates but it's things in your life that the spirit of god is dealing with your heart what's he trying to do he's wanting to completely purge and cleanse your life but the way that he does that is changing our thoughts concerning it it's god working so the reality is that you know when we look at it and this is where it says and i will receive you brother says it over and over not just in future home but he says it in an earlier part in the message he says and he says it like this in an earlier part of the message he said i don't think we need to be saying i've received the holy ghost he said we need to be saying the holy ghost received me then he comes over in future home in 1964 and he says you never received the holy ghost he accepted you don't repeat it it takes it all out of our hands is that right so here it's god the true redemption is him receiving us by imparting his own life his quickening power into the temple not made with hands and that's the new birth you see to separate completely to the word bible word himself how can you say listen to me simple question how can you separate to the word without the word you're separating to a creed right this is why brother brandon when he preaches you must be born again in 62 or at the end of 61. he said this is why there's so many false births because what it's false teaching this is why the new birth this is the error the new birth is not accepting christ that's error to be born again is the new birth is the seal of the living god is to be circumcised it is a process that god brings us through unto himself what is it it's redemption calling us out and into well you say why has that been now listen if i if that's on anybody's toes i apologize for stepping on your toes but i may be jumping on them here in a little bit you understand that it's you know we understand these things why has satan done that because he realizes that if people get the true revelation and the deity of god comes down in the tabernacle of god just like it did in the days of pentecost brother it'll turn this world upside down that's why he's afraid of it this is why jesus said you shall know the truth the truth is not just a doctrine the truth is the person of jesus christ and he is the living word hallelujah so here is a separate from all the old associates you must recognize listen to me now it's very simple you must recognize that the same same as the spirit of god is drawing you to come out there's also a spirit that you were bound by listen to me remember as we were dealing a couple weeks ago brother bran said i would have surrendered my heart to god a long time ago he said but there was a devil a spirit that hung over me that kept saying wait a little longer see how conniving that devil is he didn't say don't do it at all don't ever do it just wait just wait but then through the preaching of the word devils are cast out amen sometimes you might see a manifestation of a of a hole that's that's been in a person's life and other times you don't see any manifestation but the devils are fleeing right rather either in prayer right here or right even through the preaching of the word let me just tell you something what is it that heaviness and that part that's on you but yet when the word is going forth it's ministry it's calling to a son or daughter of god you start to believe him oh my brother brahm said it like this he said you raise up one little part in you he said the spirit of god says yes and he said there's a part in you that says yes and it goes again in the spirit of god you believe because the word is yeah and amen every promise in him and that word is being preached yes yes yes and all of a sudden what happens the yeses in you start getting closer together what is it the oppressor is actually being cast out that one that will hold you back it is casting out what should i do write to him with open arms and say lord jesus lord receive me sometimes this old associates and things like that let me just i want to just just laying this in and going just in this the lord just been dealing with my heart on this with faith you see sometimes what we're looking at is just as the spirit of god is drawing us and then to recognize the old associates and the other things that's around there's a spirit that we were bound by and influenced by it's still present working in your associates i said this it's true you take a room full of people and they ain't never met one another before let's just say you get them out of youth camp and let's just say there's a hundred of them okay maybe manageable crowd and you get a hundred of them you watch you'll find some that are there and they might have come for the wrong wrong reasons does that bother you by saying no because i've prayed with many that stood right there and said brother samuel i came here for the wrong reason but god has turned my heart they didn't even know why they were there i just love how the lord works but you watch how all of a sudden they'll connect together you'll start finding something you're like why is this pocket together why is this pocket together you know why it is there's spirits and sometimes you don't recognize it's spiritual it's trying to do it's trying to build up an unbelief this is why brother graham said sitting right there in the meeting where you'd have where once called out cancer or this and he said right across the building another devil with the same one what you're trying to do fortify against the word but i'm talking to believers this morning i believe there's more right here this morning as believers baptized with the holy ghost as sons and daughters of god that are tabernacling a part of that great pillar of fire and as it's come together it's uniting together and satan would like to affront the word of god but there is a chain of faith that is building throughout the building it's moving in hearts it's getting stronger it's pushing back the darkness it's still present to work in those associates and if you don't watch brother brown you know he spends countless times dealing with this you don't watch you'll find yourself right back in it now remember i'm talking about somebody that's in journey to the new birth you see sometimes let me just get down personal sometimes it might be your job or it might be your family and you might say i really can't leave those associates well what should i do have a positive confession you confess and do this should be what you've done anyhow when you get up from the altar or from your seat or whatever you confess you get up and say i am a christian when you feel that burden that has been released from your life you then can stand he's the high priest of your profession he will act upon what you are saying i am a christian i am a believer i'm no longer the same oh i know you you're just the same old well truly you might still have and have that same old nature but there is a work of god that you are testifying to i am no longer a sinner i am a christian [Applause] am right the bible said man believeth unto salvation as i write and with the mouth confession is made unto righteousness it's very very important now does that mean on the first time around that the devil's going to shut his mouth remember though that person that individual family member job associates or whatever more remember they are still under the influence of the spirit and when god begins to deal in your life it's as if the devil calls reinforcements and whatever he can to try to come at you and to try to hinder you i'm telling you god is speaking to somebody this morning he would try to call do what's he trying to do he's trying to build up an armor or an armory or an influence against what do i do you stay on your god-given ground you stand there to know that god touched my heart there was that lift that release that i felt and then what do i do don't stay there you get in the word well brother samuel i don't seem to understand anything but the word has power in it it has power to break the hold of unbelief i can't put it all together god's not asking you to put it all together he's the one to put you together what should i do pray read you might be driving oh god help me lord jesus lord you're my savior lord the work you've done lord god i want a fullness in my life see god just don't take us it's not you know god walking around but the same man looks foolish to think that way is foolish that's not the work of god of god doing that amen verse 18. boy and i will be a father unto you oh i love that and ye shall be my sons and daughters you see what what's happening he's ministering the rights these are the rights that belong to you as the son and daughter of god what right you've got a right to walk away from the associates you've got a right to not touch the unclean thing you've got a right there is a power oh glory be to god there's a word and there is the enforcer of the word the holy ghost that will come behind and he'll enforce that word in that standard he will be up i will be a father unto you and ye shall be my sons and daughters saith the lord almighty amen the almighty one the lord almighty he who was before amen he who holds sway power and authority i will be your father so you see it's the word that is sounding out now think of this term of father notice i will be your father you could say well isn't god already my father in one way yes and in another way no because in order to be your father he has to father you you see with myself being the son of james and pat browning there had to be that james brown though here i was within him and you can go back on back on back on back on back grandfather great grandfather on i was there and it was packed all the way on down but there had to come where james brown he himself through marriage would come and unite with a bedding ground they would unite together not just he would walk and take the bedding ground but it had to be to where he would woo patricia may brown he would woo her they would fall in love notice before the betting ground ever becomes into a place of really receiving the seed there must be a love affair it's a love affair that governs the imparting of that seed here i was within my daddy but in order for him to father me there must be a bedding ground to where that seed that me could actually be reparted or placed in that bedding ground if that's how it is in the natural then how much more in god because look god himself when you and i dropped from our mother's womb god himself when we were taking the breath of life there was that seed our representation the real identity of the son and daughter of god it entered us right then it was the womb or the betting ground or the good ground that eventually the father himself would come and impart his life into that betting ground and then when he does that it breeds out all the call it brings out all the hybridity it breeds back a son and daughter of god one who has papers that he's a thoroughbred one who has identity that is of the same stock of how god has brought us all the way down i will be your father lord i want to be father he said come out come out from among be separate touch not the unclean thing but lord you father me first he said no no i'm letting you know the potential that's in you well what's doing it love is drawing us oh my don't you love him this is why the bible would say in galatians 4 when the fullness of time was come god sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of son so there had to be a redeeming first he could not come and begin to deal with our hearts deal with our lives and say i will be a father unto you i will be a father unto you if there had not been the work of redemption already taken place listen what are you saying we're saying that the work of redemption that all that was needed he fulfilled it he is our boaz he redeemed us brother brown would put it this way and souls in prison we were redeemed there at calvary but he says now when god deals with that heart he's calling the names that are on that book and when that lame has been called and thoroughly splashed beneath that bleach then it has been thoroughly redeemed well what's happened the redemption of the redeemer is now revealed and vindicated in a redeemed subject of god where god himself is now now making known this is my redeemed subject just as he came down on the river jordan he laid claim on what he himself had made is that right he never come down and said now i will claim this body of mary they don't want the body from mary mary did not even give an egg to it it was a virgin birth it was without the assistance of man it was without that of any any any human instrumentality it was the creation of god god supplied all of our brother says it in there in the lady will see an age god supplied he said that over them that egg and god also supplied that life that sperm so it was indeed a creation of god that god there in that womb and then coming through that it was the very the very life the very cell the very blood the very tabernacle of almighty god and god said this is my beloved son in whom i'm well pleased to dwell in that's what the holy ghost does when he comes to sons and daughters that was a pattern at the river jordan he comes to every son and daughter of god he did it in corinth he did it on there on the day of pentecost it's not the holy ghost falling upon us and making us sons no it's the holy ghost coming and raising up sons that are laying in a dead state in that life who glory be to god this is what real redemption is so he came in order to redeem them that were under the law oh my boy somebody that loved us huh that we might receive the adoption or the placement of sons in ephesians 1 5 having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself god had to become one of us and he had to pay the price become our mediator the right kind of a mediator he had to pay the price shed the blood that you and i would be able to come back to him according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved amen do you make yourself accepted no he hath romans 8 15 for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father and the spirit beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of god i love this quote here in the message shalom oh my our heavenly father he's praying we are so grateful to you that we that we can even be privileged to address you as our father for father means that we have been begotten of the great god that created the heavens and earth and we are so happy for this privilege that we can think in our hearts and then that we are sons and daughters of god and then to see you strictly identify yourself in the midst of us that you are our father how changing our thoughts from the things of the world and changing our motives and objectives and attitudes and every phase of us to love you to believe you and know that your promises are true aren't you glad you don't end with the new birth [Music] he keeps on moving and dealing and working in our life oh my god you see what we're speaking of is that old nature that we received it came by that sexual birth between father and mother when we dropped from our mother and we took that breath of life you see there was a spirit human spirit that we were given and eventually we went along for a while and we we come to an age of accountability i realized sometimes that's not always in concrete and stone that it happens at age 12 or this in today's world and you find sometimes it happens much much sooner but at any rate the age of accountability is where you begin to really have a real recognition of right and wrong where you begin to realize i'm wrong this is wrong i shouldn't be doing this and you see it begins to deal with your life now let me just say it to you that old nature is receptive to the influence of the devil let me just put it in simple terms he's buddies with the devil that old nature his nearest kin is the devil amen hello glory be to god in the eyes i would go into that from ruth but ruth and boyz but i think we just need to stay here that old nature is receptive to the influence of the death you know it starts when here we are young nobody had to teach us how to lie i didn't knock that plan over he did it it keeps going keeps going he's going it's receptive to that spirit what we're reading in our text it's it's receptive and it'll align many years in disobedience he's saying something to you it can sit right in a church and it'll sit here for so long and not even move and it'll align with the spirit of disobedience you're okay you're all right you don't need to just wait it'll be all right you just brother samuel kennedy yeah he can do that but you see when god begins to deal with that heart and that life as god's dealing with that that old nature you see what god's doing it's like the prodigal son it begins to align with the spirit of god that's dealing with it you see you think about legion i think of how brother brown puts it like this legion was on the other side of the sea and when jesus jesus heard the call to come there it was the call from that seed on the inside legion needed deliverance he needed help it was a calling out to life jesus crossed that sea for one person and when he got there brother brown said like this he was there in that tomb with all them devils on him but he said when he heard that jesus had come he wasn't going to let those devils keep him there brother i need power to do that when you begin to hear him you begin to hear him talking him draw let me tell you something brother even within that right there of a life that's not even regenerated fully yet but you begin to incline and align with the spirit of god there's not enough devils that can hold you back hallelujah when you're determined i've got to get to jesus what's that called desperation amen you see god deals with that old nature just like he just shows it even as he dealt with when israel here they are coming up to the red sea they come to a heart a tight spot but god opens up a way through that red sea and pharaoh just thinks he's going to go ahead and he's going to follow him over and overtake him but what the devil didn't know that day it was a trap for him see god has a way of working and god working on that old nature and to bring it into a place to where it will align and it's a trap that's set that he might destroy it i'm talking about building up in faith now it's about building up in faith you see this is where this is where god simple statement brother brad makes god will never save a man against his own will you never heard anybody walk around saying you know what god saved me and i didn't want to get saved maybe you didn't get saved god don't work that way salvation is of the lord but it ain't god coming down and getting a right you see god will not work in opposition to our will listen to me now but god works to a place to where our will will actually surrender to his will when that takes place then god moves down fully to take care of that old nature this is all his work this is where you see when jesus would say in john 12 31 now is the judgment of this world thou shalt the prince of this world be cast out and i if i be lifted up from the earth will draw all men unto me i will draw them it is that which from an inward pull i will impel i will draw them unto me sacrifice has been offered up the redemption has come now the spirit of god begins to move throughout the earth well how does the spirit of god move through the word the spirit of god can deal with the person let's say the man dwight moody who came to the lord that night maybe whether to white moody knew anything about the lord or not that's really not to any concern right now at this point but what had to be is the spirit of god would deal with his heart go to the meeting go to the meeting go to the meeting or maybe that sister who was 99 years old when she was led to the lord you know fully in in the meetings there brother branham and he meets her on the other side there had to be something the spirit of god was leading them oh glory be to god i thank god brother branham he'll pick it up he said that possum that was right there at his doorstep he said what was it god had led her to that place and he says what about you sinner tonight what about the love of god that has led you to this meeting he said oh can't you just let the love of god move into your heart for a loving god that would lead you to this place oh he says if you just love him grace will be projected and he'll come in and do a full work do you know what he said if you love him just love him say oh jesus how will draw oh men unto me you see this is where as a scripture jesus would say in john 6 43-44 all that the father hath given me notice hath given me will come to me over in matthew come unto me all you they're having heavy lady right so come it means a come means to move from one place to another but you might be sitting right there in your seat but right here in that old nature it's moved from one place to another it's actually being led the spirit of god is dealing with mild nature mild nature you mean god is dealing with that yes because he cannot just come in and rip it out of us it's got to be surrendered remember faith cometh by love brethren talks about this of the new birth let me just let me just read this here he deals with how he says before i don't think i have these up there i just stabbed my notes i just want to refer to certain parts brother brown talks about how a birth itself is a mess he said anybody knows no matter where a birth happens it's a mess and he says it will make you and brother bran will go into things squall ball wash all the pain off your face it'll do things for you that you didn't think you'd do you'll carry on like you never think you do it's a mess now maybe nobody has pain on their face but you see the squalling and balling does not start here nor does it stop here the mess itself is not because somebody gets up and they've got all kinds of mess around their face people can have all kinds of mess and they've never dealt with this mess on the inside are you with me you see it's god trying to get this man on the inside but the mess is where things are fading away they can let loose listen right here while the words being preached right here you don't even have to wait to the end it can actually the spirit of god can move out and absolutely bring such a redemptive work of coming out and going into amen but it may not come exactly that way for everybody because as brother branham said some people die real hard but praise god they die is that right some die real hard you see this is why when it's fear brother says many they fear that new birth because of the mess but what it is it's the mess having to give this up having to give that up will here never come of fear see the holy ghost does not come and override fear the holy ghost comes and he moves into a place to where we are surrendered in his love he will not open because remember he doesn't want our life to be governed by fear it has been governed by fear ever since we come to that even that realization more and more of the age of accountability it's governed by fear this is why he's not calling us to the spirit of bondage again this is real liberty it's a real setting that's free so you see how the spirit of god will work in that place for the brown woods he would say it like this in such a place he says before you can be born you have to die and some people die awful hard they kick ball scream and carry on and that's true many many of those things that is doing it but you know listen as we just said mess itself it's where things are fading away out of that life it's where there is a releasing and a letting go brother brown would use this term over and over throughout the message and it's the term rot he said if you want to bring forth fruit die to yourself your own man-made theology be born again of the spirit and the resurrection get rid of the old spirit of selfishness and dryness that's in you notice get rid of take on new life it's messy unless a grain of corn falls in the ground and rots unless a man rots to his own theology he writes brother then goes through baptist methodist pentecostal theology until you rot to those things and give yourself into the hands of god listen i thought i didn't have anything to do with it you don't it's you rotting rotting away giving yourself into the hand of god brother iran would say it he says then the old man will die and the new man will be born christ jesus we will rise now you know brother brown would go on and he would tell us in god rich in mercy he said to die is not enough it's got a rot right a seed has to rot not just die the rot is where all of that seed coat which is that hard part that's around the seed everything has to rot it's a rotting to our own ideas it's a rotting to our own thinking this is the coming out and being separate and touching off the unclean thing see it's god how can it rot you know you could hold a seed right here and that seed will never rot you can have it right there it'll never rot or let's just say as it is right here that that old nature well what makes the old nature rot same thing when you put a seed in the ground you get the moisture around that seed and that moisture starts breaking it down little by little you can come back here on thursday nope no sprout you come back sunday oh no no sprout you come back no sprout no sprout but remember where it takes place first is down beneath the soil right now when that old nature is rotted away and then that new man on the inside can come out i pulled out many seeds there in science class and you pour them out to where then it'll be laid open like that many times we'd use the bean you'd pull it open and i'm beneath the soil you would see that little itty-bitty plant it was a little itty-bitty leaf you didn't see it above the surface but just give it time it will eventually come above the surface what's doing it the light and the moisture this is why it's necessary that we be under the word of god that brings a real bird that'll rock them old ideas that'll convict and convict you of sin that'll deal with your heart it'll deal with your life and say you need to separate from that old selfishness you need to get rid of that malice you need to get rid of that pain you need to get rid of that old worldly appetite you need to stop looking at the wrong things and whether he calls it out verbatim or not the spirit of god is here to bring conviction you see it's very important you've lost rot oh my can i have just a little bit more this is why paul would say in one direction of it of romans 12 2 and be not conformed to this world but be you transformed by the renewing of your mind he's not talking about this matter between our our ears that's our brain but your mind and your spirit oh that's connected but be you transformed by the renewing of your mind that you might prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god i want you to think of it here like this that prodigal son where he was at he was down there in the pigpen right now what what what what took him there his own desires got to a place that those desires oh you could have this could do this man this is so dull here you could have such such freedom oh my wouldn't it be wonderful to have this and this and not his desires took him from father's house that's what happened in the garden of eden as a result that first birth and that nature that we receive but as he was down there brother brown puts it very clearly he said the angel of the lord began to deal with that boy's heart it says mom and daddy prayed for him and the angel of the lord began to deal with his heart once you think what happens he gets to the lowest point sometimes that lowest point still don't turn somebody right god knows what it takes what is it and what it takes is to where the person begins to change their thoughts towards home right well who can do that the angel of the lord he begins to move this boy is still covered over in all the pig manure and everything else but he's his his desires his thinking is changing he starts thinking now father's house didn't change you know when he went away from father's house this is too tight this is so strict this why is this and why was that father's house didn't change standards didn't change father didn't send him messages come back we've learned better you don't have to do this this isn't really necessary father's house didn't change who was changing he was he was he was changing his desires his thoughts were changing toward that of father's house this is why when god would deal with our life let me just try to bring it to this place in souls in prison brother branham would deal with it he says it's the soul that god is that's in there that soul is what god is working on if he can only get that nature that spirit to agree with him you mean you mean that new nature no no he wants the old nature to agree with him in order to kill him he's got to have the old one agree with him this is the word that soul is what god is working on if he can only get that nature that spirit to agree with him then that nature dies the nature and the love of the world dies and the things of the world is dead right so that nature oh i'm wrong i'm wrong what's happening is bringing it to a place getting ready to kill it right getting ready to kill that old nature this is somebody who loved us love produces faith what led back to that place where the nature dies it's the love of god notice if you love the world or the things of the world the love of god is not in you and a man must be born again so this nature has to die and the nature of god comes and lives in you god is the only thing there is that never begin nor never can end the brahman goes on that says this is why we're baptized into his name that we might come forth in his name in his death in his resurrection that we rise again testifying to the world that we have new life that the old man is dead we buried that first nature he's not just dead right there's been a funeral preached amen there's been an obituary of how that old rascal was he's dead he's not been hung up not been put in the closet come on now he's dead and he's been buried amen amen there's a sound the old man is dead he used to live here lives here no more amen so then what does paul call it the new man all right amen remember i'm gonna say it like this he said so many times people are talking about let's put a new coat on the man put a new coat on the man he said we got too much of that right now we need a new man in the coach get a new man in the coat then the cult will reflect the new man on the inside amen if the man on the inside ever gets really changed and really born again then you don't have to worry the cult will only reflect the work of redemption on the inside it will reflect the very image and life of jesus christ we bury that first nature that first nature is gone and now we are the nature of him he lives in us and we don't do our own will we do his will we don't think our own thoughts the mind is what thinks the mind that was in christ he's in every believer there is the soul and that's what we're speaking of paul said to be carnally minded as death but to be spiritually minded is life the carnal mind is enmity against god for it is not subject to the law of god neither indeed can be think of it god bringing that carnal mind bringing that that first nature into a place to where it's laying down the bible says he giveth the holy ghost to them that obey him what's he doing he's bringing it to a place of submission now he's not playing remember that old nature he ain't the father of that old nature he don't claim that right the only one he claims is his children his children are the firstborn amen they're born of his spirit washed in his blood they're no longer the same person they used to be they're not just trying to do right there's been a change on the inside that has taken place their desire is to please god the things of the world has passed away it's a perishing a rotting a passing away there's a new man a new woman a son or daughter of god on the inside that carnal mind can never be subject to the law of god it cannot please god this is why god must move to eradicate it to move it amen so then they that are in the flesh cannot please god you might think well this heaven i mean i combed it if you got here i combed it today or i did this or i did that but when he's talking about in the flesh is you're no longer under that same nature you're no longer under that first husband you're no longer under that there has been a death a burial and you've had to be married again to jesus christ what did this love love this is why the bible says and ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of god dwell in you now if any man hath not the spirit of christ he's none of his let me close on this one we'll just stop the brahms talking about healing yourself the message the great commission let's talk about healing of the physical body he's talking about how that physical body has got to die it's got to perish he said so did the soul have to perish the thoughts the soul is the nature of the spirit and those thoughts and so forth in you had to perish before the new man could be borne into you to make you a new creature in christ you see some so many times it's the fault is it been well god will just come in and then he's the one that eradicates everything it's surrendering to him it's aligning with his word see god deals with our heart by justification calling us to himself then sanctification is where brethren explains in future home is where he sets the mind in order for holiness where you begin to think about things differently you begin to as you're aligning i don't want to do this i don't want to do that this would displease him i don't want to do that i need to get rid of this and i need what is it it's sanctifying he's getting it lined up this is the part where brother ram tells us and the scripture says a new heart and a new spirit i will give you think of that a new heart and new spirit that is figurative of god dealing with our it's figurative of god dealing with our life to bring us to a place to say father i'm leaving i'm calling i'm here you call i'm leaving my kindred i'm leaving my associates i'm leaving i i'm not i don't want to touch that unclean thing what's he doing he's calling and you're yielding it's the spirit of god working and wooing and drawing us to himself sometimes that rotting as we said i'll close sometimes this this process itself you can set a person sometimes can maybe for a long time it isn't god's fault god doesn't have down a pattern that well you're going to get the baptism of the holy ghost set right there on the pew or at the altar or that god doesn't have that kind of a pattern but the pattern that god does have is that you are going to come through hearing the word amen the spirit of god is going to deal with your heart your heart will be turned to him you repent of your sins see this is one of the major problems is there's not been a real repentance the holy ghost will never come where there's not a real repentance but the bible says repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ that's all part of justification god calling the life yet what made the person do it is still there then god begins to deal to now where the mind thinking i don't want to do that i shouldn't do this i shouldn't do that what's god doing he sets the mind in order for holiness it's god aligning everything of that old nature that he might move in not just move in but take care of that old man this is coming out of and going into this is what redemption is all about it's not god coming in where we're at but god calling us out see what's happening this the spirit of god is calling to a son and daughter of god it's beckoning that you see the flesh itself remember what jesus said flesh and blood profiteth nothing is that right i might say that that my flesh has been blessed it has because my contact with my heavenly father has has allowed this house to get well it saved it from a whole lot of more scars it's really it's it's done it real well and matter of fact one of these days it's going to be changed it's god working sovereignty to move that life into a complete and full agreement with him god working on that life moving on that life come out be a separate touch not the unclean thing i will receive you unto myself i will be a father unto you and you shall be my sons and daughters saith the lord almighty samuel what do i do surrender surrender surrender sometimes i've heard over the years i've had people that'll call me what does brother samuel mean by dying what does he mean by dying out see you can't explain that but it's when you if i could make it try to make it as simple as you can it's when you get tired of being you when you no longer love the world you have a hatred for it you have to detest for it that's god turn in your heart then it's time god moving to a place to remove that old nature then that new nature sets in it's a work of redemption i tell you what a wonderful time that we're living in friends this is a time that we're right now you realize we are right now on the very verge of crossing over it's a time of such seriousness it's a time of sincerity that's not to scare you but it's a time to let the spirit of god search us out it's a time to make decisions it's a time to where if the spirit of god if it's never moved to that place in your life and that old man is still there it's a time to say lord god lead me to that place lord i want to be completely submissive to where that new man can be born on the inside and the new man that's been born on the inside the spirit of god that moves within our hearts says lord i want to please you i don't want nothing lord between me and you it even grieves you it can it can convict you if there's something that you've either thought wrong spoke wrong he convicts you right there why does that your heavenly father and he let you know this is not how a son or daughter acts or conducts themselves and he corrects you in your desires yes father i have a father lord i don't want that in my life sometimes things can come so subtly but the spirit of god comes down he begins to move on your life and what happens that desire that's already there that's pulsating on the inside a desire that desires to please him above everything else what does it do it stirs that up it's a new man it's a son and daughter of god on the inside that says father forgive me maybe i've had this feeling had this grudge or i've had this but all of a sudden the spirit of god passes over your life and you realize i didn't even realize i had this i remember years and years ago i remember different times sometimes you your ministry you don't know why god takes you down a certain pathway the spirit of god was dealing in a situation and right in the service here an individual there was something clear back in their life truly a christian through and throughout but there's something they realized that they had harbored since a young person against one of their parents right after that service was over they went to that parent they didn't even pause they went to their house said forgive me i've had this bitterness that i didn't even know i had in my heart or if he to god what is that it's a son and daughter of god that when the spirit of god the this x-ray the scan of the holy ghost begins to go over like we're talking about on thursday it begins to deal with that life and there's something about it as a son and daughter of god you say that's not who i am and you realize that in your life you don't make excuses for it you're not dwelling here no more get out let's pray amen if you want to be remembered in prayer this morning amen god bless your hands god bless your hands he sees he knows what's on your heart heavenly father lord i always lord the desire is when i stand here is to get out of the way lord many times i i wish that it could just just come the way that does either when i'm in the office or lord i'm out somewhere and walking or i the whole desire is i want to get out of the way that you can speak to us

remember some of the very first words you think about that as brother brown said get in that first nature it's that soul that he's working on getting it in line remember it's the very first thing that god reveals to moses and he expresses to moses this would be the heart of the message when moses would go down there yet you never find these words spoken verbatim to pharaoh but yet it is the theme it's the heart the pulsation and he said say unto pharaoh let my son go even my firstborn and if you don't i'll kill your mercy oh glory aren't you glad that god killed that first one amen aren't you glad he killed it well it's not just dead he's rottened away he's been buried [Music] why that his firstborn might live and he might give us life oh glory be to god hallelujah glory be the hallelujah

worship him a little bit more can we do that amen amen to worship him to thank our brother and says it all to thank our heavenly father thou art the great god our father who hath begotten us we've been born of his spirit he's come down he's changed us and we can think in our hearts i'm a son and daughter of god i've been changed my life has been changed that's not what i tried to do i didn't do it he changed me it might have been a chunk this service chunk that's like that the next service might have been this then the next time might have been like this but you put it all together chunks were flying off our heart was lining up what's he doing he's drawing us in line and then even now after that of the new birth what's he doing he's growing he's building he's maturing he's working on our lives brother better put it simply he says as we feed on the word we become more into the image of the word glory oh my i'll tell you if you're here this morning you ain't never surrendered to that surrender to it let go and let god have his way get out of your own way and just yield to god if i was if i was entrapped i'd ask him this morning i'd say god deliver me lord give me the strength
