And he's always he's always right on time in our lives. And let's just go to him in a word of prayer here this morning. Amen. Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, what a privilege it is Lord that you have given to us that Lord that we could we could know you Lord oh God in the power of your resurrection and then Lord through that of the fellowship of your sufferings Lord Jesus through every test through every trial through every circumstance of life. Lord, &gt;&gt; oh God, you you make yourself known that you're the everpresent God. Lord, when things become difficult or hard, that's where you show your faithfulness, Lord. You show your faithfulness to your word. Just like it was with the Hebrew children when they walked into that fiery furnace or were thrown in there. You met them in there. Oh God, Daniel and the lion's den. Very familiar familiar events, but oh God is all to build our faith, Lord, to realize that you're right there with us, Lord. A friend that stickketh closer than a brother. and how we love you Lord Jesus. We pray this morning that Lord once again that you would just come Lord in a special way God just allowing the man part to step aside. Allow this congregation Lord just to step aside for Lord just a few words from you would mean more than volumes that could be said. So we ask that God that you would guide us, Lord, in the time that we have before us. May the word of God just so penetrate into the depths of our heart, minister to our needs, Lord. We're here, Father, to be led by you, Lord. And our desire is to be led deeper, Lord. and that father if there is anything in the way that Lord that it would just be cleared out because the greatest privilege we have as sons and daughters of God is to be led by the spirit of God. So Lord we want to be sensitive to you. We want to be Lord just ever so led and just even the daily moments of life oh God. Father in the bringing of every thought in captivity oh God even to all that we do and we say Lord we want it all to be under the name of Jesus Christ. So Lord we would ask God for your complete and divine leadership even in this moment. Lord we love you and we thank you father in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Amen. If you'll turn with me to Luke chap uh Leviticus chapter 8 and I want to just certainly greet each and every one of you. Greet I think visitors and was here and I don't know who all the visitors. I don't see if it's Brian and Gracie. Oh, God bless you, sister Eth. My goodness. Good to see you. My so good. Amen. And u so we just want to say so good to be together. I want to remind you this coming Friday, Lord willing, we'll uh have that uh probably be our last fireside fellowship. Um and uh begin about seven and have some things for the fall and probably some different things, you know, that would be there and just was a wonderful time and I'm sure we'll appreciate the fire like we did the last time. it it got cool and um so let's look here in the word and I want to just open up with verse one. We'll read and then let you have your seats. And the Lord spake unto Moses saying, "Take Aaron and his sons with him and the garments and the anointing oil and a bulock for the sin offering and two rams and a basket of unleavened bread. and gather thou all the congregation together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. And Moses did as the Lord commanded him. And the assembly was gathered together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. And Moses said unto the congregation, "This is the thing which the Lord commanded to be done." Now, if you'll skip with me to verse 22, I want to just read three more verses of scripture here. And he brought the other ram, the ram of consecration. And Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram, and he slew it. And Moses took of the blood of it, and put it upon the tip of Aaron's right ear, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot. And he brought Aaron's sons. And Moses put of the blood upon the tip of their right ear, and upon the thumbs of their right hands, and upon the great toes of their right feet. And Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar roundabout. Amen. May God bless you and bless the reading of the word as you're being seated. I'd like to just um continuing this thought here this morning on being fully consecrated to the word by the spirit. And with that sub thought of the anointing follows the blood. And I want to just in looking at this is to realize that when um when we when we're looking at this everything every when we read through the scriptures and this is familiar. It's you hear this said quite often but it's true is that every when we're reading in the scriptures we should see Jesus Christ through it all. And the prophet would be so um uh direct with us to say if you don't then go back and read it again for you have missed it. And so that's where the things that sometimes we even come to places when we're reading in the scripture and to say Lord let me see you in this scripture because when we can see him then we can see ourselves &gt;&gt; because remember that's we are a part of that word and so that's God's desire is to bring that to our lives that we can see because when we can see and God opens by revelation that's what the spirit of God does that's while the Lord Jesus he said the son can do nothing but what he seeth the father doing that doeth the son likewise. So the vision that was breaking what God's will was being made known there uh in that of the lord Jesus Christ. was acted out then in flesh. And that's the same thing that God was restoring back to us through and by the blood that was shed for us and the spirit of God coming to where that God would come back into a full fellowship with man once again. And so when we're looking at this, I I don't I want you to uh to look that it's all speaking of of God's desire when he would take Aaron and his sons and God would give the direction and the word and God would actually bring them unto himself that that they might serve him and a very special delegation. And I want to say that it's God who provided when we opened up our scriptures there. It is God that provided all things that was needed in order for for Aaron and his sons to come in to that place to be fully consecrated united with the word. And this is only a type that all speaks of the Lord Jesus Christ because it is the Holy Spirit which is God which is Christ the anointing oil. It was him. He gave his life for us as the sin offering. And then he also as the burnt offering he was completely accepted. He was accepted and as he was was accepted he was totally consecrated to the will of the father. Remember when when the bible says in the book of psalms that uh Paul would pick it up in writing in Hebrews of how that sacrifice and offering thou hastest not pleasure. And it wasn't that God did not have a delight to be able to at least fellowship with man under a covering, but it was only given for a time and speaking of the of that perfect sacrifice that would come to where that man could actually stand in God's presence completely completely innocent. And there's only one thing that could do that. You know, brother Brandham tells us he when he was dedicating a baby there and standing in the gap and he says, "I want you to think," he said, "that how innocent this baby is, you know, it doesn't know right or wrong." He said, "But do you know when you've been born again of the spirit of God, you're actually more innocent than what this child is." Because that's the power of the blood of Jesus Christ. You see that's that's what that's what this message come to do is to point us and take us away from our looking at ourselves from looking at man and to looking to the Lord Jesus that he is your all sufficiency &gt;&gt; he's all that you have need of every everything in life every victory of the rapture it's all laid within him &gt;&gt; and and and there and there's nothing that he would shrink back from. There's no situation, there's no condition that is overwhelming or too much for him. And to see that he provided all of this for us in in our lives. And you think of how that you know when you notice this the as we read in the in in in the scripture here of how with that ram of consecration that in each one of these sacrifices they had to lay their hands upon the sin offering and there there would be that of identifying that this one this innocent one is taking my place. I'm guilty, but he's taking my place. And the confessing their sins and that of the burnt offering that he is my acceptance. They would lay their hands upon that. And then coming to the ram of consecration and then even out of the ram of consecration. I won't get to it this morning, but into the wave offering where they would take these the parts of the consecration and in their hands would wave it before God. Every one of these things was a handson event and that simply spoke of them identifying with what God in his grace had provided and shown for them as the way that that's the only thing that we have to do is have faith in the grace of God that is coming to us. And really, there's only one thing that can really bring faith, and that's the grace of God that comes through the word of God because I it's working to take your eyes and your focus off of yourself unto him who is our way. And so within this, this is why that when the applying of the blood, all of this was a working through of a direction that God would give down through there so that they would come into an actual place of service and of worship. And you know, once again, I I don't want to to elaborate too much on this, but they would come through this whole process 7 days until they come to a place of a full consecration. And God has brought a people in this hour down through seven ages that have been dedicated to the unleavened bread of the word of God where the spirit of God has been working down through the ages to where now there is a people that has has come to the place to not only see the open door that that we can ascend into God's presence but God has himself provided a way in opening and taking off the seals off the book that you and I might come to a complete cleansing away from the filth of anything of this world, away from the filth of church anity and away from the filth of isms. And I'm not throwing off on churches, but what I'm trying to say is is that we recognize that God allowed men to probe into truth. But God in this hour took all of the truths that was scattered. And what God did, he didn't plagiarize truths, but God simply stepped down and said, "This was me in Luther. This was me in Wesley. This was me right here in in maybe pink. This was here. This was me." And what did he do? He assembled the truth. So what you see, it was Christ that was all of this truth. Because how did they receive that truth? These men were looking for the coming of the Lord. They knew. Luther knew the pillar of fire would return to the church. &gt;&gt; He that's why when God dealt with Luther the way he did, he could operate in a manner to know that God is going to return to the church in this hour. You say, "How do you know that?" Because not only the message that was given him of the just shall live by faith, but he took that word revelation in his heart and he preached that word and lived that word and there was a people that was made ready for the coming of the Lord. That's right. Right? And then Wesley, he knew the pillar of fire would come within this hour. He was waiting on it. And the prophet said, they didn't live long enough to see this. But you see, like Luther, like Wesley, and like the rest of them, they all were looking for the coming of the Lord. They were all looking and knowing that in this generation, this time that God was going to come back. That's how it was all the way from the Garden of Eden all the way down. They were looking for the coming of the Messiah. When they offered the lamb, they were looking for the coming of the Messiah. It wasn't just a ritual. It wasn't just something they did. That's why you can hear David say, "I was glad when they said unto me, let us go to the house of the Lord." &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; They would go there during their three times of the year that the sons had to come and present themselves before God. And God has operated down through three dispensations. Son of God, son of man, son of David. And it is God that is calling his sons to present themselves. Not what we can bring, not what we can achieve, but just present yourself in God's presence. And God has what's needed in order to release that part of himself in you that's really him. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; It's God working. It's not what what I can bring. I I I have nothing. You have nothing that we could bring. Aaron and his sons had nothing that they could bring. That's why Paul could say, "Present your bodies." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just present it. Just just surrender it. Just say, "Here I am, Lord. Here I am." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the greatest thing Isaiah could do. &gt;&gt; Isaiah when he saw the vision break, he said, "Here am I." &gt;&gt; See, he was surrendering. He just presented himself. There's nothing he could do. But God provided the cleansing. &gt;&gt; The word of God came to take came the presence of God moving. Who's going to go for me? And Isaiah saw the task. He saw the finishing up of the great commission. He saw that and he said and and notice he then looks to himself because he said, "Whoa, it's me. I'm a man of unclean lips. What's he recognizing? The word being revealed really reveals there needs to be a cleansing." And as that comes, what happens? God stepping down. That's all God wanted Isaiah to say is woe is woe is me. I need cleansing. And God said, I've got what you need. I've got what what is needed to take care of that. And then after that of the of that confession that came, there came forth cleansing. So it came forth repentance. I'm all I'm a man of unclean lips. Then came forth cleansing by a live coal from the altar where the sacrifice had been received and offered up. &gt;&gt; And after the cleansing, then came the commissioning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, God in this age, he that's why God allowed even Uzziah to pass off the scene. Uzziah was a type of of that of even organizations where starts out real good. The Bible tells us that God was with you, Uzziah. He conquered and he he defeated many within that. And the Bible said God was with him until he began to get elevated in his heart. &gt;&gt; I pray God, every one of us, every from this wall clear all the way and anywhere on here, God keep us little in our own lives. &gt;&gt; Let us remember that it's not us that even called us. It's not us that even that that that then that that even brought forth the confession. It was God's grace that revealed I am your safety. I am your cleansing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the cleansing comes and then what comes a pouring in of himself. It's a commissioning. So it's not it's not you walking with the message. It's the message and God's living burning reality of his fire in your life and it's the spirit packing the message &gt;&gt; through your life. &gt;&gt; It's all God's work. &gt;&gt; One thing you'll find among different for when the bride than among that of where the Bible says in that day where there will be separated as sheep from goats. It didn't say they were sheep, but as sheep from goats. That's those who who missed the baptism of the Holy Ghost. They they they missed it. They they they but but listen, let me just say it. It wasn't that they were elect and they missed it. They missed it. And they they were they were standing there and notice there were even those who would come and say, "Lord, haven't I done this and haven't I done this and haven't I done that?" And they were relying and resting upon expressions of the Holy Spirit that came through their life instead of relying on the Holy Spirit himself who is the word. See how the fine line deception is where you can rely upon expressions. That's why we don't rely upon gifts. We don't rely upon those things. But it is truly like the prophet said, it is a manifestation that the Holy Spirit is there working through the individual. But it's not the sign and evidence of a spiritfilled individual. What is that sign? Is those who can receive the word for their day. &gt;&gt; Another place brother said genuine faith in the word of God. And you know what? And supernatural that is supernatural. &gt;&gt; And then all the rest of it goes with it. And for the bride of Jesus Christ, you may not be gifted like a somebody else. I'm not gifted like other ministers are, but I'm not resting on my gift. I am resting on the word himself, the Holy Spirit, and what God has done in my life. And that's what I'm resting on. &gt;&gt; And that's what God wants you to rest on because there's promises to be taken in this hour. And when you're resting on that word, you realize I'm a part of that word. And that word is a part of me. The rapture is not coming without me. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That is so good. &gt;&gt; So God's provided a way here. That's why the prophet would say and just let me let me just drop this in just here a little bit. He would say in humble thyself. He takes the podium once again because that message is broken two parts. Said God will never put his spirit in an unholy, unrighteous, disobedient temple. Can can the Holy Spirit fall? The rain falls on the just and unjust. Sure. But no, it's got to come in the way of the cleansing of our hearts from all guile and all iniquity that we might be pure before God that he might work his pure Holy Spirit through us to bring these things to pass. And he quotes Jude, I earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the saints. He said they got away from that. How men of corrupt mind and so forth had come in and begaled them away from the real things of God. &gt;&gt; And God can only operate as we let him operate. Now, I don't want you to take this even what I'm I'm quoting here and ministering this morning and place this message off to be just something of well, I've already come through that. Let me just tell you, the Bible says, "Let every man know how to possess his vessel unto sanctification and honor." &gt;&gt; And that is an ongoing work in our life. &gt;&gt; Let me just say it to you like this. There's things that maybe you've been praying, God, and Lord, change this about me. Change this about me. And let me just give you a news flash here. There's things that God is not going to change about you, but he's going to manifest his glory by giving you discernment by the word to recognize when things want to come in and try to flare up your personality, try to flare up your temperament. And you know what? God wants you to stand there as a son of God over this right here and say, "Not today, Satan. You're not rising up here in this vessel." &gt;&gt; Amen. That's overcoming to recognize that the God in you has already overcome this. So, we need cleansing. That's right. For the Holy Spirit to come and we need to continually be cleansed that he might work in our midst. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; So, now I want to just say it like this. The way the way in here is the person of Jesus Christ. The way is not a list of ordinances and commandments. It's the person of Jesus Christ. That's where I understand Israel was blinded. But Paul tells us in re in in in Romans that they did not receive the righteousness of God. &gt;&gt; That's good. That's good. &gt;&gt; Now, God gave them a substitute until the word would come. And the whole reason the word came was for redemption. The word never came to anoint their systems. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? The word never came to a to anoint Phariseism, Sadduceism. The word came to vindicate. The The word himself. It came to make himself known to those the Bible said that were sitting in darkness &gt;&gt; that were wanting. There was a longing. There was a a hunger. I know there's a deep. I know there's a place that I can live in victory. I know there's a place that I can rise above that. What was that? It was the call of the hour while the word was coming forth that was calling what was laying on the inside of there. And here came the Messiah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The word made flesh. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And even while the word was made flesh, before it was ever offered up at Calvary, &gt;&gt; the Jubilee was being sounded. The Bible said their sicknesses he lifted them. They He bore them that it might be fulfilled in Isaiah 53. He had borne our sorrows. &gt;&gt; He came to those that were tormented. Legion that had demons and spirits all that had accumulated in his life. And Legion wanted free from that. He was under darkness. There was a little woman at the well. She was longing for the Messiah. You know why she was longing for that? You know why Legion was longing for that? Cuz the Messiah, the answer, the need was on earth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? They didn't need more Bible training. They needed the living God. &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet said in the rising of the sun, this little eagle didn't need pictures of eagles. &gt;&gt; Or teachings on eagles. What this little eagle needed was to see a being like itself. [Music] [Applause] So, I'm telling you, the way is not a is not a list of ordinances and commandments. That's where Israel, they didn't want to forsake and accept God's righteousness. But you see, the person of Jesus Christ, the living word, being revealed among us and moving in your life will lead you to deeper thoughts. It'll lead you to higher objectives in your walk with God. &gt;&gt; Now, I want to think I want you to think about this. God himself is the one that made that requirement. And when God makes that requirement that there's no way that that of the of the of the of man could come back into fellowship with God unless God come down himself, it required a kinsman. And this is why the prophet would I want you to understand this. The prophet would stand there in the message, the breach, and take and point out the necessity for the kinsmen to come in order to free man from sin. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; So when he's preaching that in the breach, he's not altogether taking you back to a historical happening. What he is doing when he says, "Let me sound a trumpet unto you that the virgin birth produced this." That's right. &gt;&gt; What is happening there? The sacrifice, the atonement has already been offered up. But God in this hour sent a prophet. The prophet that God sent was not to elevate the man. But a prophet is a sear and he's caught up above everything to be able to look back and to see the reality. And that's what God sent a word in this hour to call us back to the true atonement. Not another atonement. Not another killing, not another sacrifice, but to take us and point us to the all sufficiency of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Where man was being pointed to other things. And God in this hour opened up his word outside of the camp. &gt;&gt; And he called to his children, "Come out of the camp. Come out of her, my people." Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet said, "God opened these seven seals outside of denomination &gt;&gt; cuz they've always been against it." What is those seven seals? It not only takes the cover off of Satan and his attempted destruction and discrediting of God's word. But who is it that's uncovering the devil? &gt;&gt; I tell you who it is. It's that seven seal. &gt;&gt; It's Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What is that seven seal? It's Christ being reproduced in a bride body. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's the living word, the Messiah veiled in Messiah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; It's the coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, it is. &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet called it the bride coming. [Applause] It's Christ coming down in veils. &gt;&gt; And his coming in your life so silences every other voice. &gt;&gt; That's why his coming is a half hour of silence. &gt;&gt; It's not known as any other man. And the prophet tells us when the veil drops behind you, you can't even hear the outside noise. God works by such a way in this hour to silence every other voice. Amen. &gt;&gt; So where your life is being completely and you bring every thought in subjection to the voice that not only spoke out here but the voice on the inside that has rose up and said Lord I believe you Lord I receive you Lord that's who I am and it rises from the voice that is within your life &gt;&gt; so now what what had come on display is the very righteousness of almighty God. It's God's righteousness that has become on display in our life. Now watch how Paul would put this. But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested being witnessed by the law and the prophets. Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe. For there is no difference. For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God, being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are passed through the forbearance of God. to declare, I say at this time, his righteousness, that he might be just, and the justifier of him that believeth in Jesus. Where is boasting then? It is excluded. &gt;&gt; By what law? Of works. Nay, but by the law of faith. Therefore, we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law. &gt;&gt; Brother Samuel, what are you saying? I'm saying quit trying to clean yourself up and believe the word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You don't hold the ability to clean your own life. &gt;&gt; But you must have faith in the blood that was shed for you. The just shall live by faith. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. Oh, that's a very elementary scripture. No, it's not. You're living right here. You're justified by your faith in your sacrifice and you are resting in him. You're not resting in your own works because no doubt through this building every one of us have failed him. Not just even this week but even maybe this morning. &gt;&gt; Maybe you got upset at a Sunday driver in front of you. &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm saying? You're not justified by your works. Stop allowing the enemy to try to take away from the blood of Jesus Christ. You stand there. I am justified by his blood. &gt;&gt; Brethren, this blood's got power in it. [Applause] I like how it said this righteousness that Paul would write of is neither an attribute of God, not the changed nature of the believer, but Christ himself &gt;&gt; who fully met in ourstead in behalf every demand of the law and who it is but but the act of God called righteous. &gt;&gt; It's God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why everything you're approaching the word, you don't approach it by your own righteousness. That's right. &gt;&gt; You understand why we need the continual cleansing of the word. &gt;&gt; You know what it's doing? Because you can feel and lower than a skunk. And you come to the house of God and you feel and the devil's telling you ain't no use for you to go. There ain't no reason for you to go. And then he'll tell you, well, look how many times this and all that right there. But you see within that, if you look at that and focus on that, pretty soon that voice, you give it time in your life. The P Paul said, "Do not let your members &gt;&gt; be instruments to unrighteousness." It said, "Do not let unbelief, sin reign." &gt;&gt; Don't let it linger in your life. Bring it right to the word. &gt;&gt; It's not about whether or not good you are. It's about him who is the righteousness of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This is why Paul would talk about how he preached Christ and Christ crucified in 1 Corinthians chapter 1. And he would bring it on down. You know, you see, you see, you know how that there are those that that you know at your calling that there's many not many wise men and not many mighty and not many noble. He didn't say there wasn't any. God's got to have some wise men, some noble men, and some mighty men that are able to humble themselves for God to prove and say, "You know what? These men were great men or or great women or great ones, but you know what? They were willing to humble themselves. They might have been a rocket scientist, but they were able to humble themselves and believe the word through a man who maybe couldn't even pronounce his ABCs. They were able to recognize God." Amen. &gt;&gt; In other words, lay aside their earthly wisdom when they came to church. &gt;&gt; That's so good. &gt;&gt; Lay aside their earthly wisdom and say, "I'm here under the table of the Lord, and I'm here to receive from that heavenly wisdom." [Applause] &gt;&gt; But Paul let us know that within that, you know, you God's chosen foolish things of the world. &gt;&gt; God's chosen base things, weak things. &gt;&gt; Come on, friends. We not we need to be able to fellowship around the word. God allowed this to be and it was purposeful so that God would be able to display himself through our lives. This is why Paul said that no flesh should glory in his presence. But of him are you in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, &gt;&gt; righteousness, sanctification, redemption, that according as it is written, he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now Paul, you know, Paul rightfully so divides this. And Paul, remember, he lays this down not only through in the Corinthian church, but even all the way through the book of Hebrews. And Paul was letting it know that the letter, but the spirit giveth life. Now remember, Paul never took away and said, "Well, the law ain't no good." But remember, when the Holy Spirit is come, it is the righteousness of the law. &gt;&gt; It is the life of the law. And Paul says that there was a ministration that was given there even on Mount Si. What what what was righteous about it? Because it was according even to God's own nature. But now since and through the offering of the sacrifice of the Lord Jesus and the coming of the Holy Spirit, witnessing back to you that we we have now been made righteousness because he who knew no sin became our sin. &gt;&gt; And Paul is echoing now that this is a this is a righteousness that is exceedingly great. In other words, you can't box it up just in your little circle. &gt;&gt; You can't just box it up here. It's an exceeding righteousness. And neither can you limit it just to one time, one event, one part in your life. The righteousness of God. It began a catching away in your life. And it will culminate with the very change of the body. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Catching us all the way there to the to the meeting in the air to the to the wedding supper. Catching us all the way here coming back down in the battle of Armageddon. Then catching us back away. Then he all the way through. It's catching us until the righteousness of God has come to a complete fulfillment and culmination where the heavenly Jerusalem it sets upon a redeemed earth. It is the culminating of the righteousness of God. And there's only one thing that you can say is God did it and I'm glad I was there while he was doing it. I've been a part of it the whole time. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hey, every type in the Bible not only spoke of him, but Esther speaks of you. &gt;&gt; Rebecca speaks of you. &gt;&gt; That's right. Come on now. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; So the because you see with this the prophet would take it like this. He said, "Now the blood, the blood of bulls and goats," Paul, you know, picking up there from from in Hebrews of Paul laying this down over and over and over through every chapter working to build the faith of the believer in the finished work of the Lord Jesus Christ, the present fulfillment of the word. &gt;&gt; Now remembering because you know it's like the blood of bulls and goats. It it covered but it couldn't atone. &gt;&gt; That's right. it it could not bring the worshipper fully back in fellowship with God whereby we would actually be under the blood. And I'm talking about were they under the blood as far as the innocent sacrifice? Yes. Where they could have fellowship with God. But now when the perfect blood was come and was shed. That's why God became flesh that he might bring you and I make a way to bring you and I unto himself. And let me just say it like this. I want you to understand this in your mind. It's not just about you like coming from the back pew or here up here. It there's a part of it where we talk about progressing in the tabernacle of the Lord. But I want you to remember you are the temple of God. &gt;&gt; So actually what it is, it's not it's not so much you coming from here and traversing all the way back there or whatever, but it's actually the Holy Spirit, the blood of God that's moving deeper in your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. and moves to the place of the soulise, &gt;&gt; right? And he meets you first in your mind. The prophet said, "The altar's in your mind. &gt;&gt; Altar's in your heart." You meet him there. You know exactly where you're wrong. They they were convicted. They were pricricked in their hearts. Right there at the altar here. You confess your sins. But what made what made you do what you did, the thing is still there. What happens? The blood. It must come deeper in our life to do what? Sanctify. Set our mind in order for holiness. &gt;&gt; Amen. cleansing or cleansing out of our life. And then what must happen? The blood must come deeper into that of the new birth of the soul where it changes the very nature and now raises up that son and daughter of God where you're no longer a potential but now it's a reality living through your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The blood has to go deeper. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now this is why that when the blood of bulls and goats they could never get the stain out completely. You know, I don't know about you, but I' i've had some shirts and don't look up here to see if this is one. I've had some mainly been sometimes, you know, it's shirts and and you don't realize when a stain has come and or you do, but you forgot about it, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Am I the only human here like that? &gt;&gt; Instead of carrying ink pens, we carry Tide pens now. But you w you wash it and then you know as soon as you dry it, &gt;&gt; it's what they call it sets in there, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And that stain becomes a memory of something you did, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You got that in that dress shirt. Oh, I don't know where I was at. Right here. Let me see what date was that. &gt;&gt; That's how the blood of bulls and goats was. Yeah. &gt;&gt; The prophet said it never could fully get the stain out. There was still a trace of it. &gt;&gt; But when the blood of Jesus was shed, &gt;&gt; brother, it had within it the power to get between the worshipper and the sin and the desire. Cuz that's what it really was to release the worshipper from the desire. That's the power of the bleach of Jesus Christ. That's why the prophet when he would take that message God hiding in simplicity. Let me just tell you something. This message was not man trying to figure out things to preach. These are divine announcements orchestrated and placed by a sovereign God. It holds a message. Peace after peace after peace after peace all together. And there he points to you and I that this blood, this bleach that has come that when sin is confessed, &gt;&gt; it's placed in the blood of Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; Satan will try to bring it up in your memory, but you've got to stand there that I have met God's requirements. I confess my sin. How do I know that it was a real confession? My heart agrees with it. I abore that sin. I detest that &gt;&gt; and I've turned away from it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I know. I know. I know. You think, "Well, yeah, Brother Samuel, this is back down, you know, and and kindergarten 101." It ain't kindergarten 101. &gt;&gt; Let me just tell you something. In order for God to continue to work in your life, because in our lives, there's things that can accumulate. &gt;&gt; That's right. The prophet, God allowed the prophet to be transparent to show you and I how things can accumulate in a person's life. &gt;&gt; And it isn't that the prophet went out in the world for them to accumulate. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; That complex that he dealt with, it didn't come after the seals. It was already in progress. &gt;&gt; One of the greatest events that was taking place. Come on. It didn't just happen three months later. It was already in progress. Yeah, &gt;&gt; but he had to come to a place and God brought him to a place to a showdown to where he could see the direction he was going and bring him to a confession. &gt;&gt; Aren't you thankful for God's grace? &gt;&gt; This is why friends is continually in our lives. That's why the devil would love to keep get channels all plugged up. He'd like to throw rocks down into the wells of Abraham. &gt;&gt; You know why? He cannot do away with those wells our father dug. &gt;&gt; He can't do away with the channels that God has through your life, but he would like to clog them up. &gt;&gt; Come on. What was one of them called? Bitterness. &gt;&gt; Dysfellowship. &gt;&gt; You know what it was finally? Then when Isaac went, Isaac said, "We don't need a new message, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; We need to go back to the wells that our father dug and clean out the wells." &gt;&gt; They had to get down in there and clear out rocks. You know what rocks are? Confessions. &gt;&gt; Things that they were saying that wasn't even according to God's word. &gt;&gt; And it had to be cleaned out of their life. Let me ask you something. What could bring you and I into a place to examine our lives to where it needs to be outside of the living word of God. And God ain't going to go out here and say, "Well, I'll take somebody else. I'll take an Eleazar for my heir." God said, "You are my heir. You are my son and daughter. But Lord, how can it be? Lord, I make so many mistakes in my life. How can I possibly be the bride of Jesus Christ? But God, let you and I see that the whales that I laid in your life, the the channels that I've laid there, I laid those channels, even your weaknesses, that you might surrender them, that I might pour myself into those channels and use myself &gt;&gt; through your life. &gt;&gt; So I say, Lord, give us grace to get down the well. &gt;&gt; Amen. All of a sudden, you see this rock coming. What's going cleaning up? &gt;&gt; Getting cleaned up. &gt;&gt; Throwing rocks out. Why? There's water beneath here. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost didn't stop. The Holy Ghost didn't cease. The Holy Ghost is just as strong and as powerful as it ever was. &gt;&gt; But we've got to clean out the wells. Amen. &gt;&gt; So good. &gt;&gt; Notice the prophet says it like this in the token message. He said the blood cleanses. The spirit is a token that the blood has been applied. And the spirit is the token that the blood has been applied. And until the blood is applied, the spirit cannot come. But when the blood is applied, then the spirit is a token sending it back to you that your faith in the blood has been accepted. Your fair is paid. &gt;&gt; Your fair is paid. It's all over. The case is closed. You're a Christian. You're a believer. Christ in you and you're in Christ. &gt;&gt; Now, notice, you see, when God God's sending a word in this hour, he is that word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? He is the way. And let me tell you why God sent this message. Now you know do do you know to to others and and people can say oh my this is this is so hard and this is so difficult. I in one way I understand because I was there one time. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I was there one time even born and raised in a message church and I thought I thought that it was about what I could do. &gt;&gt; And let me just tell you buddy I've been mustered up strength a lot of times. But you know what? After a while, miss meal cramps hit. &gt;&gt; The mana became rotten. &gt;&gt; Now, the Holy Ghost never rots. &gt;&gt; But what that speaks of is if it's not in the predestinated place &gt;&gt; of the golden armor of the soul. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It can wither. &gt;&gt; Our lives can just, you understand, friends. That's why not only, listen to me now. This is why we must have the true baptism of the Holy Ghost within our soul. &gt;&gt; Because even when in our spirits we get weary, there is an anchor that holds us. &gt;&gt; Even when you don't feel, but there's an anchor that moves you on. &gt;&gt; There is a hold that's in your life that is greater because let's just be honest. There's times as things even in our spirit. You look what a wonderful service this is so far. everything that God is doing, even the service on Thursday night. But you know what I'm talking about? How Satan would like to come and try to steal the what God has done in your life. And you know what he's trying to do? He's trying even to get things just put a little damper over it. Just try to get you covered over. You understand? Do you realize when the devil sees you getting into the service, let me just tell you, you want to welcome the anointing of the Holy Spirit, start agreeing with the word. &gt;&gt; Start amening. You're not amening, Brother Samuel. &gt;&gt; No, no, no. Don't don't even think that you're amening the word. You got to be deeper to see. It's beyond brother Samuel. It's amening the word. &gt;&gt; When you begin to agree with the word of God, what happens? It invites the anointing of the Holy Spirit to come into this meeting to come to your life and bring change. &gt;&gt; He's here &gt;&gt; and we invite him in. &gt;&gt; Lord, they constrained him. Don't move on. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But you watch how the enemy &gt;&gt; will also try to work in a meeting. &gt;&gt; Cuz remember &gt;&gt; when God called for the sons of God to come, Job, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet said in question answer Holy Ghost, he said Satan's in every meeting, &gt;&gt; right? I know we, you know, we make the expressions, open the door and let him out. Well, that's true. But you know what? He'll still the the the devil's this kind of guy. You kick him out this door, he'll be back at the front door. kick him out that door. He'll come in the back door. You know what he's trying to do? This is why he sees you start enjoying the word of God and then he'll try to put something over your life to try to condemn you and try to point out why you're not worthy. That's the very moment that you need to rise in the righteousness of God and say, "Lord, your word is true. My thoughts are a lie." Those thoughts that are coming, it's a lie. What's he trying to do? Put a damper on you. And what is that damper about? It's trying to break faith. Hallelujah. The blood cleanses. &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to think of this in this manner. What is the blood and how do I apply it? I know it's very simple. What is the blood and how do I apply it? &gt;&gt; Now, we know that there's no literal blood. That all went back down into the ground. So Paul, when Paul would write all the way down through the the the Hebrews and and bringing this about and so putting it in in in in in order is to let us see that the blood itself was shed. And now that the blood has been shed, it was with the purpose to bring cleansing that the spirit of God might call to the worshipper and say, "Hey, come on under the blood." G &gt;&gt; that the spirit might call and say there's room for us all. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That the spirit might call and say, "Come get under the blood." &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, when we look at this, notice Paul in Hebrews 12, I'm not going to read all of this, but some of these places I'm just going to have to like a stone hitting water here this morning on this. And I don't want to necessarily just bounce around, but you know, you pray and I'll pray and let's let God just kind of lead us. I'm I'm just going to be a little bit longer, but I want you I want to just hit what God sees as necessary for this meeting. So within this, when we look at this, Paul was very clear. Remember through the book of Hebrews, when you even if you listen to brother Brandham preach the Hebrew series, brother Brandham so he so deals with that spirit of Armenianism &gt;&gt; that comes in there. I don't want to say spirit of Armenianism because there is a spirit that goes with it, but he deals with that whole thing that's based on your works and what you think you can do and this. And he also brings the true reality of God's grace. Remember Calvin had truth but it went on a limb. Armenian had truth but it went on a limb. But you bring it back together is where God's grace comes. His elective grace. You see it. You accept it. And then what does it do? It produces the works of the word in your life. &gt;&gt; That's so good. &gt;&gt; So it's not about what I'm doing to be accepted. It's me receiving by grace and recognizing I've already been accepted in the beloved. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me now? That's what the Holy Spirit is calling us to. It's an accepting. It's the acceptance of what he has done. Now, notice this. Paul lets them know in Hebrews 12, you've not come to Mount Zion where it's, you know, it's darkness and burning and and the thunderings and the lightnings and everything that's come to there. You've not come to that place that brings that of a of of a fear to where you would say, "Let God let let Moses speak and not God to where that they turn down the sovereign grace of God of God's desire for relationship in their life." But notice they even in they they could not be able to come even to the place that God was calling them to. And and it also goes to show how many times brother Ram says he says it just goes to show that man always wants something to do in it. &gt;&gt; Right? Adam and Eve, they made their own selves uh you know coverings and and walked out in the presence of God. on and on and on and finally here comes a man by the name and all the way yes down through the ages where you have an able who can accept he he brings what God's provided away and it goes clear all the way coming to a time in Genesis 22 where Abraham is walking on the mountain with with with a Isaac his son and he knows that his son is what God has asked him to offer up to give it all and when he gets there he does not know how it's going to happen. But he knows that I and the lad are going to come again and worship. You know what Abraham is expressing then? He's expressing that the the the authority of the resurrection in the heart of a believer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because when he came there on Mount Mariah, remember it was a moment of complete surrender of everything that Abraham loved. God tests lives and brings us to a place to where are you willing to satis settle and surrender everything in your life? &gt;&gt; Now listen to me. Please don't limit Genesis 22 to just the new birth. &gt;&gt; Because if you limit Genesis 22 to the new birth, where do you have the adoption? &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? Abraham's faith grew the whole time. But yet God seen that same faith in Abraham before we could ever see it. I wonder if we'd have been sitting in the church and we saw Abraham. We only saw him come so far as Shin are. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; Wonder if we wouldn't have been quote balling him. &gt;&gt; You got to be separated. What's true? I mean, but there's a way to express that. &gt;&gt; Sometimes the way to express that is not to go quote, but you be the living quote. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? We don't need a lot of shellacking of quotes and shellacking of scripture. You need to be the living word. You need to be God with skin on it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So here Abraham's life faith was growing the whole time. But then it comes into that place on Mount Mariah where he's offered up. He absolutely has not only tied up Isaac, but his hand is up. And remember Isaac said, "I see the wood. I see the altar, but where's the sacrifice?" &gt;&gt; And Abraham said out of the depth of his heart, "The Lord &gt;&gt; will provide." [Applause] Let me say this to you. Who has provided that you could surrender your all to him? &gt;&gt; Who's done that? He's done that. &gt;&gt; The prophet says at the end of the token message, he said, "You're the 11th hour worker. You're the 11th hour people." And he said, "You wouldn't have come here to receive the Holy Ghost." He said, "You wouldn't have done that humanly speaking, but God told you to get up and come get it." [Applause] [Music] What happened? God overrode the cloud, the darkness, the stoniness, &gt;&gt; the living presence of the living God. Not a God of not the Mount Horeb experience, but the Mount Zion experience where the living God who gave the commandments is able to come in and rewrite your story. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's able to come in and rewrite the nature in your life. He's able to so divinely place his word into our hearts. &gt;&gt; Don't you love him? &gt;&gt; So you've not come to Mount Zion. Let me get to this then. Just go right to the end. You've not come to You've not come unto Mount Zion. And to Jesus. Notice here. This is what you've come to. To Jesus, the mediator of the new covenant and to the blood of sprinkling. You know what a How many know what a mediator is? &gt;&gt; Mediator does. They They sat down between two parties. When I first got into teaching, very first year in teaching, we had a strike. &gt;&gt; I'll be honest with you, I felt like I thought I was going to cross the picket. &gt;&gt; Why? Hey, listen. Even on my teacher salon, we were we were just getting by. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm looking at it. I know what they say can happen if you cross picket lines and everything else, but let me just get to this point. They brought in mediators. You know what people was? Neutral parties. &gt;&gt; Parties that could take all of the the teachers that was demanding this. And then you had the superintendent this and somebody that can be the go-between. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, there was no man worthy. &gt;&gt; That's so good. &gt;&gt; But God came down, Paul would say, through the man Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; He is the mediator of a new covenant. He You understand what this means? He's not here to to proclaim you're guilty. You're guilty. You're guilty. You can never do it. You can never do it. But he's here to proclaim his righteousness that I am your sin offering. I am your burnt offering. I am your way of consecration. I am the unleaven bread. I am the Holy Ghost. I am all that you have need of. I am the all of it. &gt;&gt; Many titles, lily of the valley, prince of peace, but he is the all of it. &gt;&gt; Who are we talking about? Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That is so good. &gt;&gt; To the spud sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of Abel. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I want to say, look at this. The Bible said even in Hebrews 12:25, "See that you refuse not him that speaketh." Now watch how Paul would write this. Paul declares this blood has got a voice. This blood is still speaking. Are you with me now? Stay with me. He's he's declaring that. You see when we come over here then we come back in looking at the place of this. Well, who is it that's doing the speaking? The Bible said right over Paul takes us in Hebrews chapter 1 and verse one as he comes through there. God, just stay with me. God who at sunra time trans and in diver manner spake in times past unto the fathers by the prophets in the prophets hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he hath appointed heir of all things by whom also he made the worlds. &gt;&gt; Now listen, you've got to think deeper than just by his son and that being a flesh body. &gt;&gt; There you go. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Yes sir. The fle remember the flesh was not God but it was the but it was the flesh of God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? It was it was that a flesh that God had created apart from human instrumentality. A blood cell that did not God didn't borrow one iota from Mary. &gt;&gt; He didn't look at system and say well this is a pretty good thing and this is a pretty good thing. God said I don't want a hybrid bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't want her mix with this and mix with that and mix with this. We ain't trying to bring a brew. We're trying to to present the cleansing power of the blood of Jesus Christ that it still remains the same. It still can take a heart and cleanse that heart so completely till God himself can come down and live through that vessel. &gt;&gt; By whom also he made the world. Who did he make the worlds? Ephesians 2. He made all things by Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Now, we're talking about the logos, the pillar of fire, &gt;&gt; the word. Right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Right. He will lead completely to the achievement of God's purpose, who being the brightness of his glory. This is right at the express image of his person and upholding all things by the word of his power. Can we read that green part together? Upholding all things by the word of his power. When he had by himself, &gt;&gt; somebody say by himself. by himself. &gt;&gt; He didn't need nobody's help. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; He didn't need the eye in si. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? This message did not come from that of humanity. This message came from the portals of glory. [Applause] That's why Revelations 5 John said, "I looked and no man was worthy &gt;&gt; to take the book, &gt;&gt; but John weep not &gt;&gt; there is one. The lamb is worthy." &gt;&gt; John said, "I looked and beheld a lamb as it had been slain." &gt;&gt; What did John see? He saw he's all that I need. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's the end to all of my of all of everything in my life. He He is the consuming fire. Come on, preach with me now. &gt;&gt; What else did John see? When John was looking, he kept looking and finally John looked long enough till he saw himself. &gt;&gt; And that's when he started worshiping. &gt;&gt; The prophet said John looked and said, "There's John. [Applause] Now you wonder why we worship the way we do. &gt;&gt; Now you may not worship like me, but you worship in your own way. You worship, you know how you know, you know, a powerful way to worship is even through the day. You might be going through your house, going through the office, going through the factory, and the devil wants to try to come your way. But here you are in worship, in meditation, and the presence of God is abiding right there around your life. He always is, whether you feel it or not. But there you are meditating, welcoming him, welcoming the presence of God. Do you realize when you walk into the workplace, you are ambassadors of the new city, that heavenly Jerusalem? Do you realize you invite the presence of God? When you walk into that nursing home, when you walk into that job, you are an ambassador. Let me give you the prophet's words, delegates, &gt;&gt; of this new city. &gt;&gt; That's so good. Glory. &gt;&gt; Upholding all things by the word of his power. This word upholding means to catch away. &gt;&gt; It's God catching you away. Not leaving you where you are, &gt;&gt; but he's catching you away. &gt;&gt; He's loosening the hold of unbelief on your life. &gt;&gt; He's loosening holds that have been down through our life. Strains things about our life. &gt;&gt; That's so true. &gt;&gt; Oh my the word. Lord, I'm I'm trying to get this. I'm trying to get that. And remember, like we said here in the beginning part of the service, there's many of the things that God finally brings us to the realization like he did Paul. Paul, my grace is sufficient because God will allow certain measures of weakness to keep you and I in a place of humility where we need to be. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Samuel, I keep myself humble. Well, let me just tell you, Paul himself, he did that, too. But Paul also known by God, God knew I need to give him divine help as the messenger of the age in order to keep himself humble. Paul said, "Lest I should get exalted above the revelation that's given to me." You see, God is not all about what's up here. God wants to see it displayed down here. And sometimes in order to get it displayed down here, we have to be led in the dying like the Bible says like that we bear about in our body. The dying of the Lord Jesus that the life of the Lord Jesus might be made manifest also. &gt;&gt; Is that right? By his son. So who is his son now? The body already taken away but the son he did not create the worlds by that flesh body but he created the worlds by his son which is the word which is himself which is that pillar of fire. Yes. &gt;&gt; Now, you with me now? And this is why Paul's saying the blood speaks. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me now? Now watch. Paul would say it like this. The prophet picks it up. He tells us about the speaking of the blood. Paul tells us the blood speaks. You believe the blood speaks. God told Cain, he said, "Where's your brother?" His blood, his voice, the blood of his voice, the the voice of his blood calls out against you. Brother Ram goes on to pick up Hebrews 12 where we just read, "The blood speaks better things. the blood is speaking then the blood has got a voice and the voice of the blood is the word and that's what makes it whether it's right or wrong the word is identified by the voice of the blood the voice of the blood is the Holy Ghost that brings life is life brings life to the word and it quickens it amen and amen oh look at this blood speaks it speaks a better thing Brother Samuel, I I don't think I'm going to make it. Listen to the voice of the blood. &gt;&gt; And the voice of the blood don't say, "Oh, you're going to make it." It says, "I've already made it for you." &gt;&gt; You know what you need to do? Get some real good spiritual cleaning and clean Q-tips and get it cleaned out. Maybe you've got things built up so much you've been listening to so many other things and voices and circumstances of life can come our way and can so weigh us down. But God has a cleansing way to open up our hearing that will absolutely release the clogged up channels to where we're not hearing the word under a condemning voice cuz you're not hearing it right if you are. But to hear the voice of the blood, the voice of God's grace. Sure, it'll bring conviction. Let us know you're living beneath your privileges. This is where you ought to be. And he will call you from your unbelief in back into his presence. &gt;&gt; My &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The blood speaks it speaks a better thing. The Old Testament, the blood spoke of guilt. In the New Testament, it speaks of redemption. In the Old Testament, it spoke of death and sorrow. In the New Testament, it speaks of resurrection and life. It speaks of healing. It speaks of joy. It speaks of power. It speaks of life. It speaks of heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, brother Samuel, I I'm I'm hearing this. You know, the devil's telling me I'm not a very good Christian. Question answer 64. Brother Brham said, if you're worried, if your life matches the word, dismiss that thought. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? Bring that thought in subjection. He said, as a matter of fact, how he was feeling ill at the time, he said, I'm having to bring every thought in subjection right now to keep from passing out over this podium. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's bringing the word bringing thoughts, our life in subjection. That's where the spirit of God come to bring you and I and give us an authority to be able to even do that. You know, even this quote, watch this. this quote even in parenting cuz we recognize even in parenting it's just like that in the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ does the grace and the blood speaking does the blood not speak and bring not bring correction sure it brings correction but it does not leave us or bring us to a place to leave us in a dead end to strip us as far as to make us feel like a piece of trash and that we're nothing. That's not what the blood of the new covenant does. As a matter of fact, even in the old covenant, it pointed out guilt, but there was a propitiation that was made. But the new the new covenant, it not only points out that I am your way, but it ministers an encouraging overcoming strength to you to press on. That you are worthy. You are more than able. That I have predestinated you. I have justified you. I have glorified you. You are already a finished product in the mind of almighty God. That picture has already been placed on the family album. You were chosen before him in love and God is calling you back &gt;&gt; to that right there. &gt;&gt; This is why he ministers the nutrients that need to be ministered to our life. Like a woman who is expectant and she has certain cravings in her life. God knows the cravings in your life and what it would take not only to bring the new birth but to bring you beyond circumstances in life. God knows the cravings that are in your life. Lord, I want to live, Lord God, a more victorious life, Lord. I want to be more like you. And God knows those cravings. Why? You're a part of him. And so God supplies what's needed. The nutrients, the vitamins, all of those things. And you get these cravings. And what you're craving for? Your craving is for more of him. Lord, I want more of you. And what does he do? He ministers those things so that you and I might become more like him. &gt;&gt; You love him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, to think of this because you know as do do we have to correct our children? We do. But when you correct your children, you just don't leave them right where they're at. You just don't try. That's why Paul said, "Fathers, do not provoke them to anger." In other words, exasperate them. Take any ounce of hope or any encouragement away, but correct them. But let them know because real correction, the word means restoration. It means to point that there is a vision concerning your life and you're veering off right here that God's got a certain vision in the word and God is calling you to ascend into that part of the word. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Thank God for those corrections. &gt;&gt; But remember, he encourages us as well. &gt;&gt; Yes, he does. &gt;&gt; So, so it's such a fine balance. I remember, you know, even in my life, you know, as a as a parent. I'm still a parent, you know, to me is a wonderful privilege that God allowed me to be able to have. And I remind myself of that once in a while, but it's a wonderful privilege that God allowed me to have and to be able to, you know, because we go through hard things, right? We go through things and and sometimes difficult situations and sometimes you may be repeating the same things and trying to encourage in the same way and other things. Because everyone every one of your children are different. You can't take one of your children and say, "Well, I tell you what, what I did with him, I'm going to go to the other." No, that ain't how it works. Cuz that ain't how God works with you and I. The Bible said he knows his sheep by name. Knows every one of our characteristics. He never compromises his life or his nature, but he knows how to apply himself to every one of our lives that we would get it. &gt;&gt; Friends, that's the love of God being expressed right there to our lives. So how can we expect to be able to relate to one another in just a certain way in a certain way and a certain thing? God knows exactly what you and I have need of and he has provided that way. &gt;&gt; Now let me tell you what I did. It was just just as simply what I did is simply what what God has invited every one of us. I know sometimes there's things we might need to sit down and talk and counsel and things like that. But you realize everything comes back to pointing that you are the one who's actually in control. And don't allow the devil to diminish anything in your life. As a parent, you've got authority. As a parent, you may not see the way. I've been standing right there when I did not see the answers. How do I approach this? How do I approach that? How do I apply it like this? How do I do that? But, you know, waiting on God. And if you're really praying and waiting on God, then you become sensitive and God can speak through you through any channel and you will recognize him speaking. &gt;&gt; Yes, you will. &gt;&gt; That is so true. &gt;&gt; And you know what? Through all of that, working through all of that with your children, it's not actually a hindrance. It's actually God molding and shaping you. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Same thing a husband and wife and things like that. Oh, I tell you if I had this. No, no, no. Remember, God allows those things even in the coming together. You know what temper you and I put us into a place to realize that you know what? We're not all that in a bag of chips. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Nope. &gt;&gt; Nope. &gt;&gt; And you're not you're not the absolute. You're not all right. &gt;&gt; God's got two flawed human beings together. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. And God didn't call one flawed human being to fix another. &gt;&gt; If he did, he would have did that in instead of sending the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; But you know what God wants? He wants to be Jesus through you. &gt;&gt; Come on. Even in our even in our marriage, will you surrender your hands? Will you surrender your feet, tongue, mouth, mind? Will you just surrender? Say, "Lord, I surrender myself to you." &gt;&gt; You know what that is? That's that wave offering. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Lord, I surrender my all to you. So the voice of this blood, let me just try to I'm skipping here, but let me just bring it down to this moment. The simplicity of applying this blood is through faith. &gt;&gt; The Bible tells us in the book of Exodus when God showing this in Egypt, take the lamb, take unto you a lamb for the household. They were to take that lamb. They were identified with that lamb. &gt;&gt; They slayed that lamb. &gt;&gt; Took the blood. They took all of the parts of the lamb, all the pertinence thereof and things like that. Listen, &gt;&gt; they had to eat it all. &gt;&gt; Let me just make this very simple in case you don't understand. There's parts, no doubt, from setting in here that some of us like about the pig and others of us don't like. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; There's some things I've told brothers, I'll never eat that. &gt;&gt; I don't care how you disguise it. &gt;&gt; There's certain things when it comes to cows, there's certain, you know, certain cuts of meat, right? &gt;&gt; Certain cuts of steak. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; Right. You like that? But God, with this lamb, it wasn't about what cut we like. &gt;&gt; Lord, I'll take the chops. &gt;&gt; Lord, I prefer my brother. I'll just take them. Lord, I'll take the chops. But God said, you got to eat it all. &gt;&gt; Not just the parts that you like, but I wonder some of those parts they were probably eating. They probably were like, &gt;&gt; you know, that that brings it when we do it like that, it brings it from us thinking in a Disney way. &gt;&gt; Lord have mercy. I hope we're not even thinking in a Disney way nowadays. Right. &gt;&gt; But it brings it from just thinking that everything was just, &gt;&gt; oh, this was such a wonderful &gt;&gt; There's parts about the word that I'll tell you what that I don't even enjoy preaching. &gt;&gt; Cuz you know what? It's cutting. &gt;&gt; It's cutting. And it ain't just cutting here, but all through the week it's cutting. And it's not just cutting, but you continue. Lord, did I did I say it right? Lord, was it right? Lord, maybe I was too this. And you're going through. Then there's other parts of the word. Man, you love preaching. You love preaching the chops. &gt;&gt; Woo! Glory to God. &gt;&gt; But you know what? When we can just have it seasoned just right, there's there's really When we can have it seasoned just right, we might be able to say, "Oh my, here come the pertinance. Ouch. Oh me." But Lord, thank you for your word, Lord. Thank you, Lord, for speaking, Lord, to the depths of my life. Thank you, Lord. Oh, that Oh, that cut. Oh, man. That that hurts. That's like pouring in peroxide to the wound and it's isn't up. You know, you're want the drawback, but it's something. It's ministering and you realize it has what it needs within that word to do what? Get between you &gt;&gt; and that sin and that unbelief. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And that blood, they couldn't just set that blood over there. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; They couldn't even set the blood out there and say, "Let's talk about it." &gt;&gt; Man, ain't this blood? Ain't this something? They had to apply it. Yes. &gt;&gt; Now, listen things, friends. Brother Brandon put it down in such a place like this. I got to read this quote to you. I know I don't have to. I could refer to it, but you know, I I just like to say it just in the ways that the prophet would say it. I trust it's okay. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brham said, "The blood tonight is applied by simple faith. &gt;&gt; Not something supernatural. It's right around you everywhere. Just simply like a child, reach out and get a hold of it and apply the blood. The hissup is just a simple childlike faith for the believer. It isn't something out of your reach. You don't have to reach very far to get it. &gt;&gt; God brought the blood to you. &gt;&gt; That chemical blood went back down into the cell. It went back into the nutrients. But the spirit, the voice of the blood, the Holy Ghost has come to announce that Jubilee is on. You are free. The righteousness of God has made you free. &gt;&gt; And God brought this message. &gt;&gt; Not to bring us in fellowship around the chemical. He brought the message to bring us under the blood itself like it was given on the day of Pentecost. &gt;&gt; That God would bring a people back like it was on the day of Pentecost to where now a people that he has built and brought forth a tabernacle of holiness for his name's sake. A people that could come fully under the bride that have been built word on top of word on top of word on top of word on top of word from faith and virtue and knowledge and temperance been built all the way up to where it has become now Christ being manifested in a bride body to take her away and rapture. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Simple faith. Yes. &gt;&gt; You know how simple it was? Rahab heard what God was doing. &gt;&gt; And when those spies, &gt;&gt; I'm going to ask you something. How did she know who they were? &gt;&gt; Let's preach this a little bit. &gt;&gt; How did she know who they were? They weren't They didn't have on Israelite garb. They would have stood out like a sore thumb. &gt;&gt; Come on. garb itself. We use it as a slang, but it's not a slang term. &gt;&gt; The prophet talked about what he saw in the vision. Each one was in their own nationality garb. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? So now when they walked in, what was it? &gt;&gt; She was she received there was a witness that came and she received. A matter of fact, she she recognizing and something within her. You say, "What was that?" I I'm going ask you the same question. What was it that told Abraham there's something different about these men walking down right now? Yeah, there you go. &gt;&gt; Brother Ram said he knew there was something. He said cuz he was spiritual. &gt;&gt; There you go. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Sam, I wasn't even in church. You don't have to be in church to be spiritual. &gt;&gt; To be spiritual is to recognize God dealing with your life. &gt;&gt; And then coming into a place to where you become spiritfilled. Then you become spiritual to recognize God's word above everything else. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; You put God's word above prophecy or anything. You put God's word, God's word is above everything. Why? Cuz Jesus Christ has been exalted to the highest position in the church. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm talking about? Now, I don't want to go in get into examples, but notice here comes here comes Rahab. She brings in these spies. &gt;&gt; And here's what she tells him. You're not getting out of here till you give me a true token. &gt;&gt; I don't want a feeling. &gt;&gt; I don't want a sensation. &gt;&gt; I want a true token. I want something that will bring a peace and a settleness and a confidence that I know that I know that I know. &gt;&gt; She said, "That's what I want." How could she ask for that? It's because it was available. &gt;&gt; You couldn't have a craving for the Holy Ghost if it wasn't available. &gt;&gt; You couldn't even have a desire to be free if there wasn't freedom. Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; There is a place. There is a way. And that is in Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; She says, "You're not going back out the door you came. They're looking for you, &gt;&gt; but you're going to escape through this window." Yeah. &gt;&gt; And she tied that scarlet cord and let them down. &gt;&gt; When they got down, they told her, "This same cord that has brought a way of escape for us &gt;&gt; is the same way of escape for you." &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; What is he letting them know? Oh, I love Let me just use the example of the prophet said. He said, the prophet said, he said, "God's such a faithful father, if he gives one of his children ice cream, he gives them all ice cream." &gt;&gt; I like to use that quote when it comes to Mitchells. &gt;&gt; But you get what I'm trying to say. We have been made joint hes with Christ Jesus. God did not represent on on the platform night after night in the life of the prophet and then hand to you and I something that was less than God who manifest. He was greater than every disease, every circumstance, every spirit, every affliction. But God poured himself &gt;&gt; into his church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what this message come to do. The message first had to be identified. That's why the prophet said, "The same token that's worked among us all these years." &gt;&gt; Now, it's come to the capping of my message since all of those seven seals. And it's tied up in this one thing that we're all right. &gt;&gt; That's what the token came. The token is who? The person of Jesus Christ. It's the Holy Ghost. The same one that that was that moved on the platform night after night was the same God that was present to bring faith in our lives to look beyond circumstances and to accept the voice of the blood. &gt;&gt; Stand with me, would you? And let me tell you this. If you don't want to stand right now, you don't have to. Don't worry. I'm not going I'm not going to be long. Let me give you this last example. They came out of Egypt. The task masters that had always made them do what they did was still alive. &gt;&gt; They went for a few days and them task masters was still they came after him. finally had enough said they ain't getting out of my grip and they came after him. Now what happened when they start when when that happened? Israel saw and heard them the rumble. And that rumble, it scared them. They look back and said, "Oh, dear God, we're going to die. We're going to we got to go back into that." But Moses stood there with the word. Now I want you to listen to me. Here was a man that was standing under the blood of bulls and goats. And the blood of bulls and goats could so bring a man to a place to where he could speak and say, "Stand still. Fear not." The blood of God could move down into such the blood of bulls and goats could so clean a man to that place to where it could become a voice. You say, "How do I know that was God's voice?" Look at what happened. &gt;&gt; Not only did they come out of Egypt, but here they are standing be before an opposition that says, "You ain't going no further. I've got you trapped. I've got you hemmed in." Remember how it says in Ten Commandments thing, you old Brener says, "Their god is a poor general." Brother Brandham refers back to that, you know, in the message speaking &gt;&gt; and has them all hemmed in. &gt;&gt; But watch this. The humanity part's still there to where when Moses goes to God, you don't ever read about Moses crying, but God says, "Why are you crying unto me?" &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says, "Isn't that just like us &gt;&gt; humans?" &gt;&gt; There's times where, oh my, here you are. You're standing and yes, yes, yes, and here you are. But yet there's still that part that would try to rise up to doubt. &gt;&gt; Sure. But let me just tell you that doubt is not you. &gt;&gt; It's not. But here comes the voice of God and he says, "Fear not. Stand still and you shall see the salvation of the Lord." &gt;&gt; Amen. Notice he didn't tell them that they themselves that it was something that they were going to have to do, but he said fear not. Fear is the worst thing. How many knows what I'm talking about? &gt;&gt; Brother says if he said if you had cancer but didn't fear, he said you'd be better off than if you just had fear. Because what does fear do? It works to hinder paralyze. &gt;&gt; Right? Fear. But notice, stand still and see the salvation of the Lord. God wants them to see what he's going to do. The salvation of the Lord &gt;&gt; for the Egyptians &gt;&gt; whom you have seen today. Now, God didn't say they ain't there. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; They're right there. But those that you've seen today, you ain't going to see them no more. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Well, what's going to happen? the salvation of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Well, what am I gonna have to do? Stand still and see it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Stand still. Look away to Jesus. &gt;&gt; The Lord shall fight for you and you shall hold your peace. &gt;&gt; Can I read you a couple quotes? &gt;&gt; Let me get down here. Brother Brandham, if I could just quit smoking, if I could just lay down drinking, if I could just quit my stealing, if I could just quit my doing this, that, and the other, don't weary. Just walk on, God will take care of the rest of it. &gt;&gt; If I know I could do it, Brother Brandham, I'd accept Christ right now. Don't you worry. Move on. Just go on, you'll see the salvation &gt;&gt; of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says every believer when you come in and are saved except the blood of Jesus. You still how to you still try to hang on to this and hang on to that. You can't give this up and you can't give that up. After a while, God may do things for you, but you can't give up your cigarettes. You can't give up your sociable drink with the fellas now and then. But what you need is to pass through &gt;&gt; the Red Sea. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, how do I know what the Red Sea is? Because God's not asking you and I to go back to Palestine, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; He's not asking us to go back over into that area. That that that was a type, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; We can't even find the actual literal blood of the Lord Jesus. That's not what he's talking about. &gt;&gt; So, what is he talking about? is coming under the spirit of God &gt;&gt; which is the voice of the blood and allow the word where Jesus says sanctify them through thy word &gt;&gt; thy word is truth &gt;&gt; it's God cleansing &gt;&gt; yes it is &gt;&gt; God cleansing away from us all of these things and friends it's a lot deeper than just cigarettes and smoking Listen, we can go through a whole a whole list, but I'm not worried about a whole list. The whole point of passing through the blood of Jesus Christ, God even in this hour would reflect through his prophet what that pathway is. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Brother Ram tells us, he said that that star actually reflects Jesus Christ back out into the labor so the people can pass through that of the labor, the sea of glass, the Red Sea. and come out on the other side. That's what God that's why he sent this message is to reveal the way that had been closed up. &gt;&gt; That's so good. &gt;&gt; The way that had been hidden, God didn't open a new way. &gt;&gt; The opening of this word is not to not to bring a a new way. Oh, this is a new way. It ain't a new way. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, when many say, "Oh, you know what, brother Brand, I'm on this." Brother Brandham's not the one who came up with holiness. &gt;&gt; This is a restoration message. That's right. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Many of the things you can read in some of the the the look way on back in the rabbitical studies and things like that. And even with Paul, Paul believed in serpent seed, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; These weren't new truths. They had become hidden. You know, it's kind of like something you put on your coffee table. I don't know if you all have a coffee table like that or not, but we've got a we've got a we've got a pretty good size coffee table. Josh made it for us. It and and it's got, you know, I've got books there of Brother Generations book, The Messenger. We got Bibles there and we've got, you know, different books, Prince of the House of David and all those things and church age book and all that's there. And you know what? Sometimes as it gets to a place, finally my wife says, she starts taking things out and guess where they end up? My office. [Laughter] You know what happens? It's kind of like on in even in our life sometimes things can kind of start getting put &gt;&gt; on top of one another. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; And things start getting out of place. So, &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; And you know what has to happen? We have to clear out &gt;&gt; and get back down to what's really important. &gt;&gt; And it isn't that you mean to cover things up. It didn't mean, did you mean to do that at all? But it happens. &gt;&gt; But aren't you glad there's a cleansing? &gt;&gt; And it's not just to cleanse you. It's not just to cleanse you from all of our our our our, you know, the the failures and faults. And let me just say this to you. If you ever think you're going to live a life that's beyond mistakes, that's that's not. You'll never do that. But maturity is beginning to recognize more and more your humanity &gt;&gt; and beginning to recognize that to rest on the God who lives on the inside of you. &gt;&gt; Very good. &gt;&gt; You understand? &gt;&gt; So the spirit of God just passing through that of the Red Sea, let me tell you what passing through the Red Sea will do. It won't just do away with, you know, all those things we listed, cigarettes and all this stuff. It'll do away with religious spirits. &gt;&gt; Yes, it will. &gt;&gt; It'll consume religious spirits. Remember friends, the prophet told us over and over, religious spirit is the worst spirit. of all. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You know what a religious spirit is? It's a spirit that comes into a sanctified vessel. &gt;&gt; When the unclean spirit &gt;&gt; goes out, Brother Bam said he wasn't even cast out. He just left &gt;&gt; on his own accord. And when he left on his own accord, that place never got filled. And because it never got filled, finally it said, "I'm going to go back and return back to my house &gt;&gt; with seven others. Right. &gt;&gt; I'm going to completely &gt;&gt; take it. &gt;&gt; That's a rel and prophet tell ties that in to the church ages. &gt;&gt; He ties it in all. He said that religious spirit it's worse than anything else. &gt;&gt; Because you know what a religious spirit you can't tell a religious spirit nothing. &gt;&gt; Nothing. It can't be led. &gt;&gt; Can't be taught. &gt;&gt; Doesn't it's it's religious. &gt;&gt; You know what religious is? It's a covering. &gt;&gt; How to think how that Satan would would try to hand out a substitute to cover this, cover that. But friends, isn't it wonderful that God not only would speak to our hearts, but invite you and I into a place to say, "I'm your covering. &gt;&gt; I'm your all sufficiency. &gt;&gt; You don't have to walk around with your chest out because you've had 10 days straight and they have been good days and then have one bad day and you walk around like this." I know. I know. I know. Some some are melancholy. You battle against that, but God didn't strip that melancholy away. He just gives you grace to rule over it. &gt;&gt; That is so true. &gt;&gt; And you recognize it and bring it in subjection. You want to see great miracles. That's a great miracle right there. &gt;&gt; Yes, it is. &gt;&gt; Because you could walk on the water, but the water ain't going in a rapture. But God's taken that character in a rapture. &gt;&gt; And God through the voice of the blood, it has given you the strength to overcome even in your own life and walk as a true believer. Don't you love him? &gt;&gt; To free us even from the guilt &gt;&gt; so that we can continue to approach him. &gt;&gt; I'm glad for this washing of water by the word. &gt;&gt; Aren't you? &gt;&gt; And who this word is? It's our husband. &gt;&gt; I say, Lord God, wash me. &gt;&gt; Wash me. &gt;&gt; Like Peter said, Lord, wash, wash all of me. Jesus said, you don't need to be washed all over again. It's not born again again and again and again. But once you have been made clean, You need not wash, save your hands and feet only. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. So once we've been washed, but then what happens through that of the blood, the word, we're sitting under the word. And what does the word do? It's cleansing. It's washing us. &gt;&gt; What's it doing? It's making us ready for worship. &gt;&gt; Well, brother Samuel, we're already at the end of the service. Oh, please don't think worship is confined to these walls. &gt;&gt; When you walk holy, holy, holy to the Lord. That's worship. &gt;&gt; You living above sin. That's worship. &gt;&gt; I know. I know we raise our hands. We're here. You know, we shout and all that, but you know what real worship is? Living above sin. &gt;&gt; You can worship. Just begin to think about the goodness of God and what God has brought you from, what he's done in your life, and the joy of the Lord that's right there in your soul rises up to say, "I don't even know how I'm going to make it through the day, but I know in whom I have believed. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I don't know what tomorrow holds, but I know who holds tomorrow and my life is in his hands. &gt;&gt; So with that in mind, &gt;&gt; the simplicity &gt;&gt; of applying the blood, &gt;&gt; accepting, don't wrestle with it. &gt;&gt; Listen, all of this that God has given us, don't wrestle with it. Pass through it &gt;&gt; by faith. Take that. No matter where you're at in your life, no matter where you're at in your journey, I think sometimes that's one of the greatest things that can actually be a hindrance to us is we can sit around and classify a message. Well, that's justification. That's sanctification. Listen, every word of God that's preached, I need it. &gt;&gt; What if God would have sent the message of the hour and said, "I don't need to preach justification. Luther already did that." God brought justification to a greater depth than Luther ever did. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Justified as though you never did it in the first place. That's right. &gt;&gt; You know what that justification did? It didn't just take us to Calvary. It took us clear back to the mind of God. &gt;&gt; That's where you never did it in the first place. &gt;&gt; See, the word just keeps working deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper. Don't you love him? &gt;&gt; Say, Lord, all of me. &gt;&gt; All of me, Lord. &gt;&gt; All of me. &gt;&gt; Want to take that of that of that that ram, the breast of the ram, the unleaven bread, the cake of oil, and Lord God, wave it before you. It's actually waving our lives. Lord, with the word, Lord, consume me. Take all of me, Lord. Take all of my life. Notice why it was applied. It wasn't applied to the toe first, then to the thumb, then to the ear. It's first applied to the ear. Faith cometh by hearing. Then what happens? As you hear it and accept it, you begin to act on it. &gt;&gt; And you're acting on it with right hand. You're acting on it by the authority and the power of the one who has spoke to you and allowed you to hear. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And as you begin to yield to that right there, then what happens? It begins to show itself in your walk. That's why the brother Bram says when you have been saved, you confess that you are saved. When you and you believe that God has healed you, you've been prayed for, confess it. And he said, "You watch." He's the high priest &gt;&gt; of our confession. And he says, "As you confess it, he will make your body &gt;&gt; obey your confession." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. Glory be to God. Let's bow our heads. Heavenly Father, &gt;&gt; Lord, you're mindful of every need. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father, for your mercies here this morning. Once again, Lord God, may you just, Lord, bring it together, Lord. Even Lord, with that which has been spoken, Lord, for every heart and every life, Lord, for every one of us, Lord Jesus, we want to be more like you, Lord God, in every in every one of our lives. I'm sure we can test, Lord. I know I can. I want to go deeper, Lord. I want to go deeper in you, Lord. Hearts and lives through this building, in this gathering. I pray this morning that Lord God, that may Lord, their faith or may it be faith that has been granted from you to look beyond what they can do. Lord, how that the enemy is such an accuser. He wants to so belittle the children of God. Wants to Lord put us seem to put people back in a corner. You can't do this. You can't do that. But Lord, may they look and see you. I trust that Lord God even right here this morning that Lord God that they've been able to see you. See what you've done for them. Lord God to be able to lift them beyond even the circumstances beyond the boundaries Lord and Father grace that is sufficient to carry them beyond any barrier in their life. Your prophet would talk about that sound barrier that when that plane would get so close to it, it would start shaking it. It was like that plane was going to blow apart because it was close to that threshold of the sound barrier. [Music] But once it got beyond that sound barrier, it was smooth sailing after that. Lord Jesus, we know that we have, Lord, tests and there's trials. But Father, there's a strength that has come within our lives, Lord, from going beyond the camp. It's more than just the camp of ideas. It's actually Lord God when you would lead us outside of the camp of denominations and we realize Lord that it isn't always had to be that we've had to go outside of the camp of some name here or there. Sometimes it's just been things that's been right among us. But the real real camp that we've got to go beyond is the camp of our own self. That's our biggest enemy. Lord God, may we, Lord, as the scripture said, go forth unto him who's without the camp. Oh, I'm so glad, Lord God, you made a way. It's this this word is not a limited word. It's not limited in power. It's the blood is not limited in what it can do. That's why Lord, when you brought this word, it's a restoring and opening of that that pathway that has already been available. That's what this message did. It revealed Jesus Christ to be the same yesterday, today, and forever. That there's no limits on the blood. Doesn't matter what your father, mother did, or what strain lays down through your family. It don't matter. The blood speaks better things. Oh God, here this morning, Lord Jesus, as we just want to lift, Lord, our lives aresh to you. Oh God, grant it. Lord, I pray this morning, may you minister, Lord God, to every one of our hearts. Minister, Lord God, I pray. Continue, Lord. God, Lord, hear this morning. strength just moving right on through that of the Red Sea to see it that you're our way, Lord. Lord, I commit this congregation, I commit each one, Lord, into your hands. And I pray, Father, may they walk on right through the way that's been provided for you are the way, the truth, and the life. Grant it, we pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Could we just worship him in just a few moments? Go ahead. &gt;&gt; Take me deeper and deeper in love with you. And Jesus, hold me close in your embrace. Take me deeper. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Deeper than I've ever been. Yes, Lord God. &gt;&gt; I just want to love you more and more. How I long to be deeper in love. &gt;&gt; Lord, take me deeper and deeper in love with you. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Jesus, hold me close to your embrace. Oh, take me deeper, deeper than I've ever been before. Lord, I just want to love you more and more. How I long to be deeper in love. &gt;&gt; Take me deeper. Take me deeper, &gt;&gt; Lord. Deeper in love. Yes, Lord God. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, hold me close to your embrace. [Music] &gt;&gt; Lord, take me deeper and deeper than I've ever been. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord God. Yes, &gt;&gt; I just want to love you more and more. How I long to be deeper in love. Oh, take me deeper. Oh, deeper in love. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord God. Yes, Father. Lord Jesus, hold me close in your embrace. Take me deeper and deeper than I've ever been before. I just want to love you more and more. How I long to be deeper in love. What can wash away my sin? Oh, nothing but the blood of Jesus. [Music] And what can &gt;&gt; can make me whole again? Oh, nothing but the blood of Jesus. And oh preious, precious is the blood that it makes me white as snow and no other found I know whom nothing but the Light of Jesus for my cleansing. This I see. Oh, nothing but the blood of Jesus. And for my heart this my Yes, Lord. Nothing but the blood of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh preious. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. is love. Oh, it makes me w and no other found nothing but the blood of my Jesus. [Music] This nothing can for sin at all. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory be to God. &gt;&gt; Nothing but the blood. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, that simple childlike faith. Just apply it. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; I take this word into myself. &gt;&gt; Take this word into my life. &gt;&gt; Nothing but the blood of my Jesus hand. And all preious, &gt;&gt; precious is the it makes me wide as snow and no other found I know nothing but the blood of my Jes. Jesus and all my hope and my peace. Oh nothing but the blood of my Jesus. Oh, and this is all my rightousness. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, Lord. Nothing but the blood of my Jesus. &gt;&gt; Well, precious is the blood. &gt;&gt; Well, that it makes me wise and know no other fountain. I know nothing but the blood of my Jesus. Oh, and now by this I'll overcome nothing but the blood of my Jesus. And now by this I will reach my home. Nothing but the blood of my Jesus was singing.
