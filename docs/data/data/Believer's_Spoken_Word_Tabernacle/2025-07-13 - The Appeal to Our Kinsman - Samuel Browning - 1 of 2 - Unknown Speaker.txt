And that's the safest place that we can stand &gt;&gt; because God is obligated to his word. Amen. I believe we're a part of the word and &gt;&gt; we're standing on that word and God's obligated to that word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham, he takes us to where Moses um &gt;&gt; called out to God and he said, "Lord, take me blot my name out of the book first." And uh Brother Bram said, "You see, you put you put God's word before him." He said, "God can't go over his own word." &gt;&gt; God God came right there. As a matter of fact, brother Rem goes on to say, he said, "What God saw in Moses' heart was the cross." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, take me first. &gt;&gt; We want to be standing on his word. I believe God has given us the grace to do that. Amen. And so, we're so thankful for that this morning. And we I know the requests that were made um uh from Marco and then I just sent out that I just received from Sister Anna just moments before service uh where Marco had had that pacemaker put in this morning and uh just needing just to a real rest and and uh just a real calming there for him as well and with breathing and all of that. And you know, even when things have um taken place, many times we you've you've experienced this enough to see that many times when we're praying for needs, when you begin to see victory, that's not the time to let up, &gt;&gt; but pursue. &gt;&gt; Like when Gideon, the Midianites were routed, but Gideon went and he chased those other two down. And that's what we want to do. We want to just hold uh Marco up in prayer. Uh also the request was made and that came out earlier this morning as well for Sister Irma Cruz uh that the Lord will just uh moving there uh for that need as well. And we certainly believe that God's more than enough. &gt;&gt; God's more than able and he's willing. How many believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible said if two or three agree is touching any one thing, it it shall be done. And we're standing here as believers. We haven't made ourselves believers. We're standing here by the grace of God. So, we just want to draw amen upon the Lord here. Let's just go to him in a word of prayer. Heavenly Father, Lord, as you see each and every request, you see every need. Lord, you know the things that we Lord have need of even before we would ask. But father, we ask you Lord because we believe that Father, as you have said, ask the Father, anything in my name and I'll do it. We believe, Lord, that you're more than enough, Lord. You're more than able. And to believe that God, you have satisfied, you have made a way, Father, for every need, Lord, to be met already. Lord, we just Lord want to unite our faith and our hearts together Lord on behalf of these requests Lord I know that they have already been offered up in prayer even before the service Lord ever even started Lord but Father we know one thing we can never do too much and that's pray Lord we're just Lord looking oh God and asking for your favor Lord upon these needs Lord for for Marco Lord that you would move, Lord. I pray on his behalf, Lord, just a complete deliverance, Lord. We pray, Father. Lord, you're merciful, Lord. And we also, Lord, ask, oh God, that you would just, Lord, visit the hospital room there as well, Lord, for Sister Irma. May you just touch her, Lord. I pray may the angel of the Lord, I pray, God, just sweep through that room, Lord. May you just move, Lord, I pray as only you can do, Lord. For Lord, we're standing here, Lord, holding to your promise that you're the Lord that healeth all our diseases. Father, you by your stripes we are made whole, Lord. We're standing, oh God, upon your word. There's no greater place that you have that we could stand, Lord. And oh God, we just, Lord, look to you this morning. I pray that Lord that you would just give us grace as we've gathered here that we Lord all together could just step away for a few moments Lord and knowing that the cares of life that Lord that we we face things that are before us Lord even in this coming week and things that you know that lays before us but Lord we just our request is just to lay it down before you Lord and Father Father, within this moment, Lord, I believe God that you can just so move down for us in such a way that'll give us, Lord, just a real a real strength even to face the cares of this life to where Lord our lives are not overwhelmed by the cares of this world. But Father, we receive sufficient grace, Lord, to face, Lord, those things, Lord, that you see that await us. Even things that, Lord, that we have questions about and we need direction, Lord, in our lives, Father, we're asking for your mercy. And we ask that God, you'll just come in a special way. May you just, Lord, so anoint our hearts and our ears. Anoint me, Lord, I pray. Give me the grace that Lord, not only myself but this entire congregation might just be able to step aside and may you have the right away this morning. We pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Thank you musicians. Amen. Let's look here in Ruth chapter 3. And uh I want to read if we could before seated just try to read down through verses 1 through verse 9. And uh Lord willing we posted on there about the fireside fellowship. Um, so that'll be this evening at 6:30, Lord willing, if it doesn't rain. And, uh, I so appreciate the fellowship. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Um, &gt;&gt; yes, sir. One thing, one comment that was shared with me, a text from an individual is saying, you know, it's just it's just something that's very very precious where you you get to know people and you get to know that sometimes the things that you didn't know about them. And I'm not talking about bad, but I'm just certain things that it just encourages us encourages us along the way because we're not in this on our own, &gt;&gt; right? you know, when we get to heaven, we're not going to have, you know, well, you know, I I don't I'm just going to have my place way way way way way way out there. I'm going to be an offgrid living believer. That's good. &gt;&gt; No, but um we're going to be together &gt;&gt; and uh you know, even on there we we we will be rejoicing of God's grace that has brought us through. And to think even brother Bramman says we'll have the times to set around and the special singing that'll be done. My I mean we won't ever have to worry about work and all those other things right now. But I'll tell you what gives you and I the real strength to be able to face tomorrow to be able to face the things of life because life itself is there but God gives us grace and God will even move even through the times of fellowship. I I know for myself when I have I have felt really encouraged in my heart even at times and you know sometimes there's been situations where man I just didn't and I know we always have to take into account where we are with um you know our body and things like that and sometimes I've had to say no I can't do this as far as go to a a meeting I always try to do certain things to at least support it and but you know what I found is uh many times as I walk away not many times each times I walk away. I'm always saying, "God, I'm so glad that I went." &gt;&gt; And I know I know we have different ones, you know, um with uh traveling in and sometimes it makes it harder. And I'm I'm trying to look at that to make these times as far as the fireside fellowship more if we can even more accessible and maybe moving it to a different day and a different time. And uh I'm not doing things to load your schedule. I I want I want to encourage fellowship. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because we need fellowship. &gt;&gt; Amen. Re Ruth chapter 3 verse one. Then Naomi her mother-in-law said unto her, "My daughter shall I not seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee?" And now is not Boaz of our kindred, with whose maidens thou was? Behold, he went with barley tonight in the threshing floor. Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy raignment upon thee, and get thee down to the floor, but make not thyself known unto the man until he shall have done eating, eating, and drinking. And it shall be when he lith down, but thou shalt mark the place where he shall lie. and thou shalt go in and uncover his feet, and lay thee down, and he will tell thee what thou shalt do." And she said unto her, "All that thou sayest unto me, I will do." And she went down unto the floor, and did according to all that her mother-in-law bade her. Verse 7. And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn. And she came softly and uncovered his feet and laid her down. And it came to pass at midnight that the man was afraid and turned himself. And behold, a woman lay at his feet. And he said, "Who art thou?" And she answered, "I am Ruth, thine handmmaid. Spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmmaid, for thou art a near kinsman. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'd like to speak on the appeal to our kinsmen. Amen. Amen. God bless you as you're being seated. I pray that God would just give me grace to be able to deliver as he's pressed it upon my heart. But we see how that within this aspect in looking at Ruth being such a not just a a beautiful love story, but it's a much deeper meaning of of redemption. And all the way through the scriptures, the prophet would admonish us, if you've read through the Bible and you don't see Christ in every verse, then go back and read it again. and to understand that that that it's the book of redemption that all the way through the scriptures it's God showing through shadows and types and all that has been laid down of that his heart of redemption and we understand that that redemption is to bring back &gt;&gt; and I want to just look at this here this morning because this word appeal I know sometimes we hear this used in terms of a court case but that's not what is here this morning. This word appeal, it means it's a serious and urgent request. So there is in the appeal to our kinsmen. And I want you to think of this that this goal, the goal all along where Ruth herself, she is moved, I believe, by the spirit of God under an uncction to make the decision she makes there even in Ruth chapter 1. And then we see her laboring in Ruth chapter 2. I believe the Holy Spirit is right there working upon her life. And yet with all of the labors and things that she has done, the goal itself when Ruth comes to this place to appeal to Boaz as her as as her kinsman, as the kinsman there to the household and she makes the request that he would take her within marriage because of all that pertains to that. But the goal itself that Ruth had wasn't just to be married. No more than it was for tomorrow just to have an act. That was not the goal. &gt;&gt; But tomorrow was moved by the spirit of God. That there would be that of a of of life of that of of seed that would be raised up to the name of her husband. So the goal itself wasn't just to be married. This is this is redemption that was working upon Ruth's heart. And she's moved to ask Boaz to fulfill his right as a kinsman to IMC, Naomi's deceased husband, and calls his name and inheritance of that land that belonged to him to go on. And here we were, you and I, we were in the pawn shop of sin and sold into it by unbelief from the first couple, Adam and Eve. But God himself came down in order to redeem back to our lost estate of sons and daughters of God. We're potentially sons and daughters of God. But through the shedding of the blood and the Holy Spirit coming down to make that real and quicken that in our life, that's where it becomes a realization. And then that's where as sons and daughters of God, we begin to express that or is expressed through our lives. So the kinsman, it had to be one that was of a nearest kin. He had to be worthy. Had to be a worthy man, a man of honor, had to be financially able. And most importantly, he had to be willing to redeem the estate. &gt;&gt; She was near here. Ruth was moved. there was a a real love for that of of Naomi. And I want to just say it in this way when I start through this. There's some parts that when looking at this appeal, there's some parts that I want to just look at here this morning. And that is the right request. It starts here and looking at the right request being made. And that request that is made is where that Ruth herself, she presents herself to Boaz under the leadership and direction of Naomi. Naomi being that of a type of the word. She is given because the Holy Spirit is not going to lead us outside of the word. He always lead us in his word because the Holy Spirit is given to fulfill and confirm his word. And so the right request that is that is made in that time where she draws near to to to Boaz and she ask of him to uh spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmmaid for thou art a near kinsman. I want to just say this to you that this itself must be the very desire. The request had to come from Ruth's heart. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Boaz was a worthy, honorable, able man who was able to fulfill the work of the kinsman. But he could not and he would not force himself upon Ruth. &gt;&gt; It had to be her request, her leading. Yet like brother Brandon will tell us in one place in the message he says as and he'll take from that scripture where Boaz saw Ruth and oh he he wanted to marry her and and I want you to see it in this light that it's it's Christ himself his desire is to be united with us. That's what that's what the new birth is. It's where there is a real relationship, a a a uniting where all that has been lost is restored to where that it is it is no longer under our name, but it is the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that is on display and living throughout our lives. And so Boaz, he's not going to he's not los. &gt;&gt; Is that right? Right. We are from God's own loins. The prophet said, "We were in the loins
