there in Connecticut and just ministering to the body of Believers that's there and um just trying to encourage them in this time and um so we was was a full full day full days hitting the ground running and so I'm still just a little bit tired but um just ask that uh we just continue to keep one another in prayer um I sent out that text musicians God bless you I'm good I sent out the text yesterday when all that was taking place um I was in here praying and I hear sirens all the time so you know you don't think nothing about it and I thought what's going on that I heard that you know how you hear brakes go off on a truck and I heard it right outside the door I thought what in the world's going on you know uh first of all I was like who came in here with a semi I was going out after him you know but I went out the door and uh and I looked and I thought oh my goodness a firet truck you know it's kind of like a shock because I don't know for you but I've not really been near a fire that where a house has been it's been something you drive by and see it but and I seen it over there and they I just you know to me like I mentioned on the text I was so thankful that um Gus's daughter was there I went over um after everything got uh settled and even Crossing during that time right there I got stopped by the fireman hey who who are you you know we got to watch who's on here and uh so I went over and I wanted to I wanted to speak with them and I got a chance to to talk with Gus and I told him I said Gus I said as soon as I seen that I said I seen I sent out text and the church has been praying said well did you do that I said yeah we we've been praying and Gus is such a nice they they th those those people over there Gus and Donna they've been so good to us and you know Gus has told me at different times he said we watch this we watch this parking lot when you're not here he definitely packs heat I'll tell you that you know he told me some things before when he was watching out here one night and he said early in the we hours in the morning I thought who's out there he said so I went and knocked on the door he said but I had something with me you know so but uh he just you know we we just so want to remember them at prayer and they um I've seen his truck over there but I don't know if there if he's even back in there it was I sent you pictures I tried to do those things just so that you would know as you're praying and it got to a place when everything was first going you couldn't even see I couldn't even really see past the first row like my car was right there I could barely see my car parked by the it was just smoke was just rolling out of there and so it was something with the chimney when I asked him and um so thankfully his daughter was there and uh then you know she was was speaking about that you know and of course her dad which didn't surprise me about Gus but Gus just thought I'll just put it out myself so he tried to with an extinguisher but it it it it came right back and so my heart just went to them and I stood there and talked with Gus and just spent time with him over there um yesterday evening and then came back into the office here and um so let's just remember them in prayer and I told him I said hey anything we can do you let us know and um I want to I heard many prayer requests were mentioned tonight and I want I want to ask you to continue remember brother Homer and Loria in prayer uh brother Homer it was at the end of last week when he he sent me a text and uh asked me to pray because they just had uh diagn or um how do you say it diagnosed with covid and so he just I asked him how you doing he said it's pretty rough and but uh the Lord has certainly been merciful and we just been holding him up in prayer he said just got just got a little bit of a cough right now but he's doing better so and uh I just said Lord Brother you can't take brother Homer that's my buddy uh but uh brother Homer just means so much to me he's been such a such a blessing and um so I also want to remember I don't know if this prayer request came because sometimes I have problems hearing sister remember sister Sharon Van van white do I got that right brother Paul leontine sister she they they've had a reoccurrence of the cancer and so she was just going into radiation that uh reoccurrence uh was noted at the end of December and so um they're uh doing going back in for radiation here I think beginning tomorrow or one of these oncoming days so let's just continue to you know keep her in prayer and uh she's sister Sharon's doing very well it was mentioned here about sister Cheryl Lewis too and so uh was there to see her the other day and to pray with her and uh and she really got a double whammy of the pancreitis and then the gallbladder with gall stones and so they went in to take the gall stones out today and they they couldn't so she they're looking at doing that I guess possibly because everything was there's so much inflammation so um they're looking at doing that in one of the upcoming days so just continue to keep Sister Sarah in your prayers and and um that the Lord will just you know just move for her and uh and I think that's pretty much just about it brother Dave Junior had sent me a text right before when I was getting in the in the office uh early today and and he uh his back is doing so much better and they've had some transition things at work going on and uh so he just texts me said I I just he had to go back in early tonight so he just asked us to remember in prayer and I ask you not only for the healing his body but just that God will just give him guidance and wisdom because I don't know if it's it seems like it's a new position and it's some things that you weren't planning on it just happens and um so just keep him in prayer and once again it's so good to see you and um we just uh this where my heart is at this that's where my heart's at and uh so I got to see you this is good man now we can just say take the name of Jesus with you and let's go home but um we want to look into the word of the Lord tonight and U just ask the Lord to come in a special way if you'd like to stand with me I want to go to 1 Corinthians 14 1 Corinthians 14 and verse uh 26 is where I want to begin here this evening pardon me so it says how is it then Brethren when you come together every one of you half a Psalm half a Doctrine half a tongue half a revelation half an interpretation let all things be done unto edifying and the key is edifying who the whole thing that everything that is to be done it's the edifying to the body If any man speak in an unknown tongue Let It Be by two or at the most by three and that by course so notice how Paul writes this here giving this direction that the most within when there's a gathering that that comes among the people the most is two or two or three at the most and that by course so that you don't have everyone going at the same time there's the tongues and then the interpretation is the prophecy so what if what if there's a fourth person that says I've got something on my heart I know it's coming can't do it hold it that's the scriptural order that's good so even if it's felt yeah even if it's felt but if they're and let and let one interpret but if there be no interpreter let him keep silent in the church and let him speak to himself and to God let the prophets speak two or three and let the other judge so now now Paul brings this in on the judge on this is supposed to be judged if anything be revealed to another that Seth by let the first hold his peace for ye may all prophesy one by one that all may learn and all may be comforted so this notice how Paul is dealing with this this isn't someone satisfying their self as though they must or have to do something and if they don't within a service I failed that's good you let me just say this to you I could I could read a quote to you out of this multiple quotes there will be many many people that will walk down the streets of gold that will never speak in tongues but said they'll never work miracles that is real good going all the way down through he said but their life is a display of the glory of God so I I ask you what's the greater Miracle that's right do we need the gifts we do but the gifts themselves are no Vindication of God's presence Among Us is so good we need the gifts don't we brother bam tells us we have five ministerial gifts brother BR said this is the those are four if we read the scriptures and we don't we can't understand that God has five ministerial gifts and he said if we still can't get it God has nine spiritual gifts now true we can pull out of the scripture and say well one prophesy one Speaking tongues and one prophesy and it come to pass surely God is with you but remember that is only as needed are you hearing me it's as needed so we it's not necessary for us to have that in order to say we've had church tonight no more than anything else that's right is that right that's that's that's what Paul is bringing us to I'm so glad about that aren't you I'm glad that the message of the hour goes in it bring everything is rest rest rest notice and the spirit of the prophets are subject to the prophets for God is not the author of confusion but of peace as in all churches of the Saints may God bless you and bless the reading of the word as you're being seated I'm sorry I didn't even move that along when I was reading let's go to on down there in verse 36 Paul said what came the word of God out from you or came it unto you only if any man think himself to be be a prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the Commandments of the Lord but if any man be ignorant let him be ignorant so Paul's just said this we're not going to argue if a man chooses to be ignorant and not heed to the leadership of the word that's on him I don't want to be ignorant that's I want to be taught by the Holy Spirit wherefore Brethren covet to prophesy and forbid not to speak with tongues let all things be done decently and in order now I'm going to just step in here tonight and uh I'm not on job but I actually looked at a lot of these things and I've studied on these things for about the past two to three years almost and really just looking over over them and going back through and I know I've dealt with these things at different times I think one of the last times I had to CH search down in outlines I think it was back in 2006 that's a long time ago but I've hit it here and there and looked at things and things that I look at that uh that I see there's things that I can I watch and I observe meetings and other things too and I watch what takes place and I'll just be honest with you I'm not here I do not take it upon myself I'm not here and responsible for any other congregation but right here but however any other congregation chooses to do that's what they choose to do but the very thing that was so burdened upon my heart that when looking at this and that is I want to deal with within Church order and deal with this very Point spiritual leadings time and place I find one of the things that over the course of time that that I have pastored and it certainly is very peanuts compared to Brothers like brother Homer and things like that that probably is listening right now it's very small it's only been 22 almost 23 years but the one thing that I have found and I you try to work for in everything that you do is to try to alleviate so that the people of God operate under rest so that there there's a rest within them they're not feeling pressure um they're not feeling some some sort of a guilt or something but I realize that there's things that many times that whether it's been in it's been taught or it's just our conception of how things are it can become so lodged in that gate of the conscience in the spirit just let me give you an example it can things can become to such a place to where that individuals can actually feel if they're not coming to an altar every service some something's wrong I've had them get up right behind me after ministering in a meeting and when the spirit of God is speaking personally to individual hearts and a person would come right up behind me and I had no idea that this was done but actually called everybody to The Altar and you can imagine the altar was already enough of individuals filled to pray with that had already been convicted but then to have someone else come behind that and say I think everybody needs to come to the altar we all can come well I'm not against coming to the altar but I'm also want that that comes to the altar it comes under the conviction that the word has brought to their hearts that's that's good so there's ways and when we approach things on spiritual leadings and things to where that many times that sometimes when I've noticed it over the time to where that sometimes a person can feel like in some ways if they don't do certain things that they're displeasing the Lord and they just it it it just so it just so wears on them and yet everything that God will ever lay upon our heart to do God will always make a way and it will always operate according to the word and there's things that can be genuine leadings but it still falls into our discretion on when we yield for that to come to pass and that's what I'm going to work with here tonight on spiritual leadings because when we look at when we look at statements the prophet makes in the church age book of how that the the congregation is not to be operated by program but it's to be under spontaneous worship but spontaneous worship does not mean just free for all spontaneous worship does not mean I do as I feel to do that does not mean that way when brother Bram goes on to say in the Ephesian Church age that that that the camp of God is is under the pillar of fire is to be dominated by the Holy Ghost to where that all have a part in participating in the service it it we understand the Liberty that we have but if we go back and look close enough there was a divine order that God had set forth for the children of Israel they just couldn't run into the Tabernacle they couldn't even even they could not just come into certain places at certain at any time they wanted it was at certain designated times and in a certain designated way even when they camped around the Tabernacle they could not decide well you know I'd rather be on the west side instead of the East Side I'd rather be on the south instead of the north you say did that matter it absolutely mattered God had their standard placed in a certain way God is a god of order and sometimes that that seems to be uh a clash with the word of God but it's not the word of God is orderly it's not man's order when man gets a hold of it it's a mess but when God God is a god of order even when we we look at and think of the planets the solar system and everything else God so set those things in a place of divine order Now watch how brother Ram says this here he says put those things in their places he's talking about the gifts put all your gifts in there your teachers your Apostles put everything in its place and then operate in decent and in order you'll find God is a god of order I love that you'll find how many have found that that that order is not taking away from God order is not or order is quenching the spirit order does not a true order by God does not quench the spirit it is a channel for the spirit to be displayed correctly that is so good so you'll find God is a god of order and he will bring the thing right up there them so order is Godly and it's also Divine now look here in some scriptures you'll find this mentioned a lot in Paul's writings and especially here in the Corinthian Church Paul dealing with this you know coming out of out of that of communion when there was some things that had to be corrected he says if any man hunger let him eat at home that ye come not together unto condemnation and the rest will I set in order when I come in 1 Corinthians 14:40 which we read this let let all things be done decently and in order that very thing right there with the scripture just become it's a principle we can apply to all of our lives that very scripture right there is a scripture and it's just like when I can tell them you know in things when it comes to courtship brother Shane you know this this is the very scripture I said if you'll just run everything through that scripture you'll be all right you won't have to have a whole list of rules of dos and don'ts but if you'll run everything right through that scripture you'll be all right this is very very powerful let all things be done decently and in order now does that mean that I don't believe we need teaching on things like courtship and this things like that sure but you understand what I'm saying in 1 Corinthians 16:1 now concerning the collection for the saints were the offering that would be lifted as I have given order to the churches of galatia even so do ye in Colossians 2:5 for though I be absent in the flesh yet I am with you you in the spirit joying and beholding your order and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ and then he goes on for this call speaking to Titus I have left you in cre cre that thou should us set in order the things that are wanting and ordain Elders in every city as I had appointed thee I'm thankful for order I'm really thankful for it I mean I I look when I go into Banks or sometimes when you go into different I'm thankful there's an order of approach I'm thankful it's not a free-for-all I've been in places where it's a free-for-all and you don't know who's next you can just leave this country and I don't care if it's a stoplight it doesn't matter right yeah first time I went to Honduras I was sick as a dog when I got off the plane and that started driving me around I wasn't used to Horns being the right away like I told Brother Samson and M in Ghana I said in Africa I said in America horns are a novelty they just put them on the car but Africa that's your communication I mean they they scared me to death I mean here they are pulling out in front of you finally you know God gives you Grace to just be able to lock in and you you know you're laughing at me but you know brother Josh way if he was here tonight he was the one that called me when he was back over in Congo where he came from and said I don't know if I can do it I don't know if I can stay here this many more days I said yes you can yes you can you got business to take care of yeah yes you can and I but I told him this is what you do don't watch the road they know what they're doing they they know how to dodge the telephone poles come up on the sidewalk and they they're used to all that just put put your seat or put your face on the back of that seat right there I said trust me I've learned to look at headrest a lot but it's order you know I appreciate order because order gives you Direction order even gives you an expectation it it shows a natural progression with things of things that we can even look forward to now when you think of this it's very much like Elijah in this in in the time in First Kings 17 it was a prophet to set the church in order according to God's Divine program when Elijah got on the mount remember he repaired the altar but he didn't pick up stones or take Stones up there he used what was already there it's just it was scattered and that's the same thing when God sent the prophet in this hour and let me just mind remind you of this right here the prophet of God in this hour is a major prophet it's not an Ephesians 4 Prophet it is the major prophet that Ephesians for comes under true Ministry does and every believer will heed to that word as well too that is one of the evidences of the Holy Spirit In Our Lives now when we look at how that Elijah would put this order together even the wood would be put in order even the sacrifice would be put in order and when God came down like he did on the the Tabernacle Moses had erected Solomon on and on and on and even right there on Mount Carmel God himself was confirming the word he had given to Elijah and when the order had been followed God came to his word and so when we look at this brother Bram tells us in church order in December he says Brethren we've been called this meeting together here tonight for the purpose of knowing how that to operate the Church of the Living God which we believe to be a part of this church now not too long ago about a year ago I heard a brother that would took this very quote right here and and isolated Church order to brandom Tabernacle yeah isolated well this doesn't pertain and just kind of you know poked at different things but this if you notice what was spoken right here and recognize that the prophet of the age you see this is why that when you have men going in and well I think brother Brandon meant this and I think brother BR meant this let me tell you what that is that is not recognizing the ministry of Malachi 4 the son of man Ministry Revelations 10:7 it does not recognize the Divine Authority that God has committed to his seventh angel messenger which has now been placed into the hands and hearts of the Believers so to me I'm not interested in tampering with it you and I were like the people that had the hood up on on the car putting this wire to this wire to this to this to this we did not even know how to make things run we didn't even know how to make our own life operate and live a real Godly life but God himself came down it was not brother brandham but God through that vessel and through that Ministry it was not the second in command it was the chief mechanic that showed up and he showed up if you'll notice how brother Ram tells that he showed up in unlikely apparel suit and tie he did not show up in blue jumpsuit like that of someone working in a garage why he was the chief engineer and when when the young man or listened to what was said to do and it worked he turned around and that's what caused him to ask the question who are you and the man said I'm the one who designed that engine aren't you glad that the one who knows about you and I the one who who wrote who is the word aren't you glad that he's here right among us to give sense to the word oh I thank God for that notice how that you know brother R would would speak of these things in church order and he would he would speak to us and say you know brother and I know he says that you know many of you you kind of you kind of look to me you know as as a there's got to be a final absolute and you kind of look to me in that way my absolute he said is the word and as Paul said you follow me as I follow Christ notice in Philippians 4:9 those things which you have both learned received and heard and seen in me do and the God of Peace shall be with you second th Thessalonians 2:15 therefore Brethren Stand Fast and behold the Traditions which have been taught whether by word or Epistles these are the kind of traditions that I don't mind but see sometimes our the word or the verbiage is it's almost looked at well I tell you that the bride's free we're free from within we are free within our nature we have been we have been disassociated not just only divorced there has come a death to that first man and we have been United to the second Adam to the Lord Jesus Christ through him by a spiritual union we are a new creation in Christ Jesus and that being said then there are things that when we look at it our only desire is to acknowledge his word our only desire is to obey his word I believe that's the desire of every one of us as Believers I want to just touch this this uh uh scripture here tonight but I'm not going to read it you can read it at home because I I'll cover it in another service coming up but when Paul writes of this in Romans 12 verse 4 and verse through verse 8 and he is talking about how that we have our bodies have many members and likewise the body of Christ has many members and so forth and how that there are gifts that differ according to the grace of God and prophesy proportion of Faith but let us wait on our ministry and so when we understand that there's a time that even you know when we're looking to the Lord for his leading even as we come together we are waiting upon on on the Lord to guide and direct and minister to us the very things that we have need of just as much as I am trusting in his leadership all the way even through the time that I will stand out here God close my mouth to anything that that you don't you don't wouldn't want me to say and give me and fill my mouth with what you do want me to say well see brother bam is taking this and I'm not going to dwell on this tonight and he all the way through the message this was not a night 1963 thing where brother Bram comes out and specifically says that type of ministry tongues and prophecy should not be done on the main floor oh it's all the way through the message quote after quote after quote but you see these are things remember a prophet of God is coming to put that in order now I know I know remember when brother BR when he actually did that that's what caused Junior Jackson to to leave the church yeah that's right that's what caused Junior Jackson and the rest of them and you know why because they were not willing to come in subjection to the word of God and then like brother Bram said he said that's why junior Jackson is having all the problems he's having wow now I don't want to be ignorant and I'm saying these things and I'm saying I really am I'm saying it you from from the depths of my heart there's things that I've looked at and you know there's a lot of things that God has opened my heart and my eyes to over over the period of time I there's a lot of things and there's things that even that I intend to really to revisit here tonight and looking at some of these things and looking at it but if you can understand it this way right here the prophet of God the word of God never come to take anything from us that God has given us in his word that's good it's it's here to move in the right channel now notice brother Ram will talk about this in in church order and you know he deals with things cuz you know even as we have and I know now we' we've got we've got new ones that's come in well I mean my goodness since before I mean 19 years ago when I took just time and I probably it'll be a lot more in depth than it was the last time on those things but you know when you look at it there's times that we all even need Refreshers on these things I don't know about to you because I don't when I when I when I Minister yeah the holy spirit will bring things back to me that I've studied man he'll bring things back that I didn't he wasn't even thinking about whatsoever he'll begin to put things together but when I go to study something like this I don't go back to Old outlines I I I want to study I want to look back through the same quotes and look over things and and also as you'll bring things to me because listen I I want the Holy Spirit to teach me in his word I want God to speak to my heart and minister to my life don't you I I mean when I display something up there you don't want to say oh I know that quote already oh I know that scripture already I want the Lord to speak to me I I because if he's laid it on my heart and going through these passages then Lord speak to my heart there's something in here that we need in our lives so brother R goes on and he's talking about you know when you have someone like a baby starting out he says you know they they can have a little bit of a difficulty with talking they goooo and things like that and you know when they're doing that like our our boys when they were going through that they never we didn't spank them because they goooo did y'all do that we didn't do that I mean even when they were walking learning to walk I never when they fail and you know you start putting everything around tables you're putting pillows I mean the whole thing becomes like a you know you almost want to think you need but blow up you know blow up things all around everywhere you know cuz you're oh my goodness there's a corner table quick quick every all of a sudden every right angle becomes a problem every corner because all you can see from Corners you look at Corners instead of saying man that was a beautiful table when you're at the furniture shop you look at it and say wow what a knot that could put on their head true you you you you're worried about that you see them you know going like this and so you don't spank them when they fall but you guide them yeah and so when brother Braham is going through this within the he would even speak of these things to where that even when you have someone come in maybe there new you don't reach up to them harshly maybe they they just come in and and you know they're they themselves are just learning because maybe they weren't setting and and being taught and maybe they come from a different background and brother BR said bring them back to this tape take them to the side and just talk to them just work with them there a little bit just just minister to them because you can't you can't correct them for anything that they don't already know and you know there's a way to correct correction is not altogether just the belt right that's right the Bible deals with us that chastening itself is also to with words as well to guide now brother B will deal with this in this manner and he says you know there's always an appropriate time you know how you teach and little children you we we all had to teach our kids um uh we all had to teach our kids CU you know they thought everything was it needed to be known hey Daddy Daddy Daddy and here you are you might I might be in the middle of of of having a brother over at my house and sister sister and man all of a sudden they run in from the back door daddy daddy guess what I hit a home run it's over the fence the neighbor said you got to come and get it so it becomes an opportunity to teach them that's wonderful now Daddy's talking right now and then even to further instruct that later on because if not they'll keep interrupting you the whole life oh yeah so you got to set boundaries boundaries are healthy they're Godly that's that's a different subject but to understand you got to teach them see that's the same way God does us God doesn't God doesn't look around and say man why are they thinking this why are they but God comes around to give us Direction and instruction now notice brother Bram says if there's ever been anything that's been a thorn in my flesh now remember I'm talking about spiritual leadings time and place for everything if anything ever been a thorn in my flesh out in the meeting it's someone to rise up when I'm speaking and then give a message in tongues and break the spirit now notice what happened it broke the spirit I just come out of a meeting in New York in different places to where ministers they let that go on time after time and it's nothing but a confusion so when God is dealing in one line of thought Now watch how he he's laying this in when God is dealing in one line of thought he would be defeating his own purpose if he tried to get a line of thought to you to the congregation to make an altar call in something but in so there's a natural progression God has an order in other words it's not just like you know rearranging de chairs and man we don't know there's there's an there's an order there's a there's a natural progression now at the end of the service sometimes I know you know from from being here with me at times there's been a few times where God had us and I think a few times where we had a prayer line on a Thursday night and I let you all know about it I said hey the Lord's laid it on my heart that was a rare thing I think I can probably count on one finger the number of times we did that on a Thursday night right so it wasn't like some but I knew that in my heart it wasn't something I was even working I knew that in my heart but in the after service that part of it we don't know if it's going to be many times I don't know it's going to be an altar call is it going to be a prayer line uh I I don't know what's I don't know maybe it's just going to be like just a worshiping and just watering in the word but that's that's what God would have us do and that's a natural progression within a service everybody with me so now brother Bram goes on he says for instance he said let's say we're sitting at the table and talking and all of a sudden Junior runs to the table and takes all the attention from what we're doing and hollers Dad Mom I just hit a home run at down at down at the down at the team and we're doing this that and the other and we're right down on a real sac subject now can you imagine this cuz maybe you can't but as a pastor here I am sitting and finally it's come to an opening and all of a sudden Junior runs in you're like oh no oh no oh man and because it was just a sometimes it's just a small little window of a moment or you're in a sacred moment with something that talking you know with your with others and all of a sudden that sacred moment of where things are moving into w how did that sacred moment come that sacred moment did not come just like that that sacred moment it came it moves into that just like Genesis 1 Genesis 1 the seeds didn't all of a sudden just come up that's right the first thing be the first thing that leads to relationship is the word the word creates the atmosphere it was the word that drove back Darkness look you can take Genesis 1 and we can preach a marriage banquet from Genesis 1 because it's the word that drives away Gloom anybody ever been gloomy everybody amen down it's the word just like when you come and said in here it's the word or words our Expressions that begin to change the atmosphere for what purpose for seeds to come forth so God's got a God's got a goal in mind God has a goal in mind and we want to operate within within that right channel he's he's got the channel already set we want to just operate within that now notice brother BR says it's a sacred subject and him hitting a home run that's all right at the baseball game that's all right but he's out of order when he breaks in on the message that we're talking about let him wait till his time comes then he can tell us what did at a baseball game we've all probably had to tell our kids later later later later later but when is later sometimes I want spiritually word but when is later Lord so now notice brother re says that's the same thing we find with gifts today that's the reason God cannot trust too many spiritual gifts with people they don't know how to control them that's an incredible thought so you mean that gifts and the gift of the Holy Spirit it isn't just like you know that I'm just like a you know just like a puppet that's just being moved around and I don't have no you have control over it just like me standing here preaching I have control yielding is being able to yield at the right moments there's a control that's over it so it's not just something that's just loose and well I feel no it's it's having a control it's also knowing at times because sometimes if you maybe could look at the amount that I have here in an outline you would say dear God I hope he's not going through that whole thing don't worry I'm not it's it's it's a study it just keeps on going but you know what it's knowing win at that time to shut down and I'll just be the first I'll just be honest with you there's been times I've missed that I wish I could say it was just one time but I've learned and I'll tell you this right here I've paid for it God has corrected me so you know where I would rather be with that is when I can see in a certain place and oh it might be wrestling Within Myself I want to go on this inspiration this was the point I was really wanting to bring us to and God just is like stop and it isn't it isn't You Preach until the people are dead but it's almost like you're halfway through your steak dinner and say hey would you like dessert and take it away I don't know about you you can tell by looking at me I clean my plates you do not take my steak away at a steakhouse while I got a steak Knife don't even take the loaf of bread till I'm done with it matter of fact bring me a bag and extra butter to go home they don't know how to control them notice what brother BR is saying here don't know how to control that's that think about it friends when he's talking with Pentecostal people that concept goes against the grain because what came out of ausa Stree that goes against the grain brother B says that's what's the matter today that's the reason we don't have any more than we do he said but we find a lot of impersonation of spiritual gifts but I don't believe there's so here in our church and I'm thankful for that I don't believe it's an impersonation at all I believe we have genuine gifts but we must know how to control those gifts so it isn't just something that's just loose like all of a sudden you know somebody you know it drops on you know somebody's heart this special just dropped on my heart and they stand up and just start singing that special out of order correct they might have received divine inspiration from God exactly divine inspiration but the wrong time what's the correct time hunt the song leader up find out who it is going to be leading the next service and let them know I have a special to sing are you hearing me this is this is order because it's not about you see but sometimes if we're not careful here we are buding in and stepping in because of what we feel to do instead of looking at the right order but the same you telling me that it can be an absolute Godly leading absolutely and you will see this with different quotes that I'm going to read here tonight hallu so good it's how to control them not them controlling us well well I can I I got to do it at this time listen when you decide let's say you're out driving around tomorrow and all of a sudden it presses on your heart don't go down Cooper Foster 254 but I want you to go down and go up here to Lake Road and go down maybe that's an impression maybe it's a Divine leading oh brother Samuel every time he talks to me is a Divine leading you might want everybody to believe that but I know better because the prophet of God himself tells us I just read this where he when he was being led by the Lord in Memphis he thought even when he put the thing in the mailbox is this just an impression that's right that's so good but what he noticed was the leading kept moving him in that way now he could follow that out there just like you could or I could that's different but we can't just bring leadings into the house of God and bringing leadings in here and then we've got to do whatever we're led to do there's an order there is a divine order oh my don't you love the Lord notice notice here when you look at it in the scripture Paul said out of love this is out of Charity do does not behave itself unseemingly that means not proper or appropriate it won't do that love does not do that now brother brand has asked the question you know regarding with spiritual gifts and speaking in tongues brother BR does he the person who's speaking in tongues does he at all times have control over the spirit as to when and how to act yes sir the Holy Spirit controls it has control of you and you have control of it how powerful it has control of you see it's God moving upon you but then the holy spirit is entrusting you as a son to know how and when time and place hallu say God help us it's just like time and place when God delivers something on your heart maybe it's to speak to a loved one it does not mean at that moment to call them all right it may not mean that I'm not telling you that it doesn't I'm just saying that in this manner is that there are times where God will drop things on your heart and it may not be for a period of time later before the opportunity is presented for that to be expressed I've witnessed that with things I just told you even with the things that I'm ministering here right here tonight with things and waiting I honestly thought at the beginning of January last year that I would be in job 24 and and getting into these things here and laying in Doctrine but you know what that's not what God had now I'll be honest when I came towards the end of the year I thought oh my what's this year going to hold now moved over that I skipped over that chapter and I'm here Lord what what what's it going to behold but you know what God has everything in time because it's not about even of all of the wonderful things that I can be studying and looking at and outlines and all that but it comes down to what is the correct thing to be spoken in this season so is appropriate times notice it has control of you and you have control of it it'll never make you do anything contrary to the scripture the spirit does not misbehave itself unseemingly so there's appropriate times how many believe there's appropriate times it's appropriate times appropriate times for singing a special appropriate times for giving a testimony appropriate times for the gifts themselves to operate there are appropriate times the Bible says quench not the spirit despise not prophesying every time I've ever read this scripture over the years I can't help but wonder when Paul would write this right here quench not the spirit if there's not been things to where that within it that individuals have not given and release themselves to the Lord at the correct time in the correct Channel and instead because they didn't release in the right way the correct channel that all of a sudden they just felt like I ain't going to do nothing at all and they quenched the spirit also wonder when I read this despise not prophesying I wonder I wonder if when every all the time I read this I wonder because just as much as the prophet seen so much that was standing up he was being interrupted even in the brandom Tabernacle brother Bram said all the way through the 50s all the way through the 60s he gives us gives us orders of how that is to be done how there's to meet beforehand all of those things and how he had that in place clear back in the 50s and even before that he tells us but yet he dealt with not only things being interrupted but individuals standing up and saying behold the Lord is coming and quoting scripture and this and the Bible tells us that it's not to be vain repetitions that's why brother BR tells us he said that's what the preacher is when he quotes the scripture he said but anything that comes forth is to be a direct message to someone and he likened it Oh my he likened it to exactly what takes place on the platform aren't you glad for order I am appropriate times now notice brother B is is dealing with this here in questions and answers and he's talking about speaking in tongues don't worry I just engines got a little warm here in Connecticut I was able to preach with it on the whole time but uh you know with this here brother BR is going into you know he's talking about speaking in tongues and he'll say this multiple places of how he says it just comes like such a combustion until a person hardly knows what they're doing or they're saying and he saying the interpretation is actually the same way too cuz the Supernatural and he says it's like something grabs you now I don't have this quote displayed I'm going to get a part of it here he says it's like something grabs you and takes a hold of you and you're doing it brother Neville steps up brother brandom brother brandom he says now you're you're you're not intending to say brother brandham that that a man speaking in tongues and service that he wouldn't have no control over you because after all a man with a gift is supposed to be in control over brother Neville was a faithful faithful student wasn't he because remember brother brother brandham had to correct brother Neville we'll get into that but notice when you look at this brother Ram said no no he said he can control himself whoever it is he can control himself now so he's just said this it comes upon you all of a sudden but it doesn't leave you without control right so it's sound like I just can't help myself no you can't right he can control himself he says you're supposed to be conscious enough to know that he's about to speak in tongue brother Ram said yep that's exactly right that's exactly right now notice brother B said say for instance now he brings it down for you and I say for instance I'm standing here and anybody when you're fixing to shout anybody ever shouted okay about five of you did you ever feel the power of God come on you when you start to shout said how many ever did that well all of us have you just sit there you feel it coming now there's where you can quench it you hold it see it's not right I agree there's right times I agree there's right times I mean what good would it do for somebody to be shouting in your ear and you can't even hear what's being preached I'm listen friends I believe in shouting you know that you know that I mean no not everybody can be as quiet as me I know that but I believe in shouting I believe I believe even having a good time in the Lord am hey I just don't shout when I'm in church I shout man when I'm listening to the message but sometimes it's kind of hard to shout when you're walking in Costco with your airpods in but I'm in control see I don't say oh I can't help it and I tear the the bread case apart I just can't help myself no I've got control over it I'm really I'm not saying things to have to be funny I'm just trying to let you brother goes into this you think I'm saying things right now brother Bram goes into this very thing that you and I have control over it we have control over now watch as he goes on he says you just sit there and you know you can quench it but you hold it and it's not right then he goes on to talk about he says let's say here you were and you were standing talking to the president of the United States and you were standing out there talking to the mayor of the city and talking about something or another and all of a sudden a bunch of people come around and man you feel like jumping up and down and screaming and hollering kicking and everything else he said but they'd say man that guy is crazy but you see if we're not careful then here all a sudden a scripture will be inserted well in the way that's called heresy so worship I the god of my fathers but the prophet also told us questions and answers on the seals right don't make yourself odd amen don't make yourself odd like everything you know it's almost like everything is spiritual like oh they forgot my fries in my McDonald's I'll tell you it must no it there somebody just forgot it they didn't have the running president working there at that time it's okay you can but you understand what I'm saying sometimes we if we're not careful it BEC everything becomes like a spiritualization let me tell you something right now let me just pause as parents that will run your kidss nuts because that's not real life every moment and everything of our life does not have to be spiritual that proves nothing nothing we walk here in this life this your life is to show them what the Holy Ghost is all about it's God living inside of a human being in the middle of your temperament hallu cuz if you're not careful you that can come on and then everything you do is absolutely right on the dot thus sayith the Lord in your own mind now watch brother Bron dealing with these things and he says regarding that you know not shouting in front of the president and everything else cuz people going to think you're crazy he says you know better than to do it right then you hold although it's just digging in you and you just can't hardly hold it yes sir uhuh uhuh oh boy she's digging you to pieces but you know to hold your peace right then some of y'all eat lemons before you came here tonight or did the deacons pass them around I'm preaching the message of the hour right here oh I know there's a liberty right here I can sense it but I'm just looking at this here we know better than than that he's bringing it down to things that we feel to do it's just like I tell you what there has been meetings I have set in and you know what God had to teach me cuz sometimes I was such a knucklehead when I was younger I got so excited about the word I still do but sometimes I just thought people weren't spiritual if they put their head down and pluged their ear how foolish I was you know what God had to teach me is try got to contain it here and wait for those moments when maybe the whole congregation explodes wait for those moments just take it in because you need to hear I mean I was hearing but they need to hear too I'm hearing and you know a lot of times with the gift of a minister that part within me I can work and and I know where they're going I begin to things begin to F not because it's just a gift in my life and all of a sudden I can be racing out there and I'm like glory to God and they're back here at AB B CDE e f and you're thinking Lord have mercy what in the world I I must be missing something I tell you I must have spent too much time on my phone coming here today I must and and you know the devil just starts beating you up but you see how that is there's a right time even here because you could shout so much to where your wife didn't get a thing out of the service so there's a right time for everything do we believe in shouting we do notice so there's a knowing how and when the Bible tells us in 1 Corinthians 14: 32:33 the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets now brother Bram deals with this in correction and everything too he says when you go to correct somebody he said they get all blow it up at you and everything else he said you know it's not the spirit of God verse 33 for God is not the author of confusion but of Peace as in all churches of the Saints brother B says this on questions and answers on the Holy Ghost he says a preacher up preaching in the pull pit and somebody will raise up and interrupt him and speak in tongues said I don't watch this I don't say it isn't the Holy Ghost oh Lord you see how easy this would be to classify that's an evil spirit trying to interrupt him brother B just lays this right out for you it's a genuine spiritual leading that person is feeling a message from God it's the genuine Holy Spirit but you ought to know how to use the Holy Ghost to use it can't you see how Satan would wants to work on people and defeat people and mind us he would love to come against us of well I just have to do this and I just have to say this and if I don't do this and it be and instead instead of waiting on our ministry which might be the next service it might be the next Point instead oh I just have to now brother Bram goes in you you most of you that uh followed the message for any length of time you know how brother Bram he'll talk about this particular situation where this woman and there was something in here as I was going just coming back over here today I got to look and I thought dear Lord I'd never even C it like that before but remember the one brother bam talks about he was out in um in a great meeting Pentecostal meeting and and each night what was happening every time that he got ready to make the altar call that woman would jump up and she would speak in tongues and brother Bram says it interrupted the altar call notice the progression of the service that the next part of that service was alter call God said that no doubt her she she just felt it burning within her she just felt it burning within her but notice brother R said you know when he Billy told him said dad you know he came back the third night he said dad that that woman she said she's got another message for tonight what think go for spil in the camp he said daddy she got another message for you got said said she got another message tonight brother BR said you know I looked at her bobbed hair dress on so tight looked like she was poured into and fixing her hair cuz every time brother BR brother BR pegged it that every time it was getting ready to lead into an Altra call she started fixing her hair started pulling everything up and making sure everything was just right he said I know she was getting ready to jump up and I said sit down she kept on he said I said did you hear me sit down why the Spirit of the prophets is to be subject to the prophet and the prophet is the word but remember brother Ram was hit with this by many ministers that ran out to the car oh what did you do you grieve the Holy Spirit brother Bram said any Spirit the word will grieve deserves to be grieved because the word is first place and the church said now notice when we look at this notice B says you know he says here it was he said they told me well you were up there teaching the word he said well that's what I'm standing by is the word but she had something fresh and new from Heaven something different from that brother Brandon watch this statement if that isn't back to Roman Catholicism I don't know what is w prostrating prostrating and maybe say I wouldn't have nothing to do with Roman Catholicism but prostrating before a false conclusion of the word of God and no doubt this little woman you know what brother Bram tells us on throughout the message you know this you've heard it on tape brother Bram said why she did that she wasn't taught no better she wasn't taught no better if she had have been taught better it may have been a different different outcome she won't Tau no better oh god brother Bram even deals with one situation in the pergam and church I I can send these quotes to you but I I I don't want to put a put every one of them up here but brother bram's dealing with it and he's he's telling a sister she starts to speak in tongues in the beginning of the pergan church age and brother Bram just breaks right into prayer in the middle of that prayer he just says Lord when confusion is being carried on help us to be our best your Serv through Jesus name and he says sister you Anointed with the Holy Spirit no doubt but she had that message after the word had already see brother Bram had already stepped to the platform he says it's just a little bit from out of the order of the things sister that's all right sister he says it's the Holy Spirit on you are you hearing me now he didn't say you got an evil spirit on you he said it's the Holy Spirit on you but it's just not in the right order right he says you know Sister Deary says oh it's I know he says it's hard to hold things like that he said you know what it was you probably felt that before we ever even started ministering he said but what happened was as soon as it it came back when the spirit started working it just got so heavy on you but see be just because that happened that was not the time and the place that's the kind of control not quenching it's the control and to realize I have not displeased God by receiving inspiration and channeling it for the appropriate time now brother Bram says you know it'd be just like he says it'd be like you know imagine me he said trying up here to teach and a man jump up beside me and start teaching right at the same time that'd be bad imagine somebody just step up here Paul get up here and Paul just start you'd be like what I mean you know you're trying to who in the world am I supposed to listen to and brother BR is given that example he says now imagine you say here somebody jumps up beside me and starts teaching at the same time another man is out there singing a jubilee song what confusion that's the way it is about speaking in tongues Let It Come orderly just as the spirit will give it and you speak with tongues well brother random I can't help it oh yes you can if there be one among you who speaks with tongues there be no interpreter let him hold his peace no matter how much it wants notice it wants to speak not he not she it wants to speak hold your peace that's a gift brother and I pray God will let me have another Revival here one of these days where we can get into those things for you I'm glad we're in the midst of that Revival right now AR you where you can see watch this it's a gift and that watch this is key right here that gift wants to operate all the time but you've got to have the wisdom of the Holy Spirit here to know when and how to operate the gift that's what true anointing the prophet picks that up and and why people are so tossed to out that's what true anointing is is knowing how and when am right so it's yielding to the order of the spirit that's why Paul said when I was a child right I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things there's things that all the way through this building that we no longer play with now some of you sisters if you still play with with Barbie dolls now I know some of you got some of you got kids I know you have to go along with all that so your excuse Mr Rebecca but you understand brother Drake you better not be playing with Barb but you understand what I'm saying there's certain things that you just you lay aside and notice notice it isn't that God would have you and I to lay aside the gifts it's laying aside our ways of thinking right oh may God help us and give us Grace may God my my prayer has been God may you give such Grace among us to where that there there wouldn't be anything in any heart or any life that that just so looks at things in a manner and well I feel to do this and I feel to do this and if I don't do this and then they feel defeated oh I pray to God that God would bring such a release and a liberty to realize that if God puts something on your heart there is an appropriate time and place you see we've got to yield brother Ram says this in one of the quotes you got to yield to the order of the spirit that's what I was quoting from you got to yield to the order of the spirit you know it would be it would be just like the equivalent of a song special now there's special singers song will drop in your heart sometimes maybe what's being ministered here right why it's being ministered and it drops in your heart the appropriate time is next service right not that service right because the order specials have already been left behind we're Beyond specials right now right are you hearing me right and then then again it might be something God will do right now within a person's life maybe it's a Deliverance maybe it's a healing and they've got a testimony next service be ready to give that testimony that's the appropriate time and place you think it is not burning in our hearts you think it wouldn't be burning in our hearts sure it would be sure it would be I got your attention now don't worry I've got a bunch of quotes laying in front of me here but I'm not going to keep you all night but I want to lay this in good so you know where I'm coming from there is an appropriate time when the prophet himself and we begin to look at certain things and deal with this on the flow of service and this is the very thing that when I come into this part of it here these are things that I know I know there's certain things that I put in place years ago and just like I told the Lord even even the other day the blame is right here because sometimes when there's a little opening and then it just keeps on moving in a certain way in a certain way in a certain way and then things just they just it just starts getting out of order little by little by little by little and so I stand before you and I ask you to forgive me there's a part of it to where that I I am held responsible when things like this and we can look at it and look at different things of how that things would flow even within a service and you know what you sometimes you try things you look at things but I also look at it with this is what I'm looking at where is the continuity a service should not be moving like this and all of a sudden it comes down just an abrupt stop after the preaching of the word that is the time to worship that's the appropriate time can I have just a few more minutes flow of the service brother Bram you'll hear him call this pre-service or preliminary that's when gifted individuals are to meet that's not if the service is at 7:00 p.m. they don't come here and meet at 7:00 p.m. brother Bram says it's an hour to 45 minutes before time right I I'm not going to try to break all into all that today that's a service in itself this is also the time the testimonies are to be given it's also the time when Sunday school then we come into the song service that's when service time starts 11:00 a.m. 7:00 p.m. that's when written prayer request and if we're not going to give the testimony in person you can write it like Brother Richard perfect he didn't know I was going to do this but I heard that back there perfect it was written testimony got to the point Thank God it was part of the prayer request we move on it did not cause the service to just stop right because you see every time you stop that's why look look these are things when you think I'm saying this right here you don't know how often when I've talked with the song leaders ain't that right over the years this guy gets it more than anybody you think you all get correction my boys get it not just from the things in life but if there's anything that I don't like per se and I'm looking at because it's the betterment of every service I want every surface I want it to be the best that we can be amen so there's times when we're looking then at this right here ministering of the word what and like I said before the ministry of the word I don't know sometimes I don't know what's going to what God's going to do afterwards that's a time we pray for the sick maybe altar calls given maybe it's a prayer line maybe it leads into water baptism but at any rate brother Bram makes this statement when he talks about our service he says conserve your time conserve your time he tells us even as ministers he said there's some people that F that that that fill up fast other people that take a long time to fill up but don't try to fill these that take a long time to fill up get the happy in between he said conserve our time that's why brother Bram tells us even when he goes into it he said for a person coming to pray over the prayer request or anybody praying he said it shouldn't be a long prayer right right now I'm not standing over here with a stopwatch but I think we can tell when you can look at something and say that belongs in the prayer closet because it's cutting in on time it's conserving our time if brother Homer if you're listening tonight I I hear it told me one time he said I asked somebody to pray over the food he said they prayed so long I told him you ain't never praying over a church Fellowship dinner again that sounds like he know it he meant it too he meant it too he said you ain't never playing over a Church Fellowship meal again I like to starve to death he said but it's just using wisdom right just using wisdom brother brother Homer has his comical way but just using wisdom but notice well that's what brother BR said if you you know when we look at this right here you think oh brother Samuel I don't know about that let's look what brother Bram said here in church order 19 58 these messages now he's talking about meeting in the pre-service right these Revelations and people are privileged if they desire to raise up and give a testimony a testimony only for the glory of God now they're not bound to it but testimony should be given before the message or any song service starts that's when it should be given so what if I get in here late next service let me just say this while I'm talking on testimonies testimonies are indeed just that testimonies are not the Lord showed me this that's not a testimony that's saying something that's not been proven or judged and it does not classify as a testimony that's right you got to be clear on these things no subversion no getting around a testimony is straight to the point of something that God has done for you am amen is that right now brother B goes on to say he says if you've got a testimony give it before talking in the pre-service in the congregation of the people while the spirit is a blessing and so forth or the real way to testify is not in church it's out in Dark Places Let Your Light where it's dark go to the roadh houses and different different places where sin and things is heaping up and then let your light shine there is the place to do it but however if the Lord has blessed you and give you some great special blessing or something you have to tell the people do it in the time of the other service the pre-service the preliminary this is the prophet of the hour this is the Elijah messenger that laid down the orderen aren't you glad for it because I've watched this I've watched it like I told you I was the one that that times over the time and look I I've spoke personally to individuals already I I've I've it's it comes down to me but everything within it for years i' I've waited in because I've watched it it just everything as soon as soon as it would happen and sometimes I would tell individuals just wait just wait just wait just wait and then I would have that pressure on me when I'd go to pray for somebody look at because I knew as soon as that happened service was over it was done and you understand friends there's times I would love to get out there and shake hands with all of you because I love seeing you here and I'd love to be able and God has given me opportunities some Services work that way but then there's other services that I have been right here even lives right now that are serving the lord right here in this assembly today sometimes it's happened 25 minutes after dismissal where the worship has continued right along and moving right along you see this is why you don't want to start and stop I told you with the song leaders I told them when you're up here don't get up here and talk lead the songs because every time you stop then we got to get this Locomotion started again let's keep it let's keep it going down the track where his brother Homer would say let's keep this baby going let's keep it moving forward yes that's good boy he's really going to light me up tonight when we get done with this but why stop it but you see so many times it can be stops and stops and stops and stops so this is what I'm saying if you have a testimony you make sure you see one of the deacons see it find out who the song leader is and they can have you in the prior service not at 700 p.m. not at 11:00 a.m. you're not cut we're not cutting in to the song service because you cut into song service then they have then they only have so long of time right then that cuts into the word and the prophet said that's the main thing we're here for is the word to punch that in just like when I expect even when I look at this and song leaders don't know it but there'll be a meeting right after this at some point in time I expect them when they stand here I expect them to be in control right I told them many times before I said what they don't know is this veteran right here brother Bill when he had when the church was just starting and he had to tell people to sit down that wanted to take over a service those people aren't here but they they don't go here but he had to tell them to sit down sit down because they wanted to take over a service they felt like they had something to say they had some great spiritual edification to the church so there's an order we can also write our testimony now I'm just going to tell you don't give me a binder I'm not going to be the one reading it anyhow these song leaders are but don't give them a binder you give them a binder I'll tell them to flip to the end and say God healed me glory to God thank God for healing so and so why conserving time conserving time I know some of you you you know you've laughed and things like that and maybe sometimes you know like brother Bram says in the in the fourth seal there's times it comes like that he said I'll do that he said it breaks you up and then I'll come right back around with something serious I understand that but this a serious matter yes it is it's very serious and I want to see I want to see our church I want to see us continue to go this is why in that time of the after service let me read this and I'm closing last quote brother brm says now is your time to worship why do you worship at the end of the service over the word you water it now worship over the word that's went in to your heart that's when we worship right I don't want to take his time I don't want to take away that time I want to move within that time right because I can just tell you he's corrected me when he's let me know before you took some of my time when I went over oh God I thank you for his Mercy amen don't you thank God for the leadership in this hour thank God for such leadership and such Grace I'm so glad that I'm so glad he's not a come he's not ashamed to come by and speak to us about these things aren't you to me my my heart has just been even as I've studied over these things over the time it's just been so blessed but I pray that I pray that there's things that even tonight maybe you can look at but I ask you just to pray about it and look at it and say Lord knowing that I've not made these things up that's right I've brought it right from the message of the hour and right from the scriptures and we're just getting started do you love the Lord amen amen God bless you let's stand amen well who's tasked with somebody needs to be tasked with singing after the teaching like this has been laid in it's a little time to worship right now and who is is uh uh okay you might be singing Acappella is is't the Lord good really ain't he good I I I I love the word of God Amen and I know that it's things that give such a Clarity to our lives and we just want to see things just move on and on you know what I love testimonies as a matter of fact like brother Shane and I talked about it hey if there's times where I look at it and we think hey we we need to do just a testimony service on a Sunday evening just everybody go get something to eat and come on back here and have a testimon I'm I'm all for it that that's different just having a testimony service like that I'm all for it I love testimonies amen so don't get don't get in your mind that I don't like testimony I love testimonies but I like things in the right time I like it's in its right place because like brother bam tells us when he'll deal with that pre-service he said if we can get that pre-service just right and you know the pre-service is is even us coming in here early brother brah says whether we come here and pray at the altar or we go back and we sit in our seat and we just just Worship in silent prayer thinking of the songs thinking of the goodness of God that's all part of it you realize it you're part of the atmosphere do you realize you coming here and even as you come in here and enter into that do you realize something that you might look at and say well how significant is that do you realize your preparation might have been part of the link that brought Deliverance to somebody else that brought healing to their life because brother bam says when we can get that time of worship and get that just right he said oh how it's so easy than for that song service to come on board he said then it's so easy for the minister to step right in and Minister the word I want to create the right atmosphere don't you love him just appreciate the Lord heavenly father thank you for your mercies tonight Lord I pray dear God that Lord as you've just spoke to our hearts may we as we look upon this many things but really comes down lord to True spiritual leadings but understanding that Lord as the Holy Spirit has control of us
