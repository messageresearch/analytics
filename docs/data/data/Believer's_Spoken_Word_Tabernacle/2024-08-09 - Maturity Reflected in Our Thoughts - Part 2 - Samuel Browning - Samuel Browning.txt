I'm so thankful that we we have a real true reality to look forward to aren't you my if I tell you if if all that we had to look forward to there no wonder that the world is in a place of insanity of where they're at right now but I'm so thankful amen that there's been a a breaking in our lives From Another Dimension you know I just was reading where the Prophet was saying of how that there was a lady that she just just dropped in her heart bring the baby to the meeting and brother Bram said you know he said she was a Believer but he said something Came From Another Dimension that thought and struck her heart take your baby to church tonight brother Bram said see he says that that thought he said they just don't come just from nowhere he said it dropped From Another Dimension just like he said these these he describing it then how that words travel along these lines and now we're living in an age where it's not words traveling along telephone lines we're living in an age where things are being beamed the signals and to think about that in this hour you know the prophet said we're going to realize he said that to see he said to recognize that the God who always was has always been here and you know what the reality of it is God has supplied by the promised word of this hour what is needed in order to make himself known amen and you know what what God did did through the life of the Prophet because that was that was ordained as the prophet he found his place in the scripture and the believer today as we find our place in the scripture and in Christ we become a channel as well you know brother Bram said it just like this in Revelation book of symbols he said once he said you're born again of the spirit of God you have now been placed in a position for Angelic Association that's so good because Angels come to minister the word of God to us amen isin't that wonderful amen that's something it it we we our hearts are charged with that because we're Witnesses of that of God has ministered and and continues to minister to our hearts oh I tell you friends we we're not alone we're not we're not wandering amen God is is the chief Shepherd to draw us together and lead us all the way home amen amen God bless you this evening amen and I certainly uh certainly thank our musicians and brother Brian amen and we just want to uh just look to the word of the Lord for a few moments here this evening and just ask that the God will just um just minister to us and um I know uh different ones that you know we've been and we're not the only ones that's battled with sickness and different ones and things things um but we want to remember um one another in prayer and uh that God will just I know he'll see us through amen I know he will he is seeing us through and so um we just want to remember amen different ones that are in prayer that the Lord would just continue to strengthen them I think sister Naomi uh uh brother brother Brian and sister Barb um and uh just some different ones and you know I'm so thankful that we have truly in the atonement there's healing amen I'm so thankful for that amen God bless you let's stand to our feet and we want to go right into the word of the Lord so good to see each and every one of you amen that's here tonight and and uh amen so let's look here in the scriptures in um 2 Corinthians chapter 10 and and verse three and I want to go right back into this and uh just to further play a little bit more of a of a groundwork in dealing with our thoughts um and in our mind and you know the the the prophet God would lead him to preach the message the greatest battle ever fought and that is a very it's a very key message that is that is to be applied all throughout because we're we're living in that time we're truly the greatest battle that's ever been fought it's being fought right now yes it is and so you'll find all throughout the message you find the little glimpses here and there where uh from that um understanding that Revelation it continues to um uh be spread out but yet there for us to draw from and I believe God wants us to be victorious in this hour uh you know like like this like the statement brother Bram made God did not just save us and then just step back and become disinterested he's with us all the way yes he is even in the times that maybe we don't feel like it when God told the saman age I know the tribulation but God knew of it he just didn't give in but he was there and giving the sustaining strength to the Believers then and he's the same God for you and I tonight amen let's just read here in verse three beginning for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh now Satan's Satan's always always busy to try to get us out into that realm and when I say flesh I'm also talking the spirit realm because you're a you are a three room house your body Spirit Soul right and Satan is always wanting to get us out in the flesh cuz soon as he can get us out in the flesh he's already got us whipped right there we're already we already whipped remember when the maniac came on the platform that night uh when brother brandham was standing there and Satan was was really trying to get him to come out into the Flesh and everything he did spit in his face and so forth what that Maniac did and I know we're aware of this maybe some are not but I want you to understand Satan's objective he wants to if he can get us out into that place that it's flesh and we begin to act out in fleshly or carnal ways and that sometimes isn't even in actions it's just in thoughts he's already the battle right there he's got that that that particular battle right there but this is where we we battle against remember he came to draw brother Bram Satan was trying to draw him out into that but brother Bram says I chose to think different thoughts yeah that's good now let me ask you this question how could he choose to think different thoughts if he didn't recognize that he was a Son of God yeah that's right and recognize that as a that really as in a dual reality he's in contact with another realm if you've been born again you're in contact with another realm you have access to that he could either live by that or allow himself to be brought out here in the flesh that's a good is that right y amen so this is constantly the battle that we we are set before us for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God I want you to notice every High thing is anything that seeks to put itself above God's word we cast it down that's right not not going to let it stay there and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ and having in a Readiness to Revenge all Disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled amen how many of you ever entertained the wrong thought this is where that last scripture comes in having in a Readiness to Revenge all Disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled this is what remember brother Brandon will use these words I don't mean to keep you standing but remember the words brother brand would use he'll use the word tow hold yeah spelled like toe like our toe tow hold and he says you know when the enemy gets you in a Toe Hold you've got to have a strength that's able to break it now what a Toe Hold You know for me I I kept listening to what brother Ram was saying a toe hold and and I remember I looked it up the one day and I thought well this is what a tow hold is for you and I it would be someone tapping out or they're brought into submission there's got to be something a hidden power on the inside that maybe when we're about at that place place of the tap out but there's something that we're Tapped Out to the right source and that's when he steps on the scene abolutely there's the hidden man in our heart yes he is is that right in the Garden of Eden it was the bride that was hidden in the groom now here we are in Satan's Eden but now it is the groom hidden within the bride amen the same same almighty God walking here Among Us amen let's just bow our heads real quickly in a word of prayer father certainly Lord we want to say thank you tonight for your mercies Lord once again father we just Lord we could Lord gather together and just to have prayer Lord for the remaining part of the time and it would never suffice Lord to give you thanks Lord for what you've done Lord and and what you are doing and Lord what you're about to do but we just want to say we love you father how we can Lord see Lord and take notice of your care Lord to our lives Lord and how we appreciate that so much Lord we love you father and Lord we just Lord our hearts are just drawn in these times and moments Lord we just want to be Lord a better servant Lord we want to serve you better Lord and so we just ask you Lord that as we would just lay Lord our our feeble efforts and everything Lord upon the altar Lord in our lives that God May there come Lord a fresh quickening lord of the spirit of God into our lives Lord a fresh refilling Lord of your spirit Lord may you move throughout this congregation tonight Lord in the visible and invisible audience Lord and father May every Lord hold or any hold that the enemy would have Lord I pray that God may it be released tonight Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Lord whether it's physical or spiritual Lord we know that God that this Warfare we're in is not flesh and blood Lord but it's a Warfare against principalities and spiritual darkness and wickedness and high places but we're thankful Lord for that reality greater is he that is in us than he that's in the world we're resting and we're trusting Lord in you and you alone father we love love you and thank you now Lord in Jesus precious name amen amen God bless you as you're being seated I want to continue to speak on that thought for a few moments and on maturity being reflected in our thoughts and we were looking at that scripture of last week where Paul had wrote and said when I was a child I thought as a child and um I spake as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things and you know I'm thankful because if it had not been as we were saying before uh I think last week if it had not been for the mercy of God coming to our lives and even working with us dealing with us and surely every one of us I know myself and I'm sure we can Fellowship around this I can look back across and through my life and I can see that where God has remitted situations whether it's tests it's test and it's trials truly that's where our molding and shaping and character character building comes from but God has so worked through those means to bring me to a realization of myself that I can do nothing without him there's things that God has pointed out even within it to where that we can look at and he's there he's changing us he's molding us and that that doesn't mean that God is doing away with who you and I are but what it is it's God bringing that it comes to light and when you and I can recognize that and see that weakness and see that tendency and put that before God then God that invites God to take over and it doesn't mean that we're not going to battle it just simply means remember overcoming the prophet said is two parts it's recognizing the devil at every one of his tricks and then to recognize that the god in you is greater and has already overcome that thing so it's it's there's a constant a constant listen and the way that we recognize that is by a spiritual discernment and that spiritual discernment is as we're staying in fellowship with the lord it's even as we come to the house of the Lord you you and I staying in the word of God and in prayer a constant relationship with him it it sharpens our our spiritual senses to be able to discern good from Evil and remember we're living in a day let me just say this to you it'd be really easy if everything was black and white but everything's not black and white there's a this is the day where the Bible said it will be a day as known unto the Lord where and neither day nor day nor night neither light nor Darkness we're living in that time where that Pale Horse anointing is upon the people it's a grizzled effect it's a it's a grayish it's it's not having like one exact exact color but I want to say this to you if everything was in black and white my that would be very simple in terms of discernment but we're living in an hour that we cannot walk by our own means or even our reasonings we've got to trust the spiritual discernment of the holy spirit cuz he'll always keep us centered in the word and that's what we're depending on and I'm grateful to God that that same Pillar of Fire he's right here with us and he has divided himself into those of us that have been born again of the spirit of God and if you haven't just say Lord let every part of my being be open and surrendered to you lead me to that place Lord of full surrender because let me tell you it won't be a church that'll do it won't be a man that'll do it it's God who brings us to a place of full surrender that's what the pillar of fire does it's super natural so now with thinking of that in the maturity being reflected in our thoughts with things this is where when brother brandom would say this and I want to just just uh drop these things in here uh tonight out of the greatest battle ever fought brother BR says you've got to get the soldier the Holy Spirit placed at the Battlefront that takes God's word he is the word and he stands there and there's nothing going to stop it then now notice get him placed at the Battlefront and what is what the whole what what the prophet is dealing with is is get the holy spirit in that rightful place of the Soul because this is God's then listen the spirit itself is not God's Abode in our human Spirit or Upon Our flesh that's not God's Abode and we can see that because if it's just an anointing that comes on the spirit or the flesh many in lady OA have that but it never translates into a sacrificial life that's lived according to the word but if the Holy Spirit who is the word if he gets down on the inside in that Soul which is that place that he has prepared for himself to dwell then he is setting on the control tower of our soul to give the influence and he has given us the authority as a son and daughter of God to reign in this vessel so it's that's important getting the Holy Spirit on the inside this is why that when you listen into the message this is why the message come is to bring a real true New Birth on the inside to bring a real Born Again experience man has diluted it churches has diluted and not throwing off but I'm just trying to say that God himself has brought and restored that to you and I of what the real true New Birth is that it is the spirit of God coming upon Sons and Daughters of God to bring that reality in our life and manifest through our lives yes sir Hallelujah not a handshake not even an agreeance in our mind all all of those things have their place and part but nothing nothing can replace the real reality of the new birth and so this is why we need that soldier on the inside which is greater is he that is in you than he that's in the world Amen listen friends don't despise it just say Lord be it unto me be it unto me Lord that's good the prophet goes on to talk about how how that so many do not even clear out the the channels of their Spirit conscience memory reason affection imagination and all of those things and just leave it there but you know you know how we clean it out how those things are cleaned out it comes the prophet says you've got to clean it out conscience memory thoughts laying aside everything that's a real key amen laying aside everything well I I know so and so claimed to have the Holy Ghost lay it aside I know so and so claimed and professed their healing but they they they they they died lay it aside because the Bible says very clearly we realize healing there's times where there's healing in this Dimension or it can be in the next Dimension yeah that's good you see you don't want to try to serve God through your conscience or through your reason we can't do that Satan chose the mind but God chose the heart amen amen let me just say this friends you can try to figure God out and you'll never be able to do it no sir this is why when the Holy Ghost has come when when Jesus would say regarding that of the Holy Spirit he says you cannot tell from whence the wind cometh and where it goeth has anybody ever seen the wind you might say my the other day I know I was here when all of that and I'm watching the clouds and here everything flying around the other day but I didn't see the wind but I saw things that were being affected by the windall right yes sir is that right it's that that's where it comes down to the new birth and the reality I can't explain it but I know what happened to me I know what I was I know what I was I knew where my desires were but I know what came in my life and when he changed my life from all of those things of the world and there's a desire just to please him even when it brings me to a place to say Lord I see my error I see Lord even my thoughts or my attitude or my Fe God you're there to mold me Lord we want to lay all that aside and come watch this come from the inside out with that unadulterated word of God that that it's the truth now this is what I love about the spirit of Truth we can take this portion right here of the message and you could leave that that particular script or that quote and you could leave it and say well that's the new birth and praise God God and I don't really need to focus on that quote no no we do because Jesus remember there's things that come to you and I even after the New Birth and sometimes there's thoughts can get in our mind you can get worries in your mind you can get frustrations in your mind come on fellowship with me Paul remember brother brandom was getting ready to go out off the scene and he was going to go out there you know and and said you know I'll just stomp out of the Wilderness whenever it you know I get a message and I'm just going to do this there was a complex and you know what a complex is it's a way of thinking about something that's right he was filtering everything that he was seeing through that complex and it just started with one little nail one little board and it kept building until eventually that com Lex became a residence in the spirit of William brandham and this is why listen to me this is why brother brandham if you'll listen to the message standing in the Gap then it preaches flashing red lights of his coming then he continues through that month there in in in in July and he'll make this statement over and over all he says it's so easy to build a complex yeah it sure is yes that's and I don't know about you but sometimes I didn't even realize when I had one yeah that's right there you go I didn't and all of a sudden you realize wait a minute here I'm processing everything through this oh my and you know what when you can recognize it and then submit it to God it's liberating it doesn't mean that we're not going to be tested against it just simply what it means is we've recognized the devil and oh God help me to stay in that place of submission to recognize him Lord you see that's part of maturity maturity isn't well I'm a Son of God I tell you I tell I'm going to go out here and I'm going to you know the storms that we have to deal with is the storms in our own life oh I want to go out to Colorado no that was an example to show you that the same thing where God used a prophet to control a snowstorm in Colorado is the same Holy Spirit Works through your life to stop storms there might have been things that's overtaken your family grudges and everything else that you can look back down and say man it has swept through my family but you have been equipped with thus sayith the Lord to speak to that storm yes sir Hallelujah you're not just an ordinary people you're a supernatural people the pillar of fire has come and led you out of Egypt and the Egypt I'm talking about is your first birth Hallelujah he has smelt the the Tabernacles of ham he has smoked that for that on the inside let my son go that he may serve me that's what the word came to your life it spoke to the son and daughter it spoke let it go every desire let it go let it go let my son let my daughter serve me and he leads us all the way so we take that word this is why even as we come and we're listening to the word of God Hebrews 12 for the word of God is quick alive powerful sharper than any two-edged sword dividing a under the bone from the marrow even the spirit and comes down God Is So precise God doesn't come in a service and do a hack hacksaw job he's precise I know sometimes God might use a minister sometimes maybe even an evangelist and I know times that I felt like that I've preached scrambled eggs many times uh but you know when I I I say that in a manner but when you look at it God is precise in what he's doing and I that's the kind of person I want operating on me I want I want that precision and this is why Jesus said you're clean through the word that I've spoken you see when we can take that word in and you think about it where there's Witnesses all through this Congregation of where you have sat here and maybe the way and you've persevered and come and the spirit of God has come and delivered the word to your heart maybe it's been while you're at home working and meditation and here you are you're just in tune and in fellowship with God and all of a sudden it drops in that word and when you take that word in and let and lay aside everything else it will clean out all of those other channels let me tell you something we need continual cleaning is that right once the soul has been clean the soul don't need to be washed any more but we need to be washed with the washing of Water by the word that's why the word is there to wash and to cleanse and and you know this is why we need the word now look at this here with this in our thoughts and I want to go to one of the uh scriptures in Ephesians 6:1 17 where it speaks of one of the parts of our armor and it says take and take the helmet of salvation now notice this whole armor is given to you and I what is that whole armor well the whole armor putting on the whole armor is the word of God you know you can't put on one part of the armor not the other the the armor of God is is the holy spirit is the word of God coming into your life that's the soldier getting the soldier in the beginning is that right but notice how Paul would write this brother Shane he doesn't write it as though that well you know you really don't need to do it but he says take the helmet of salvation so in other words what you already have in Your Arsenal and your disposal take it use it amen is that right in 1 Thessalonians 5:8 let us who are of the day be sober putting on the breastplate of Love of faith and love and for an helmet the hope of Salvation that's an expectation that's what hope we ministered on that it's an expectation I I don't know how how all of this is going to come out but I'm expecting God the Hebrew children didn't know how things were going to turn out but they were expecting God they said whether whether he delivers us or not out of here we are not going to Bow we're not bowing what was it they had an expectation they had a hope in God because they already knew himall the Bible doesn't let us read of all the little excerpts from their experiences and their Journeys that led up to their it doesn't do that but you and I know that there were experiences that led to that moment God is building and their faith is growing what's happening there's a maturing that's going on and maturing doesn't mean that we become independent as far as you know oh I'm just going to do this on my own no when we when maturity we recognize I I need him and with that reality I know sometimes those are just a phrase that sometimes it could become common to us but it's recognizing that my and our submission to him that every channel Lord let it be cleaned and clear that he can work through because you and I are instruments were to be instruments of his now I want you to think of this the prophet would say it like this and greatest battle ever fought he said now how you going to let this helmet what it does it's a protection what is helment made out of brass brass can even be tempered it's hard harder than iron what is brass it's judgment so it speaks of take this helmet of salvation we are going to have to bring every thought to judgment that is so that's our responsibility God is not he won't do that for us but he's equipped us to be able to bring every thought into judgment a brass headpiece notice the Salvation or knowledge of knowing this my healing comes from God my salvation comes from God my experience matches his word not the church's idea the word there you you are covered over with a protection the helmet of salvation Deliverance take that then go marching forward brother Bram would go on further in that quote I don't have it up there for you but he said notice he says as you take this helmet take the word of God he said the devil will follow after you every day and he'll try to scare the liver out of you look at these words he uses he says like this kingly Priestly big Goliath wow you know what he's trying look at these words kingly Priestly I I don't know you know for me these words the spirit of God just begins to take hold and I begin to just meditate thought why would brother R say that kingly Priestly big Goliath because King is one who would have power and a priest is one who is trying to offer something to you and I but notice how Satan will constantly try to do that to scare the deliver out of you and I but you have and I have an access to a helmet of salvation but I don't have to know all of the answers but I know the answer I know who's holding me I know that my experience matches God's word I know my healing comes from the Lord a helmet of salvation you might say well why do I need that because salvation is ongoing God continues to deliver you and I time and time again he delivers us even sometimes when our thoughts and our attitudes get wrong he delivers us from sickness he delivers us gives us the strength in testing and trials and one of these mornings he will Deliver Us from this Wretched Man the end Paul said of our Salvation Hallelujah now let's look at our responsibility here from our text 2 Corinthians 10:5 casting down imagination this is all arguments reasonings and every High thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought of The Obedience of Christ you know how a lot of these things take place where people then different things and sometimes they'll find oh this one got on a plane with this or or how did somebody get back in this development or how did somebody you know why because somebody just some seemingly looked at a person or or something just kind of it just seemed okay listen you cannot trust any disguise no matter how what it feels like what it looks like our responsibility is to bring every thought captive and you let me tell you something even the spirit of God when David thought that he was going to build a house house for the Lord even the what he thought and he looked at it this is what I'm going to do and Nathan said do all that's in your heart I mean you're going to do something for God but remember here David needed to seek out God's provided way that was consult the prophet of God how should the ark be brought up how should the house be built and remember God came back around and told David you can't do it but your son is going to do it what was it even showing that even in our Humanity we can sometimes let thoughts slip and it isn't so much the back and white thoughts but sometimes it's the things that comes in such a mixed way but I'm so glad for The Living Word of God that's there to equip you and I and help us bring these things captive so good I don't know about you but sometimes you know when you go past certain checkpoints they can take a hold of you and bring you back and say hey we need to look at this oh yeah I don't know about you but you know when you pass through the airport and things like that sometimes they'll let you go through you know on those scanners and I've I've went through I've only had just a few Pat downs and so forth but I'll tell you sometimes they get to look and say hey wait a minute we're we're looking at some here come on over here and I you have this I mean they could ask me do do you do you have like some you know like something you know in your waste like maybe some medal or tag no they don't just say okay Mr Browning go ahead and go on they say okay we'll just step over here and then they take a wand that's right pat down and everything you know why they're capturing capturing every part now you and I both know there's things that can slip through that but it can't slip through the Holy Spirit you see God's not asked you and I in our natural senses to discern the enemy's advances but what God has equipped you and I with when the soldier is there in the beginning we can bring every thought subject to that on the inside prise God that's what we want to do captive every thought to The Obedience of Christ that actually that word means to bring into captivity right lead away captive I don't know about you but I've always been grateful when I get Beyond security that's one of the things I always test you know text my family I I'm I'm past security Now that means now I can go I can go get my Starbucks go get my Americano and go sit down by the gate if I got time that's what that means man I mean you we we've got it but you know my brother one time when he was traveling with me one of the first times we went to the Philippines together in 2017 he had you know his carry-on bag but he had all of these things in his carry on bag actually had his uh toiletries bag inside of there he had oh man these nice good siiz bottles of sprays and all this other stuff I mean they were nice he had just bought them just laid them in there they scanned that stuff and they had it laying over there on the other side and they invited him over opened it up and they asked him what's this oh he says well that that's my toiletry so I can see that so they asked him do you want us to throw it in the trash can here right or do you want to call go back out and call somebody to pick it up cuz you're able to take this and go back out right right now he had a choice at that time either go back out and go through all that line again try to call my mom or my wife and say hey can you come pick up a can of powder or I'm sure they weren't going to drive clear over to Cleveland for a can of powder or some other kind of spray or this or that but you understand what I'm saying what they did was they just okay can you take it if not it goes right in the trash I think that's exactly what we need to do with every thought we need to bring it right over here and say yep and there's something that just doesn't seem right so let's open it up and let's let the word go through it and then we can decide throw it right here not taking it with me in my journey you see what you don't want to happen is this is why we want to bring every thought in captivity you do not want Satan to come in and hijack your spirit because if he comes in and hijacks your spirit he'll have you thinking certain things are real and they're not real at all he'll have you thinking certain things are true and it's not even true at all I can't get to that tonight but he can come in and if he can hijack it just right he'll cause you to act certain things out that are not not even true that is so true yes sir that's in the imagination abely that's even in reasoning come on let's bring it on down here how Satan can get right in there and maybe you haven't heard from God in a while and as maybe a young believer even as an older believer you haven't heard from God in a while and you wonder where's he at why why haven't I heard from him and Satan can get right in there he can suggest to reasoning well God don't love you God don't care he can do that and you know what if you and I allow it then here we come and we sat down in the house of God we don't worship that's right we just said here we'll sit on the preacher that's right well and yet God is trying to help us because listen friends those are channels in there that you and I must re over is so that's why the Bible said he that ruleth his spirit is greater than he that taketh the city yeah is that right yes sir so we notice we don't want to become a hostage in our own Gates Now watch how brother Brown will put this in greatest batt of fa now watch the devil will try to come right back he's worse than a mosquito watch this if he can get in there at all he's got your army routed right then you know what it means when when an army is routed every all the ranks are broken yeah they're just running scattering that's right if he can get in there at all he's got them routed if you've got your senses see taste feel smell here they're all right we need them don't we I don't know about you but I'm glad when I can taste food yeah yeah I'm glad when I can smell it too right I'm glad that I can see I'm glad I thank God for my senses I'm grateful for that I'm glad that I can hear right I I thank God for him but God never intended for those senses to be our leadership that's never intended that no sir but watch what he says but don't trust them unless they agree with the word they're all right they're all right but if they disagree with the word don't you listen to them yeah do you understand Satan will come right there and right through your mind and right in that spirit and you know whose voice tone he'll speak in your own voice you'll hear yourself your own voice he don't use brother Shane's voice on me he don't use brother Brian's Voice or brother Bill or brother rockos or Brother Ray or brother brother Drake he don't use their voices he cloaks it in my own voice this is why with discernment and maturity you discern that Spirit not by the voice but what is behind it and bring it subject to the word of God capturing every thought and say let's open this up Glory a don't listen to them you've been given Authority right here don't listen to them imaginations conscience memory reasons affections they're all right if they agree with the word but if your affection doesn't agree with the word get rid of it yes sir brother Bill offended me I ain't going to have nothing to do with him that's in my affection are you with me now I've got a choice I can say he offended me but remember if I've got Divine love in my soul I've got to bring that subject to the word all my feelings may not feel like it my spirit you know memory kicks over and says remember when he did this remember when he did that conscience will kick over oh you know there you got to mark them that cause division it and then how things will just start to flood right in to do what build our case to isolate our own selves you know what that's called a hostage crisis you're being h hostage there you go and it'll affect everything listen friends you cannot contain those things just in one area it'll affect your family it'll affect your marriage it'll affect everything and that's what Satan wants to do it can come right in here and affect this church affect the meetings affect the services what must I do if it doesn't agree with the word don't listen to it amen yes brother Brian may have posted the most awfulest thing about me I've got a choice right I've got a choice come on friends I'm preaching right down our alley oh I can't do that if you don't have the strength on the inside to do it there is a strength Giver here tonight that is able to give you the strength to love your enemies come on friends that's good this is what the power of the go goel does it equips us as Sons and Daughters of God remember those storms that I'm talking about those storms that end out there it's controlling the gates inside of here that's right my my my my my my my if your affection doesn't agree with the word get rid of it not my feelings my feelings have been hurt oh yeah oh yeah yeah my feelings have been hurt yeah there's been things that even has been said I I don't believe that even that I know people did not mean to say it but you know I've got a choice and listen friends I want you to understand when I'm preaching these things I'm preaching from experience as I stand here as he brings it to my heart but what I am preaching is I've had to live this and I'll have to continue to live it it's a battle there are things that are before us and we've got a choice either we can give one another a pass or we can hold things we got a choice God ain't going to choose it for us God ain't going to do that for us are you hearing me oh my you know many times people get things caught in their spirit and they feel like they're going to make other people pay you don't make anybody else pay you're the one who pays I'm the one who pays is that right we end up paying for these things but I'm so thankful that the spirit of God will come right down and on them minister to our lives to give strength to the inner man and you know what as soon as you agree with the word of God amen amen means so be it when you say Amen you know what that is that's laying aside your feelings that's laying aside you know I'm not just talking about us just going through a repetition but I'm talking about really entering in to the word to the spirit of the word that's coming oh God help us notice you'll blow a flu right quick if your reason disagrees with the word get away from it right if your memory your imaginations if your conscience anything disagrees with that what's on the inside get rid of it that don't mean Fold It Up nice Fold It Up nice and get rid of it no it means get rid of it when I put trash out on the street to be collected I try to make sure it's not going to fall over but I'm not trying to make it look beautiful I I I want I want the trash men to come and get that and pick that up and take it away and I'm not really I don't put an air tag on it to find out where it went to I really don't care where it's going to I don't even care if somebody comes around cuz you know you see it in your neighborhood there's people ride around and they have trucks that I think are held together with shoestrings and they're picking up metal I know my neighborhood's not the only one but I can hear them coming are you hearing me so we recognize I don't sit out there and look at and say hey hey hey hey hey hey what kind of house do you live in you want to take this right here this old rickety Rusty end of a two-wheeler what what are you planning on doing that I don't care I set it out there cuz I don't want it in my house no longer I don't care what they do with I don't care if they melt it down I don't care what they do with it you know why cuz I'm tired of it I see no need for it and when we can come to that place in our life with things and God brings us to us and say look where this has gotten me all it is doing is taking up space you know how we do we've got these I'll save this I'll save this cuz you never know you know when this is going to happen and finally pretty soon we all of our never knows we never knows is oh my a mountain and it's a mountain of never knows never know when what going to come in handy then when we really need it we got to go out and buy them one because we couldn't find what we never knew we would need don't stop remember the prophet says this don't stop to listen praise God remember Nelly Sanders when she had got delivered right the Holy Spirit had so touched her heart and her life brother R going through that but how that she is walking by that Music Hall walking on the other side of the street and she thought oh that music boy It really used to bother me it don't bother me no more brother BR said oh that's just what you think and she began to stand there and all of a sudden now it went from reasoning to memories oh I remember when Lee and I used to win these dance competitions what she doing memories imagination then it's opening in affection yeah come on you see it goes from gate to gate to gate it can go so quick and before she knew it there was a spirit that came on her but she knew where to go get help and she ran she took a c and ran up there to Brother rand's house she said Oh Brother random brother random brother random I'm lost I'm lost I'm lost brother random help me help me help me said well I don't believe you're lost Nelly I don't believe you're lost and he begin to take her by the hand and he begin to pray and he says you know he said I didn't know too much about casting out Devils at the time he said but I said Satan this is God's daughter she belongs to the Lord you're going to have to take your hands off of her she oh I love this she didn't mean to do that hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory be to God and remember that Spirit it rose up out of there remember brother B said like a bat with long hair it sobered up the drunk man he had picked up you'll hear Brother R even commend Nelly Sanders on and on in different messages all throughout the message but what happened she be to just yet entertain something anything disagrees with what's on the inside get rid of it I want to remind you you're the one who's in charge Lord You're the one who's in charge this is why we want the Bible would say that every one of us should know how to possess a vessel and sanctification and honor you see that Battleground like brother Ram would would speak of this here let me go to greatest Bor of fought paragraph 110 there's your Battleground your Battleground is back here at the beginning back in your mind that opens your mind opens up and accepts the spirit or it rejects the spirit I want you to understand thoughts are not just thoughts they come from somewhere they sure do yeah you can have little consciences little feelings little Sensations and all these things that has nothing to do with it that's just little Sensations and things but when it comes to reality your mind opens it up your mind either accepts it or rejects it he says it's your mind that opens the door or closes the door and listens to your conscience listens to your memory listens to your affections that's so good yeah this would kind of almost be the equivalent somebody came to your house and was going to run down somebody else and you stood right there at the door and said I'm sorry I don't got time for this right just close the door God bless you brother if you sister who yeah if I I don't I don't have time for that why it's not edifying I I don't have time for it right and and that's not it's not you or I demeaned you realize just even in doing that it can totally change the circumstance and situation CU do you realize when Satan does things like that listen to me now when Satan does like that and can get up on somebody's mind and they go to start looking at somebody else and somebody might be dead wrong they might be wrong as wrong could be and what that person is saying might actually be truth but you know what happened Satan is getting their attention off of where it needs to be our attention can never be upon one another I can never focus on brother Ry or Brother Richard or brother Richie or brother Bill I can't focus on them and expect to live a Victorious Life you know why they're flesh just like I am they need the grace and mercy of God just like I do is that right I can't focus on that I have to focus on what the word is speaking to my life I can pray for my brother I see one in need that's my responsibility as a Son of God is to take dominion over over the tongue that it don't talk about him that's it you know so and so did this this and this and this and they did this this and this and this and then here's the cherry on top you you pray for them why did you have to say everything why'd you have to say everything maybe it have been better if it had been an apple and got put in the snout before anything could have come out right just pray for them take it and pray for them is that right oh God help us that's part of maturity friends you might look at that and say well that ain't that great big of a Ministry it is in the book of Colossians there was a man by the name of aaas he was recognized as praying for the Perfection of the Saints not that he preached meetings or did this he prayed for Perfection among one another don't ever despise what God has you to do when your mind Clos itself to these things and let God the spirit of his word come in it blows the rest of the stuff out this is what this is what one of these Daisy cutter bombs do yeah that's right it comes in and it just when we can receive the word hallelujah you say well how how do I receive it well it begins first with agreeing right receiving it in our mind and as you'll take that word in not your thoughts but God's thoughts it has within it power transforming power it has power to clean channels out amen oh my this is why the prophet in the message is super sense and I want you to think of this scripture 2 Corinthians 5:7 for we walk by faith and not by sight walk by faith this is how we walk we walk by faith we our life it's moving on by faith faith is a master of every circumstance faith is that of the good man in the house I want you to watch how the prophet places this in the message the six the super sense you see which one okay the six sense that's faith faith come for this reason only that was to make the five senses in you deny anything that's contrary to God's word amen that's what the six sense is for the scripture speaks of casting down reasonings watch he goes on six senses come upon the human being to make them deny anything that's contrary to the word of God any symptom any symptom that's contrary to God's promise the six sense says it isn't there amen what says it's not there the six sense notice the natural man only has these talking about the five natural senses they're all right if they can be brought in submission to the six sense if the natural mind says and it reads the word of God and said this is the word of God it's speaking the truth but if it reads it and it says it's not all the word of God or you know it was one time but it ain't now then that six comes in and says he's the same yesterday today and forever see the soldier at the beginning right the word of God established in our hearts this is why with faith and the Holy Spirit the word of God is so important remember how Paul let me try to bring this down remember how Paul would write in Romans 7 I don't have time to read all of it but Paul would say in verse 14 we know that the law is spiritual but I am carnal sold under sin for that which I do I allow not for what I would that do I not but what I hate that do I if then I do that which I would not I consent unto the law that it is good now then it is no more I that do it but sin that dwelleth in me for I know now watch this this is a maturity for I know that in me that is in My Flesh dwelleth no good thing I'm telling you your flesh My Flesh man it'll side right against the real you on the inside in a moment you don't ever want to take him in a fight never never take and rely on your reasoning your affections or any of your senses natural or those five spiritual don't ever come against the enemy with that because those things it'll side right with the devil all the time them guys are turn codes man you don't want them this is what Paul is saying I know this is a reality of maturity I know amen but Paul you're born of the stock of Benjamin Paul you're the prophet of God Paul you got understanding in Mysteries Paul but see what's what it is Paul recognizes within me he's not talking in his soul no when you read Paul's gospel in Romans Colossians Philippians all the way through it almost sounds like there's two people in one body and yet there is there's a real man that has come from God on the inside and he's walking in this vessel God made Adam first Spirit man then put him in a flesh body you see that's part of the maturing and recognizing being able to discern and separate the Realms in our lives this is where Paul said I know that in me that is in my flesh that means flesh and spirit dwelleth no good thing for to will is present with me but how to perform that which is good I find not for the good that I would do I do not but the evil which I would not that I do how many have you ever said I'll tell you what soon as I get done with this I'm going to go pray there you go and all of a sudden here it is later on at night later on or whenever more and you look man man how did that how did that because you know why evil is always present you know what evil is this right here this guy right here right here it's always it's evil is always present this guy don't feel like doing certain things he don't the flesh don't are you with me yeah so notice for the good that I would do I do not but the evil which I would not that I do now if I do that I would not it is no more I that do it but sin that dwelleth in me I find in a law that when I would do good evil is present with me watch this now for I Delight in the law of God after the inward man that's important it's got to be a delight a desire is for the word of God in the Inner Man psalms 27 this one thing have I desired is that right that's but I see another law in my members so Paul you mean there's still a battle out here in your members Paul wrote of it in Galatians 5 the spirit capital S not human Spirit capital S for the spirit lusteth against the flesh meaning there's desires that are against the flesh the spirit desires to be in tune with God right and the flesh lusteth against the spirit these two Paul said are contrary one to the other but I see another law in my members Waring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members oh Wretched Man that I am who shall deliver me from the body of this death I thank God through Jesus Christ Our Lord so then with the mind I myself serve the law of God but with the flesh the law of sin thank God for a strength on the inside to bring that outer man in subjection yes amen Amen brother BR in the prayer of a super sense he said the six sense the super sense oh God he's in prayer pour it out on me give it to me and to everyone who needs it Pour thy six sense into me Lord I'm willing to surrender these five my own knowledge thoughts casting down all reasonings Lord let Thy word be true and every man's word Al lie every reasoning every doubt be Cast Away and let me walk by the super sense the sense of the Holy Spirit he goes on to say if the six sense says God keeps his word I give myself to him I surrender all I got to him my S says this will bring it to pass my faith in God's word then call anything else contrary to it as though it wasn't Abraham met God and God said you're going to have a baby by Sarah him 75 ver 65 Abraham called everything that was contrary to that as though it wasn't he walked as if he seen God and he believed are you hearing are you hearing what the prophet said he walked as if he seen God he saw God by dreams he saw God in Vision he saw God In Lights yes come on the prophet walking us through even the church ages he received all of these visitations and Abraham was called crazy because of the vision he was walking by but the prophet said one day that which I have heard of I now see with my own eyes when Isaac came the vision was made material but he had to walk through all that ridicule he had to walk through all that contesting and what was it doing it was trying to contest against the word that he had received but that word he had received had found a bedding ground in Abraham's life do you love him oh yeah amen let's Stand Together praise God he called anything that said that he wasn't any reasoning anything else that don't make a bit of difference what the doctor said right what anybody else said what his own mind said what anything else said God was right and he stayed with it and I just love how brother brandham in this this prayer he says oh God give me more right after this he says God give me more of that six sense so that I can Minister Faithfully to your children I say tonight Lord I want more of that six sense amen I want more Faith Lord pour it in me Lord you know what faith is it's a revelation of God's will it might just start with a little something here tonight because as God is dealing with each of our lives across such a spectrum but you know what if we can just say Lord I want more of that Faith tonight Lord oh God I want more just to pour it in Lord Jesus let it just so moveed through my life Lord I tell you friends he not only will dismantle and he dismantle desires but he goes right down if we'll just bring every thought captive and bring it over here well brother Samuel this don't it don't seem too bad remember there's a lot of terrorists that looked pretty good oh yeah oh no I I don't want to I don't want to I I don't want you know we're living in a day where it's kind of like in this agenda and everything but I want you to understand I'm not getting in a political realm but it's almost got into the spiritual realm I don't want to offend nobody I don't want to do this you know I don't you know I got no no no no it's your responsibility I don't care what their last name is I don't care what their origin is I don't care what the thought is Bring It subject to the word of God are you hearing me cuz many times it's those things that we just let we can let go and my my my ah you know what there's many listen there's many many individuals when you look at a lot of these things and shootings and things and things with that that has taking place sometimes it's it's it's amazing to me sometimes as you know over the years I remember a lot of it started out when I was just graduating from from uh from college to be a teacher out there in Coline that was one of the first ones that I remembered and it was really big but you know what there's things that you you start hearing and it's whether it's there at a school or whether it's a dad or it's a mom or it's somebody sometimes it's people you would look at and think well these would be respectable citizens yeah that's right and all of a sudden something got a hold of them right and there's things that probably people could say oh they wouldn't hurt a flea I've heard people tell me that about dogs too yeah they weren't Hur to flee that's okay they can't have mine oh W many times you know what it is just got oh no they're real good person it's the people that was right around them that looked at and said oh don't worry about them they're not a threat I tell you you better take every threat serious are you hearing me I'm not talking about out there now that's one thing we we're walking if we're walking with him we can trust him we can look to the Lord are you with me cuz friends if we didn't think about it you'd be looking everywhere when you go into a supermarket and everything I believe in knowing your surroundings is that right I believe there's right times to go out to the store and so forth but you know what I don't believe that word meant to live in fear but I do believe that we should bring every thought yes subject to the word of God sometimes I can remember even in my well you know even how the devil would still like to try to come the devil would try like to try to come and well there's nothing to you you don't have there's nothing about you you're not you're not really part of it you're not really going to make it all you say Brother Sam you mean the devil would actually come and Whisper those things do you think he ever stopped that but one of these days when I'm standing right there and pressing through as God gives me Grace day by day and Moment by moment I can one day be able to say just as he gave me overcoming Grace there this is the moment of Goodbye World Goodbye hallelu Oh hallelujah oh he's no respected person listen he rose right up in the prophet's bedroom remember brother Bram said he was brother Bram described how he looked he said he looked like one of those Ali he looked like Ali oop the cartoon character I didn't know what that looked like so I had to look it up that's one time I was thankful for Google cuz I could pull up the image of what Aly oop looked like brother BR said he's all big and you know what he told the prophet he said you're nothing but a bluff you don't got no power with god wow and he kept coming and brother Bram said finally he said I had enough and said Satan praise the Lord thou are an affront to me get behind me he left so don't think that he ain't going to try to come and don't try to come around even sometimes even listen even while song leaders are standing here musicians are playing he'll try to get and move and say well I tell you what look you're messing everything up look at you you're the one you're you're just all out of sorts you just need to walk off the platform you think he don't tell sometimes even as ministers I'm just giving you a little bit of an Insight because the very things that you battle with when you can come and sit down and the enemy says look at you you can't even get your mind centered you can't even get it right your mind's everywhere else well it ain't going to do you no good to be here what should you do at that time keep sitting and say thank you Lord for your mercy you know what you're doing you're cutting a hole right through that Gloom and that devil praise God that's and the angels of God they're ready to move in and move in God says hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on I I want you to watch what my son or daughter do hallu just want and the ministering Spirits they're ready to go they're ready to go and Minister wait wait wait wait wait wait wait watch even before you get to them what just just watch them stand right here and they begin to just say thank you Lord thank you Lord something begins to move oh my the angels are marveling and looking and you know what they're looking at at the effect of what the Holy Ghost is inside of the of the believer that is yes sir and you know how that's been able to happen because the spirit of God even sometimes friends when it can escape us and get by us but the spirit of God will come right back around and that thought comes into subjection and say wait a minute I'm a Believer that's right and I'm going to Worship the Lord God's got something for me today God did not call me here just for nothing he's got something for me my mind might be a million places all it may it may be all so seemingly scattered and even if I hit the wrong note I'm going to hit the wrong note for the Lord are you hearing me sometimes the enemy can get where people get up and they sing a special sometimes you just can't seem to hit the right key or the right note it's like brother Bill always said from when the church first started go forward there's no other place to go so if you feel like you've been hitting wrong notes in your life don't put don't set the microphone down nope nope no we're not going to mute it back there either God's not going to mute it around your life you take that microphone Lord I'm depending on you Lord I'm depending on you Lord hallelujah you know what that is that's casting down imaginations that tells you well you failed here you've done this you've done but cast it down because why there is a word of Grace that comes to lift you and I thank you Jes bring it subject to the word tonight thank you Father you love him amen let's just pray Hallelujah heavenly father thank you Father thank you for your mercies tonight once again Lord father I just Lord I'm so thankful ful that you're the chief Captain Lord among us you're the great five-star general you've never lost a battle Lord father there's a few victories that few things that Lord battles are where I've let slip away but I'm so glad that the war has already been won but Lord I I know I can speak not only for me but for everybody I want to win Lord even in battles Lord of areas where you've brought me Lord too help me Lord It's a moment to surrender yeah it's a moment Lord with a Readiness to Revenge all Disobedience when our obedience is fulfilled help us Lord the real arresting of our thoughts Lord father all of these things Lord and as it pertains to our lives it's surrender it's submission Lord may we capture every thought don't let those thoughts run loose like letting somebody questionable run through an airport that won't happen Lord I've seen them where when something got called there can be people Lord all of a sudden off officer security things can take off it's questionable help us Lord that we would lead captive I think how that word says bringing into captivity that not only means to bring it into captivity but sometimes that deals with as a part of that meaning means lead into captivity that our thoughts would be led to this place of the word hallelujah what does the word say that's right Lord Jesus how we need you Lord Lord I I know I have to I know these five senses in order to be here upon this Earth but I I want to be more in contact with that six sense Lord I want more of that six sense Lord that faith in my life like your Prophet Lord would speak Lord to where we're would be walking in

of our life would be baked out in your presence Lord Lord help us I pray May you Lord God continue to move and through the things that we've heard Lord you've spoke to our hearts you've taken us on this little pathway Lord because job thought that it was you that was doing this to him but it wasn't you doing it it was you permitting it Satan was doing it but Satan was trying to make him think this way and your Prophet said as long as job thought that way he was whipped in his mind Lord God that shows right there we do not want Lord our spirit help us that our spirit is not hijacked and held hostage Lord whether it's through affection memory con I reasoning I don't want to keep them like the prophet would use that terminology if you'll keep them I don't want to keep them Lord right I don't want to keep them I know that Lord I there's things that I wish I could get so far out of my memory I wish there's things Lord that I never seen or knew or heard but Lord God the way that we keep them out is by receiving something that's greater and submitting Lord to you oh Lord Divine love has a way of going down and dismantling hurt Stingers Lord that can get stuck and it has away Lord the Holy Spirit Lord the great oil of God and has a way to move down lord and move through the gates of our spirit Lord and through those channels Lord God oh as we'll take the word of God in Lord it'll come from the inside out and it'll blow those things out Lord amen [Music] father I want my channels blown out Lord I want to stay in that way Lord I don't want things to accumulate sometimes

heart and his heart had been wooed to submission and it was a life Lord that was lived according to your word no written bible at that time only what was written in the heavens but job Knew You by
