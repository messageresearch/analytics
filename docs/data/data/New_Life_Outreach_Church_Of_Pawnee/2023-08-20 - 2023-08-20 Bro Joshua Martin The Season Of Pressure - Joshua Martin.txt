according to your world can we sing it again now be it unto me according to your words according to your promises stand secure right upon my heart the truth that sets me free according to your word Lord be it unto me amen is that your desire be it unto me it's the truth that sets us free amen and I believe that's a reality you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free no matter what we go through there's something that's a companion amen if you have your Bibles let's turn to Matthew 4 and 1. I have a lengthy passage of scripture this morning um are you happy to be in the house of the Lord amen like it's been said our pastor is in Virginia there for Uncle Sean's 50th birthday party um he had Uncle Sean had Josiah out all day thinking that it was going to be at Josiah's birthday party and so whenever Sean came in and realized it was for him it was a look of surprises on his face it was pretty funny and so he was definitely surprised he said well Jonathan's here Wendell's here Dad's here so it's pretty funny seeing his reactions so amen Uncle Jonathan will be preaching this morning and Dad will be preaching tonight so I we pray that they have some good services but Matthew 4 1 and we realize this is the scripture right after John baptizes Jesus and the spirit you know descended upon him but Matthew 4 and 1 then Jesus was led up into the Wilderness to be tempted of the devil and when he had fasted 40 days and 40 nights he was afterward of hunger and when the tempter came to him and he said if thou be the Son of God command these stones to be made bread but you notice how he come at his weakest moment he was hungry he was in fasting for 40 days and he come at his weakest moment in the fourth verse but he answered and said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God then the devil would taketh him up into the holy city and sitteth him Upon A Pinnacle of the Temple people and said unto him if thou be the Son of God cast thyself down for it is written he shall give his angels Church concerning thee and in their hands they shall bear thee up lest at any time thou shall Dash thy foot against the stone and Jesus said unto him it is written again Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God again the devil taketh him up into the exceeding high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them and he said unto him all these things will I give unto thee if thou will fall down and worship me then Jesus said unto him get thee hence Satan for it is written Thou shalt Worship the Lord thy God and him only shall thou serve then the devil leaveth him and behold Angels Came and ministered unto him and now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison he departed unto Galilee and leave leaving Nazareth he came into Wilton Capernaum which is upon the Sea Coast and the borders of zebulun and Nephilim that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaias the prophet saying the land of Zebulon and the land of Nephilim by the way of the sea Beyond Jordan Galilee of the Gentiles the people which set in darkness saw great light and and to them which set in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up and from that time Jesus began to preach and to say repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand and Jesus walking by the Sea of Galilee saw two Brethren Simon called Peter and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea for they were Fishers and he said unto them follow me and I will make you Fishers of Men and they straightway left their Nets and followed him and going on from thence he saw two other Brethren James the son of zebaby and John his brother in the ship with his ever be their father amending their Nets and he called them and they immediately left the ship and their father and followed him and Jesus went about all Galilee teaching and their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the Kingdom healing on manner of sicknesses and all manner of diseases among the people and as Fame went throughout all Syria and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with the diverse diseases torments and they which were possessed but devils and they which were lunatics and they that have policy and he healed them amen can be about our heads this morning dear gracious Heavenly Father Lord we want to thank you for the the word you've given us Lord Jesus God lord all that the Lord all the the forerunners had to go through Lord to get this printed Bible Lord we want to say thank you we take it for granted too many times God but Lord we want to say thank you for the word you've given us Lord we want to thank you for the service that you've allowed us to be and Lord as we come into this part of the service God you know the needs of the people I ask that you would anoint your servant Lord help me to get myself out of the way father and speak the words that you would have we ask these things in your precious name amen you may be seated and I know that was a familiar scripture and a long scripture but if I had a title it would be the a season of pressure and I know this is the quote they'll be all no but brother Branham says unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him you have to suffer to Reign the reason for this is that character is simply never made without suffering character is a victory not a gift he says a man without character can't Reign because power apart from character is satanic but with power character is fit to rule and since he wants us to share even his throne on the same basis that he overcome and has set down in his throne then we have to overcome to sit with him and I love this part and he's quoting a scripture here in the little temporary suffering that we go through now it's not worthy to be compared to the tremendous Glory that be that will be revealed in us when he comes and oh what Treasures are laid up for those who are willing to enter into his kingdom through much tribulation and I just love how the Bible puts these he's quoting the scripture and Romans 8 16 the spirit itself bearth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if the children then heirs Heirs of God join heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we might be also glorified together for our reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us so he's saying the things I'm going through right now it's not worthy to be even compared can't even be in the same sentence in what we're going to gain from this suffering but brother Branham says character is not a it's not a gift but it's a victory it's something that we gotta fight for it's something we got not necessarily earn but it's not something that's given to us we've got to fight for it because power apart from character is satanic and brother Branham says this is that right waiting God trying to place his church in a position to manifest himself getting one that can work through this and say that that my spirit flowing freely there it is I can work there get another one over here and place him I can place him adoption placing manifesting he says God is trying to get his church in a position where he can manifest himself through that church but we know but we know if we don't got the character of God we're always going to display our feelings we're going to display what we think is right what what our manifest our own desires but God is wanting somebody that has his character that can display his power his authority look at Isaiah 8 and 20 to the law and to the testimony if they speak not according to the word it is because there was no light in them in other words their actions their words is going to display the character that is on the inside so God is looking for somebody that is going to display his word through every trial through every circumstance through every hard time through every suffering there's a character on the end side that is displaying the authority of the word we can look at dictators throughout the span of the world we had Hitler Stalin Mussolini Saddam Hussein all of these men had power but without the character to to use that power that becomes satanic they become uh uh they they become rulers that were hated they hated people that throw them in prison they weren't that that power was immense to bind people but that power was meant to loose the captives the power was meant to set him free but without the character to use that power they're abiding the people and I thought oh my that's the way it is with many people they don't got their character to use the word so they're putting people in condemnation they're putting people under the rule of a man but God ain't God didn't call us to be put in condemnation but under the character of Christ we can fulfill the word that he has for this generation so any man without character will abuse the power that is God we look at politicians politicians they're all dirty now judges can be Bots all of these high rulers can be above the presidents have got their own agendas now what is it they've got power but they don't got character to use that power and so the Apostle Paul is telling us in Romans if we suffer with him if we gain a character then we can be glorified with him we can sit with the same Authority we can sit with the same power with the same mindset that God has we can have but that only comes through the sufferings through the trials through the tribulations it's through those things that are carnal character is being beat out and start to reflect God's character you know being a think of the diamond the diamond in the ref that it it's in a horrible spot but as that diamond as as that Master starts to beat on that diamond it's chipping off all of the heart spots it's shipping off all of the heart and the pointy spot watch until he can look into that diamond and see his own character he can see a reflection of himself and that's what God is wanting he don't want to abide with their own agendas with her own mindset with their own actions but he's wanting somebody that he can look at and seek himself he can see a bride both of us bone flesh of his flesh power of power of his power she is him that's what he is wanting in this generation is somebody with a character that is like unto him but you looked at First Peter 4 and 12. beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery triumph which is to try you as though some strange thing happened unto you but rejoice in so much as ye are partakers of Christ's suffering so he's saying here he is counting you worthy enough to go through the same things that Christ went through so we've got a right to rejoice in every trial we've got a right to rejoice in every Affliction because God has enough confidence in you to put you through the same thoughts the same sufferings that Christ went through so you can have the same results that Christ have I don't believe that we are a powerless individual but because of the sufferings that we're going through it's producing a character a character to rule you see brother Branham says this that is what Peter said is it a strange thing that God wants us to develop a christ-like character that comes through suffering no sir we and we have all have trials we are all tried and chastise the sons no one that goes through that the church the church that is not suffering is not being tried and it isn't of God and I thought my many people think after they get the Holy Ghost the battle is over with but in reality the battle is just starting whenever we get the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost ain't to take the trials away the Holy Ghost equips you to press through the trials the Holy Ghost equips you the Press through the sufferings you look at Ephesians 6 and 10 finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of his mind so the first step of Christianity is to be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might then watch the next verse say put on the whole armor of God that you might be able to stand against the Wows of the devil so in order to stand you got to be strong in the power of His might in order to put the armor on you've got to be strong in the power of His might in order to obtain character you have to be strong in the power of His Amite so the Holy Ghost don't do away with the trials it gives you a perseverance to go through the trial you see the Apostle Paul through human strength could not those three beatings could not go through scorchings do not go through stonies and shipwrecks and to be beheaded but because he had an anchor on the inside he had the strength of the Lord on the inside he was able to persevere to gain the character and in your own strength you would be blown away by every trial you'll be blown away by every persecution but I believe there's a bride that is in the strength of his power the power of his strength and we're not being blown away we're not wishy-washy Christians but there's a strength on the inside that is persevering through everything we go through so getting the Holy Ghost is the start of our battle career it's where we're enlisting and God is building a character inside of us you see brother Branham talks about uh uh talks about the Eagles and he says what are the equal among the eagle do he says whenever it gets to a certain point she starts to pluck out all of the soft things in the nest she's wanting to she's wanting to build a character inside of them inside of that eagle you know I like helping the Brandon puts it he says now the mother is determined them little Eagles are not to be chickens but she's determined that they are not to be you know what she does says she struts up and down the nail spreads and she says looky here honey how great I am see here you've got the trust me I'm going to take you somewhere where you have to trust me and how do I know that God has a scent these sick people in this afternoon the same way put you in a place where the doctor you may say I'm a Christian brother Branham I know it I've got the Holy Ghost and here I am suffering and he says this how do you know that Jehovah that Jehovah's not just trying to get you to look through his wings and see how great he is how great I am I'm going to do something for you but you have to trust me and so he's saying the mama ego in order to determine that those are those eaglets are not chickens they've got to go through some character building they got to go through some trials they've got to go go through some hard times and those sufferings is building up an ego-like character that separates them from the chickens oh my and the sufferings that you go through is building up a christ-like character that separates you from the serpent seed it separates you from The Cast Away God and raising serpent say God ain't raising Castaways God ain't raising one of these but he's got he's got his children on Earth Sons and Daughters of God that are going through some hard times to produce a character that is likened unto him but he says you've got to trust me and it's only an eagle that can trust Mama ego how come because she came from Mama Eagle he knows that I come from that eagle and he's got my best interest in mine and I think that's the way it is with the children of God we've been born by The Germ life of God and we know no matter what we go through he's got our best in interest in mind you see so whenever a mama Eagle wants to see the eagle-like character she sends them through some testings and here's another quote mother Branham says and soaring so high way in the air here's the funny part about it when she got up there you know what she'd done she shook them off off of her wings she wasn't they wasn't going to be chickens they had to fly and I love how he keeps pointing back that some point what is going to separate the chicken from the eagle is the character that the sufferings is bringing upon hope you're catching it this morning what is separating you from the rest of the world it's the sufferings it's building a character on the inside that is making you fit to rule we're gonna rule one day and we're gonna March over the ashes of the wicked but character or power without character is not fit to rule we may not want to go through sufferings we might not want to go through hard times but God has his Authority waiting for you he has a he has a throne waiting for you but you just have to overcome the sufferings you've got a person here and come out on the other side ready to roll but you're saying we've got to be willing to persevere you see God is sending you through some times you see brother Branham says this cloudy skies and the storms of life or not signs of God's disapproval neither are bright skies and still water signs of his love and approval and so you may feel like God has forgotten about you because you're in the trial of your life that doesn't mean God has not approved you but he is standing there right beside you watching character build you notice Mama Eagle don't leave the baby eaglets whenever she knocks it off her Wing she's flying right beside him watching it every step of the way waiting for it to Flap those wings and take off the character building is not the eagle by itself but it's a mama Eagle right beside it every step of the way and character building inside of your life is not you by yourself it's Papa God next to you every step of the way saying come on son you've got this the end of the trial is right ahead of you I see light after the end of the tunnel you're not going down but you're going up it's a character that I'm building on the inside of you so that you can rule one day oh we don't like the suffering but we are going to like the ruling part we always do like the yin product of the suffering but you see where the Brandon continues on to say his approval of any of us is in the Beloved here's the love is elective which he had for us before the foundation of the world how does does he love us oh yes but how shall we know we shall know because he said so and so in order for us to know that God loves us is to walk by faith the only way that we can feel love from anybody's the trust that they love me we can see their actions we can see how their their expressing their love but it still takes trust to say my mom loves me that my dad loves me because anybody can come up and say your parents don't love you the devil does that with many children nobody loves your mama don't like you Daddy don't like you and even though they're expressing their love without a trust in them you can never appreciate the love of the parents and that's the way it is with God the devil will come and season left you by yourself and if there's not a trust there you can never appreciate the love of God it's the love of God that we go through sufferings because he's wanting us to rule one day oh my brother random continues on to say and manifested he did love us for he brought us to himself and gave us his Spirit placing us our sons and how shall I prove my love to him by believing what he said and by conducting myself with joy in the midst of the trial that he and his wisdom allows to come to pass he says how do we express love back to God is having joy in the trial that he allowed to come to pass so the devil can never put you through anything that he did not run through God first come on now the devil don't got free rule over your life he can only do what God allows and brother Branham is saying here it's by God's wisdom that you go through sufferings but in the midst of the sufferings you can still have joy because you are experiencing the love of God oh hallelujah it's not the hatred of God that you're going through the valley of the shadow of death but it's the love of God letting you know that there's a character that is going to be expressed one day you might be in the Lion's Den you're my being in the fiery furnace but God hasn't left you he's building a character that is fit to rule how joy in the trial have praise and the suffering have have something that is of character in the hard times God hasn't forgot about you it's his wisdom and his love that he's sending you through that oh my James 1 and 2 my brother and counted all joy when you fall into diverse Temptations diverse means more than one Temptations is Trials you see we fail to see the end product of many times when before we forget to count it all joy because all we share is the trials but if we can just see what the Apostle Paul saw then we can have Joy inside of the trial the Apostle Paul says these present sufferings are not worthy to be compared to what I'm going to gain from it the Apostle Paul knew every suffering that he went through was a building came up to Roar every suffering every trial every heartbreak he went through Christ was starting to reflect inside of him self through every trial and through every hard time Christ is seeing himself inside of you a e-cigar and greater and greater and greater oh hallelujah what brought on the image of Christ inside of the fiery furnace it was them going through the suffering and the King that threw them in the suffering turned and says who's the fourth man in the fire who's that it looks like the Son of God while brought on the image oh Hallelujah of the Son of God it was the suffering come on somebody what brought on the image of the Son of God inside of the fiery furnace inside of a god-forsaken land it was somebody having joy in the midst of the suffering and that's what brings God in the middle of laodicea for the world to see is somebody having joy in the midst of the suffering in the midst of the pain you're still reflecting love in the midst of the Heartbreak you're still expressing joy in the midst of the suffering you're expressing God in the midst of it all that's what the world needs is some love in the midst of hatred and that's what you can express you can express the love of God in the midst of the suffering oh Hallelujah that expresses God more than than your testimony it's whenever you're in the suffering and still expressing the love of God oh come on now that expresses God the more you remember I know I know this this story is told many times remember when brother Branham lost his daughter and lost his wife his first wife uh the the critic come up to brother Branham he says Billy I've seen you pray hell no I've seen you work all day then go to the street corners and preach all night then go right back to work and come back and preach again he says I've seen you do this time after time after time you go and visit people that are discouraged and sick and here God has taken your loved one away he's taken your daughter away he's taken your your your wife away what do you think of God now and in the midst of the suffering God's character started to express itself and says he's still the same he is still faithful and what did the critics say oh you've kept your religion huh he says no my religion has kept me the character that was on the inside was blossoming and blooming oh Hallelujah you don't gotta get you don't gotta get hated or hatred inside of the trial you don't gotta curse God inside of the suffering but you can express the love of God that even the Lions can feel oh my the Lions inside of the den with Daniel started to fill the character of God you notice you notice brother Branham says the Adam and the beginning was petting Leo the Lion but after the fall he was running from the lion what was Daniel doing in the Lion's Den he was expressing the character that Adam had come out somebody in the midst of the fiercest Lions they had to realize this is God's character on Earth oh my they could not they was realizing that the champ the same love the same character that Adam had in the beginning this a man is expressing in the midst of hatred in the midst of chaos he's expressing a character like it under Gods like thunder or maker you see so God is wanting an image on Earth that in the tough times it's Jesus in the good times it's Jesus on the Mountaintop in The Valleys it's Jesus and it's only through the character of Christ can we reflect reflect Christ in every pressure you see when did Jesus ministry start it was right after the Temptations in the wilderness but you notice he was equipped to press Through The Temptations because the Bible says that he went he was baptized by John and the Spirit come like an unto a dove and says this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased to dwell and what happened right after the the Holy Ghost rested upon him the Bible says the the spirits let him into the Wilderness how come his ministry was about to start and in order for him to fulfill his ministry he had to gain character oh come on now he had to gain character so that he can rule in his administrate and so the Bible says the spirit of the Lord led him into the Wilderness to be tempted so he wasn't by himself but he was led by the anchor oh come on now you don't go to the Valley of the shadow of death by yourself how come you don't fear no evil because the anchor is the one leading you through it so that you can obtain the character Jesus didn't heal one body he didn't open one blinded eye unclog one deaf ear until after the Temptation him the Wilderness and what happened right after the Wilderness the Bible says he started to preach the Kingdom of Heaven it's an eye what puts him in the position to fulfill his administrator the character building times through the suffering oh come on now you may say I don't got a Ministry I'm not a preacher I'm not a prophet I'm not this you don't need to be a preacher to be had to have a Ministry you see what it was Stephen that was not a preacher but here's a Ministry reflected the character of Christ even in the midst of the suffering how did the Apostle Paul get saved it was by the character of Christ being shown through Stephen he wasn't a preacher but it was somebody with the ministry that was expressing the character of Christ oh Hallelujah you don't got to be a preacher you don't got to be a singer you don't got to be a deacon but all you need is the character of Christ to express the character to the lost and Dying World it can be the hardest of Sinners the ones that's Addicted by the biggest and strongest of drugs that you can set free it's because of a character that has been obtained through suffering oh come on somebody it's a character that is reaching out to the lost and Dying World you see so the devil don't pull fast ones upon God every time you feel like you're at your weakest moment and the devil's bombarding your mind God's allowed it to build a character you see you notice what happened right after that Jesus won the victory you look at Matthew 4 and 11 then the devil leaveth him and behold Angels Came and ministered unto him so you notice what if Jesus would have been obeying his own will whenever the devil says jump from this Pinnacle and the angels will catch you because the Angels were there follow me now the Angels was there because the Bible says they came and ministered so I'm sure that he had the same thoughts that we have how many have the thoughts whenever you're being tempted you're being tried and you're going through a struggle and the devil says just give in and you will get rid of this suffering just give in and the heartache will go just give in and this will go I'm sure that Jesus have the same thoughts just give in and jump and these angels will catch me but in the midst of the suffering he knew he needed the character oh come on now in all points he was tempted like you were tempted but without sin there was a promise to you to know that the same thing the bra or the same power the bra Christ through the Temptation through the Wilderness through the suffering is the same power that can pull me through every suffering through every season through every trial Hallelujah it was in the wilderness season that the Angels come and ministered to Jesus come on now it was in the wilderness season that the ministers come or that thy Angels come and minister to Jesus and it's in your Wilderness season that the angels are going to come and minister to you you see where would Jesus ministry had been if he gave into the pressure what if he would have gave into the pressure and followed what he was wanting to do or what the devil was wanting him to do he wouldn't have obtained the character that he was gaining through that trial oh my you so while we Express in the wilderness season is going to determine or ministering what is going to determine the outcome of the Wilderness you notice it was right after the Wilderness that Jesus preaches the Sermon on the Mount and I'm sure that there was many people that were sitting there thinking my what a wonderful sermon this is powerful this is great but they didn't realize the suffering he had to go through to get that sermon come on somebody he had just come through suffering it was by the suffering that he could preach The Sermon on the Mount and it's through your suffering that you can preach God that you can preach a Grace and love to a lost and Dying World you see every preacher that we look at and admire they didn't get there by accident they had to go through the Wilderness Seasons you look at Ron Spencer a great warrior of Faith it's somebody that is standing against the odds but he didn't get that way by accident he had to go through the Wilderness Seasons he had to go he he had he fell off a roof multiple times he's broke his back multiple times he's been through a fire he's been through these hard times but it was through the sufferings that he can stand as a general and letting you know even though I've got cancer I'm still going to preach the God heals the body come on somebody what is it he's been through some sufferings that's brought on a character that he can let the world know that he is still the god that healeth all diseases he's still by your stripes he still heals even though he's in the suffering hope you're catching up this morning even in the suffering he's still expressing the character of God oh my you know we we look at brother Morrow and sister Leah they're like solid rocks but they didn't get there by accident it was through some suffering that they went through and it was your response in that suffering that is determining good Ministry now one of few would have turned away and become bitter at God and said you took my son you took him too early I'm gonna hate you I'm gonna be bitter but no in the midst of the suffering they express the christ-like character so that they can let you know that in the midst of the Suffering The Angels administer to us in the Dark Knights the Angels administered to us in the lonely times the Angels minister to us it was their response in the suffering that has produced their Ministry come on somebody it's your response him the suffering that is producing a powerful Ministry you might never get up behind the pulpit and preach you might never get up and sing a song or be a deacon but your ministry is just as powerful as every preacher that is on the earth just as powerful your ministry is so powerful that you can reach people that the preachers can't reach you can reach people that the prophet couldn't reach you can reach people that the deacons can't reach it's because of the suffering it's because of the suffering that's brought on a character oh it's the suffering that's brought on the character for you to express God oh man the same angels that minister to Jesus in the wilderness was the same angels that minister to Elijah you know brother Branham dramatizes it he says I want the surface that they're the angel with the softest hands to go down I want you to rub his brow I want you to stroke his hair he's at a hard place right now he's in the suffering but he sent ministering angels in the midst of the suffering to encourage him it was the same angels that were surrounding Elisha and his servant whenever they were surrounded by the by the by the armies and it looked hopeless and what's the bible say that Elisha says Lord open this Poor Man's eyes and whenever his eyes come open he's seen Chariots of Fire surrounding him what was it it was a ministering angels in the midst of the suffering God hasn't left you by yourself there's a ministering Angels every step of the player now speaking encouragement how did you get through the hard times how did you get through the heart breaks it was the ministering angels that brought you each step of the way you shouldn't be here this morning you should be and Billy Joe you should be in a ditch somewhere with drugs and alcohol but it was a ministering angels that was in the suffering the pressure through we all have testimonies that we can tell and say I shouldn't be here I should be backslid I should be bitter I should be off somewhere else but it was the ministering angels in the midst of the suffering that has brought you through so you can stand today with the character say no matter what you go through God can bring you through no matter the Heartbreak God can bring you through no matter the trials God can bring you through it was the suffering that has brought on the character oh my hey was my greatest heartbreak the struck a fire on the inside of me it was the suffering that God brought on a character like never before Oh Hallelujah but how you respond determines your outcome you look at Matthew 11 and 6 blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me he is saying not being offended in everybody else but being offended in me and brother Branham says this oh my blessed is he who is not offended in me now don't be offended I believe there's more people offended in Jesus than any other person that has ever lived on earth they get offended too quick Jesus now in this misplaced me attitude slip over there so that we can get it tonight excuse me he says blessed is he who was not offended in me don't be offended in me no matter what takes place everything is working right on schedule so just go ahead and believe it everything is all right just go ahead and believe it oh my soul how come we can't get offended at God because whenever we get offended that's somebody we start to treat them different we start to think about them different we don't we don't trust them anymore that's the same thing that happens to God when we become offended how God our trust has broken we can't believe his word anymore we can't pray anymore we can't listen to the messages anymore what was it we've become offended at God but he is saying here blessed is he who is not offended you may say brother Josh He said hopeless it's not hopeless the word is here to break that offense because you notice he is speaking talking this how about John the Baptist it was John the Baptist the forerun the first coming of Christ he had baptized Jesus in the Jordan River he was there when the dove come down and ascended or descended upon Christ but now he's in a jail cell now he's in a dark place and now he's getting offenses because of the suffering he's responding wrote oh just follow me for a second he's responding growing in the suffering so what's the Bible say the Bible says he sent his disciples to Jesus and say are you the one or are we to look after another well the Branham says John the Baptist seeing the Messiah sign he had seen the Vindication of Jesus but because of the because of the offense he is now looking at Jesus in a different way oh my you may have been on fire 20 years ago you might have been in love with this message but because of offenses maybe you're looking at the word in a different way but it's not over blessed is he was not offended there's a word this morning that can break that offense because how did Jesus respond to that offense Jesus he tells the disciples you know brother Branham says he didn't say here give here's some literature go tell John how to be happy in the jail cell tell John how to be happy in the prison Jesus didn't say any of that but what Jesus did say was come to my meeting tonight and watch the word manifested and he tells the disciples go tell John that the blind sea that the lame walk that the poor have the minister have preaching to them what was it it was scripture back in Isaiah I believe that was being manifested so it was the manifested word that broke the offense off of John oh come on somebody you may be sitting in a hard time saying I don't I don't think I can believe this message anymore there's too many doubts I've been through too many sufferings and if you might got some offenses this morning but the word is here it's a break off every offense it's here so that you can love again you can praise again maybe you've lost your joy maybe you've lost your worship maybe you've lost your praise because of the suffering but there's some morning there's a word that is Sam blessed is here who is not offended you don't gotta say it in that offense you don't got to stay in that in my hard time but get out of that offense and see Christ like he's meant to be seen he's still the same yesterday today and forever he's still the friend the sticketh closer than a brother he is still with you in the Valley of the shadow of death you just need to see him again you just need to seek him the same way oh my it's not the God has changed but the way you see God Has Changed come on somebody God's still God is still right there there but if you don't see him as the friend that sticketh closer than a brother how can he be a friend let's sticketh closer than a brother you've got to allow him to be that friend you've got to allow him to be the healer of all diseases and because of the fences we keep him from being that to us but if we can get away from all of the offenses he can be that friend that he wants to be he don't want you to be by yourself in the suffering he don't want you to be by yourself in the wilderness season he wants to express himself but first you got to get rid of the offenses oh my you've got to get rid of now it's not offenses towards the brother and the sister you need to get rid of those two but I'm talking about doubts I'm talking about defenses though we get towards God God why if you left me here why don't you hear my prayer anymore why don't I feel your presence anymore we all get there we're not all Saints we have been I've been offended Our God but I also know what it's like for the word to come across my path and it breaks that offense and I can walk out of that offense and praise God like never before you want your joy back break out of that offense you want your worship back break out of that offense you want your joy back and your peace back your long-suffering back you want to love people again get out of that offense and love people like I hey uh Kobe and Caleb can testify as the pastor's kid you see a lot you see how your dad gets batter or baby gets beat up he gets he gets cursed out I've seen him cussed to his face right there somebody claiming to be a Christian I've seen those things and you know what Dallas always told us he says if you become bitter you can never love anybody and that is something that has stuck with me because I have become bitter I'd become bitter where I didn't love anybody anymore I couldn't look at the good at people anymore and I was at a hard spot because I had become offended at God but the same word that broke John out of his offense was the same word that brought me out of my offense and it's the same word that can print you out of every offense that you go through you may say brother Josh I went to the deepest of the trial and it didn't feel like God was Smith me get out of the offense get out of it for the same God is on Earth he's just he's sitting there waiting for you to see him brother Branham says John the Baptist eagles eye was filmed over Sir John Jesus was still there the word was still there but because his eyes was filmed over he couldn't see it yeah oh but it was the word that that took the film off of his eyes so that he could see the word made flesh brother Branham says that the devil is trying to get John to disbelief he was the Messiah you may say how's that even possible he was John that says Behold the Lamb of God the take away the sins of the world he was human he was human just like you as human you must say how could John the Baptist do that he saw the Messiah because of the suffering and how he responded him the suffering I believe he did the that God allowed that to happen so that you won't feel hopeless if John the Baptist went through offenses and if you go through it it's not over you can come out just like John did oh my look at Matthew 11 and 4. Jesus answered and said unto them go show John again again you notice how he says that again in other words he has seen these before this is what caused him to believe in the first place I'm going to show him the same things to break him out of those offenses Go and show John again these things which you do hear and see the blind receive their sights the lame walk the lepers are cleansed the death here the dead are raised up the Dead the poor have the gospel preached to them what was it he was letting John know I'm right on schedule but the Branham says this go tell John the lame walk the blinds see the deaf here all that comes to the meeting is poor the Poor's got the gospel preached to him tell John not to be scared not to think anything different I am right on schedule everything's running right everything's all right I'm right on schedule tell him there's a healing service going on the gospel has got the the Poor's got the gospel preached the power of God is moving among them I'm right on schedule don't pay any attention to nothing else I'm right on schedule don't pay attention to anything else I'm right on schedule and let me tell you this morning don't pay attention to anything else he's right on schedule he's right on schedule he's right there you may feel like you're about to step into the fiery furnace he's right on schedule right on schedule but you notice notice how Jesus responds to the offense you notice how we respond and so Jesus is offended John is offended of Jesus but look what Jesus says in Matthew 11 and 7 and they departed and Jesus began to say it to the multitudes concerning John why went ye out into the Wilderness to see a reed shaken with the wind but why you went out to forth to see a man clothed in South Raymond behold they though wear soft clothing are in King's houses but what went ye out to see a prophet yea I say unto you more than a prophet for this is he of whom it is written behold I send my messenger before my face which shall which shall prepare the way before thee what was John do and what was Jesus doing in the midst of John's offense he was quoting scripture concerning him come on somebody he's not going to leave you hopeless he's letting you know you've got promises concerning your life if you can get out of the offense you can fulfill the promises that you're meant to fulfill and verily I say unto you among them that are born of women there hath not risen greater than John notwithstanding he that is least in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he he is responding in a way that even though he was offended he was still lifting up John hmm Hallelujah he may feel like offenses are going to take you over but God is still lifting you up he's still quoting his promise he's there's still a word here letting you know you're not Forsaken and he's right on schedule nothing is out of cater brother Branham says God Know Thee again from the beginning therefore he could plan everything that would work out just for his glory and that gives us courage to Noah no matter what comes or what goes God is making everything the time clock is ticking exactly on time he says sometimes we get upset we get hastily we think oh we must go and do this or that but remember God's time clock will be just exactly on time God's time clock will be exactly on time the Bible says in Isaiah 46 and 9 remember the former things of old for I am God and there was none else I am God and there was none like like me declaring the yin from the beginning from ancient times the things that are not yet done saying my counsel shall stand and I will do all my pleasure he know he declares the end from the beginning from ancient times from times that are not yet done and you think that God has forsaken you you're engraved in the palm of his hand he can't forget you in order for him to forget you he has to lose his strength what is his right hand the Bible declares that his right hand is his strength it's scripture after scripture so in order for him to forget about you he's got to lose his strength he's got to lose his power and God is never going to lose his power he's never going to lose his authority so that means even though you're in the suffering he's not going to lose you even though you're in the wilderness time he has not forgotten about you you're a part of him in order to forget about you he's got to forget about himself and how can he forget about himself he's never going to forget about you such a place of Courage on the inside that God knows exactly what I'm going through this one may forsake me this one may turn against me I might be going through hard times but God is right there and I refused I refuse to be offended at him I refuse to be offended at his word I know the pressure is coming at me we're living in the day of pressure but the Brandon preaches will find messages on pressure and he says this is this is pressure it's coming after everybody coming after children coming after couples that's coming after the families it's a pressure that the devil is trying to use to admire your character but you can withstand the pressure you see what happens when the pressure comes against you how does somebody lose their temper it's not something that they lose right away or most people don't some people do but what how do how does that call how do people lose their temper it's not by one thing happening but it's something that's built up it's built up it's built up the pressure has built up it's built up until you finally explode it didn't happen right away and that's what is happening here in Lake odessia pressure has been building up through the first church age the second Church age the Third Church age and here we are in the seventh Church age and that pressure is coming so hard where it feels like we're going to lose our mind where it feels like we can't think straight but we've been called to stand in this evil age we're not standing in our own ability we've got the strength of the Lord that as we're standing every pressure we're going to come out with our character intact or character and being marred or a character ain't being destroyed but we're going to come through this most evil age with our character what a brother Branham saying look God's coming after character he says you're going to lose everything else but what's going with you is your character means for evil God is turning around for good so the pressure that the devil is using to try to destroy your character God is using to build up your character that's why the Bible says Rejoice that you are partakers of the sufferings of Christ because what the devil meant for evil God has turned around and is making it good there's pressure remember the story of the rifle the blue mother branham's face he had a model of 70 Winchester rifle I believe and then somebody was going to report it and convert it into a Weatherby Magnum 257. I believe that's one of us and he says when brother Branham went to shoot it they didn't reboil it right and so there was some air or some pressure behind the cap I believe what it was and so whenever he shot the rifle the rifle had too much pressure and it exploded he says the the barrel went up it went up 50 yards the scope went flying behind him and blew up the boat went flying one way he says he was bleeding everywhere he says the doctor looked at him and says the only way you're still alive is because God was standing by his servant but he says one cause that to happen he says pressure he says it was pressure inside of that rifle the constant to blow up and he says none of us what's happening instead of laodicea it's pressure he says what is that what is the devil trying to do he's trying to blow up families by pressure I'm preaching now the devil is trying through pressure to get you to buckle and explode but the devil has no right to cause you to explode unless you give it to him but if you can stand against the pressure there's nothing that the devil can do tomorrow your character oh my look at Matthew 5 and 10 blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven So when you say it here those that are persecuted are going to gain the kingdom and the next verse blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall say o manner of evil against you for her against you falsely for my sake you may say well I don't feel a natural persecution but there is a spiritual persecution you noticed how he separates the two blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness Sake One definition of righteousness is being right in the eyes of God including character so the spiritual persecution is coming after your character it might not be a natural persecution where you're being beaten you're being whipped you're being flawed but it is a spiritual persecution that is coming with pressure against your character come on somebody that's the pressures of the world you may say I don't think I can make it don't give in to the pressure the devil's trying to to marry your character brother random says this when John came he was Supernatural when Jesus came he was the Supernatural and the enemy on the fundamental side always persecuted the supernatural you see God you see what he's trying to do today the same thing so it might not be persecuting you naturally but he's coming against the supernatural character the goddess building on the inside but the Bible says rejoice in Matthew 5 and 12 rejoice and be exceeding glad for a great is your reward in heaven for so persecuted than the prophets which were before you you are the salt of the earth but if the salt has lost its savior where will shall it be salted it is thence for good for nothing but to be cast out and to be trodden under the foot of men so you'll notice how the Bible puts it there's two results that you're going to have inside of the same trial he says you can either be put into the kingdom or you're going to be trodden under the foot of man ye are the salts of the Earth but if the salt has lost its Savor what is Thy word Savor it's a characteristic and so the savior is the character of the salt so how you respond inside of the suffering determines if you're going to gain character or lose character hope you're following me this morning the character is either going to push you into the kingdom or losing your character is going to put you under the foot of a man but how you respond to it determines the outcome but then he says bless it or they that are persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the kingdom he gave you a promise if you can just stand in the midst of the pressure there's a rule waiting for you there there's the kingdom waiting for you there's a throne waiting for you there's Authority waiting for you if you can just stand against the pressure stand against the persecution you see character is always shown through pressure it was the character of job when he was on the ash Heap that was expressed whenever he was at his darkest moment his friends turn against him his wife says curse God and die but his character started to express itself and say the Lord gives and the lord taketh away but Blessed Be Thy holy name it was that character that gave him a glimpse of this future what if he would have cursed God you think God would have spoke to him through the Thunders come on somebody if he would have cursed God like his wife said you think God would have lifted him up for him to see the Redeemer but it was because he stayed true in the suffering he stayed true in the wilderness season the god lifted him up and he can say I know my redeemer liveth what was it character lifted him up hallelujah it's your character that sees God as a friend that is with you and every child don't curse God in the suffering don't curse God in the wilderness that character Express gods Hallelujah nobody else seen the Redeemer he was standing there with his friends whom when that when the Thunder started started to ring out everybody else just heard the Thunder they just seen the lightning but the character of job heard something else come on somebody he refused to be offended in the midst of the suffering you know why you look at you look at Joseph he was the Suffering The put Joseph in the Kingdom how he responded to the suffering put him in the Kingdom you notice that his brother sowed him as a slave and he went in and he started to do some things he worked his way up the ladder and he was there with potiphar and you notice he's in the midst of the suffering on his way to the kingdom and then the Devil comes with pressure and how he responds to this pressure determines his ministry because you notice what happens it was Potiphar's wife the cometh to Joseph it says come lie with me it was pressure that was coming against Joseph but what happened is character prevailed what if he would have went and laid with it with Potiphar's wife he would have been killed once potiphar found out obviously so he could not fulfill his ministry that way come on now follow me but because his character stood strong in the midst of the pressure even though he went through some more suffering he went to the prison but it was because of the suffering that he ruled and second in command next to Pharaoh himself he was the one that was calling the shots during the payment how did he get there through suffering he didn't give up by accident but it was through suffering and his character remains even in the suffering what if he would have lost his character think about it what if he would have lost his character would Jesus been on Earth because his brothers would have died Joseph's brothers would have died because of the famine if Pharaoh if Joseph wasn't in command so think about that because he says that Joseph says if I can get it right what God meant for evil why man meant for evil God turned for good and he says I can't remember how he puts that but life was preserved because of this he wasn't speaking of his own life but the life of Jesus Jesus would not have come I believe it come through Judah he would not have come if Joseph's character would have been marred come on now better with his character prevailing in the persecution that brought life it's your character in The persecution that can bring life that can bring a sustaining power it was his character through the suffering that he can look at us brothers and say I forgive you hum Joseph it was character you can't love you you can't love somebody they'll persecute you without the character of Christ you can't do it it's impossible we look at the world they're full of hate because they've been done wrong but it was the character of God inside of Joseph that says I forgive you and not only come through the suffering I hope you're following catching it this morning this has been something that has been burning strong to me it comes through this suffering the love of God can be expressed if you're hating God in the suffering but it's the love of God can be expressed on the other side of the suffering but it's through the pressure that's getting us out here I'm gonna I got a few more points just bear with me you see what happened whenever the children of Israel was about to leave Egypt the pressure got stronger you notice now the pressure got stronger the Bible says the Pharaoh commanded the task Masters don't get the straw for them let them get their own straw and double their work for the for the day so now they've got to go the Bible says they was going throughout the land of Egypt getting straw for the bricks and they're going to make the same amount of bricks that they would be making if they had the straw for them and so now they've got to go get the straw and make the same amount of bricks for that day that's what Pharaoh said to do how come because it was time for Exodus the pressure was getting stronger you look at Genesis 15 and 13 and he said unto Abram know of a surety but thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs and Shall Serve them and they shall afflict them for 400 years and also that Nation whom they Shall Serve will I judge afterward they shall come out with great substance you notice how the Bible says that he says they're going to go through some pressure but on the other side of the pressure they're not coming out empty-handed they're not coming out with nothing but they're coming out with great substance come on now we're not leaving this in this Exodus with nothing but you're coming out of it with great substance you're going to come out with your character you're going to come out fit to rule the pressure is shown the pressure's upon us but it's the character that's going to Prevail when the pressure is gone when the trials are gone when the sufferings are behind us and the Wilderness season is behind us only one thing is going to remain that is the character that was brought through the suffering God by Vision said there was going to be afflicted by a vision could you imagine that the word afflict means to be occupied oppressed to be put down they were pressured but they said we're not leaving a child behind who are not leaving a child behind the promise says we're coming God with great substance we're not leaving Family behind and that should make your altitude we're coming God with great substance I'm not leaving a hoof behind I'm not leaving my teenagers behind I'm not leaving my young daughters behind I'm not leaving my sons behind the promise is we're coming out with great substance all the how to do was withstand the pressure they had a prophet on the scene that come with the pillar of fire and a message so now they was in position for Exodus all they had to do was wait for the right time and withstand the pressure oh my the prophet was on the scene the God says I'm going to come down until and deliver them he shall Moses with the message the pillar of fire was vindicating that message not all they had to do was withstand the pressure oh and what did we get in this day we had a message that was Vindicated by the pillar of fire it's time for Exodus all you have to do is withstand the pressure don't give in to the pressure If you give in to the pressure The Exodus might happen but if you can withstand the pressure keep your staff in your hand your shoes on your feet it's time for Exodus don't give in to the pressure foreign it was because of the pressure they was under but they started to forget can you imagine I'm sure I went over there was first in in slavery they were probably having the promise in mind we're going to come out with great substance 100 years later we're going to come out with great substance 50 years later no the next generation is like man this is crazy this is a fairy tale there's no promise ain't doing nothing for us we're being beaten the same 200 years later we're being beaten still I'm sure they might have started to forget about the promise of the great substance then all of a sudden 400 years went by and I'm sure there's multiple Generations now and could you imagine all of the elders saying it's time it's time it's time for great substance and I can see the Next Generation oh you're crazy man you've been believing this for 400 years we haven't seen nothing God's forsaken us they were becoming offended but what happened now it's come out of the Wilderness and I'll come out of the desert was a message but the message that broke off every offense we've been believable for a Rapture for years we've been believable for this Exodus for years we've been believing for this body change for years maybe you've become offended because it's taken so long but God sent the message John the Baptist Malachi 4 he sent the messenger to let you know the time is at hand it's time for great substance it's time for The Exodus we're not leaving a hoof behind when did the Supernatural come to the camp of the Israelites when the message came on the scene it was when the message come on the scene is when the Supernatural come on the scene that's when flies come last came water was turned in the blood the message brought the supernatural to restore the strength the restore the confidence in the promise and this message has brought the supernatural so that you can know that beyond a shadow of doubt that the promises of God are yea and a man that the supernatural can break off every offense it can break off every doubts it can break off every unbelief the message has brought the supernatural back into the camp but you notice remember how did they break this how do they break the offenses remember what did John tell Jesus or what did Jesus tell John he quoted the Fulfillment of scripture and that's what broke off the offenses off of John and why did Gia why did Moses do he come to Egypt quoting scripture that God gave to Abraham so he was he wasn't bringing a new message but he was bringing what was already there and using that for a Deliverance God didn't bring a new word in this day he took the original and he broke the seals off of it and says this is the delivering power to the church it's time for Exodus it's time for Exodus oh my just bear with me one one more one more uh one more Point remember the five thousand I was hungry remember this remember that's a simple story but you notice how did they get fed it was whenever Jesus brother Branham says that he says here he took the original five barley Loaves and they begin to break the Loaves and from the original He Made bread it fed 5 000. so what was the sustaining power against the pressure was when Jesus Took the original and he broke it he then a seated it brother random says he didn't create more bread he took the original and whenever he broke it when he broke it that brought forth a sustaining power and you notice how what how did this what was the chain of command you look at Matthew 14-19 and he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass and he took Five Loaves and two fishes and looking up to Heaven blessed and he break and gave the loaves to his disciples and the disciples to the multitude so you see the process it was Jesus who broke the loaves then he gave it to the disciples then the disciples he gave it to the multitudes in my who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof when I looked hopeless when it was beyond hope to see the word John was weeping and he heard an outer say whip not John for the lion of the tribe of Judah has prevailed to open the book and loose the seals thereof and I saw another Mighty angel coming down from heaven with an open book so he did not create another word he took the original word and he broke it to know somebody he took the original word broke the seals off of and watched the Bible say he comes down to earth and now we are to go to the Earthly Angel and say give me the book just like Jesus he broke the bread then he gave it to the disciples then the multitude got the bread from the disciples the mighty Angel come to Earth with an open book that was opened up gave it to the seventh angel and says in the voice of the seventh angel when he begins the sound the mysteries of God shall be known then he commission and says go to the angel and take the open book out of his hand we've been commissioned to go to the original word and partake and that's what's going to withstand the pressure Hallelujah God's taken the original open the seals he didn't bring something new just like Moses then it brings something new he just broke off the offenses and says what the original has is still the same today it's the delivering power and what the book of Acts had is what we got today it's the original Power of Pentecost that is that is prevailing over every pressure is prevailing in every suffering it's prevailing in every Wilderness the original has come with the supernatural hallelujah it's the supernatural that is equipping you to stand against the pressure it was when Jesus broke the bread but the Supernatural come they said Jesus We've Got Five Loaves and two fishes how are we going to feed five thousand he says give me those you can do it nobody's worthy to loosen the seals nobody can do it give it to me I can do it but I'm not going to give them this I'm going to give it to you then you got to give it to them the multitudes has got to come to you then once he broke the bread the Supernatural come and I started to multiply it started it was just enough for that present day it was just enough it was what they needed and my I started to study these things and that just struck me and I saw another Mighty Angel come down descend from heaven with an open book an open booked not a closed book not a book of offenses but an open book to break off offenses now we've been commissioned we've been commissioned Revelations 10 7. but in the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophet the prophets and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth and I went unto the angel and he said and I said unto him give me the little book and he said take it eat it up and it shall make that belly bitter bitter shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey that's you and I that's you and I coming up to the Earthly Angel not saying please can I have the book but no that's my inheritance that's my Deliverance that's that's that that's my inheritance that's my way out of this pressure that's my way out of this that is my Exodus give me the book give me the book that's my Exodus in church take this word it's our Exodus brother random says why don't you take his word for he is the word run into that and you are safe and he said he continues on today today it's always something they got to do they run to a Creed they'll join and unjoy and everything else from one to another but they won't try to take Christ watch him as he vindicates himself that builds up pressure you must let it off just believe his word he says just believe his word that's what lets off the pressure that's what lets off the pressure as the musicians come I was listening to uh letting off the pressure in uh uh 62 513 and I I've heard this multiple times but I was hearing it I was listening to it I was getting ready actually it just it just struck me brother Brandon was saying if you're listening if you're if you listen to that tape towards the end of it you hear Brother Branham he's preaching then it shuts off and I'll be singing and then he explains what happens he says oh Heavenly Father Satan has lost the battle just be patient don't build up don't build up steam standing here preaching on letting off the cell letting off the Steam and Satan thought he could run me from the pulpit get me out of this altar call no Lord in my heart there was something burning saying there's somebody here there's somebody hunting for the rock we thank you Father for the victory when the last person walked to the altar the lights come on he's seen he had lost so he might as well give up the battle and that just struck me thank God for a prophet that wasn't intimidated by pressure he was sitting there preaching he can listen he's preaching he's preaching and it shuts off the power goes off but he continued on preaching he says the devil wanted me to get out of the pulpit because he knew there was somebody here that was needing to get out of the pressure I thought my the devil pressures every service it comes with mind battles he comes with one more to do tomorrow what I'm going to do afterwards and he's trying to pressure you out of your inheritance he's trying to pressure you out of your deliverance the Holy Ghost a renewing a revealing whatever it is it's pressure but brother Branham is our example to press through the pressure so that we can break through and I just love how brother Branham puts that when the last person comes to the altar the lights came back on he realized he had lost and he might as well give up the battle that's why the pressure is so strong right now because he knows the time's almost up it's time for Exodus it's time for a Rapture all the offenses are gone so he's coming with pressure he's turned out the lights we're on the darkest age there's ever been but just be perseverance don't give up don't give up we're not sitting here by accident but the Branham continues on to say it may be very strange father very simple you make things so simple so that we won't error on us love that but because they raced out of their seat and come to onto the invitation Satan tried to keep them from doing it every effort that he could put forth he tried to do it but he lost Satan's putting forth every effort to keep you out of this Exodus but let me say this he's lost the battle maybe he's fighting you this morning trying to keep you from renewing trying to keep you from from being pressurized don't give in to the pressure once you ever become pressurized the pressure won't bother you no more brother Branham says that to become pressurized he says get in my brother my sister get pressurized the pressure won't hurt you when you get inside and get pressurized it's the word he says get in Christ and you won't care what the world says that's what he's trying the devil is trying to keep you from is getting inside of this word of Exodus this is the message of Exodus and he's trying to keep you from it [Music] in my
