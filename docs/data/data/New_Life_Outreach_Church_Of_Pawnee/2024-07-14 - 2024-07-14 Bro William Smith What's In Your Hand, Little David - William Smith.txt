battle is his he just wants us to believe yes and he'll go out fighting for you praise the Lord you may be seated for a moment I uh wanted to give a testimony of the six weeks I've been gone and uh some here knew that the work here just kind of like stopped for a little while and still has stopped and so I went out to minister with brother Dale and um he wanted me to go by a little town called shello to minister to them because they don't have a pastor and so the little brother Craig he called me and uh we went and ministered for them and by the time I got back here I had a real strong burden for them I couldn't sleep um so I came to brother wendle and we talked and uh and so I was supposed to go out there and just preach one service but the lord gave me the opportunity to preach almost every weekend while I was gone except the meeting at brother brother manuels we went there um and um one service I went and they already had somebody there and he was going to councel it and I said no no let him preach I just want to be here with you and so they have asked a lot of questions the Lord did a lot of wonderful things there and January uh July the 7th they asked me if I would be their pastor and so I told them that I'll be back in a couple of weeks to finish some work at my wife's aunt's house and I would come and be with them for a couple of weeks and let them ask questions I can ask some questions each and every one of them had come up to me in the time I was there and asked me if I was going to move here be their pastor and I stayed very neutral as brother Wendell asked me to let God lead this if it's God something will happen if not I could be like in the Bible where the I think it was John and or it was Peter and them sent some of the men that were ministers to a country and they ministered until they got a pastor at that time I didn't know this pool that I had for them but since then my heart has been very heavy for that group and so we're going to go and and uh be with them for for the whole next month until I finish that job and I just wanted you guys to be updated to to know what's going on CU I know there was some here that was wondering why have you been gone so long and uh some of you knew that I wasn't called to be evangelist this 6 weeks of going back and forth from Albuquerque there was 4 hours there and four hours back and I want to tell you my hat comes off of every man that feels that he's a uh a missionary or a guy that goes out and ministers and loves to minister on the road I I couldn't do that very long and so I just wanted you guys to know and to be in prayer for me and uh we just love you guys I want the will of the Lord yeah I'm not brother w at all but I have a a lick of fire in me that I'll do my very best wherever he has me to do if it's here there or where I'll do my part but I just want you all to know that I love each and every one of you some of us have butt heads but I love you guys and I need your prayers this is a very big decision because that little lady that's home right now be praying for Sharon she's her all of her nerves are all tore up about her aunt and uncle and wanted to be there tonight tomorrow and uh and so she's just really having a hard time this evening to move her from a place where she has had security to God putting it on my heart and her heart too that was amazing and so please keep us in your prayers and uh we just love you to and um I can't answer any of you guys's questions anytime out those doors I'll try to answer them but that's all it is at this moment I poured my heart out to them they poured out their heart to me and we'll just see what the Lord has in store for brother William and sister Sharon as I told brother wendle and sister fresa the hardest thing for me is to leave you guys but I know one thing we're only a phone call away 16 hours away will always be a family brother W will always be a leader in my life and you guys will always be my first love as a church I've been a bunch of churches this is the only one I really felt like I was at home and it was you that made that possible and I love you guys for that God bless you if we can just stand and maybe as brother Wendell could just grab that mic and as I'm not a singer just let's just sing only believe for a moment change the the order of the service and uh only believe only believe all things are possible only believe only believe yes [Music] Lord [Music] believe all things are possible [Music] only believe you believe that one more time yes Lord Lord I believe Lord I believe all things are possible Lord I believe yes Lord I believe yes I do Lord Lord I believe all things are possible Lord I believe Hallelujah let's just pray Heavenly Father Lord we just love you Lord Lord we're thankful father God that we have a heavenly father that loved us before the foundations of the world gave us a Bible so that we can read your words and the Holy Spirit can come and reveal it to us Lord the five-fold ministry could preach it but Lord it takes you to come and reveal it to your babes and Lord I just ask you this evening Lord as we heard a masterpiece this morning to take these little words father God and speak to your children Lord L we just love you we thank you in jesus' name we pray amen praise the Lord if we can open our Bibles to Exodus 4 then we're going to go to Ephesians 6 the little church there did want me to say God bless brother Wendell and brother durren and the church and uh they uh was so excited that when they all found out that I come from Brother windle's church and and uh there's one man in this church that's not here this morning or this evening that they really love and that's brother Duren they think a whole lot about brother Duren and his wife and and uh if they could have had their way they wouldn't have never let them get out of Arizona and so but here in Exodus 4 and one it says and Moses answered and said but behold they will not believe me nor hearken unto my voice for they will say Lord the Lord has not appeared unto thee and the Lord said unto him now God speaking to Moses and now we all know that he's up there by the burning bush and now he's telling God that they're not going to believe him but God didn't answer his question listen to this very closely he goes and the Lord said unto him what what is that in thy hand and he said a rod and he said cast it on the ground and he cast it on the ground and it became a serpent and Moses fled from before it and the Lord said to Moses put forth thy hand and take it by the tail and he put forth his hand and caught it and it became a rod in his hand let's go to Ephesians six we all know these these scriptures here many times we've heard including myself many times read this Ephesians 6 I believe this is very important to a believer of God and here in Ephesians 6:10 it says finally my brother be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might put on the whole armor of God that he may be able to stand against the Ws of the devil for when for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against all the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that he may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all stand to stand stand therefore having your loin girded about with truth having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet Shaw with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all take taking the shield of Faith wherewith he shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God Amen you may be seated I would like to take a little thought this evening just kind of what is what is in your hand little David all right what's in your hand little David what's in your hand brothers and sisters he preached this morning morning on the authorities of sons and if you believe that you're a son or a daughter of God and believe that God has given you Authority then there should be something on the inside of you that should know who you are right now all right because today we have complete word of God through a prophet of this age had come to you and I and gave you everything that you need to kill the devil right all right okay now we go back here and we see Moses and he still kept talking to God saying he couldn't do these things okay but then God come back one more time and if you drop down to the 12th 12 verse he said now therefore go and I will be with thy mouth and teach thee what Thou shalt say okay all right so if you and I will just believe what the prophet of God said and read your Bible that is your staff this is your Rod this should be in your hand at all times physically I know you have to work but in the spiritual realm that's where the devil is going to come and attack back your mind to get you off track and so you have to be able to be able to withstand him by the word of God when Jesus was up there on that high mountain he only used the word he never use his power he used the word because the word was proven and if you and I can believe that the word is proven in your mind and drop that down into your heart brothers and sisters Every Chain will have to break so what's in your hand little David it can't be Mama's or Daddy's experience because you go back in the scriptures Moses when he was a little boy his mother knew that he was special yeah all right but that day that he was born the King was killing babies because they was supp to be a deliverer yeah this mother by the inspiration of the Lord inspired her to put this little baby in a basket and let it go down the river now God could have let that baby go down the river to a tribe somewhere and he was been able to be with a tribe they could have taught him how to fight and they could have went back there and F the Egyptians and and and being Victorious but that wasn't the deliver that God was going to use for Israel okay so he let this little baby go down the Nile to go into a place right underneath the enemy and the enemy fell in love with him because the daughter of pharaoh now has a son and the Pharaoh looked at him as a grandson says he will be the heir of my kingdom and so but the mama there gave him back to the real mama yeah he was had an experience with his real mother right he was able to feed off of her she loved him he even got taught about what the Hebrew was and she was telling him who he was but he had an experience of something his mother had all right she had an experience in a living God but he had an experience in what mama said and that ain't going to get you know where you have to have an experience with God Almighty yourself and when you have that experience with God he comes down inside of you and you're a miniature Gods right Hallelujah so 40 years he knew that he was a child of the Hebrews yeah yeah but here was a king a pharaoh that had brought him in and brewed over him and put him into the school and taught him how to be able to speak and do things and how to fight and everything else yeah for 40 years he knew how to go with a with a men and go fight and win battles he knew how to dress nice he knew how to eat right he knew how to speak right he knew everything about the Egyptians but there was something laid down inside of him that one day it might have been a cousin or might have been a friend that that Egyptian was beating on and something on the side of him rose up and he killed that e that Egyptian everything he learned right then was void because now he was a fugitive and Pharaoh was going to come and kill him and the Bible says that he fled to the Wilderness all the power he had was backed up with him if he would have stayed long enough to be payroll he could have been able to let them go and walk free sometimes we go through trials because we do not sit back long enough and let God deal with the situations we do it ourselves and we get ourselves in in hot water and before long we're running to the Wilderness yeah and when we do those things it takes us a lot longer to get around the mountain because we have to get to a place that we're dead Amen to Christ so that Christ can come and live inside of you and that life will motify you it will get you to a place as Jesus was not my will but thy will be done and that's where he's trying to get you and I to place where you and I can believe what brother random says without just saying lips but it comes in life when you walk out that door you will be exactly what you've been preach to all right because now the preaching comes in the manifestation through you all right hallelujah amen and so here he was now it's going to take God another 40 years to get all that trash out of him sometimes we're all sitting here but I've been in the message for 10 years and he's still working on me because of the things I used to do what is it those things have been rooted into you have been born into you of sin and it has to take a God to come in and root all them things out right you take some of these these uh bushes out here that we have yuckers and stuff oh they're easy to pop out of the ground they're dead but when you get a these trees that we got to have Elm trees you can cut them things right out the ground two weeks later new stuff starts growing up you can go in there and chop it off take the big old stump out but you let that roote going down there and one down the road this little stump starts bringing out all right all right it's going to take God Almighty by the prayers of the Saints getting down into their knees and asking God to root out all evil root out everything of unbelief everything out of us so that we will know what's in our hand right sometimes we wonder what can I do yeah what can I do brother Moses was probably standing there but I can't I can't talk like them any I I stutter I'm just a sheep her but there's a time and a place that God's getting us to and when he gets us there you're more than conquerors amen it says you're more than conquerors in Christ Jesus so what are you Sons and Daughters of God brother brand brother wend was saying this morning that sometimes we look in the mirror and we see these things that we're doing and we just feel so bad in things but the prophet of God is taking scripture and he comes back and he says if you repent and the blood is shed upon you red over red is white and when God looks at you you're perfect and so if you want God to look at you perfect get under the blood and if we're under the blood you have the authority and if you have authority absolutely the devil don't have nothing about you now you could do whatever you want in the name of the Lord Jesus and he'll have to do it because he's bound to that name all right because that's a name above all names and he was trying to get Moses to believe and so what did he do after he picked up that Rod it was in his hands but then he looks right at him and says now Moses put your hand in your coat and he puts it in there and he brings it out and it's leprosy and he sticks it back in he goes put it back in he puts it back and it came back to flesh God showed him signs and he says the first sign that they don't believe I'll give them the next sign yeah all right God knows how to wear people out he knows how to defeat the Devil if he can just get our minds completely out of the way and let him have the heart goes back you're more than a conqueror all right but what's in your hand little David what's in your hand Moses had to have an experience with God so that he can have the faith to be an overcomer okay and God was giving him a backside experience in a burning bush because when he looked up at there one day and he saw that burning bush there was something about that that was pulling upon him he had to know and if you stepped on those grounds you would die he had to be something special am if there's a call in you to come up a little higher it's because God's calling you not Satan Satan only wants you to get onto the word so you can be judged but a child of God has been judged on Calvary you just have to believe and when you believe it takes you underneath that blood that you have been atoned by by the presence of God coming into your life then you become Sons and Daughters before the foundations of the world not when you recognize that you was a sinner here you recognize that you are already a son and daughter of God but he gives you the ear of the Holy Ghost to come and live in you just like he lived in that flesh called Jesus Christ amen you'll be able to stand there with your foot on the bow and say peace be still you can change the circumstances when you when you are filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you're reading your Bible every day and you're not letting the devil come in there and mess you up but you're saying get behind me we need to quit playing childish games with the devil yeah we are so far away from this thing when parents and children are arguing all the time there's a lack of the holy spirit in their lives when me and my wife get too much fussy fussy it's because we're not reading that Bible like we should be we're not getting into that message and getting tenderized and getting the love of God living inside of us we forget who we are sometimes we forget who your wife is you forget about who your children are you forget about what Mom and Daddy is that is a god living inside of that flesh and we need to have respect for one another that's why all through the Bible it says love your brother love your sister love these things why because you got something in your hand that's most powerful thing in the world and that's the word of God that's what's going to conquer this world this is what's going to conquer every devil that's in your way and when Moses realized that he was a oneman army Hallelujah he come down off of that mountain and when he came down off of that mountain he got his donkey he put his little wife upon there and he put his two B on our hips and said we're going to go down and tell Egyptians to let my people go all right he went to his father-in-law and he said Daddy I'm sorry but you got to take care of your own sheep God gave me two-legged sheep and I've got to go deliver them okay all right good God has placed it into your life to be a little Moses a little David and it's time for you to go down to Egypt and let all right these Devils know that they can't keep you bound no more right okay all right and so here he is how little how significant what is in your hand today you may not have even a stick in your hand you can testify you can sing or you can pass out tracks you can tell somebody about it whatsoever is in your hand yeah get out and do something about it move let's get going let's get the Revival moving let's fill these seats up get people saved filled with the Holy Ghost get the church built upon up around here on fire all right okay for the last three years I have known God has been speaking about being on fire for God being on on the the power side of God's word and will just sit there sometimes I'm guilty and just sit there like a mule at a gate knowing that that's what prophet of God said knowing that the gifts are there knowing that I'm a Child of God knowing these things but I'll sit there and look at the preacher like a mule at a gate you need to get on fire for God or you're going to be left here we can't be church members we can't be these things we've got to be Sons and Daughters of God we're further than a church building church we are God of a miniature gods that lives inside of you and I we've got to start acting like it well I can't do this cuz God told me not to do those things if that Spirit told you anything contrary to the word of God that's not God he's not going to let you do something and turn right around and say don't do that again all right cuz then he's changing his mind and he's not a changing God we've got to come back to the word of God where's your staff in your hand little little David all right Moses had to be cleaned out for 80 years and then he was in his time so that he can go do what he had to do he had a Crooked Stick how can an 80y old man go down there with an army that has been practicing for years how to use sword and to kill with Spears and horses and chariots and everything else and one word that come out of the mouth of pharaoh he would have been struck dead immediately okay because he knew he who he was because he got the sign the experience that he needed to be a deliverer praise the Lord Lord I'm sorry Church you're not going to be well until you learn to be a deliver over your own self right you got complexes you've got to stand up on God's word I like that quote that you put out this morning You've Got to Believe It When God says you're healed you walk out of there and you say I'm Healed and you keep saying it until you believe it it might take two weeks it might take a year but you keep telling everybody I'm Healed [Applause] don't worry about the circumstances but you stand on the word of God Jesus had to stand on the word of God the day before he got crucified he wanted to not go to Calvary his heart was heavy but he looks down in his hands and he sees your name written in his palms of his hands yeah not my will but thine will be done yes if you believe that God saved your soul yeah and you're obligated to come underneath that word that head chip and let God take control yes of you and if he's got control of you you ain't going to hunker down on the preacher you're not going to hunker down on anything because you already know who you are why would I want to be in the way of God doing something for the church get me out of the way Lord whatever it takes it just takes dying we don't like to die older we get we don't like to die we like to be set in our old ways we can quote unquote brother brand but sometimes our life ain't quoting up with the BR sometimes it's a two-sided mouth talking I believe this but I don't believe this I would be better off if I don't go this way I would rather say brother wendle help me to pray I got it on the Shelf I just don't understand then say well I don't believe it that way cuz there's things in that book I don't understand but I believe it all right because one day he said he'll reveal it to me he said he'll reveal it to me it's not time but what I do know I'm going to do my very best to conquer every devil cuz we are devil Slayers okay hallelujah praise the Lord don't make any difference God told me to take this stick and go down and take over God said so I'm going to do it why it seems like retical but he did it Hallelujah why God takes the radical to prove his power hallelujah amen what is he going to prove that you are Sons and Daughters of God they're going to call you crazy but that craziness is going to prove to them that you're Son of God who cares what they say about you well I don't know if I raise my hand in church man they're going to call me crazy you're crazy if you don't cuz the devil's got you he's got circumstances on you yeah you still got chains on you you don't want to stand up and shout a little bit cuz your knees might buckle down have faith stand up yes Peter and David I mean Peter and uh John when he went to go to pray in the synagogue there's a a beggar there begging for for money he walked up and said silver and gold I have none but what such I have I give to you and he Bible picks him up and holds him until he gets strengthen his legs and then he started praising God leaping and shouting and jumping going into the synagogue praising God I think some of us need to get that experience in our lives again get the fire built back up in our Liv that we can worship God in freeness instead of being under circumstances well my first church don't believe that well that church might be wrong let's go according to the scriptures David didn't even have the Holy Ghost but when the when the Covenant was coming in he took his clothes off and started worshiping God he didn't care what people say he was glad that it was coming back and into the kingdom yes who cares what his wife said he wasn't doing it to show his nakedness he showed that his reverence of God was coming back into the fold so he would have the supreme authority in the Kingdom not David's Kingdom but God's kingdom David was tired of seeing his people getting k killed he wanted peace if you want peace in your mind what's in your hand little David if it's empty you need to find this and get to busy start reading it yes Samson was just a a an ordinary man he wasn't all biffed up like the movies bring him up he's not he's not the Rock rock is a guy that buildt his muscles up and made him million millions of dollars because he's all big and goodlooking seeing Elvis Presley he's going to re be right beside Elvis Presley if he doesn't get his life right yeah but Samson was a little man God don't need big things he just needs a heart that he can do something with and the Phil Ines were coming and they he couldn't he wasn't a fighter but he looked down and he saw a bone of a donkey and he picked it up and the spirit of the Lord fell upon him and he slain a thousand Philistines it's impossible to do that by yourself but he did it because he believed in a God that could do it Hallelujah glory to God praise be to God what is it Hebrews 11 and6 but without faith it's impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that go to the grocery store and buy groceries he will reward them because they're going to go do something good for the community no he says and that he is reward of them that diligent seek Him and when you seek him he's going to give you power what's in your hand little David what's in your hand well I don't know can you sing can you testify come on is there anybody in here that has never been saved yet if not let's get it done so you have a testimony you can tell somebody about so every one of you are sitting here that you have a testimony are you giving your testimony out every day are you seeing these little women you're seeing these men with faces drawing down to hair are you look at I'm and say hey I know how to make you happy that bottle that you're getting ready to go into ain't going going to make you happy it's going to give you a headache tomorrow but I know a Jesus that's lit me on fire took that same desire that you had out and placed himself in me and today I got joy unspeakable and full of Glory I don't have to live under a box no more I live in the Kingdom of Heaven because I have created a mountain I created an atmosphere that I am living in Hallelujah why because there's something down deep inside of me that's pulling because it's getting me on fire I was at brother Dale's on a Wednesday night and he does he has about aund and some people that come to his church on Sundays a lot of them live far away this one family only lives four or five blocks away never comes on Wednesdays but they showed up on Wednesday that night and I'm preaching and I have these same glasses on I can't see you guys with these glasses these are all fuzzy like how it is right now got to have this for my my regular glasses are falling apart on me so I'm just preaching and all of a sudden these glasses just opened up and I can see those two and he's just standing there sitting there and she's just tears running down on her face I didn't know their problems D didn't tell me nothing I said the reason why you have a face that you have is because you don't enjoy coming to church I said when you feel that there's something wrong in your experience with God you need to come to God and be in church and let God give his love to you he perked up and from that point on he just kept his eyes right on me and I kept preaching kept preaching kept preaching brother Dale said that he text him that evening while we were sitting in the gr at the place to eat and he said brother William that brother told me that he said you lit a fire underneath him all right 3 days later my sister text me and Sharon together and says there was a couple in our church that never comes on Wednesday nights they came Wednesday night when you came they said that they're never going to miss a church service again because that guy had to have an experience and when he got that experience something changed and when I went back and preached on a Wednesday night when there hardly anybody there he was standing back there with the biggest smile upon his face you could see the chain taken off of it and he was sitting there worshiping God Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever signs will follow them that believe I saw lots of signs following that man because he gave up and let God take over his life amen hallelujah don't be bound to the circumstances Church Moses was bound to circumstances until God showed him who he was Saul was bound to circumstances because he let L do something to him and he lost his hair his his power but one day when he got his power back he wanted to get out of that circumstances he said One More Time Lord one once more once more Lord and that day he killed more Philistines than he did in his whole life he gave his life to do what he was born and that was to kill Philistines Hallelujah diligently means doing something thoroughly and well with great care that's what diligent means we got to take these scriptures and really find a meaning of what it means David it was a little boy sitting out there in the taking care of his daddy's sheep every day he's taking care of his sheep and one day a a bear comes and he he what a great shepherd He was grabs one of his sheep and he leaves the 99 he goes get that one little sheep and he kills that bear with a slingshot and then another day here comes a lion he takes off with a a sheep he leaves a 99 and he goes and gets that sheep back and kills that lion all right now in this country where the where his brothers were fighting for the King Saul Jesse tells him say son take this bread take this this this this cheese and go see how your brothers are doing tell them that I love them tell me what's going on this little sheep her didn't have just an experience of Daddy's sheep he got the experience that these sheep is my responsibility and when he took that on his responsibility he protected him with his life you've got to protect that soul with your life yeah the only life that's going to protect it and that's the Holy Ghost and so here he goes and here's this big big old giant Goliath making his boast but what happened was he boasted one time in the ears of David and David couldn't stand it he love God and He Love Israel he says who is this uncircumcised Philistine cursing God looking around find where are my brothers where's the Army at and they're all hiding behind trees David come over here what's your problem go out there and kill this man you're bigger than I am why can't you go out there sh David David David don't get that guy mad yeah where's King Saul at where's the king well he's over there on the other side of them rocks in his tent shaking in his boots yeah but don't tell him he'll cut my head off oh take me to him I'll go kill this Philistine oh David you you need to go back to your daddy get back under his SKT go take care of them sheep you're just a boy he made enough Ruckus that Saul heard it he looks up this sa and Sal oh I'll go kill this Philistine for you this uncircumcised devil I'm a Slayer I don't need to worry about anything I got thus sayith the Lord behind my name I'm anointed yeah yeah oh I admire this little David but man that guy's been in War battle Wars and he knows how to throw that that thing 3540 yards and he's dead on he'll kill you yeah well you're above the above everybody's shoulders why aren't you out there anointed king yeah yeah all right David here put this armor on you because you don't need it he throws it off because he never proved that all right but he had a sling in his hand yeah he goes listen to me that Philistine ain't nothing I killed a bear because it took one of my sheep and I killed it with this [Music] slingshot I killed a a lion that stands 5 foot tall and his head is about this big around and I slew it with this sling shot yeah and that boaster this day he will die there he goes first thing he goes he goes off into a river and gets Rock he goes up there and he stands that boat says oh you little this is all you're going to give me you're making fun of me I will kill him and feed him to the birds he stood right there and saids this day you will die Israel needed a new champion this world needed Jesus we were Bound in the circumstances of sin and God had to come down through his son and he had something in his hand and it was a book of redemption and he come to take you and I home you boasted enough Satan today you're going to die you're going to be powerless because I am going to die and I'm going to raise up on the third day and I'm taking your to and so then David goes out there says come on little Boer and David starts swinging that that sling and about about the time that man starts getting up he lets it go yeah one spot that he did not put something there oh yeah Rock of Ages slammed him right there in the head Glory he falls down and David didn't have a knife but he went over to the enemy and he used the enemy's knife to cut himself cut the devil's head off not himself cut the devil's head right off Israel started screaming that something in the congregation the fire started building up and they came running out with their Spears in their hand and they said let's go and they went out and they killed those Philistines that day and he come back with proof that he was the anointed one and he brought that head and he threw it in front of Saul he said this day God won the battle so now David Little David what you got in your hand well I'm not a preacher but William but you are a singer sing with all thy Hearts I can't preach brother William that's all right brother Mike tell your testimony buddy every time you tell your t testimony the devil goes why because it is experience between you and God and he can't take that away so what's in your hand little David I pray to God that it's this and if it's in your hand then you're going to believe and you'll get that fire built up in you don't matter how old you are because when they crossed that Red Sea it was an 80 something year old woman or 90 year old woman that was running down with a tambourine in her hand she had Victory all right the chains were broken and the devil was in the sea you're Slayers tonight you're a Mighty Men of valer don't let nobody in this message say that you're not a soldier of God you are a soldier of God you're going to have Battle Scars but those Battle Scars are going to bring a fire underneath you knowing that he was with you in every battle amen amen that's why David could stand there and say I can kill that Philistine because he had an experience with that slingshot and he know he was good at it cuz he trusted in that God would make sure that that rock would hit him right where it need needed to be so he can cut his head off praise be to God goath made his boast when that fell in David's ear it killed him because it took the right man for the right job and those there at the Baptist Church ain't the right people it's those that have came to Malachi 4 that turned the hearts of the people back to the original Faith at Pentecost and you're going to have the same signs that they had you don't have to boast you can walk up to somebody say silver and gold I have none and grab them by the hand and say get up and walk in the name of Jesus and if you have thus sayith the Lord in your life it didn't say that this person has to have faith brother Brown says they you can sit down he didn't ask them if he had faith in Jesus or God he didn't ask him if he was a Believer right he just said I don't have silver and gold but what I have I give unto thee and he grabbed a h of him and brought him up in the name of Jesus and he got his strength in his legs Peter isn't no no better than you are he's just a Son of God but he knew who his maker was do you all right we've got to come to the complete word that word has to be completed in you I know we're all on different steps but we should be striving to get at the top we should be striving to step down one and grab somebody else and help them up yeah amen you can't leave all the load on him you can't leave all the load on these other preachers you've got to eat the book yourself and I think sometimes I wonder if we're eating the book like we're saying we got brother brandham quotes just for ourselves but we got to take all the quotes that's why we got marriage and divorce all fouled up because they only take the marriage and divorce tape that's it but you got to go all the way back when he first started talking he never changed his mind she can't he can only under fornication bottom line but we got people in this message who preaching that's been married two or three times they're messed up in this church don't be deceived Church stick with the word brother Adam never came off of this right here Jesus said it wasn't so at the beginning so if it wasn't so at the beginning it's not so now cuz he's an unchanging God and so when he said I died for you you can take that to the bank and sign it and cash it in you're sick this morning cash it in you'll be healed in the name of Jesus Hallelujah why what's in in your hand little David not circumstances but it has to be Faith thy sword in thy hand this is the rod this rod in you can conquer every devil praise the Lord in your life this can conquer sickness cancer unbelief this will even give you salvation this will give you Joy this will teach you how to live right this will help you with your finances this will get you to love your pastor and not talk about him this will let you love your brother if because he's an oddball you still love him we've got so many things in our life that we want to condemn everybody except ourselves and we got sin in our own life what's in your hand little David David didn't have sin in his life that's why he was Victorious but when he did have sin in his life God corrected him and he repented that shows he had character of God in him Moses fouled up he didn't get to Cross Jordan he got to see it but God had take him right we got to come to a place in our life that Jesus Christ is everything to us prise the Lord because I'm can tell you something you go get a extension cord and stick your finger in the end of it and stick to the other end of the other that electricity is going to make you go that word should do the same thing to you I'm sorry it should and I might only fired up because of what happened I seen when I was gone for six six weeks I'm fired up because I see the time it's getting close and I want to get out of here I want to get myself out of the way so that God can reign in my life Hallelujah I don't want to be your stumbling block I want to get totally out of the way how Hallelujah I want to get to a place that God is everything to me Hallelujah what's in your hand David he said a slingshot what's in your hand today Church the opening of the word it tells me who I am it tells me where I'm going it told me where I come from it's telling me where I'm going Satan you have been de feated in the name of Jesus Christ Hallelujah glory to God Psalms 1 44 and 1 it says blessed be the Lord my strength which teaches My Hands to War and my fingers to fight yeah my goodness and my Fortress my high tower my deliver my shield and he is whom I trust Hallelujah huah when God promised anything God is under obligation to take care of his promise God always will back it up I don't care what anybody says about it when God says it so it so rest your soul body and strength on it because God is obligated to his word First Timothy 6 and12 it says fight the good fight of Faith lay hold on eternal eternal life where unto thou are also called and hath professed a good profession before many witnesses samgar I'm almost done here's little B in the Bible little Shamar a little farmer just a a man that just every year would get this crop and he'd get his crop in and about that time 600 Philistines would come big old fat things and take off with his food year after year brother B call him fat go look it up all right so one year he gets it all stored up and he gets it all ready and he's in the house yeah and he's hearing these Footprints foots and his little girl looks out the window says Oh Daddy we're not going to have food this year this winter he looks over and his wife is in tears crying in agony knowing that they're going to be starving all winter long the hard work my husband did now they're coming but something Rose in him something at that moment he caught a glimpse of what God did for him he realized that he was circumcised he knew knew that he was a Israelite he says I'm not a fighter I don't have time to go fight and and learn how to fight so he did the very best thing he could is believing God will take the devil and he goes and he gets the ox I can't even say the word b b a r b o b a o d yes and that's a a stick that they used to pry cows through and beat off the stuff off all the equipment and stuff very heavy big old nut on the back of it he grabs a hold of it and brother Brown says he gets angry he ain't angry of God he ain't angry of his people but he's angry of the devil coming in and stealing his his his treasure his stuff that would feed his children and feed his wife and make a little living yeah and the Bible says he went out and he killed 600 Philistines that day because God come on the scene and anointed him to kill his enemy if God could do that in the Old Testament he'll do it today in the spiritual realm you are down with circumstances chained down it's time to grab the ox and start fighting you don't have to come up here and let brother wend fight for you he's preached and he's preached what you need grab a hold of it and believe put it in your hands and fight fight with all that's in you and believe that the enemy will be smoting amen hallelujah don't let the devil come over and take the glory of God out of the church he's already did it to the church ages but today he's restored that Joy let's get it back into our hearts don't let it just be preached and let words just fly out grab a hold of them put them into your bosom and let it go to the heart and let God come down and take over and watch the power of God come through and you will be another acts in the Bible because I believe the prophet of God said that we are more than conquerors because he saw it in the scriptures and he wanted to make sure that you and I knew that that means you that's why he kept repeating it that's why he kept repeating these things because he wanted to make sure that you knew who you are praise be to God what's in your hand he just had an ox and what happened 600 Philistines laid on the ground dead and he was able to eat that winter and his little girl got fat and sassy and those Philistines rotted up and went to nothing all right it's time to put the devil in his place it's time to take your joy back it's time to take your salvation your presence of the Lord in your life take it and make him suffer for it by cutting his head off and let him bleed out kill that devil you've got mind battles you need to kill that devil so he can't come back you kill that devil and that other devil over there he's crying back he won't even want to come to he'll go into some swine somewhere why is those pigs smarter than us when Jesus went to that man and he cursed them Devils they went into those swines and them swines had more more intelligence than we do and ran off the cliff and died cuz they didn't want those Devils but we'll sit there and take them all day long Oh Me Oh Me yeah oh Oh Me Oh I got heart problems no I'm Healed in the name of Jesus cut that devil's head off Mark 16 I couldn't stop without reading this Mark 16 And1 17 and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if any they drink any deadly thing it shall not harm them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover if you're really a Son of God or a daughter of God and you are focused into his word you won't let one person go by you without praying for them when we pray put things on this pulpit and we need to be praying you will be diligently praying for them while I was gone I never not one day did not go all day without thinking about you and praying for you because I I love you when I say I love you I love you yes I know there's a lot of people I love you I love you they don't really mean it right cuz soon as you walk by they running their mouth I do run my mouth on my knees saying oh devil you leave my pastor alone you leave his wife alone you leave the song leaders alone you leave the sisters alone you leave my brothers alone you leave the children alone you leave them alone you are a defeated f why cuz there's something burning on the inside of me that I have to you're a part of the body yes I can't live without my big toe well I could but I walk funny the church needs to quit walking funny if you're the big toe start acting right all right well I don't want to tell you what I am well if you're the bottom of the foot walk right grab a hold of the dirt help you move that body closer in the presence of God praise be to God you love him amen whatsoever is in your hand pick it up go to slaying the devil from one side to the other amen and you'll find out that the feathers will go flying and the devil will be defeated and you'll come forth whole again amen Hallelujah last scripture as the musicians come 1 Corinthians 2 and 4 and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom but the demonstration of the spirit of the power that your face should not stand in the wisdom of man but in the power of God Jesus received up into heaven and the last commission he ever gave gave to the church was to heal the sick the first commission he ever gave the church was heal the sick he chose his 70 and his 12 and sent them out and gave them power against unclean spirits to cast out

message every day but if your prayer life is not where it needs to be it's just you're not going to grasp anything anyways it's all head knowledge it's all but desire comes from the heart and desire for prayer desire for a closer walk with God you know a church WIll Thrive and it's up to every one of us as far as even our little local assembly here it it's it's up to the individual whether we want a thriving Church the presence of God is is Flowing or joy is in the camp when the word is being preached our homes we we we operate that through our relationship with the Lord so relationship is not coming to church that has nothing to do with relationship that's right amen that's we learn we we worship him we give that honor to him we learn from him but that's not relationship relationship is what we're doing on a daily basis it's what we're doing when we get up in the morning times when we're going to bed at night relationship is as I was you know mentioning here this morning getting here early how long has it been since you got down on your knees just got down on knees and pray relationship you and God bowing you're you're your knees in humility and and and sometimes you get you get where your knees are or a little creaky you know I've got that arthritis in these old knees and joints and so sometimes I just have to set on the ground but your way of bowing yourself your heart before the great God that's what that's why we bow our heads we're showing respect that's why we we we do what we can to express our love to [Music] him and and as we uh as we as a congregation meet together here where where we are collective the joy in the camp the power in the camp depends on what we are in our relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ and I I say I say today there's got to come that there's got to come that something within us where we're like that as as brother William had said amen uh we're where the the man says enough's enough you're not taking my beans anymore my lentil whatever it is amen I'm I'm I'm going to take what's in my hand amen I'm not looking for something Beyond me I'm not looking for something I I've got something I can do and there's one thing I can do I can keep my relationship up with God that's one thing I can do I might not have a a a singing Ministry or a playing Ministry or or anything else but what's in my hand amen we've got the weapon of prayer that's something that is in every believer's hand and Prayer Changes Things relationship with the Lord changes things can you say Amen so we want that kind we we want that [Music] amen I'm I I want Power in in my life and the way I get that power in my life is through that relationship that that dying out to self that calling unto God Amen and and and amen walking alone with god oh yes that's that's a that's that's a secret weapon right there amen the enemy coming in and Ain stealing my time and prayer no more you ain't taking my joy no more I'm going to mark it down from this not

Victory back from me again can I hear it amen amen I want that you see because as a collective body we're made up of individual Overcomers so the church collectively is an overcomer when there is our
