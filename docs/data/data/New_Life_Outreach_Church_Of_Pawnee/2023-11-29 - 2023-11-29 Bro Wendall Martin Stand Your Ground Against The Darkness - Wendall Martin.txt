body change we've got a millennium we're going to folks and uh it won't be too much longer praise the lord well we won't keep you standing let's go ahead and look here in in the book of St John I actually I'm want to I'm want to read two scriptures one out of St John and one out of First John and both of them's in chapter one and um amen we're um going to uh Minister tonight on a on a on a little thought stand your ground against the darkness amen St John 1:14 it says and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth amen I also want to look here at 1 John 1 And1 that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life for the life was manifested and we seen it and bear witness and show unto you that eternal life which is with the father and was manifested unto us let's go to the Lord in prayer Lord we are so thankful to to you today for your blessings thank you for your healing virtues Lord that when we're feeling a little little under the weather that your presence is there to help us we're so thankful Lord that you help our help us as Mortals Lord and and you understand our weaknesses and you're there to give us the strength and we're just asking Lord that you would be with everyone tonight that is feeling a little under the weather I pray Lord that you would be with us here tonight as we Endeavor to speak your word ask Lord that you would give me the words and help me to say only what you would want me to say and that you would cause our ears to hear you Lord father we Look to You Lord you you see my dad's family my my aunt and Lord I I pray pray that you will be with her and be with their children and grandchildren tonight Lord I pray your presence would be with them in a real in a real special way and just ask Lord that they would know that you are with them Father we thank you for the promises of eternal life in your word in Jesus name we pray can the church say amen and amen God bless you you may be seated I um I want to uh speak here a little bit this evening and and actually it's we're going to deal a little bit with with the um um with the dress code and um uh coming at it a little bit different way but maybe um as we as we have been a little bit on Ministry uh I I want to um Minister a little bit this evening on on um on how that um dressing our our dress is a testimony of the um of of the land that we came from it's a testimony of the Holiness of God and and CU all of us want something to do for the Lord and and I think we we all do I I I want to be about the father's business and um and so a as we uh think about this here tonight my title standing your ground against this this evil age of darkness and and we may not be Jesus amen he was the light of the world but then he turned around and said you're the light of the world and so though you may not be you're you're not Jesus none of us are claiming to be Jesus but yet each of us are reflecting his light and his power amen the scripture says uh there in in Isaiah the the 60th chapter arise Shine for thyl has come and the glory of the Lord the es uh the the the eso in amen is risen upon you and darkness shall cover the Earth behold gross Darkness the people but the Lord is risen upon you the moon amen you're the we're we're a type of the Sun and the Moon Sun being Christ Moon being the church amen and His glory shall be seen upon you and and so amen it is with the ministry of the Moon brother brandham would say the moon and the son is husband and wife and while the son is going away it is it shows its light against the moon to give us a smaller light until the sun comes and when the sun comes uh when when the sun comes let's see um the moon Fades out and Christ is the sun who's gone to glory and shining on the church with the same light the same kind of light he shined when he was here and the church is the light of the world until Jesus comes and it all melts together like the Moonlight and the sunlight become one light when it emerges together when Christ and his church comes together at the great Millennium then they emerge into one praise the Lord so amen we we have a a great call it's a great purpose and I say today in in the in in this hour of Darkness it is it is time for the moon to persevere amen don't be overcome by Darkness amen but you overcome amen the world in spite of the darkness because the people need you they need that reflection they need to know the Eternal land they need to know that there is someone that believes the Bible and that the Bible is still has the power of God under salvation I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ for it is the power of God under salvation and so you as the believer you reflect the power of God by reflecting his light amen you reflect it through through through your lifestyle you know Peter said there in Acts 2 and 40 amen there at the end he said save yourselves from this onward generation in other words save yourself from amen this this this generation of sin but then there in in the book of uh 2 Peter 3 and 3 it says knowing this first that there shall come in the last days scoffers and these scoffers are going to walk after their own lust and they're going to say that God doesn't mean what he what he meant and and and their love for truth is not going to be where it is but the but the but this the church has got a greater responsibility that when the church nominal uh H uh forsakes the word and loses their light that is the greatest opportunity for the bride of Christ to reflect her light to this dying generation amen I think today your responsibility is greater in this day than it has ever been before amen the responsibility of light is greater in this day the scripture says because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold amen but he says but he that endureth to thee the end shall be saved and then he says and the gospel the of the Kingdom shall be preached and in all the world for a witness unto all nations and then shall the End come and so there's where we are iniquity is bounding amen the love for the gospel is not there anymore Hallelujah but we've got to endure and shine that light now when you think about iniquity amen how is it that that that what what does iniquity mean is that brother Brandon would say it's not just a sinner out the road but really uh iniquity is is is really applied to the church because you know to do something and you don't do it amen and and he said it many places but here he says David said if I conceive iniquity in my heart God will not hear me see iniquity is some something you know that you ought to do and you won't do it you know better but you won't do it it's iniquity amen he says it's right before you that you shouldn't do it and that is Iniquity so so here we stand today in in this when it's so dark amen it's dark in the regular world and it's dark in the Christian world Amen because the light has been forsaken not just by those Sinners out there but it's been forsaken in the church in the church nominal amen and so we we see that amen there in 1 Timothy 4:1 it says in the latter times or the spirit speaketh expressly that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith 2 Thessalonians 2 and 3 let no man deceive you by any means but that day shall not come except there be come a falling away first so we can see here today that this gross Darkness amen it it is covering denominations it's covering uh Nations it's covering it there's it doesn't matter whether you're rich you're poor it doesn't matter whether you're a preacher whether you're a saint amen this darkness is covering the world and if there's ever been a time that we need the ministry of light this is the day to shine amen hallelujah amen he says now he says the prophet has said Gross Darkness upon the people and the people of the world gross Darkness have you noticed in the last few years some of you men and women around my age and how each year it seems like darker and darkness comes more and more I was speaking about this the other day and my wife you know it seems like as the years go on it just seems like the people begin to get further and further away from the real thing and and that they should be getting closer and closer to I notice men I look at on the streets and and among them women and and what's their desires and what they like to do and they're changing attitudes all the time men are becoming more like women women are becoming more like men and it seems there's no way to stop it across the nation preaching against the thing and and come back the next year and it's worse than it was when I started them people want to do right but there's something about it that won't let them do right just presses down on them forces them it's like a heavy dark fog upon the whole church or the whole earth not only in Phoenix but all over the world there seems to be just a groping Darkness that's Gathering amen Gathering more dense and dense all the time just smothering out the real manhood the real Womanhood I'm talking in in the natural now and it comes more and more in the churches and then when you raise up and say something against it then they condemn you for it and and you can you can see it coming and then when you speak against it somebody misunderstands it sometimes women understands it men misunderstand it and they take the wrong attitude and Men sometimes good men have to cope with such things in order to hold their life in the religious ranks that they belong to it's because they're excommunicated and then they're on their own and and so brother bradam was saying as a prophet he he could say this Darkness he could he could say this PR ing against the people Amen to to come under its pressure come under its form but brother we are not of the night we're not of the darkness amen we are of the light we're Children of the light can you say amen amen and God loves to test his people Amen brother Brandon would say and when the but when the testing of his word is over then we are taken up to this body that was prepared for us before the foundation of the world it is the word there that we skip that we could come by and be tempted and tested so I want to speak here tonight the importance amen of reflecting that Holiness amen and I think the greatest thing that we could do is to reflect it accurately as as the scripture gives it to us how many believ that's right amen we we talk about the morning star and amen and how how it's the brightest right at the dark right at the at the darkest of night amen it gets really dark before the be before the breaking of day and then that that that morning star begins to come out and I love the way brother Brandon puts it he says it hails it hails the arrival of the oncoming son amen it declares hang on because the new day is coming the new day is around the corner can you say amen and I believe the anointing that is is in this bride is declaring the S so n is coming I believe the anointing of the day I believe when you shine your light at the grocery store you are declaring the light is coming amen I when you when you shine your light on on the job you are declaring Jesus is coming we need to declare it more than we've ever declared it we should declare that Jesus is still alive he's in his bride and a physical return of Jesus Christ is coming Amen brother brenon would say what is it the Morning Star the Church of the Living God today who's the Watchman in in on the tower warning the Nations and the people it stands alone a man that stands for God stands alone what's he doing he's reflecting the same light of the Sun that went down years ago and is rising again what is that true Church's Ministry the ministry of that church will be the ministry of the son because it's reflecting the same power the same sunlight that the world will know that J that the sun rises what it'll look like I want to say I'm glad for this ministry I'm glad for this call I'm glad to be able to tell people that Jesus is coming and I have an authority to do so I I I believe every one of us amen should be laboring under the anointing of the Holy Spirit I believe our lives should be reflected amen otherwise our our our labors are in vain amen I believe that we should we should we should be thankful for the ministry I I I believe every time that amen you you you you ladies are are fixing your hair amen and wearing decent clothing and you men are amen not looking feminist and you know refusing to put the skinny jeans on and and and those kinds of things and and and and you know you you you should be thankful that that you this day are reflecting the Holiness of God it the decency of God the the attributes of God in this dark world Amen now now you can you can do those things I know a lot of people that can that that can look holy amen but if they haven't got the Messiah light flowing through them amen you know they they they uh brother Brandon put it I like the way he put it he says uh amen they look pretty all on the outside but yet Amen on the inside they they got a temper that that that that could fight a buz saw you know well that's not what we're wanting amen this is not something that is a religious act to us we want to reflect the gospel in the purity of the Holy Spirit flow through me Holy Spirit flow through me can you say Amen except the Lord build the house they that labor labor in vain except the Lord builth a wall they that build it build in vain can you say Amen so we are to flow with God and his plan amen because his plan is already set in stone and the willing and the obedient will eat the good thereof now what kind of a witness are are are we to be I think if there's ever a time for some holy looking folks on without looking like weirdos I I think I think Now's the Time sir Now's the Time To Shine now can you say Amen if there's ever been a time for you sisters to accurately represent this message it's now right and that's something that you need to you you you need to look at yourselves as you're doing so are you are you are you are you representing the message amen as the prophet brought it to us or are we are we are we so close to the world that they don't really know yeah you're wearing your dresses but amen that looks a lot like theirs and yeah you're not wearing your lipstick but you're wearing the glossy stuff just like theirs and no you're not wearing your your fing nail polish but but yes you are polishing your fingernails amen with that clear stuff and yes you are painting your lips with that clear stuff and yes you are amen uh uh uh wearing those tight skirts amen like they do that is this really what the prophet brought to us are we really reflecting Christ the way God wants it or are we just another version of worldliness praise the Lord Brother Brenham taught us how to dress he says we're still have those long flowing skirts not short and form fitting can I hear an amen he taught us that we're to wear the low or the not the low blouses the loose blouses not the low cut the form fitting amen the tight well praise the Lord you see brother Wendell I want to know how long is long you know we we need to know how long is long I I I just want to say you know just get the dresses away from your knees amen and and and and get them flowing a little bit so you could come down and sit in this church or in this chair right now amen you could come down and sit in this chair and there wouldn't be anybody looking up your skirt come on well praise the Lord amen I I I think it's and I I I love our ladies around here they are so modest I mean they wear their they you know they they wear their their their blouses all the way up to here and anytime that they'll lean down to do something in front of a man have you noticed all of our ladies you may notice this they they they always cover themselves as they're doing that what are they doing they they've got some virtues on the inside of them that's right and you girls need to understand those virtues that your mama's got on the inside of her man these these these these these these blouses that you know that that that you wearing amen and leaves leaves a little bit of leaves a little bit of guessing and a little bit of amen and and and and that all that is is flirtatious all that is is inviting something that is taking a man that is trying to be a Son of God in the church amen and and it and it causes him to have to go out and and and pray when he when this should be the safe place this should be a Haven of Rest amen let me fix myself back up here hallelujah all right amen so so you know where where are we amen what what are we doing where are we at you know someone asked me the other day and I appreciated it brother W what do you think about a nexist and and uh and I thought that's that's very nice for a for a girl to ask H about a necklace and and and and and and and brother brandham says well you know if if your if your daddy or your your your uh your boyfriend or husband wanted to get you a a little necklace well I I don't see that that you know that maybe there's not too wrong much wrong with that and and and and and and you see a wedding ring would be okay but a ring on every finger and a Gody necklaces all over the place you see what what are we at expressing what are you girls expressing to the world when we've got a message well praise the Lord now come on sister because you've can testify without ever saying a word over the years you know Sister Key's working and and she'll talk to freska and me you know about this one and that one that she's working for and and and and almost every one of them almost everyone that she has worked for and is currently working for amen they they they stop they ask her why she believes what she believes almost every one of them and and and she has just taken them right back to scripture and says well this is what the scripture says she's able to witness without ever saying a word because and someone tells me that the men well the poor women don't have a Ministry dear God you've got more of a Ministry than I spend do if you're willing to do it the way God want you to do it can you say Amen you are to reflect amen you're Heavenly bridegroom praise the Lord but the anointing will only rest upon the gentle nature and a gentle nature will always submit unto God that's now we can't expect amen you know if you're Gruff and stickery all the time and you're easily irritated and your bird and amen you always got to bur under your saddle and you got to correct everyone that that that that that SLS you the wrong way and that's the opposite of a lamb's nature that's the opposite of you know I got you they done me that oh dear God when are we going to grow up and let love Prevail amen when are when can we Overlook someone's faults someone's failures and let love Prevail in our lives I'm not talking on the women on that one I'm talking to you men can you say Amen you see don't expect the gentle Dove to rest upon a wild nature of a wolf that's right that's all the time all the time well you miss you're missing you're missing the lamb is self-sacrifice icing right squirrels can run up into a tree rabbits can hide in its den foxes can go to its Halls amen horses can kick wolves can can bite dogs can bite but sheep they have no protection that's right they're depending on a shepherd that's right their life is in the good Shepherd's hands right and that way the home is peaceful their heart is peaceful everything's peaceful well praise the lord well that was free amen now we brother Brandon would say we find out that this lamb simple he must be led look at the Lamb of God Here Comes Here Comes the dove coming from the lamb coming to the Lamb of God the dove is the most meekest bird of all Heavens the lamb is the meekest animal of all the Earth one of them is of the Earth the other one is of the heaven the lamb is Earthbound and can't fly the dove flies in the heavens one of them was Christ representing Christ the other was represented God now you see the lamb he's the innocent substitute he must be clean he must be innocent to be a substitute now the dove must also be of the same nature of the Lamb or they can't dwell together and that's the reason sometimes that we get get all mixed up is because we got one kind of a nature wanting the dove to dwell on us now when the Dove came down and lit on the lamb what it uh uh what if the lamb would have snorted like a wolf you know what it would have happened the dove would have took its flight right now certainly he would he couldn't have stayed down there he he couldn't have because it must be the same type of Nature and if you want to be a Christian you've got to be a lamb if you're going to be a lamb you've got to get away from your own thoughts and just let the Holy Spirit do the leading why certainly amen now how many knows the Bible says those that are the led by the spirit of God these are the sons of God the Sons and Daughters of God brother bam says when the dove come come down from heaven was the meest of all birds came to the meekest animal all the Earth and Heaven and Earth kissed each other Heaven and Earth was United together man and God was reconciled in one body the Lord Jesus Christ certainly it was it was the god of Heaven in the form of a dove the Son of God in the form of a lamb and the dove come down upon the lamb and it abod upon him never just come down and lit and when way it stayed there it was satisfied and the lamb was satisfied to have the dove look at him being led of the father not my own will the father's will that sent me I come not to do my own will but the of him that sent me he says now the lamb can't lead itself but we call ourselves the God's lambs and we want to figure our own way out I'm going to see I'm going to see if I can stand that this or that or not you you you try to figure out on your own way and as soon as the dove comes and lights on you you try to figure out your own way and how you're going to do this and how you're going to do that and God can't lead you anymore so the dove just takes her flat can you say Amen so the characteristics of God's Lambs are what willing Hearts I think this is the greatest thing this to me is the is the key it's the key to Ministry it's the key to anything with God's word because it's coming at one it's coming to a mature where you are understanding why God puts things in his Bible it's you coming to the place where you trust God over your own and you're saying all right amen there's a reason you've said this there's a reason we're doing this there's a reason you're not a kid anymore he well can you say amen amen I remember when I was growing up you know uh uh all the girls all the girls I mean they they you know or most of them I biggest majority of them amen they had their pants in their in in in their in their purses Back Then They Carried suitcases for purses and uh man theyd carry those things and so they put their pants on as soon as they got out of the house uh uh they see and then when they was back around everyone else they they they all look pretty good and and and but see that what what good is that what good is that but see understanding that there is a Ministry that is involved here and and and it's not you just looking at the preacher and say skip you and it's not you looking at brother Bram and saying well you know I you know he's not here and I'm sure he would he would he no no no no you're missing the spirit that you're entertaining and if you don't follow God's word the Bible says there in Jeremiah the 17th chapter is it the 20th verse uh uh the heart is the most deceitful amen I I you know uh uh uh Jeremiah 17 maybe it's nine uh eight 10 you can't trust your own heart you've got to trust you've got to trust God's word did you find it the heart is deceitful Above All Things amen yeah who can know it so how are you going to know your heart he tells us the next verse so I try your heart I the Lord search the heart I try the rain I am seeing who's in control of that heart even to give every man according to his ways according to the fruit of his doing so he he wants wants us not to just do this legalistically but he's wanting to show you who you are right here well praise the name of the Lord can you say amen amen so how many's understanding where I'm at how many of you kids understand what I'm where I'm at amen you you you boys and girls you and and then you adults too you teenagers amen so so it God sin's actions are way amen many of times God sends actions our way so that that that you can react amen your reactions tell a lot of who you are your reactions to this message right now will tell a lot about you that's right is his word your absolute did is brother brandom's message to you the absolute amen does your brother mean as much to you as you say God will always send test he sends test not for himself he knows who you are yes but he does it so that you can know your own heart that's right because it's the heart that matters brother amen praise the Lord true brother brandom says now notice another thing the lamb is a willing was a willing lamb to be led it was willing and God's Lambs are willing to be led by God's spirit my sheep know my voice and a stranger they won't follow another thing it is self-sacrificing lamb that has no selfish motives the lamb was willing to give everything it had a little lamb you can take him out there and he's only got one thing that belongs to him and that's his wool you can throw the little fellow on the table tie his feet I've done it many a time and shave every bit of his rights uh that that he H has away from him and he'll just stand there but oh how different we are amen oh my you try to shave us one time and brother we got a we're hot under the collar and tell them off don't we amen then you wonder what's the matter with us that's right oh a lamb is a willing lamb you say brother Brandon what do you mean listen here you say I'm an American amen uh I some of you women say I'm I'm an American last last week you preached on on the way you know we wore our makeup and you preached on the way we wear our shorts on the streets and things I'm an American citizen I've got just exactly the right to do what I'm doing as long as as the law puts it put up up with it and and they sell it in the store that's my American privilege I know but sister if you're a lamb of God you'll forfeit your rights that's right you'll forfeit it you say well if I'm if I'm to stay home uh if I want to stay home and see who loves Susie or or what uh uh them things you know are uh or or what them things are to look at cat that's my own American privilege I know it but if you're a lamb you forfeit it because it's not sheep food that's right you say it's it's my American privilege if I want to put some beer in my ice box and drink a cold uh a good cold glass of of a night when when I come home from supper that's my American privilege I know it sir but if you're a lamb you'll forfeit your rights to become a Christian that's exactly right I'm not supposed to to to see a pig in a manure pile rooting not a bit or I'm not surprised to see a pig in a manure pile rooting not a bit he's a pig that's his nature I wouldn't holler at a sinner drinking beer smoking cigarettes but when you see amen uh it says and and a sinner woman out on the street and herself all uh you know dressed to attract men now don't tell me you're not trying to attract the attention of men cuz you are that's right you might as well come out and be truth ful you are who are you trying to attract then why are you dressing like that for then then you become a show to the world that's right that's right well now you say my American privilege and you preacher you ain't got no but if you're a lamb you'll forfeit it can I hear an amen he says let the Bible or the Bible says let the woman women dress in modest apparel as become Holiness well you say I don't I have I don't cut my hair amen it gives me it gives me a headache get it all off then that's what the Bible said shave it you wouldn't have a headache much more if you if it was like that that's true well don't you say well you're burning the women up yeah I'm going to tell you men something too any man that'll let his wife act like that and smoke cigarettes and act the way she does that shows What You're Made Of that that's a very little thing for a man God gave you to be the rulership and over her and what you are what are you doing she's ruling you that shows what you're made out of that's right can you say Amen so so brother Brandon was coming pretty pretty pretty strong there amen coming down really strong now what is he what is what is he doing here preserving the family preserving Holiness in the church right that's right well praise the Lord now sister if you don't see if you don't see it that way you're missing the bigger picture you are reflecting you are a type of the Bride of Jesus Christ you have come out of those denominations You' have come out of sin we have come out and separated ourselves to God and the way that you show yourself Amen to your husband is the way the bride it's a reflection of either the church world or it's a reflection of the Bride of Jesus Christ amen well can I hear an amen now your dress shows your heart amen that goes for everyone and and and brother brandham saying that about the man because you're a reflection of Jesus Christ you can't allow sin to go on in your home that's right amen now you say well you know I I I wear my dresses however I want to brother Wendell and you know I don't have a problem with them I can walk in them just fine and I I'll wear my blouses however and I'll wear as as many necklaces and as many rings as I want and I I I'll I'll do whatever I I I I I please to do cuz my you know my my boyfriend likes it that way or my husband likes it that way or Hallelujah sometimes it's even dad that likes it that way amen but it shows the spirituality of the whole situation well praise the Lord your apparel is is your billboard right true right true Did you know that you're a pel how many times have I been stopped by the community now they don't they don't say they like you guys all of you men but they brag on our women yes and they all tell me I don't know what's going on at that church but you have the purtiest women and all all of pony and I go well thank you amen hallelujah they got all that junk and they're and that I I've been told so many times I don't care where any of these girls have worked whether it's been at Sonic or whether it's been at Dollar General or whether it's been uh Anita Franks or whether it's been uh uh uh uh where where wherever we've we we've been even e even even our our our most precious our our friend here in our community that just has done everything for the church even sis sister Suzanne Spears has noticed that that that something and it's been because of you ladies you have you have been a billboard for our church you've been a reflection right you've been a testimony yes it's a light in a dark world but now why what are we doing you're advertising you see when you see the advertisement the advertisement is not it's not the thing the advertisement is telling you come inside the store and find out what we've got right we've got the goods come on inside is that right amen this is who I am am this is the attracting power this is hey what you're seeing here I'm showing you that there is a genuine Holy Spirit and he will reflect his life and he does when you're tested and you're tried and your every which direction it's not something you're doing in a religious matter amen hallelujah my my wife told uh uh uh there's someone in the community had stopped her one time and she says you know and and and she was bragging on her but then she says you know how how long uh does does your does your husband tell you you have to do that all the time and my wife starts laughing and she says what do you mean do what well does he make you do you know you're cute and everything but just and my wife says I want to do what I do I love my Lord this is this is who I am I want to reflect this praise the Lord now I want us to look here and and and and and and I I done a little uh a deal I sent to kala and I'm going to let you see my notes for this one this deal here amen if you want to put that up Sister Keys praise the lord it's going to be in 1 Timothy 2 and9 can y'all see that amen Now 1 Timothy 2:9 in like manner also that women Adorn themselves in modest apparel with shamefacedness and and sobriety not with braided hair or gold or pearls or costly array but which becometh women professing godliness with good works now I want us to look at this just real quickly because this is not can can you can Hallelujah I'm so used to pinching things up higher can you can you make that bigger or no okay amen hallelujah so the Greek word for apparel I want us to look there at modest apparel and when we look there at apparel it comes from it comes from the Greek word Casto and Casto means a long dress and if you break down the word cata is a garment flowing down stole is a long garment covering or wrapping modest comes from the word uh Cosmos which means orderly well arranged decent modest harmonious Arrangement or adornment so when we look here a long flowing orderly garment w well a well arranged dress now I I just thought I would check it out I just thought I'd I got on the internet and I said I said long flowing skirt and this is what it gave me show me a few others this is what they call long flowing skirt this this is what they say is a long flowing dress now the scripture says modest apparel and we' just shown you that it is a garment flowing down right it's it's a it's a it's a it's a and that stoy the again garment flowing down stoly is a long garment covering or or or wrapping so so where where where where do we get well I don't I I just get it long baby just get it long that's right right then you don't have to worry about it modest well arranged it's not tight fitting it's flowing right well praise the Lord now I know that this is coming back into style now you girls used to not my my wife had a hard time finding some some good stuff for a while but this is coming back into style long hair is coming back into style I understand that but don't you think don't you think that we ought to be doing it not because it's finally back in style but that we should be doing it because it's God style all along that's right and wouldn't it be bad if the world started looking like that and you're looking like the hussy come on let's let's let's let's let's do our part that's right the Sinners can look like that why why why why don't we do our part that's right right well praise the Lord from a heart that is pure long flowing can you say Amen you see now modesty also applies to one's demeanor or Behavior now these are the inward qualities of the heart how he or she presents themselves and yes this applies to men too now that word is used that that word is used two times in the New Testament amen that word Cosmos and it is it the next time that it is used it is it is it is actually used for us preachers and it says a bishop must be blameless the husband of one wife uh Vigilant sober and of good behavior which is that word cosmial a well-ordered life given to hospitality and apt to teach so so so therefore now going back to you uh uh uh go going back to you sisters therefore it is and once again it is not it's not you girls having to do it because your Mom and Daddy's telling you to do it listen we got a Rapture and you can't wait till you're my age and then to decide okay yeah I'm going to be holy but right now Mama's got to make me no no no no I want you kids to know what you're doing right now and if any of you Elders are guilty of it uh uh any anyone else in the well anyone in the room that's guilty of dressing amen that is not according to the message we need to straighten it up we got a Ministry but it's not it's not a have to but it's it's it's it's what you're doing you're singing according to scripture it's part of your nature the good behavior amen so so what what what this what this is saying is you're actions exhibits your belief system your dress your actions your behavior your attitudes all come from the heart and that's what the what God is wanting the world to see with Holiness that is deep down beded in the heart you want to run us far away from anything that would be close to what the world has can you say Amen now amen I I again I know many women had that never wear immodest clothing but then they're Brash they got a Brash demeanor they they run their house rule their husbands they're missing the point it's it's this here I know a lot of I know a lot of us guys that can look good amen it's easier for us to blend in but it uh Holiness is not something on this outward nature Holiness is not dresses Holiness is not long hair Holiness is not any of these things Holiness is what God has done in the heart to make you a new believer and it's because of the heart you operate that's right but if you don't have that heart then you will reject it no matter how many times I preach against it that's right it'll never be part of you cuz you ain't got the Holy Ghost you've got to have something here that ready to express it here that's right orange seeds produce orange fruits can you say Amen now I want us to look at something let's look real quickly over here at at at U Peter 1 Peter 3 and 3 now I want you to look at this it says who is adorning let it not be the outward adorning of the plating of the hair wearing of gold putting on of apparel but let it be the hidden man of the heart in that which is not corruptible even the ornament of a Meek and quiet Spirit which in the sight of God is a great prize for after this manner in the old time the holy women also who trusted in God adorned themselves being in subjection under their own husband even Sarah obeyed Abraham calling him Lord whose daughters you are as long as you do well and are not afraid with any amazement now Peter as Paul is pointing out the real Beauty now I'm not going to hold you too much longer tonight but he's pointing out the real Beauty now one point said the broed hair the other point it's it's it's saying the plating the hair now amen that that was a braid or a twisted hair that they would run it all the way up they they would go up as high as they could go with it and then they decked it with all gold and pearls and they and that's the reason why brother brandom says he's not talking about the the the braiding of your hair amen it was the part that it was they the way they were doing it and and all the gold and the jewels and the things were to attract were to attract and so amen and then he says you know the wearing of gold and and and and silver he says it's not it's not it's not that now amen again brother brandham says you know you you can wear a wedding band or something like that but don't look like you've went through a 10 cent store right amen you you can wear a necklace but but don't but don't look like it's you see we have a purpose for what we're doing our beauty is not this how is it that you girls are so beautiful in this building and you ain't got a bit of that Max Factor I don't know what Max Factor is I'm taking at the brother brandom know what he was talking about huh you you ain't got a you ain't got a you ain't got a none of that stuff on why because there's a peace on the inside of you and it's reflecting through your nature it's reflecting through your heart that's right I tell you man Hallelujah you you you you you get on the internet and you're looking at junk that and and and you're doing that to that and you're looking at stuff and and here you've got a wife that is remaining true and pure to you you I think there should be some lynches we got to be we we ought to be we ought to be faithful to our Wives come on we ought to be faithful to our wives you see when we when we look at this and you know you you you you say well brother wend you was talking about the lipstick and the fingernail polish and all of that and it is is that clear stuff is nothing but to attract attention you're painting your lips and you're missing the point brother Bram says we know that everything on Earth is a reflection of what's going on somewhere else you are only reflecting yourself what you are somewhere else is what you're reflecting here on the earth for if this Earth Earthly body be dissolved we have one already waiting we see we have one waiting just what are what you are somewhere else you are here now if you and your life isn't just correct here then your spiritual body is in a place that is not correct yet but if you got all your members submissive to God to God then what you are here you are reflecting somewhere else can you say Amen now amen I I think of Abraham as Abraham was offering his sacrifice unto the Lord and he had separated taken the sacrifice he had he had separated it and he was making that Covenant with God and and if you'll notice that as as he was there the scripture says the buzzards tried to start coming in and Landing upon that sacrifice and Abraham was diligent to shoe the buzzards away the birds away to shoe them away from from from that sacrifice there to shoot what what was they doing because brother bradam said the sacrifice had to remain pure had to remain clean he says and now that's what I'm trying to do now keep the old worldly Hollywood virt vultures out of the Pentecostal Church keep them out away from our women away from our brothers and things like that you can have all the big silly jokes and things you want to tell let them have it that's their Kingdom we're not of this world our kingdom is not of this world we live here as Americans but our soul comes from above can you say amen he says what good is all we've got going uh uh to do on that day Lord now he's praying and he says let us stand for you so when that hour comes and we walk into his presence the omnipotent the omnipresent oh God and we hear that dove with its wings setting back there in the great light that'll it'll flash through all eternity then we'll dwell in that light or when we dwell in that light when I have when I have to stand there by myself my brother's gone my pastor's gone my mother's gone my Daddy's Gone my wife's gone my kitties are gone oh God what am I going to do then Lord what am I going to do that may be before the sun goes down tonight but what am I going to do what can I do oh Christ I'll stand for you now I'll take my choice today I'll forfeit all of my talking about other people I'll forfeit all my temper I'll forfeit all my differences I'll forfeit everything sheare me off Lord take all I've got you just take me Lord I want to stand in your place I want to be shed sheared I want all selfishness and all pride and all indifference just all taken off of me that when I when I want to stand for you uh then I want to stand for you as a sheared lamb willing to give all up all the pleasures when when they call the pleasures of life and all the dances and all the parties and all the vulgar clothes and the makeup and the lipstick and the fingernail polish and all this indifferences that that looks like the world you said don't even act like the world don't even associate the world come out from among them oh God help me Lord sheare me today take me like a lamb and let me be dumb and not open my mouth say nothing about it but just stand and be sheared can you say Amen how many wants that today this is a Ministry friends this is a Ministry take that call seriously as as much as William Smith has to take his call seriously as a preacher as as much as wend Martin has to take my call a as a preacher as much as as Merl laate has to take his call seriously as a song leader every one of us must be diligent to our call you'll give an account for it not just I'm not even I'm talking about the ministry side I'm talking about the folks that could have might have received Christ in this message but because you didn't tell them because I didn't tell them scripture says they'll go through the brother Brandon says they'll go through tribulation because we did not tell them well if you if you women aren't preachers what what what what kind of a life are you living you're preaching the gospel through your lifestyle Brothers you're preaching the gospel through your lifestyle that's right if you're if if you're if you're laughing at filthy jokes on the on on the you know on the uh H the job if you're if you're if you're if you're if you're not taking what you are seriously you're going to stand to God on that day and then that's that's that's that's for the souls the 10 thousands of Worlds that that have been lost because you haven't live that kind of a life that has wanted them to be hungry what are we going what are you sisters going to do when you have to stand and answer for a man committing adultery with you well can you say that ultimate it depends on your roots what you are in your roots the new birth can only energize the seed and if there is a seed on the inside of window I pray the Holy Ghost would germinate that seed on the inside of me you girls hear me you want the Holy Ghost to so energize it you boys hear me you want the Holy Spirit it'll energize that seed on the inside M and daddies y'all hearing me it will energize that seed brother brandham they'd say well someone would ask what are you doing then preaching he told us to go and cast out cast The Net in and pull them out on the bank he knows which is fish which is crawfish and which is snakes and turtles and terpens he knows all about it but they was that to begin with that's right it's just our business to throw the s in and pull it out and say Lord or here they are Lord here they are first thing you know Mrs water spider sit there a little while and say huh I don't believe that my pastor don't flop flop right back into the mud again brother that fellow when he come out he if he was a fish to begin with he's a fish at the end of the road yes sir his name was put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world he said my sheep hear my voice and a stranger they will not follow they'll hear that word as many as I love I rebuke and Chase and bious and repent and come back that's that's the age that's the message we're getting now can you say Amen so my my job is not to clean them up your job is not to clean them up your job is to preach the gospel to them live that life and I don't be living a life contrary to what we preach here amen now it's a little bit quiet in here tonight Hallelujah I thought we all agreed I've been preaching this for years this ain't nothing new I I've been preaching this for 30 some odd years so so I ain't preaching nothing that amen I but I'm here to tell you the time is growing close and if we're going to win souls we need to win souls and the only way we're going to win souls is by is by Walking with God the way that he's ordained us to walk with him can you say Amen how many wants to do that tonight I I want God take my take my heart take my heart amen I I want to reflect I want to keep on reflecting I want to reflect to my family I want to reflect amen I know I know there's a lot of Amen there's a lot of legalists out there that thinks that you're that they're earning their salvation and they're and they and they act so and their heart is so full of Amen of junk and hate and and and and and and stuff like that they're just a they're just a bunch of Hypocrites I understand that but I'm here to tell you there is a real true genuine bride and the anointing is with you the anointing is upon you live that life live it from your heart live with everything that you've got only then only then can the anointing rest I want to win some souls to the kingdom of God it's getting late we don't have much time I'm not saying he man that that that we're that that you know we're going to see a great swell I'm not saying that we're not that that that we're going to see a lot of souls saved and a lot of I I'm not I'm not saying that I am saying I've got a Ministry on the moon and I've got to reflect accurately what that son is I've got to reflect accurately the prophet of God came into this day amen and he brought that word he brought that message to us brother Let's Line ourselves up with that message line ourselves up with thus sayeth the Lord somebody needs to see you I can't win who you can win and you can't win who I can win but brother together we can shine this Gospel Light amen we want to give of ourselves amen yeah there's a light you can say well that's just a lot of nonsense and it may be maybe maybe that was just brother brandom's opinion but if God sent Malachi for to us come on yes sir then I think we should probably take heat that's right someone told me well that's opinion I said so is yours yeah but the only problem is the only problem is he's got the Vindicated Pillar of Fire upon his opinion makeup's not in the Bible well yeah there was one that wore it well praise the Lord might as well might as well go here are y'all ready I'm already here and you guys are quiet so here we go you know someone says well brother Brandon was wrong for mentioning earrings because they wore earrings in the Bible Hallelujah and I've heard I they're they're they're there there's some spiritual preachers who's who's who's actually who's actually believe in that I you know brother brandham he come back from Africa and he and he's seen all he says he said they had so many necklaces and all that all around them had those piercings everywhere and Rings everywhere and he comes back and he says it is a heathen trait Hallelujah I I I'm not going listen I am not to Hallelujah I I am you wna you want to paint your hair pink go ahead you you wanna you you do what you want to do but can you win souls because there's nothing in the Bible that says anything about painting your hair pink I'm looking at the Spirit behind it as brother brandham was looking at the Spirit behind it yes as the Apostle Paul and the Apostle Peter was looking at the Spirit behind it amen can you say Amen does that mean people with with with with with tattoos are going to hell dear God no Hallelujah some of you guys probably got tattoos I've seen one of them brother Joe amen but God's called you out of that that's right right come on now y'all hearing me so this thing that

those preachers are all up there they got the shirt outside their pants Hallelujah want to look like one of them for minut and this is the way they preach except they've got tennis shoes on you know

God some says well not it's not shouldn't be the hat if you're going to do anything you need to take off your shoes Moses took off his shoes but the culture where we're standing where we're at went

the headship of God's word amen let's do it with everything that we've got give ourselves to this and show those show this Dying World that we're not just another church that we're not just a

in our lives brother Brenham says now remember if such holy men recognize themselves sinners in the presence of God what will the Sinner and the ungodly do at the day of judgment what will people do who sit in the meetings what will people do that's seen the power of God that's heard the countdown on the word that's seen God manifest himself beyond a shadow of a doubt in every scripture fulfilled and will still try to make it heaven without being born again receive the Holy Ghost the Bible said if a righteous man scarcely saved where were the Sinner and the ungodly what kind of a place are we going to stand in if we see God unfold himself right before us and see the glory of God just the same as men did and that kind of men cried out as prophets and sages upon the word as if they cried and fell to the feet and screamed of a man of Unholy lips uncleanness what will it be for that man that won't convince confess his sins what will it be for the teenager that won't confess his or her sins what will it be for the hardened man that thinks he knows more about God's creation than God does himself what will happen to that man that spent all of his life trying to disprove the Bible where will this guy appear think of it this is evangelism this is time to shake the people oh God if there's anyone that is listening to our our service tonight and maybe you've not heard this kind of preaching I am in no means un christianizing any of [Music] you I'm talking to my church I'm talking about living Our Lives the way that we know the Bible says says it in the convictions of our heart and we've all got to serve God according to the convictions of our heart but if the Lord deals with us then we want we want that Holy Spirit we want to we want to walk with him in that light we want to walk with him I'm not in the slightest bit saying [Music] that you're not a Christian if you're wearing earrings I'm not a slightest bit saying that you're not a Christian I'm saying that we want to please him we want to love him we want to do everything that we can to reflect his life we're saved by the blood of Jesus I just know what the Bible teaches maybe you've not been taught that but I
