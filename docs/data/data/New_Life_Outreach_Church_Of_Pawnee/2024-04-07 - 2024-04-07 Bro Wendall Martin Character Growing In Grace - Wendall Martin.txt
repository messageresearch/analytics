so well amen been been wonderful now it this is going to be uh quite a reading but I I want to read all the way the the third chapter from verse 1 to verse 15 and I brethren could not speak unto you as unto spiritual but as unto carnal even as babes in Christ I have fed you with milk and not with meat for hitherto you were not able to Bear it neither yet now are ye able for ye are yet carnal for whereas there is among you envying and strife and divisions are ye not carnal and walk as men and while one saith I am of Paul and another I'm of Apollos are ye not carnal who then is Paul who is Apollos for but ministers by whom ye believed even as the lord gave to every man I have planted Apollos watered but God gave the increase now and so then neither is he that planteth anything neither he that WTH but God that giveth the increase now he that planteth and he that WTH are one every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labor for we are laborers together with Christ ye are God's husbandry ye are God's Building according to the grace of God which is given unto me as a wise master builder I have laid the foundation and another man builth there on but let every man take heed how he build thereupon now if any man build upon this Foundation gold silver precious stones wood hay stubble Every Man's work shall be made manifest for the day shall declare it because it shall be revealed by fire and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is if any man's work abide which he hath built thereup he shall receive a reward if any man's work shall be burned he shall suffer loss but he himself shall be saved so uh yet so as by fire let's go to the Lord in prayer father we want to thank you today for your many blessings that you have given us Lord as we've sung the songs of Zion as your Grace has been here this morning Lord and this is a a wonderful morning more than just the than the resurrection Lord but a a a beautiful anniversary being celebrated here this morning Father we we thank you for eternal life and what it does in our in these bodies and the and the beauty of life that it gives our families we thank you for that and ask a blessing there upon brother Merl and sister Leah father we just ask Lord that you would help us as we have read your word Lord we ask that you would now just pull back the scales for from our spiritual eyes that we can behold you and see you Lord hear your words we love you Lord with all of our heart in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ can the church say amen and amen God bless you you may be seated amen I'd like to uh Minister this morning on character and growing in Grace and um um and I I thought we would uh just continue a little uh bit uh did you enjoy the the uh Wednesday night uh reading of the church age book I uh I I I have really enjoyed uh ministering and uh reading the church age book and and we talk about uh it was about the trials and the testings and and um and so I I wanted to just um maybe minut Minister a little bit more on character here this morning and God is looking for a matured bride now the reason that this is called the bride age is because amen it's not that we're the only bride that that we're the only ones that can call ourselves bride out of The Seven Ages amen but this is simply the time to where the bride has come of age she is is she's no longer immature but she has come to maturity to where the mature word of God can come to her and she will take that word amen apply that word in her life and of course Christ will come and will take her amen and raise all of the other bride members of all the other ages uh and and we will go in a Rapture in that great Resurrection so uh so we are living in this age of maturity amen now this is where the word has come to its final as a church as as a as a church as in general amen of the last 2,000 years we have come all the way up to this Pinnacle ready for a Rapture but it in this church amen even in this bright age there are there is still maturity that is required in every one of us we are all growing we are all maturing we are all amen uh we some of us may be at the baby stage some of us may be uh uh may maybe you're you're in kindergarten maybe maybe you're in uh uh maybe you're in high school you know may wherever you are we are all in this in this body here this morning this this uh Church Auditorium there there are uh uh a wide uh variety of growth amen and we're all at different stages in our walk with God Amen and so never be discouraged at what stage you are in but always be diligent for the tutor to to train you and always have that desire to come up higher in your walk with God Amen maturity it it means the state or fact or the period of being mature amen maturity is fully developed it means adulthood full growth the sense of responsibility level-headedness um re responsibleness wisdom adultness and so this is what Webster has for maturity so amen we the Apostle Paul was was telling this church he was he was just telling the the Corinthian churches we've just read amen there the time or I believe it was actually over in Hebrews that he was telling some of those the time that you should be teachers you have need to be taught all over again which is saying listen you're not taking your tutorage uh uh uh to to heart you're you're not taking the word of God you're not allowing the Holy Spirit to teach you the way that you should be taught and so he is saying now you you have need for someone to teach you all over again the very basics of the of the doctrines of Christ and as we looked here at the Corinthian Church amen we we find that the Apostle Paul was getting on to them and said listen you guys are just carnal you're just carnal there's a lot of ening there's a lot of uh uh malice you're you're debating over who's better Paul or Apollos you're you you've got you've you've got sin in the church I've had to rebuke you back and forth it's just you and and yet you are all claiming to be spiritual you speak in tongues you prophesy you're doing all of these things but I'm telling you right now Corinthian Church it is time to take off the Pampers and it's and it's time to be potty trained it's time to mature it's time to grow you you you you you have got God's got a specific purpose for you you've got to take this seriously and I I want I I I want the holy spirit amen to train me tutor me bring me into the maturity that that he wants me to be because every one of us are his genan seed and so as we begin I think every one of us are that way as as Believers we don't want to look back 6 months and uh from now and say I see no growth in my walk with God I don't want to look back last year at this same time and say I see no growth with God I want growth I want growth how many wants to grow in the Lord amen now amen uh uh brother Bram would say uh in the end time evangelism and and he would he would talk about and I would encourage everyone this week that that uh I I would encourage you to listen to end time evangelism and brother Bram was talking about the reasoning for the m message the message is being scattered out because there is a people that is that he is attracting he's the elaser trying to find a a a people who will hear that word and so he says God God's looking for character not membership but character elaser when he went to get the Bride of Isaac he sweated it out until he found character remember Abraham put him responsible as God puts us responsible that's right we ministers hunt my bride God bless your heart I ain't looking for members I'm looking for the pure in heart see somebody that'll believe the word amen he goes on down and says then when eleazer found the character that was in the the woman Rebecca uh the the beautiful bride of Isaac he told her about Isaac and she never questioned one thing amen I want you to get that she never questioned one thing she believed the word of the messenger she made ready to go and she went and asked the father or they went and asked the father and he said just ask her the damils of age ask her let her decision be and she said I will go to what a man that had a man she had never seen know nothing about but she was ready because she was predestinated and for ordained to that exactly right can you say amen amen so the the desire or the the craving the craving to grow is in the seed there's there's no way a church member is going to Crave to be more like Jesus Christ they they'll want positions they'll want these kinds of of things but only only the predestinated seed of Christ on the inside of the elect it craves to be more like Jesus Christ amen so Rebeca was predestinated to be the bride of Christ and when the word came to her she knew that there was something within her to respond to that word well glory to God Amen I love that song that brother leontine wrote I feel the pool amen there is something pulling me to a higher walk there's something pulling me to a higher praise there's something that's pulling me Amen to that deeper relationship with the Lord can you say Amen now brother Brandon would go on and he would say now the end time message is not to them that are in Babylon amen it is to the bride alone amen he's looking for the character of faith that will believe that one amen so he says one Angel he's talking about Abraham one Angel come to Abraham and his group on the mountain and performed a miracle by Discerning the thoughts that was in the heart is that right and Sarah was on the inside where where the angels that went to Sodom had thousands down there see the shaking comes in the little group he says going on further he says getting the bride ready that's what it is is now we're going to the end right here by saying that we're going to end right here by saying this the end time message is to get the bride ready and prepared for the Rapture amen so the reason we're coming to church is to get ourselves ready and prepared for the Rapture amen so simply believing the message doesn't make us Rapture Ready amen just uh uh uh Justified doesn't make us Rapture Ready Sanctified doesn't make us raptured ready but we the bride has made ourselves ready hallelujah amen it takes a matured individual to take the word of the Lord and say I'm going to take the word of God I'm going to apply it to my life and I'm going to make myself ready because I am his bride well glory to God amen so there is a certain quality uh uh of character of of the uh in the elect to believe that predestinated seed amen is what God is looking for now now when we talk about the predestinated seed we would have to go to Romans the 8th chapter and the 29th verse and he said whom he did for know and that word means before love them he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son now that that simply means if he loved you and he called you you are predestinated to come to the full maturity that he has purposed in himself amen you're going to arrive can you say amen amen God's pred that you cannot you cannot expect uh uh the the church member to come and into that maturity you cannot expect a a a denominational system to bring you into that maturity only the elect can mature because only the elect has that predestinated seat whom he before loved them he also did predestinate to be conformed well glory to God Amen now now here we are you say now amen I was predestinated I was was called of God Amen but I I I but we were in sin and we were we were filthy and and we were you know you were predestinated even when you was out there in the world you were predestinated even when you were out there drinking and crowding and amen drunk as a skunk and and and you before you are even sitting in a church pew you were predestinated then but you have to have a call from God Amen brother brandham didn't he he said this he said the blood did not save you the Blood Washed you you were saved by predestination the blood is there the blood is shed Hallelujah but only the predestinated elected seat of God will do anything with that blood that's Oh Glory to God that makes me want to shout amen I you see the blood came for me to pull me out of the pig pin pull me out of sin pull me out of the muck and mire pull me out and to bring me into that position that he predestinated me to be and I want to tell you where you are right now is your is not exactly where God Wants You God's got a Destiny for you and you're going to keep on growing and maturing we're going to grow somebody say Let Me Grow amen I'm going to grow I'm going to continue to mature it don't matter where you are now in this walk there is a maturity that God is calling us to amen hallelujah so it's through that new birth that we can find now amen and and Christ reflected the heart of the father when in an identification he said you study that character a little bit and then look at yourself and I look at myself now now that's but but that's what he was that's who he was that's why he was now he said that's what he was that's who he was and that's why he was to save you I love that he says he become you that you might become him he took your load of sin therefore when we come to meet him we will not have to stand we could not stand in the presence of God there's no way for us to do it but when we stand in him he's already recognized the the sacrifice this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased he recognized it there was no blemish on him yet he suffered Temptation like every other man he was scorned he was made fun of he was persecuted from the hour that he was born until the hour he died yet he returned good for evil you cannot no way ever produce a character like that only accepting that character in you a church cannot do it a Creed cannot do that a denomination cannot do that education cannot do that it must be a birth it's got to be a dying out and let God in by the grace of Christ then mold this character this type of character in you that you become him your life and his is the same you are Sons and Daughters of God hallelujah hallelujah oh can you say Amen so it took now the predestin at seed was already there but it took God Amen Jesus was nothing but the character of God Amen he was the love of God he was the Divine Redeemer of God he was the Savior When God says there is no savior beside me it was God in Jesus Jesus was reflecting the savior he was reflecting the character of love he was reflecting the character of Grace when he came to you he was expressing and reflecting his love his eternal love for every one of you and then when he comes in what is he doing the Holy Spirit ignites the seed predestinated in your heart before the foundation of the world and you begin to live Hallelujah but now you've accepted that character in you but it's in seed form the seed is now living but now the seed must mature that's right because brother Brandon would go on and say amen he in in in that same uh uh uh the same message identification after Jesus doing this when no one else wouldn't could do it we are invited now the church think of this just a minute we are invited to shape our own character to his by his grace then he says again we are invited think of it to become character like his if we're ready to lay our character down and the molding that we had he high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God false accusers incontinent despisers of those that are trying to do right having a form of godliness and denying the power of God how can God come into a place like that when they deny the word see when he watches over for his word to vindicate it to make it come to pass and the word is pushed out how can he identify himself with something like that we've got to take the entire Full Gospel amen we must now being that we are identified ourselves as a Full Gospel people let's mold our character once again he says we are invited to be molded in His image that we might reflect his presence and the works that I do shall you do also and the life that I live so shall you we're invited by God to take him as an example and let our character be molded like his what a thing my then we when we let his character be in us then we have become uh Sons by having the mind of Christ which is his character your mind makes your character let the Mind Paul said of Christ this mind that was in Christ be in you let the mind of Christ be in you and it'll mold the character of a Son of God Amen it it'll mold the character so so now he the character of Christ came in us through the seed the seed was ignited then brother Brandon would say then you're invited to take on and to produce that character in you what are you doing you're taking the word of God Amen you're not just listening to it in a message form anymore but now you're taking those words that are coming across the pulpit and you're applying those things to your everyday walk amen you're not forgetting the sermon when you walk out now you're taking those things and you're going to prayer and you're saying God I'm asking that you mold my heart according to that word that I have re seed I'm asking well praise the Lord you see and it can be done it must be done because the seed that is that is being preached up here well the the word that's being preached up here amen is simply the rain to fall upon the seed that's already in your heart and when you accept it and you allow that word to water that seed it must produce of itself well are you are you are you catching my dri we want that word to bring that maturity amen now now we we there in in first or second uh Peter 3 and 14 it says wherefore beloved seeing that ye look for such things be diligent that you may be found of him in peace without spot and blameless now now he's he's he's letting you know now there's going to be those if you were to read all of those verses there amen they're wrestling with the word here they're wrestling with what Paul said here they're doing it to their own destruction and he's saying I want you to be diligent to be found in him without spot and without blemish the 17th verse he says therefore beloved seeing you know these things before beware lest you also being aay with uh being led away with the error of the wicked fall from your own steadfastness but grow in Grace now Grace Can't grow Grace is the ultimate right what he's saying here I'm giving you God's given you a vehicle grow in Grace the seed is laying within you Grace is already been extended to you and through that Grace you can now grow these other guys are wrestling with the word and again I I don't have time because I've got a long message amen but but if you were to read if you were to read all the way down through uh through those four verses there he's talking about this one that is being led away this one's arguing with the word and that one's arguing with the word but he's saying but you have been given Grace grow in that Grace take advantage of that Grace there is light that has appeared to you they're living in darkness you're living in light and you can grow they don't have that opportunity because there is no seed laying on the inside of them but you are a royal priesthood you're a chosen generation you are the elected of God the Grace has appeared unto you oh that'll make you want a shout amen amen yes now amen if you were to look I I let me just say this did you know that uh uh well let's just read it there in 2 Peter 1 and3 it says according as his divine power hath given us uh given unto us all things somebody say all things that pertain unto life and godliness that through the knowledge of him that hath called us somebody say that hath called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us somebody say given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you somebody say me you might be partakers of the divine nature Hallelujah well that now that that deserved a standing ovation right there hallelujah amen yes that you the words have come to you so that you can be partakers of that divine nature to them hallelujah amen remember the the other angels went out to thousands but that's not what God was looking for God appeared unto two people Abraham and Sarah it was God with his prophetic word that appeared and because of those words imparted life into their bosoms and they were able to produce a supernatural thing right Hallelujah there you go Sodom didn't hear the words of MDC Abraham and Sarah did Sodom didn't hear the voice of the Lord saying unto the according to the time of life Thou shalt have oh come on church now now Peter is saying here amen unto us has been given exceeding and precious promises that by these we might be partakers of his divine nature no one else is invited here no one else can do this no one else can take it I'm asking you to take this word and become like me Hallelujah can you say amen amen now no one else can do it but the ones that God has called in remember what brother renham said five times we are invited come on to Blind up to his character now he says now uh partakers of the divine nature fifth version besides this giving all diligence now I want you to look this before we go any further add to your faith virtue to Virtue knowledge to knowledge Temperance to Temperance patience to patience godliness to Godliness kindness and to brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that you are neither Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ now he's talking about this growth now I want you to add but there's one thing that was not added y'all remember amen it says add to your faith virtue virtue knowledge there one thing he didn't tell you to add he didn't tell you to add Faith right faith is given yes to the elect there you go faith is the invitation there you go to take the word faith is saying here it is now you add to your faith knowledge you add to your faith I'm supplying the faith you be diligent in bringing it on up into maturity as a son and daughter of God that's really I'm giving you this I've elected you I've ordained you but now you take what I've given you and you come in to maturity well glory to God that makes me want to shout on Amen now so we have to have things to overcome now we can say these things in the word the word is there amen that has been given to us but if there's nothing to overcome then the word will really mean nothing to us the word won't mean anything we we'll hear the preacher preach it and we amen and yeah yeah yeah yeah we believe it we believe it we believe it but unless there was a trial for us to go through then that word would never really be molded into your nature it would be here and then forgotten within a couple of days God don't want it here God wants it here well praise the Lord amen amen so now God is telling them said now you got to be diligent amen because if he he he says now if you if these things be in you and abound they make you that you're not uh uh sister CA uh there in 2 Peter 1 and8 if these things be in you and abound is the last verse we just read amen uh they make you that you should need neither Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but then the next verse amen it says and Hallelujah the ninth verse but he he that lath these things is blind and cannot see a far off and have forgotten that he was purged from his old sins so so he's saying now you've been given this now you've got to be diligent I've given you that word so that you can be partakers of his divine nature but if you are not diligent and you're not applying these things then you are just like him that is blind can't see a far off and you have already forgot what God has brought you from and I want to say there is too much of that stuff going on in Le osia and there's too much of that stuff that goes on in message churches where we can come and set we think that we've got the message we think that we've got it all right and we don't give a ddly squat about how our actions our attitudes or anything else is we've got to line it up with what God has been teaching us can you say Amen now we have to have something to overcome come right you have got to take the bull by the horns amen and bring that circumstance amen under your control bring your flesh under your control bring that situation under your control that is part of adoption all right can you say Amen now once again the New Birth the Holy Ghost baptism is a gift but character comes only by victories okay the seed the supernatural Eternal seed of God in potential form all Hallelujah every bushel of apples that that little that that Apple that apple tree is going to produce is in that little seed that is put in the ground that's good every bushel of apples is already laying in that seed while you're holding it in your hands that's right can you say am man but the seed has got to be buried and it's got to be ignited it's got to die and it's got to amen it's got to receive life and then it will produce on what can you say Amen so the new birth is a free gift it's the seed in that se seed holds everything you need to an overcoming life hallelujah amen the character character character can only come by victories right in other words you've got to bring everything and in line with the word of God you've got to die to yourself you've got to die to your mind you've got to die to what you think is right oh come on Amen and that means that you know what that usually means amen you got to watch those guys that are just constantly amen looking at everyone else and critiquing amen you you women that sat around and just talk and gossip amen you know about about so and so about this one about this one in the church what how the church is going this way or that way you you you go you you you are sitting there amen and and you don't call it gossiping you're it's a it's a it's a prayer session amen we got to pray for them and we got to oh this is on my heart you see all that is all that is is a bunch of fleshly Flesh inspired flesh motivated flesh it's just come on church God has called you to be an overcomer actions don't just happen actions come on are the results right on all right of the heart all right words are the results of the character of the heart actions come on church are the results Abraham believed God therefore it was imputed unto him for righteousness he went for 25 years without it are y'all following me now so growing growing Proverbs 21 and2 it says every way of a man is right in his own eyes so every way every way of a man is right in his own eyes but the Lord pth the hearts now we've laid the foundation that the seed comes from God that election comes from God that it is all within us potential form through that seed but now is where it's supposed to be coming out and living its life through us right can you say Amen now there are the works of the flesh amen there're they're in in Galatians 5 and 23 amen if if you want to turn there uh uh there there is the the Works let's see um uh let's see uh five and um let's just 5 and 16 amen uh let's see boy it's the whole the whole chapter is just really really good amen it it says um uh we we could even we could even go on up because it's dealing with the I want to deal with the lust of the flesh for just a moment um let let's look here at the 13th verse for Brethren uh ye have been called un Liberty only use not that Liberty for an occasion to the flesh but by love serve one another for all the law is fulfilled in one word even in this Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself now remember we talked about the character of Christ the character of God that was in Christ that character is what Christ is looking for what is what God is wanting to see through you and me he's wanting to see that so he is the love of God Christ is so what Christ is doing now the Apostle Paul is bringing it out here in maturity he's he's showing us the difference amen remember Christ the the love uh the the law is fulfilled all in one word it's all summed up in one word love loving Christ loving God loving your neighbor can you say Amen now watch this he says the law is fulfilled even in this one word thou shalt love uh th like thyself as thy thy neighbor as thyself but if thou bow and devour one another take heed lest you be consumed with one one another this I say then walk in the spirit that you fulfill not the lust of the flesh for the lust of the for the flesh lusteth after the spirit the spirit after the Flesh and these are contrary the one to the other so that you cannot do things that you would but if you be led of the spirit ye are not under the law now the works of the flesh are manifest which are these adultery fornication uncleanness lasciviousness idolatry witchcraft hatred variance ulations wrath Strife seditions heresies ening murders drunkenness ra uh reings and such like of which I tell you before as I have also told you in times past that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God so within so you you have in your I in in your DNA in your fleshly DNA you have the works of the flesh am amen and that's the reason why the Apostle Paul says You Must Die daily Paul says I Die daily so so what what am I now I am not saying that that it is a mind over matter mind over matter is will never bring maturity it'll never bring maturity I heard someone say one time well you know uh that you know there talking about you know makeup and things and and uh he just he's talking about Sin and how you know brother brandham shouldn't have been you know talking about those uh pain face Jezebels and and Miss dog meat and things like that he says listen amen he says he says I know our girls that got blue stuff on their on their eyes and they've got you know the makeup and things like that he says but they'll grow out of that now now listen you don't grow out of sin oh come on you must cut sin off in your life you've got to cut sin off somebody say cut sin off cut you've got to have a new birth you've got to be born born again come on church you've got to have a new nature that wants to please God that wants to serve God you've got to have a nature and that can only come by a predestinated seat that has been found of Life by God hallelujah can you say Amen but in you are two wall to to to to uh laws that are that are Waring Amen in you amen come on now don't you tell me you don't battle Pride don't you tell me you don't battle amen you you guys don't battle lust occasionally don't you tell me you don't battle some of these things but a matur Believer will choose God's word hallelujah the character that God is looking for is for that man that woman that will base every action upon thus saith the Lord Lord amen that's good can you say Amen see the character that's what God's looking at amen now well I I fight here in my mind I fight I fight this Amen brother when I fail here I fail there I'm not looking at where you have fallen here and Fallen there I'm looking at a character that God is bringing about in your life to line it up with thus sayith the Lord what a promise amen you're invited yeah you're invited into this place to share his character oh GL you're invited into his holy place to where you can you can overcome the evil one and stand well praise the Lord amen sir but the first way you're going to have to end up coming to you've got to come to this knowledge every way of a man is right if you want to put it back up Proverbs 21 and2 every man every way of a man is right in his own eyes right everybody say every way of a man is right in his own eyes every way of a man is right in his own eyes and if you are going to walk according to what that truth is then you will never except amen the character that says God Ponders the hearts you see we want to defend what we think is right too many times we are wanting to justify where we are too many times and God may be Hallelujah he may be trying to get you out of that crawling St stage and into the walking stage but because you don't want to walk and you would rather crawl amen and God's picking you up and you just want to sit back down and throw your little temper tantrum why because your way in your eyes is right but God says no I'm taking you a little bit higher come on it's time for you to learn to walk Come onlj could you imagine all of these beautiful girls up here amen still in diapers and having to crawl their way up here to the bench aren't you glad mom and dad had a little bit better vision for him amen and says listen I think you can be poty trained I think you can learn to walk I think you can learn what can you say Amen it's part of growing up and God is calling the church it's in your DNA to rule it's in your DNA to bring your flesh under control it's in your DNA to conquer the devil you can do itall Hallelujah can you say Amen now we want to look and we want to say well I am moral I am moral I don't smoke I don't drink I don't cuss I don't whatever so that's character brother brandham would say it's the state of the heart he says most people say well he's a good man Pays His ties he's a good member that's very good he says that's a moral life now no one could speak evil of that it's a moral life but that's not what I'm talking about Jesus judged a man a Believer a different type of character yeah amen he would say it shows what's on the inside of you what you're thirsting that's right that's your character that's your conduct well praise the Lord so so your character is not that we go to church pay our ti do this our character is where is is where the root system is it's where it's where our heart is it's what we think and because we think we're better than everyone else then we can talk about everybody else and because we think that we're better than oh yeah we say oh no we're humble we think we're better that's the reason we can just go along pointing fingers to this that and the other a man or a woman that ever sees themselves Amen in the light of Calvary can never ever ever Point their finger at another man or woman because they know that they themselves have nothing without Calvary can you say Amen it's what you are on the Inside Man another place he says I'm not saying what you are he I ain't saying what you are I'm asking your character we're going below these Li little things that you're looking at were going on the inside of you so now he's he's he's hitting it hard now I'm not I'm not I'm not I'm not saying what you are out here I'm not this right here you look pretty and you look cute Hallelujah but now amen I'm going to go way on beyond all of these things I'm going to go down deep on the inside of you what's going on on the inside what can you say amen and you know what God knows what's on the inside God knows what you have on the inside amen God knows that junk that's on the inside but he also knows that there is a character in potential form laying in that seat on the inside of you and when those two laws are Waring there's got to be a man of the house step up there's got to be a good man of the house step up and answer the and say you ain't allowed here anymore Hallelujah can you say Amen you see now then we're beginning to grow now I'm what I'm talking about right now is our thought process our thinking process you see that J that when when they when when when Jesus you know told him he says you know you say he that you know he that commits adultery is is is worthy of hell and but I say he that lookth upon a woman go come on lusting in his heart he has already committed adultery that's right okay Hallelujah you see it's all going back he said I didn't come I'm not doing away with the law I'm magnifying it you're doing it with this come on I'm going way down to the root of the matter I've not called you to be religious I've called you to be powerful I've not called you to sit in a church I've called you to reign in this life through the power of that Eternal seat on the inside of you amen hallelujah well praise the Lord now how do we get these kinds of things out now we're catching up amen a little bit to the church age book how do we get these things out in us when God's already see we're naked before him he knows you better than you know yourself your heart's deceitful your heart can deceive you that's right there's going to be many that say lord lord lord lord lord lord have we not cast out Devils have we not done this and he's going to say I don't know who you are and their hearts deceived them but the elect cannot be deceived because within the heart of the elect is a cry to be right hallelujah amen in the heart of the elect deep down inside of you is the desire to get get it right praise the Lord and for those who have the desire to get it right unto you has been given precious promises unto you has been given these words of life that you can be partakers of the divine nature just as Jesus Christ was the partakers of the divine nature can you say Amen but how's that seed going to grow how H how how's it going to mature how Hallelujah well if you're going to be up on

guy crossed the aisle from you what come on Church yeah if we lived in that real where God wants us to live on come on brother brandom says love is the most powerful thing that could ever be given to a man all right okay are you hearing me love now learning to trust comes we go through the trials and we those who have found a total surrendered heart to the Potter the design of the Masterpiece is in The Potter's hands yes so whatever he's building he knows what he's making he knows what he's wanting he knows the pressure that is needed and he has the patience at the task at hand so if you're looking at me while I'm on the potter's wheel and you're going to see me in my unfinished State you're going to be so disappointed in me that's right all right but if you could look through the power of the Holy Spirit Through The Eyes the mind of Christ look through the eyes of the Potter amen he knows what he's doing that's right that's good in me there you go when you don't see it when you don't know it he never takes his eyes off of the Potter or off the Clay he never come on church and I guarantee you this year he never throws the Clay Away he might have to break you back down he might have to put you back in the on the on on the on the potter's wheel he might have to do those kinds of things again can you say amen amen but I just want you to remember there in first Ephesians 1:1 in whom we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated somebody say being predes destinated read it with me according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will we have been predestinated according to the purpose of him who works all things according to the counsel of his own will let's go to the next verse and then it says and read it with me that we should be to the praise of his glory Hallelujah really I thought y'all was going to get up and do a jig on that one that we should be to the praise of his glory he's predestinated us he's going to bring us out he's going to show his purpose right amen 1 Peter 1 and six we're in you greatly Rejoice though now for a season if need be you're in heaviness through manifold Temptations the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth though it be Tried by fire might be found unto praise and honor and Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ now now now remember what I just read to you there in Ephesians 1 being predestinated according to the purpose of him who have worked all things according to the counsel of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory now he's saying though the trial of your faith is much more precious than of go that prish that perisheth though it be tried with fire that it might be unto praise honor and Glory how is he going to take you to the honor the praise the glory it's going to go through the fire it's in the fire that's in the fire is where the humble soft malleable beginnings of the clay are transformed into the new durable substance that becomes indestructive in the fire in the fire is where the soft clay that can be easily messed up that can be easily in the fire is where the transformation takes place in the fire if you're looking at today's Ceramics they're tough and they're strong amen they're similar to to that of a Stone because the clay came in contact with fire that's good come on there are pieces of potery that have survived for thousands of years thousands of years because the clay came in contact with the fire that's good sometimes we're looking and we're not wondering we're we're not understanding what the fire is we don't understand we're trying to get out of the fire but God's molding you Hallelujah and he's not wanting you to be here just today and going tomorrow but the artifacts that we could see from thousands of years ago is because somebody took a piece of clay Hallelujah and they put it in the fire and the fire gave them a resilience the fire made them indestructible thousands of years later we're digging them up come on don't ever don't you don't you ever get discouraged in your training God's calling us to maturity and maturity can only come through the fire amen yes sir now in recent times we've had the the Kel the Kiln and the bricks the ancient times they were sundried and and though it worked for the time the bricks were not strong end durable but when the Kiln was invented this was a major advancement in in the ancient technology and it revolutionized the process because it provided a stronger brick so the brick kle today it it it it's hard they they they that they they make rocks they make the brick they make and it and it's just as hard as a rock as you as get as you as get out there in in in in their you know that you uncover from the earth makes them strong amen and and and it and it it's because of the heat process so a lot of the rock most of the rock that you see this this rock here is fake Rock Amen right is that fake that's not fake okay never mind that's not fake fck amen lot lot of a lot of that stuff today is is is is is is stuff that looks that looks good but they they've done it in the they've done it in the Kil and and and so but in in the Kil is where the the magic of pottery I'm glad we ain't got nothing fake in here amen the pottery uh uh is is uh is it's where it it's where it happens in the Kil is where the magic takes place amen it turns your raw work of art into a finished Masterpiece and there is the process of firing they call it the process of firing that turns the clay into Ceramics now the firing is the process of the clay and glazes it up to a to a high temperature and the final aim to is to heat this object to the point that the clay and the glaze are matured and become one Hallelujah now so you got your Pottery right right you got the you got the potter's wheel the guys doing that and then they then they glaze it and they put the little pretty stuff on it and they they but and that it but it it until until you're until you're ready to go through the fire but when they take that Pottery all of that painting can be washed off all of that stuff can come off that's right we sing you know you're the Potter and I'm the clay amen here here when they go through that process now you don't want to try this at home because amen this this this this this process at home your your stove you know it might get up to $450 deg they they that Kiln they'll heat that up to 1,500 plus degrees and they'll heat it now if they do it too long it'll just disintegrate it right but they stand and they're watching over the Clay they're watching over itlu they're heating it up and right before the Master's eyes the clay and the print is all becoming one Hallelujah right before the Master's eyes as he is watching he knows what he's he's he's done invested all that time and he ain't going to burn that clay up all amen amen but now it's time for the fire and sometimes you're going through the fire on and you don't understand what's going on Hallelujah but I just want to tell you there's that transformation that is taking place the clay is becoming Pottery I I I I I just love it only the Kim can reach the temperatures of over 1,500 degre Fahrenheit amen which is needed you can't do this anywhere else it is a special deal can you say amen and I just want to say when God is putting you through the test God knows what You're Made Of God knows who you are God knows why God knows you may be in the trial of your life maybe you're in can you say amen amen maybe going through the through through through heartache maybe you you may you may be an elder that's saying man I blew it I'm messed up I'm embarrassed I'm this that and the other stand up on the words of God and just remember he's molding his nature he's molding himself in you Hallelujah can you say Amen now all right I'm fixing the clothes amen when you're in that Kil there's many tears pain Agony many sleepless nights but it's in those times when you look and you think I'm understanding a little bit more why Jesus said blessed are you when you're persecuted for my name's sake blessed when you're reviled against blessed when men get jealous blessed when you have been done wrong blessed when people say all manner of evil blessed when you're going through your trial blessed you've been invited you've been invited into God's Kil brother you've been invited it's going to take the suffering I'm not going to Shield you from sh suffering it's going to take the trial I'm not going to I'm not going to Shield you from trial I'm not going to Shield any of you but I promise you you'll come out with character good pre the Apostle Paul or what we read the other night even brother brother random and say is it strange that God wants to develop a Christlike character that comes through suffering no sir we all have trials we all we are all tried chasen his sons not one but goes through that church that is not suffering is not being tried hasn't got it all right it isn't of God all right the Apostle Paul had to be molded there in 1 Corinthians 2 and one it says I Brethren when I came to you came not with the Excellency of speech and of wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of the Lord for I determined not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ and him crucified I was with you in weakness and in fear and much trembling my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom but I did have the demonstration of the power of the spirit of God that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of man but in the power of God Amen can you say amen test trials UPS Downs if I hadn't gone through the testings and trials of my life I wouldn't be the man I am today right I was telling brother Ken the other night we had got into making Sho uh selling shoes and making making some good money and uh you know I'm closing promise and I needed we needed the money and you know the church was poor and and I knew it we could we could definitely put it to good use and uh dad and I went out and bought us some boxes of shoes and came back and we sold our our cases of shoes as a case we'd have 12 box 12 12 pairs of shoes in them but it's in per case and we came out and sold it man dad went went to Street Corner dad dad went over someplace I went someplace and we sold sold them we thought whoa so man we just loaded ourselves back up and went back went went back down to Dallas and picked us up some more before you know it we were doing quite well selling shoes and uh I mean we look like Walmart on Wheels and uh we we'd come in there [Music] so I mean we we' had we had a big old display we had hundreds of boxes you know I mean big old display so I thought man if I'm doing this good I want to get another truck so I go get another truck and another truck so I've got two of these big old U-Haul trucks carrying shoes and then I've got me a big old Ford douly this is one of my business ventures I told you about all the for douly I had a 30 foot I had a 30 foot trailer and uh so we we were we were everywhere well and so dad had came up while I was doing this and dad said wend I don't believe you're in the will of the Lord and I said now dad now you guys can drive y'all's truck truck Singler and I can drive my trucks plural I can make I can make more money I we can bring BR it in I I sort of need it for the church I you know we could use for I mean I I just I it say you're you're putting this before God and you I I just I just don't feel right about it well you know I'd already bought these U-Hauls and and uh and so uh I mean our this was our routine we'd go on Monday ride down to Dallas pick up our our our all of our inventory we'd get back either real late early morning Tuesday morning or uh sometimes get a motel on the way back and then Tuesday we we we divide out all of the all of the stuff and and uh I had I had had mine dad was selling Shawn was selling Jonathan was selling and so we'd go in together and and uh uh make a big big buying buying pull I mean we were we were we were big wigs and um and and so uh we so then Tuesday we'd be getting everything all loaded up Wednesday was church Wednesday night after church we'd be taken off and then we'd sell uh Thursday Friday a little bit on Saturday then we'd have to drive all the way back home late Saturday night preach Sunday and then Monday morning out early heading back to Dallas I mean that's that was that become our routine and no I wasn't spending a whole lot of time with the Lord and I'm saying this to say it was an embarrassing time for me because God was put that situation in my life wanting me to make the right choice but I was putting business ahead of God and so well it wasn't I went down they I when I got the trucks the the guy that was buying the shoes from we were we were his talk top buyers and uh he said listen I'll give you up to $50,000 in uh uh inventory just just load your trucks up he said it's on me I just just pay it whenever you get it and um so I I went down and loading loading the trucks up stocking them up getting everything all ready to go and uh I was excited I was going to make me some money well we done good we did we done good for a couple runs we done we done really well but I had a driver take uh he was I was in Ponka City selling that weekend the driver the driver took it uh another driver was was going up to Omaha Nebraska set up there in Nebraska with with one of those trucks and all set up I mean he was all he was all ready and um well you know um he never came back uh he didn't he didn't he I I was having a hard time calling him didn't come back home on that Saturday or Sunday and and um so Monday I'm still trying to find him and I and um well finally he answers for a moment and he said man I'm messed up and I you know I could could tell he was he he wasn't all there and uh and so he was he was on something so Jesse and I took off up there and and uh drive we went to the police uh we we uh uh when I got a hold of him again he said listen everything's been stolen everything is gone the truck's gone I don't know where it's at it's all gone so he wouldn't tell me where he was at and so went to the police station police said man you're on your own we get the stuff stole around here all the time you're on your own so fresk and I just went to the neighborhood that we thought that he might have been selling in and we we started from there and just crisscrossing every road and Alley and just going back and forth finally we get we get back U we find the truck we find the U-Haul I'm pulling up and I I don't know whether it's booby trapped or what you know but I I I pull up I open the door I mean it's been cleaned out there is nothing there I mean my dollies are gone my tarps are gone all of the equipment's gone they my radio they was even they was trying to take the radio out and So Gone $25,000 go well long story short we got the truck back home and then we went to so then we had the other two trucks going and in Oklahoma City and and I was on one end of town and the other driver was on the other end of town and so we had agreed that we were going to work till it till it was it was cloudy going to be raining I said let's work until the time and then throw tarps over the over the stuff and then we'll we'll we'll pick up afterwards it shouldn't take long and anyways I I I got my stuff picked up before the rain hit and so I'm going over to his spot and it's pouring it's pouring and he's just standing out in the rain and so is my shoes he didn't have his Dolly he' lost it somewhere and lost the tarp somewhere and all of my shoes were ruined I'm looking there and uh I want to get mad I want to get mad at both the drivers but I can't get mad at both the drivers I'm I'm the one that God's molding the character in I'm the one that's getting whooping it was hard digging out of that cuz the guy that loaned me the money well he's going to want his money I didn't have it so I said all right we can do this I'm a big boy we can do this I got out selling and it seemed like the sales just every town we'd go into there' be all of these little guys with little boxes you know I'd come in with my big old rig and they they'd have their little 10 boxes out there and they' just set up all around me wherever I was going they'd have their little boxes and then discount if I'm doing mine for 20 they're doing theirs for 10 so I said all right two can play this game so since I was the big wig of the of the deal there I started slashing prices and that was a bad idea but bottom line was it took me two years before I got that money paid back and it wasn't by selling shoes Austin the Lord was whooping me it was a humbling experience couldn't hold my head up high I knew I was wrong but you know what that experience done for me that experience let me know that God loved me that's right he told my father to warn me I had the I had I had the opportunity to accept or reject and I rejected but the Lord was not going to allow this pastor to be out there when and Sher the responsibilities that I had I had responsibility before God amen so the testings and the trials the situations that I endured and having to dig myself out of that thank God for his grace and helping me to dig myself out of it but it taught me now if it doesn't teach me then what good is the trial that's right but I had it this this was a trial in front of the whole church it was a trial in front of the community it was a trial in front of everyone I had to learn my lesson and I if y'all had time I I could share a bunch of them amen bunch of my stories I'm thankful that God has not just called me and left me but God has promised to mold me and make me I'm thankful to stand here today that he who has begun the good work has been faithful and will be faithful to complete that work in me if the musicians would come trials sometimes can be your best sermon situations sometimes can be your best teacher sermons can be preached but trials is where you [Music] live and God doesn't want us just say an amen to the preacher but God wants that word to becoming part of us and he sends those trials to mature us aren't you glad for a Heavenly Father that'll never leave you nor forsake you he won't leave you he's vow vowed to himself he's made a vow I will not leave you oh son of God oh daughter of God if you feel like you're being whipped by the by the Lord maybe you've
