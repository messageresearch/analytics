door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will sck with him and he with me let's just pray father we love you we desire you Lord would you just feel so welcome in this place lord lord your word says where two or three are gathered in your name you would be in our midst Lord and father you are the reason we are here Lord they didn't come to see me they know I can't sing I can't preach lord I can't do anything Lord I'm just just a clot of clay Lord I just ask you father could you help me Lord could you use me as your instrument tonight Lord would you touch every heart tonight that they could pull on the gift that you put into my life Lord and Lord Jesus that they can increase their faith tonight in this service through the preaching of your word in Jesus name amen God bless you you can be seated you know this scripture is one of the saddest places in scripture uh this this is is one of the hardest times is because Christ was outside the church and and you know man has constantly missed the Lord and it's because he comes so simple that they miss him and you know a lot of times the Lord thinks if God's going to come he's going to come this certain way and because he comes so simple they miss him you know they think it's got to be more complicated to that it's got to be more to it than that but you know I'm going to tell you something the Gospel of Jesus Christ is simple it's a God that loves you you know we were all Fallen toward sin every single one of us we were born in sin we were shaped in iniquity Lord you didn't ask to be born you were chosen and you were chosen for a purpose and you know the God has chosen us because you know in the Garden of Eden God was able to fellowship with man lip to ear there was no hindrance think of it how wonderful it was in the Garden of Eden where God could come down in the cool of the evening and speak to Adam lip to ear absolutely no hindrances but you know God allowed the things that happened with through the through the serpent because God had all these attributes inside him that he desired to unveil himself God had the attribute of being a savior of being a comforter of being a Healer of being all these wonderful things of being a father but you know God being that great spirit he couldn't do that unless it happened you know I had the potential of being a grandfather and praise God in March I'm going to be a grandfather haha praise the Lord I can praise the Lord for that I had the attribute all the time but you know what in order for me to have a grandchild I've got to have a son then that son's got to have another son you know God's the same way God had the attribute inside him to be a Healer a savior a comforter and God allowed the things that took place in life so those things could come out of him and you know there was a a great time of Fellowship that God had with man and we know that the through through the fall of what took place that Fellowship was broken between men where there there no longer man could just come to talk to God freely with lip to ear because of sin had come between man and God but God praise God made a way for man to come back to him back into fellowship with him you know it's not through emotions it's not through Sensations it's through the blood of Jesus Christ you know God that is where God will meet the worshipper is under the blood brother and sister let me let me say this again the gospel is simple God wants to live inside your heart God wants to save you from your sins but not just that God wants to use you you were born for a purpose you are ordained for a purpose every person here you are born for a purpose you can take a seed of an apple and every Apple that will ever be produced from that tree is in that seed already and inside every one of you there's a seed inside that seed is a potential for you to manifest the attributes of God can you say amen I think I just lost myself I just speak louder every seed has the ability inside of it to Bear the fruit that it was ordained to do and every person under the sound of my voice you are born for a purpose God chose you God ordained you for a purpose but you must come God's provided way amen I'm reminded of in the Civil War can y'all hear me at all here we go maybe praise the Lord I'm reminded in the Civil War of his story how a man that was on the on the firing squad and of the of the war and this man was going to to hold his post of Duty but in the midst of his post of Duty he got afraid under Warfare and under this Warfare this man run from his post of Duty and went somewhere else and they caught him and this man was going to die of a firing squad this man was going to die because he when you leave your posted Duty listen to me when you leave your posted Duty you're go you're you're going to have to face consequences and so this man was going to die by a firing squad and he had a good friend that loved him he said you know what my friend is going to die unless I can get to the president so this man run as hard as he could all long to get to President Abraham Lincoln Abraham Lincoln was going down the road and had his Bible in his hand reading his Bible and the soldiers stopped him he said stop right there he said it's so important that I talk to the president tonight he said because if I don't talk to him an innocent man is going to die and Abraham Lincoln waved the man on and he said sir Abraham Lincoln sir I've got a friend who I went hunting with I went squirrel hunting with him he's a good man he's got a family we were on war and he was in the midst of war in the midst of War he got afraid and he run away and he's going to die by a firing squad Abraham Lincoln sir could you please help this man please Abraham Lincoln looked down to his Bible and found a piece of paper and just ripped a small piece of the paper off he says I Abraham Lincoln pardon this man he says thank you sir thank thank you he takes this piece of paper and he runs as fast as he can all the way back to the man standing behind bars the man standing behind there waiting to die there is a firing squad outside the wall he says you're free you're free you're free the man says what do you mean I'm free he said I've been in the presence of the of the president of the United States he has set you free he's given me a pardon to give to you he said get out of here you're making fun of me he said no it's a pardon by the president you're free you're free and the guy said get out of here that was the president of the United States it would be bigger than this there would be a band going through there'd be a big piece of paper there'd be music there'd be this he said get out of here you're making fun of me he says no you're free I'm telling you you're free he said guards get this man out of here they come got the man and he died by firing squad that morning they tried it in the federal courts and come to find out a pardon is only a pardon if it is received as a pardon listen me brother and sisters the Gospel of Jesus Christ is simple it's the blood of Jesus Christ that Jesus died for your sins and you must receive that blood because you know what I'm going to tell you something in the Old Testament when they had the the sacrifice of the Lamb they would bring a lamb that's without blemish and when they brought that lamb before the priest they didn't even look at the worshipper you know what they looked at the lamb that would inspect the lamb to make sure that lamb was perfect because if that lamb was accepted they were accepted I'm here to tell you God don't even look at you God looks at the blood brother and sister and he says because the blood is worthy you are worthy but you got to accept that blood that is your pardon and you say God I believe it I believe your word I accept what you've done for me and God it opens the way of Fellowship for you there's a picture of Jesus that many I'm sure we are probably all familiar with is where Jesus is standing at a door and Jesus is knocking on the door and the holoc critics looked at that and said you know what there's something missing in the picture there's no door knob on this door Jesus is standing at a door and he's knocking on there's no door knob and come to find out he says because the door knob is on the inside and you must accept him from the inside out and that's exactly how it is when Jesus Christ is knocking on your heart you got to receive him from the inside of you you know we can give you the pardon but you got to be the one to receive it and say Lord I accept it you don't have to beg him for it you don't have to bleed on it you don't have to beat on the altar just receive it if you will receive it brother and sister God wants God wants you to have it you know if my son was hungry I'm not going to give him a stone I'm going to give him bread why because he's my son I love him how much more would God give you the eternal life that you desire God died for you that you can have it it's yours accept it amen God wants to work in our life how many of you want God to work in your life I desire I desire God to work in my life he wants to work in your life it comes so simple it's not Dynamic it's not great it's little you know fire is hard to you ever start with big list of blades that hits the ground and catches on fire it usually starts with a little splinter and that little bitty Splinter brother and sister will start a wildfire and all God needs to do is get one soul in his hand that'll get on fire for him and you can set the whole church on fire you can set your whole family on fire you can set your whole community on fire what does it take one Soul one Splinter don't try to be a big log be a splinter cuz listen to me if if God wants you to be a big log he'll make you a big blog but right now you just concentrate on being a splinter and you be the best Splinter that you can possibly be it don't matter what Avenue what position you have in this life you be the best you can be at it if you change oil for a living you change that oil the best you can if you're sweeping floors you sweep it the best you can if you're going to be a bum don't work a day in your life be the best now I'm just going to tell you don't be a bump we'll get you job okay somewhere send me up to service be the best no matter what you're doing do be the best do it heartedly as a to the Lord and not for man brother and sister on a daily basis from the small things to the big things if your physician in the church is to be a doorman of the church listen to me you be the best doorman of the church that you can possibly be if you are a musician in the church and you play the piano if you play the instruments of anything you be the best you can be you sanctify your heart before the service say God use me not just to make a sound not just to be these things but that the anointing of God would flow through my fingers that the anointing of God would flow through my voice that I can break barriers that I can be David that I can slay Goliath that I can do the victory CU listen to me you can do it through Christ that's right brother and sister you can do it you've got a you are ordained for a purpose and whenever you're going through a service and it seems like nothing's moving you can raise your hand say I defy the gravity I'm praising my God my God is worthy of my praise I'm here to tell you you make a woman feel beautiful she'll act beautiful you make God feel like God and God will act like God Amen God wants to act like God more for you than you want him to but you know what he's got a provided way of worship and the thing you got to do is get in the spirit the first thing you can do to receive healing get in the spirit you want Deliverance get in the spirit you want to face Goliath get in the spirit amen shamgar had to get in the spirit amen yes sir God will move on your confession that's right it's the little visitations as I was saying it's little splinters that starts fires and it's the little visitations of the spirit that will cause your Amber to grow it's when that anointing and that spirit will come into your life whether you're doing homework whether you're doing schoolwork whether you're mopping the floor you are sensitive to his spirit because when his Spirit comes down my sheep know my voice and you will hear that voice and you're saying my lord is here see we need to remember that God is a holy God and he and he he deserves our respect no Moses had to take his shoes off of because he was on Holy Ground it wasn't because the mountain was holy it was because God was on that mountain brother and sister and listen me it might be your bcle it might be your car it might be your your in your washroom listen to me you are on Holy Ground because you have Sanctified that place for the Lord and listen to me God will meet you there Jesus will come where he is welcome there was a time and I'm I'm just stepping away from my notes for just a moment Jesus come to a time to where Simon come to him he said Simon or Jesus I want you to come to my house I want you to come Jesus knew what they were going to do to him he will come where he is welcome Simon said come to my house and he know what he did he just put him in a corner somewhere they never washed his feet they never anointed him with oil they never did these things they put him in a corner somewhere think of it the King of Kings come where he was welcome and they put him in a corner listen me brother said how many times do people do that to him we say we want you to come we want you to come and he'll come but what do we do with him when he gets there they put him in a corner and they didn't give him the respect that he was due but here come a little woman praise God she was walking down the street and there was something on the inside of her that was hungering for a move of God there was a deep call to the Deep you know there was something about this woman she recognized the presence of Jesus Christ and that's the thing today brother and sister is recognizing the presence of Jesus Christ not about feelings not about emotions but you see him you hear him there's something inside you so this is Jesus this is him this is Jesus there's so many people that don't recognize him this woman because she approached him in the right way and she humbled herself and washed his feet this woman left with her sins forgiven but brother and sister it's because she recognized the presence of the Lord and she gave him the praise that he was due amen St John 15:16 and uh chapter 15: 16- 17 he says you have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit that your fruit should remain and whatsoever you shall ask of the father in my name he may give it you these things I command you that you love one another if you excuse me just a second I'm about to die up here thank you brother I appreciate that brother I'm justra I'm G to walk around with that GAR in the back of me you have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit
