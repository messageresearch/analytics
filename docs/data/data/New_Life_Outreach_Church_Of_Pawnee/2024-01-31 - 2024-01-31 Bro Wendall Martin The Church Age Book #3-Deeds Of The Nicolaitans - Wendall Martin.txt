seven golden candlesticks I know Know Thy works and thy labor and thy patience and how thou canst be not bear them which are evil and thou Hast tried them which said they are Apostles and are not and has found them liars and has born and has patience for my name's sake has labored and has not fainted nevertheless I have someone against thee because thou Hast left thy First Love remember therefore from whence Thou Art fallen and repent and do the first works or else I will come unto thee quickly and will remove thy Candlestick out of its place except thou repent but this thou Hast that thou hatest the Deeds of the nickan which I also hate he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit sath unto the churches to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of god let's go to the Lord in prayer Lord we just want to thank you today for the many blessings that you have bestowed upon us we thank you Lord for this beautiful weather that we have received this week and we thank you Lord for the sunshine in our souls thank you for this precious message and what it means to us Lord and father father as we're going through some of these things in the church age book lord I I just pray that you would always receive honor and and my desire father is Lord that we can we can see ourselves in the light of of who you created us to be that we can also see the enemy and the tactics that he would try to use against us I pray Lord that you would just let your presence be known and be felt Among Us is our prayer help us now in Jesus name we pray can the church say amen and amen God bless you you may be seated praise the lord well how many's glad you're in church amen praise the Lord I uh before we get started tonight I I ran across um um a a some some uh articles or some posts that that some of us ministers brother brother Tim had had sent to me uh it's been a couple of years back and I and as I was um looking over some um for for this church age the in the church age book and and um I I found some start startling comparisons and and um so as we were talking I was talking with Mom and Dad this morning and it and it sort of triggered um some of these memories how many remembers um how many knows who Carl Williams is y'all amen if you've listened to any of the messages at all um uh Carl Williams was was was a board member um there with the Full Gospel businessman and so um he loved brother Brandon and and uh he would he would U he he would often fight to to have brother brandham to come even when brother brandham um had lost his PO popularity um he he always wanted brother brandham to come and to to minister there in the uh there they in the Full Gospel businessmen's meetings and so uh uh even even when there was other board members that were that were trying to vote to keep brother bradam out because of his his stance on Holiness his stance on on the different things uh of that nature he just he they they they they loved the they they loved his um um you know his um U gift they they love the healings and the Miracles but um so brother brother brother Carl was he he loved brother brandham now brother deas sharen if if uh if you've if you've listened to a lot of the sermons DEA shakarian was the one who started the Full Gospel businessmen and um and so the Full Gospel businessmen is really largely they're they're responsible for for sending brother brandham around the world and a lot of these messages that we hear um uh that that brother Brandon preach you know lots of times you you kids might think that it's all at at random Tabernacle but these are these are sermons that are Prett a bunch of them over in uh uh uh California um um uh Phoenix you know there was places all around and and so brother Branham would be the guest as as brother brandham he wasn't like Oral Roberts and Billy Graham and them who um back in back in the day uh they had to have oh my goodness I I think or Roberts had to have like $3,000 a day um uh whether he was whether he was preaching or wasn't preaching brother BR or brother or Roberts had had um uh so much going on that that he would have to U uh uh he had to be careful where he went to preach um and what he done because he had to have thousands of dollars in in in uh in in one meeting in order to keep afloat so brother bradam didn't didn't do that brother brandham did not want that they wanted to make him that way they they they really wanted um because brother brandham was a very popular man in fact uh when he had went off the scene in in in the early 50s because he was he he got sick um uh when he came back on you know his six or seven months that he was off um the there was a great big vacuum and so when he came back on 7 months later there were dozens of new preachers tent meetings just going everywhere uh uh and these were all healing campaigns and things going on and they say that within the first month of brother brandham back on the field brother brandham was already dominating of the meetings he he he had the largest crowds um and and the supernatural they they said there was no one that could compare the supernatural uh that that could compare with brother brandham Supernatural gift and so um uh so Deus sharan he was the one that and that the the Full Gospel businessman was an organization that was that was broke uh or that was set up that that would just break the denominational barriers Deon sharan had a had a desire to to to to bring to bring in uh the Baptist and the Presbyterian and the Catholic and the Methodist and and bring them all in and give them a chance for the baptism of the Holy Ghost and and it was a quite a successful it was a successful organization and um in fact the Full Gospel businessmen International is still is still uh going today but DEA shakarian um he uh it was it was it sort of they both worked hand in hand because brother brandham made the Full Gospel uh businessmen famous and the Full Gospel businessman uh uh uh organization was the was the vehicle and so uh as brother branam as the people begin to seek for brother brandham and the and the gift and and when he would come in as you know as a household name well uh the Full Gospel businessman was bringing him in and and and brother Brandon was just content come in and and and preach the services they dealt with all the finances he didn't have to deal with anything and U he was receiving his $100 a week uh uh from the uh or the what whatever it was he was getting from the Tabernacle and so he didn't have anything else that he needed besides that but as as the as the seals were open and as brother Brandon began to get very direct in those first in in those last three years of his ministry Deus um begin to to pull back and and and uh because uh he was catching a little bit of flack from from uh the women that as brother brandham was hitting so hard against sin and and and and those kinds of things and um uh and and and we understand that uh Deus just could not he never he couldn't he couldn't uh follow on with the message and or anything else but Carl Williams did Carl Williams loved brother brandham and he he he um appreciated and seen more than a gift and for what brother Carl Williams knew he believed it with all of his heart now his wife uh she was she was a uh she was a total bromite I mean she she loved brother brother Brenham so I I i' so I built the I so I built the platform here for these two men I as as I begin to think this is going to blow y'all away and maybe maybe you guys already know this but now these two guys have got grandchildren brother brother um Carl Williams his his grandson was um uh brother Carl Williams daughter is uh sister was sister Rachel Williams which ended up being Rachel Schultz which goes to brother Tim's Church Jessica Adams and Adam and Anna Boer uh Jessica is married to to Joe Adams um and Anna is married to Craig Bo are our our grandchildren of um of of brother um uh Carl Williams so um let's see am I yes that that's right and so Daniel Williams was Carl Williams uh son Daniel Williams was the one that um that he and brother Tim started the uh the uh Louisiana youth camps many years ago so so here brother Daniel Williams had the burden uh to my my uh oh my batteries are dead on this uh on my inner monitor um the Daniel Williams got with brother Williams and um Wanted to us or or or wanted got with brother brother put I hope I'm not confusing y'all here tonight and and started the started this move so uh uh and and and and I I thought wow what a what a Godly Heritage uh brother Carl Williams his son Daniel Williams doing this his daughter uh had two daughters and and married to Preachers Wives and and quite a oh yeah you're my hero and you know what I'm going to let you do that and um and so um but on the other hand so we we want to look and see what happened to DEA shakarian now every one of you all know who DEA sharan's granddaughter is she is well known she is one that dominates the internet she dominates would y'all like to know who this woman is Kim Kardashian the scripes Kim Kardashian with all the filth and the vulgar and the and has led thousands millions of souls to Hell the Kardashians are the grandchildren of deus shakaryan now the Tail of Two Men the tale of two men both of them in the presence of a prophet one went to Great popularity one went higher in riches the other one took the sight of a prophet and The Souls of Daniel by Daniel Williams that that can you imagine these last 30 years of of kids that have been filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost in that in that Louisiana Youth Camp what about what about Joe Adams and and and Craig Boer incredible ministers in this message wonderful men of God and the heritage is still going on yes now I want there there was an article and those of you that don't know who who uh how how many knows who Kim Kardashian is that's Kim Kardashian this this is this is her and she's got she's got uh she's got sisters and and they've got that she's she was the number one the highest paid um a reality show star and she's got you know they they they made bukus of money Kim Kardashian there was an article that was written how many wants to hear a little story amen now this was written I I I we I I just looked at this this was written probably 10 years ago and so this this news article Kim Kardashian 34 is an American TV celebrity most famous for her reality TV show Keeping Up with the Kardashians she was rumored red it was rumored that she had was the highest paid reality star uh at the time she has since branded out uh branched out to to other TV programs movies and the retail fashion industry her father Robert Kardashian is a third generation American Armenian and most famous for his role in helping defend the former M NFL star OJ Simpson in his notorious murder trial in 1995 research by The Daily Mail has recently uncovered a strange story of how a prophetic word by an an 11e old boy saved Kim's family on her father's side from The Armenian Genocide the Kardashian family originated in in Russia and at that time had the last name Cardis Goofs sometime in the mid to late 1800s they moved to the Village of of kacel in in present day Turkey it is found near Mount erat considered the resting place of Noah's Ark the family was considered religious Rebels as they did not belong to the Russian Orthodox church but instead favored the Protestant Group malikan which uh translated means milk lovers they were tagged with it with the name because the Russian Orthodox fast days uh they drunk milk which was forbidden the Russia the Russian Orthodox Church branded them as Heretics and Heavenly persecuted the group the particular uh Mullan group the Kardashian family belonged to was impacted by an outpouring of the holy spirit in 1833 as a result their services uh their services took on a very Pentecostal flavor including raising their hands in worship and dancing jumping prophecy and other Holy Spirit manifestations there was also a release of Miracles said to rival that of the early in the early church one person influenced by this outpouring was etham clenin during the 1850s as a as an 11-year-old boy he received a prophetic Revelation that many Armenians would die unless they fled the area to a land across the great ocean he said those who believe in this will go on a journey to a far land and while the unbelievers will remain in place our people will go on a long journey over the great and deep Waters people from all countries will go there there will be a great War all Kings will shed blood like Great Rivers two steamships will leave the uh to cross the impassible ocean and though the molans believed in Prophecy because it came from a boy it was basically ignored however in 1901 epim now grown called a meeting of the Elders of the Mullan churches and villages in these areas surrounding caracelli and he reminded them of the prophetic word he received 40 years earlier he told them that decades old prophecy would soon come to pass and people needed to leave he added to uh uh two further Revelations one was a warning that there was a small window of opportunity the Armenians needed to move quickly because the government would soon close the door to the people leaving the country the second what was that there was not only they was not only to go to the US but to America's West Coast used and used a crudely drawn map to point to California over the next decade or so about 2,000 Armenians obeyed the prophecy abandoned their homes fled to America and those who stayed behind mock the families as they departed 1913 Kim's great-grandfather tatos Kardashian then 17 headed on a steamer to America following his parents who had left a few weeks earlier to Los angelist he would eventually marry a fellow Armenian and malikan Refugee Hamas hamus shakarian those who left avoided The Armenian Genocide of uh of 1915 to 1923 where it's estimated the Turks slaughtered upwards towards 1.5 million Armenians the World War I between 2 uh 1914 to 1918 and then and the 197 Russian Revolution what I found unusual is why the prophecy told them specifically to go to the US West Coast the answer to that question may lie in the isusa street Pentecostal Revival that took place place in Los Angeles between 1906 and 1915 because of their previous experience with the Holy Spirit the mikans in both Doctrine and spirit played an important role in this Holy Spirit outpouring which sparked the worldwide Pentecostal movement Kim's great great-grandfather DEA shakarian father of Tat's wife hamus was a famous Pentecostal preacher in Los Angeles and his grandson was given the same name and followed his grandfather in Ministry deas shakarian who was born in 1913 founded the Full Gospel businessmen's Fellowship International in 1952 and though the uh the ruling otoman government was Islamic many believe the motivation behind the Armenian Genocide was largely political political versus religion uh according to the history.com this resentment was compounded by suspicious that the Christian Armenians would be more loyal to Christian governments that of uh the Russians for example who shared um an unstable border with turkey that were to be uh that were to the ottoman kif CIF so so I so we'll just stop we'll just stop right there so Kim Kardashian is the granddaughter of deus shakar and you you you look at that because Deus seen the the the gift of God in brother bradam but he did not follow on with the word in fact in fact it has been said that that uh uh that that uh Deus has had had had before he had passed away had made major public statements that the that the Roman Church and and the and and the pope was was um uh a sin of God and and and all of these things there because they refused to accept what God had sent isn't that just amazing I I thought y'all might enjoy I thought y'all might enjoy that tonight listen it matters how you raise your children and it matters it matters that you get a revelation you young people get a revelation don't hey we're not we're not this this message is not just another opinion that that we're all that that we're all proud of and that we you know this just makes us all unique listen this is the very word of God this is what God promised to do I will send you Elijah the prophet and I will turn your hearts back to the Bible and brother I believe it 1,000% I believe it 1,000% and to see that these two men and what has happened to their grandchildren amen I I I was I was just blown away I was blown away when I seen it a couple years ago and then and and when I came back across it uh I I had I had saved it because I was wanting to read it and I thought hey well here we are in the church ages this is it was just saved for this time amen and so now you you young people uh uh I hope um the Kardashian Ian are not Heroes of y'alls amen the the Kardashians should never be a girl's hero I know they're pretty and they and and they are they're pretty amen but they're leading a lot of people to Hell leading a lot of people to Hell amen so we we talked last week on this uh uh on on the church ages and and and just really dealt last week with with that first love that love for God I want to to deal tonight a little bit on the the Deeds of the nicians and I don't know if y'all y'all felt the presence of the Lord last Wednesday night just just the the sweetness of God's spirit comes down and and and and it's just like God saying I I I want to I want to be loved and I want I want I want to love you I want you to feel my love and and and brother Brandon put it so beautifully and so I I I I want us to remember now what brother bradam in the church age book how how many's been uh reading on your church age book this week oh my goodness now listen we're teaching on the church ages so you need to be listening or reading uh uh the church age book uh uh or or the church ages um but but God's desire was for a people that he could live in Express himself through brother brandom put it put it very beautifully he says um and and and we've we've already read this and I I and if we take too much time going back over some of this other stuff um I we won't be able to get too much oh let's go for it let let's go to uh page 257 amen uh I loved brother I love what brother brandom had said here on um uh page uh 257 and we're going to go all the way down to the to the last paragraph and when you're there you can say amen amen he says now I wish I could say that the sardian age was a restoration instead of a Reformation I cannot say that the word does not call it a restoration but but certainly calls it a Reformation had it been a restoration the age would have been another Pentecostal age that's that's just beautiful isn't it but it was not the best could be said of it was strengthen that which remains that is ready to die there was something missing my yes there certainly was this age had justification but it had Miss s it had justification but it had Miss sanctification in the baptism with the Holy Ghost that was God's original plan and the reason I'm want I'm going back to this tonight is I want you to keep that in mind that was God's original plan they were Justified they were Sanctified they were filled with the Holy Ghost why listen to me the reason somebody say the reason for being justified and Sanctified is to the end that you might be baptized Ed with the Holy Ghost this is the reason there is a church it is the temple of God filled with God even the Holy Ghost The Same Spirit that was in Jesus while he was here on Earth causing him to do the mighty Works which he did uh came back upon the church at Pentecost so that they did this The Works that he did this age did not have those works oh they had the written word but not the revealed word this was a Reformation period but little but fear not little flock God said I will restore this reform was going to be the start of it it was going to according to his promise take the church back from the depths of Satan in the dark ages to the depth of God they had at Pentecost and in the first few years of the existence of the church so so he's going to so his desire desire his whole desire is to take us out of the depths of Satan and bring us in to the depths of God that they had at Pentecost now that is what God had in mind all along that's the model church and that's the reason why brother bradam says the church that every age wants to be is that first church that original church at the very beginning can you say Amen now now brother brandham would would would also he he would say that you are another creation you're a you're a creation of himself and that God and man has joined and that that you are that he was the first of the new race and and and and His glory was was to be upon you now while you're still there in that um um let's see um while we're still there in in the sardian church age uh 250 and and um well we're let's see um I've got 250 and it'll be the second paragraph it says yes the spirit is not seven spirits but one he will always be the same and act the same the seven Messengers will have the same spirit and teach the same word and have the same power and if the church is the true church it will have the very same spirit and word and acts of power they had at Pentecost and by experience it will be a Pentecostal Church there will be tongues interpretation prophecies healings God will be in the midst of her and God will declare himself in the midst of her as he always has Hallelujah she will be unorganized unorganized don't forget that can you say Amen so we we don't want to we don't want to to to forget that now Satan his desire was to cool the church now we're going to be reading tonight and and we're going to start about page 83 and um yeah it was 250 was 279 in the grounds oh oh in the are you in the I got was I in 251 oops sorry um man those those those new books are are are killers and I've got and what I've got to do is um um the next time I will I will try to get everything that I'm going to be reading and try to find the pages for those new books too either that or you all need to order y'all some blue books amen voice of God still still has blue books and uh uh now you're having to pay a lot of money for these things these days I I don't know what' you pay for yours huh 7 750 so so you're know used to you used to get them for like uh$ two or three doll so so you're paying a little bit of money for him but I'm I'm here to tell you you'll never own outside of the Bible you'll never own a greater book than this right here amen that's right so so the the desire okay so um okay let me get you guys on the right let's okay so if I if I told you all 83 let's see where I'm at um okay so it is under Christ Praises his own Christ Christ Praises his own and there will be a total 1 2 3 4 five 6 there there will be we will be in the eighth paragraph from uh where where it says Christ Praises his own so those of you all who have the the other books um that that'll give you something now huh oh 80 81 oh boy okay oh well Christ Praises his own there's where we start we're starting right there sorry guys oh boy okay so um okay so now I I want you to we we got to catch this we we got to catch this because we don't want to fall into the Trap that Satan has got Satan wants this church formal he wants this church powerless he wants us to be content with this and we don't want this we can't not even these Wednesday nights we don't want it here we want it here amen and that's what what Satan was trying to do we we're going to deal here tonight on the nicians amen thou hatest the Deeds of the nicians now now the nicians were were were some men that were among them in the church who were trying to usurp their Authority claiming to be Apostles um and and and the word nickan simply means niiko is to conquer uh letin means to the Ley it was an invasive spirit that was that was um that brother badam says was not even a Doctrine it wasn't a teaching it wasn't but these were Deeds these these were these were so minuscule it just they they were actions that were trying uh to to put men ahead of the word of God now they weren't they weren't they weren't taken away from anything the Apostle Paul said they they weren't doing that but but some of their actions were just sort of defying what what the Apostle Paul was putting in there they were they were they were organizing men and and and and trying to put things together trying to help God out they they they they were tired of persecution and they were trying to make the gospel more appealable to others and so so these men there was just some men that were that were trying to help God out amen and Buddy the Bible says that that that they um as we're fixing to read here they the church wasn't going to have it so let's start here let's let's look here in in Ephesians uh or in um uh page 81 under Christ Praises his own Revelations 2 and 2 I Know Thy works and thy labor and thy patience how thou canst not bear them that are evil thou Hast tried them which say they are Apostles and are not thou Hast found them liars and hasth borne and has patience and for my name's sake hasth labored and has not fainted now we we read some of this this portion of it the other night but I just we're just going to do here to get going how beautiful how how beautiful the Savior praises and commends his children he takes full account of their spiritual attitudes and behavior he knows that there is weakness among them but as yet he does not cry out against it isn't that just like the Lord he knows how to encourage us in the right matters and discourage Us in the wrong matters we could all learn a good lesson right here in running the church and our families and better still we could all learn a good lesson and that God deals with each of each one of us in the exactly this way don't ever be discouraged saing of God for God is not ungracious to forget your labors of love where whatever we do even giving a cup of cold water has a reward and a blessing from the Lord I Know Thy work Works thy labor thy patience he walks in the midst of the church he is aware of the suffering of his people he cares it it was as it was in the days of the Captivity in Egypt when he heard their cries he who never changes still hears the cries of the oppressed as he walks among them the very word labor signifies weariness through oppression God's people do not only work for him in a labor of love but they suffer for him with joy they are patient and bearing the Yoke the first aid suffered great persecution it had to work it had to work hard to preach the gospel and shed forth the truth and their calling their High Calling in life was to serve God and when their hopes in life were blighted they were patient and committed all to him and who had promised a lasting recompense in heaven for what they had given up for him on Earth I love that I love that line right there I think we ought to stop here and and deal with the thought that God's people have always been and always will be persecuted you know that Genesis is the book of beginnings and when you find uh what you find started right uh there will carry right on through the Revelation and never change and there we can see that uh there we see that Cain persecuted and killed Abel because the latter pleased God then we see the perfect picture in Abraham's son of the flesh ish who teased and fought the son of the promise Isaac there was Esau who hated Jacob and would have killed him had not God intervened in the New Testament we find Judas betraying Jesus while the religious orders of the first century attempted to destroy the early Believers the children of this world controlled by the devil hate the children of God who are controlled by the spirit no matter how just and upright a Christian is before the public and how gracious he is to his fellow man doing not but good let him confess that Christ confess Christ as his Savior and acknowledge the operation of the gifts of the Holy Ghost in tongues prophecy healing Miracles and he will be condemned the spirit of this world hates the spirit of God because it can't overcome the spirit of the Lord it tries to destroy the vessel in whom the spirit of Truth dwells that's powerful that's powerful persecutions and trials are a natural normal part of the Christian Life there is only one thing that you can you can do about them commit them all to God judge not and leave their outworking and final judgment to him thou cast not bear them which are evil thou Hast tried them which say they are Apostles and are not and thou Hast found them Liars these Ephesians believe that God's people ought to be holy according to this verse they Tau steps to keep the body unleavened from sin most evidently the apostasy had already started sin had entered into the church but they were obedient to the words of Paul when he said to put away the wicked from amongst them and they were a separate people they had come out of the world and now they weren't going to let the world enter amongst them they would not put up with sin in the church Holiness wasn't a phrase with them or a figurative speech it was a way of life how many can say amen amen they believed it now now I want you to catch this yet the Deeds were coming among them and when they seen it they were still standing this is where the two trees are fixing to start coming up amen thou has tried them that say they are Apostles and N not not and has found them Liars my that is a blunt statement thou has tried them who call themselves Apostles isn't that presumptuous what right has a people to try those who call themselves Apostles how do they try them oh I love this here here it is in Galatians 1 and8 but though we are an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have already preached unto you let him be accursed it was the apostles who brought the original word to the people that original word could not change somebody say could not change not even a DOT or a dash of it Paul knew it was of God who had spoke it to him so he said even if I come and try to give a second Revelation try to make one little change in what I've already uh gave originally let me be a curse first you see Paul knew the first revelation was correct Co God can't give a first revelation and then a second Revelation if he did he would be changing his mind he can give a revelation and then add to it as he did in the Garden of Eden when he promised the seed to the woman and then later designated the seed uh designated that seed had to come through Abraham and then later said it would come by the Bloodlines in David but it was the same Revelation it only gave the people more information to help them receive and understand it God's word can't change the seed came exactly as revealed Hallelujah so what those false apost what were those false Apostles doing they came with their own word and those Ephesians knew that word as Paul had taught it uh those PE knew that word as Paul had taught it they were full of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of Paul's hands they looked those false Apostles in the eye and said you're not saying what what Paul said you are their false oh that sets my heart on fire get back to the word it is not you that really tries the Apostle and prophet and teacher it is the word that tries them and I don't care who it is I don't care I don't care who it is that wants to come in and try to tell us well brother brandham don't mean that or no no no no no no no no brother brandham was a prophet to bring us back to the original thus saeth the Lord and how are you going to try Amen brother bam just he just gave it it's not you that tries the Apostle the prophet and the teacher it is the word that tries them and so that's what we've got to do when people say well we don't believe in that we don't believe in the moving of the spirit oh we we're beyond that brother brandom didn't say it we're not we're not accepting that well we don't believe in uh uh well you got to you got to shut your church down and and and live stream Jeffersonville that's not the original we're not going there well well you don't want to no no no no no God has sent us the word of life and you must believe every word of it every word of it can you say Amen we we we don't get to pick and choose what we want we don't get to do that but I promise you if you will accept the word the way the prophet gave it and way the Bible gave it it'll be the same Pillar of Fire coming down and backing that word up in your life Hallelujah I would rather oh my could could you imagine can you imagine what is going on in glory right now amen we've got we've got a Dema sharen that's went to his rewards and we've got a and we've got a Carl Williams who's went to his rewards and to know that that reward is going given and given and can you say Amen all right amen it says one of these days there's going to be a prophet to the Le odyssean Church age and you will know if he's a real one sent from God or not yes you will for if he is of God he will be in that word exactly as God gave it to Paul he won't deviate from that word for a moment not by one iota in this last age when there will be many false prophets appearing watch and see uh how they'll keep telling the people that if they don't believe them and what they say you will be lost but when the last day Prophet comes on the scene if he is truly that prophet he will be crying back crying out get back to the word or you are lost ye won't build on a private Revelation or interpretation of the word amen and amen now I want I want us to listen here now brother brandham is is pointing the two out now he says he says the false prophets he says watch and see how they'll keep telling and and I'd encourage you to mark that write that back in the in matters of fact if you mark that and put that in the fly leaf back of your Bible your your book it it'll be a blessing because brother brandham does hit it a couple times how that that that these men these false ones will draw people to themselves matters of fact uh hold that place cuz we're going to we're going to do some reading there let let me let me get down to this real quick Hallelujah I'm going to I'm going to read a couple of more places to you amen hallelujah oh man I thought I I thought it was it was closer than that guys hallelujah amen okay let's let's look here real quickly um hold your place we're coming back uh let let's go to um you know what guys I don't even have the page number on that all G it I it's let let me let me it's it's it's in it's around 350 I know that praise the Lord and what it is is the people who bind themselves preachers who bind themselves to them with fear by fear um if someone's got just get well you won't be able to help me on that one neither uh just because I don't you don't give the page numbers okay um well I'm looking I thought would have had it marked okay well um sorry guys I'm want to read it to you anyways all right and then um um and then put this this in your put this in your book put or and and and and and what is what is so nice is what I do is I'll take I'll take this this area you know if I'm reading a certain thing and and then it's in and it happens in another chapter then I go and write it back down and that way I can I can I can just keep tabs of a lot of that but here's what brother brandham said he says now in every case you will notice and this is in the Le oysan Church age I thought it was it's in the 300s I thought it was somewhere around the 350 it's under the it's under the messenger section okay let me let me look here I bet if I can narrow that down praise the Lord praise the Lord I cannot believe that I don't have that marked if I do then it's uh huh it is marked and it's 330 not 350 330 okay and we're going to go now this is one in this this is one huge it's the the whole page is one paragraph okay so you're going to go down to the it's it's below the second half um if you cut your page in half we're not going to read the whole thing um you you'll see if if you do it in half it'll be right there at 1 Timothy 4:1 do youall see that all right now the spirit speaketh expressly that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith giving heeds to seducing Spirits doctrines of devils now in every case you will notice that a false prophet is one that is outside the word just as we have showed you that Antichrist means anti- word so these false prophets come perverting the word giving it a meaning that fits their own devilish ends have you ever have you ever noticed how that people who lead others asay bind them closely to themselves by fear saying that if the people don't do what they say or if they leave then destruction will follow they are false prophets for a true Prophet will always lead one to the word and by B the people to Jesus Christ he will tell the people to fear he will not tell the people to fear Him or what he says but to fear what the word says can I hear a great big amen now that's what we put we do not the ministry we do not lead by fear say Satan and and and husbands hear me and and and the way you handle your children and the way you handle your wife Satan Works Satan works by force God is a shepherd He is not a cowboy you drive cattle but you lead sheep that's right if you want your family to follow then then then you cannot be a driver you've got to be amen a a leader now I and and I'm I'm not going to uh uh brother brother Brandon this is in th in the th tyan Church age guys I I wouldn't I I just put these the these are in my notes i' I've got 59 pages of notes and I was not planning on reading this but it just hit me as we looked at this all right I'll get I'll get some of these the pages to you it says remember this is the false Vine let it name the name of the Lord it does so only in a lie it's headship is not of the Lord but of Satan and it finally ends up completely identified with the Beast the wh riding on the Scarlet Beast distinctly shows her power is the god of force Satan and not our God the Lord Jesus Christ can can you say Amen so so now brother brandham is is is is showing us that we are not to there is there is force that's that the Holy Spirit don't even for he is a gentleman we are gentle we follow the leadership you've got to follow him because you love him that's right amen can can you say amen and so as Ministers of the Gospel I I I am I am not to force my own way and and there's many of times I know destruction is going to come and I give the warning and I and I show but I can't I I I can't go out there and slash tires and and and uh take the gas out of the card and so no if you've got true leadership respect that leadership don't walk over a good man well praise the Lord that goes for pastor that goes for husband that goes for parents if you've got good leadership then honor that and respect that because they truly have your interest in mind that's right they're not they're not beating you and demanding and telling no no no no no no they're trying to lead you in a certain direction and we want to have that we want to be led of the Lord Jesus amen all right so let's go on praise the Lord now um let's see are we in that first paragraph yet he say now these these false Apostles are the Grievious wolves we're back on 84 and the first paragraph I don't include the one that was up above it that was part of the LA last page these false Apostles are griev wolves that Paul spoke of he said once I'm gone they will try to come and claim equal Revelation but their purpose is not to help you but destroy you acts 20:27 for I have not shun to declare unto you all the counsel of God take heed therefore unto yourselves and to all and to all the flock over which the Holy Spirit hath made you overseers to feed the Church of God which he hath purchased with his own blood for I know this that after my departure my departing shall Grievous wolves enter in among you not sparing the flock also of your own selves shall men arise speaking perverse things their own word and ideas and not Gods to draw away disciples after them therefore watch and remember that by the space of three years I cease not to warn everyone night and day with tears and now brethren I commend you to God and to the word of his grace which is able to build you up and to give an inheritance among all them which are Sanctified you know when I read that with tears can't you hear Brother brandom those last few years couldn't you hear his heart just a crying saying don't go into that system don't go I'm begging you in the name of the Lord stay out of that world Council of churches you could hear the Holy Spirit crying through that Prophet yes sir he says John knew of them also that uh for he said there in 1 John 4:1 many false prophets are already going into the world that Antichrist Spirit was already infil the church infiltrating the church and it was doing it by going against the word why here is where it all started right here in the first Church age already they were denying the word setting up their own Creeds and philosophies instead of the word this is Antichrist for Jesus is the word and to be anti- is to be Antichrist to be anti- is to be Antichrist because the spirit and the word are one if you are anti- word you will have to be Antichrist if it started in the first age it will have to grow until the end when it takes over and that's exactly what what you will see as we cover all the ages it starts out real small in the Ephesian age and it grows in every age until the anti- word Antichrist system takes over entirely and the infallibility of the word is repudiated by by false prophets and and of the false church now it is easy to get the wrong impression of what we are talking about because I'm making this so strong it could sound to you as though this is anti- anti- though this anti- word Antichrist is completely repudiation a complete repudiation of the word a denial of the Bible culminating in its rejection no sir it is not that what it is is Revelations 20 and 18 for I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book If any man shall add unto these things God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book If any man shall take take away from the words of the book of this prophecy God shall take away his part out of the book of life out of the holy city and from the things that are written in this book it is it is the changing of just one word by taking away or adding to it it is the original trick of Satan in the Garden of Eden he just added one little word to what God had said that did it it brought death and destruction and in Ephesus it was just the same just a word added just a word taken away and the anti- word anti-christ Spirit begin to flourish now now do you did you catch that we don't want to add to we don't want to take away we got to keep it exactly like God said because his words are Eternal he wants a church a word church that he can flow through as I was saying last Wednesday night now now we can't just say that and and we're sitting in a church and we're just say man we got all kinds of Revelation we've got to put this into action outside the doors everything we do outside those doors should be in the word temper shouldn't be flaring because that that's not the way it should go amen bad deals or or Shady deals should not be done there should there should be a reality of that word in our lives because one iota out of place will keep the Holy Spirit from his gift in you that's right can you say amen amen now he says he says do you get it now there are those there are those twins again there are those two trees again growing side by side in the same Earth and taken uh partaking of the the same nourishment drinking in the same rain benefitting from the same Sun but they come from different seeds one tree is for the word of God exactly as God gave it and loves and obeys it the other tree is from the seed that is anti the word of God and changes it where it wants to it substitutes its own Creeds dogmas for for the living true word exactly as it did Cain who ended up killing Abel but fear not little flock stay with the word keep that word between you and the devil Eve did not do that and she fell and when the church lets down on the word she goes into the depths of the darkness of Satan and has borne and has patience and for my name's sake has labored and has not fainted now this is just about the same as the verse as as was said in verse two but in verse two the work labor and patience were from guarding the separate the the sacred word which was committed unto them how they kept away the adversaries what a credit they were to Paul but in this verse their persecutions and trials and Patience are over the Blessed name of Jesus you know that it's not you know that it is not at all strange for this uh for it is the word and the name that brings the enemy pouring after us like a flood that Mighty word which was manifested in healing signs wonders and other demonstrations caused the Pharisees to scream out for the death of the True Believers now that name hated and despised by the Jews is mocked by the culture as they laughed to think anyone could be so foolish as to believe in a man who died and rose again and is now seated in heaven so here were the religious persecutors the Jews cursing this Jesus who to them was a false Messiah and here were the others laughing with delight and mocking sarcastically at the name of a new God who to them wasn't a god at all now here is something else that started in the age in that age and we'll continue right on down Through the Ages and get deeper and darker that is people were repudiating that name it was not the true Ephesian church that was doing it no sir it was the false prophets it was The Outsider trying to get in and defile the Believers the Ephesians knew that name and loved it recall the origin of of the Ephesian church a little group of people who were looking for the Messiah heard that a prophet who called himself the Forerunner of the Messiah and had appeared in the desert of Palestine and was baptizing people under repentance and then these re received the baptism of John but when Paul come to them he showed them that the prophet was dead and that Jesus had come and fulfilled his life as a sacrifice for sin and that now the Holy Ghost was come and would enter in and fill all the True Believers in Jesus the Messiah when they heard this they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus and when Paul had laid his hands upon them they were all filled with the Holy Ghost they knew what it was to obey the word to be baptized in His Name Lord Jesus Christ and in that way they knew they would be filled with the Holy Spirit you could not get that people to change they knew the truth Acts 19 And1 they knew the power of that name they saw the name was so powerful that even aprons taken from the body of Paul and sent in Jesus name to suffering people could deliver the sick from all manner of diseases and cast out evil spirits so manifestly wonderful did the name perform the repeate Jews at Ephesus attempted to use it to uh to exercise devils and Acts 19 And1 and God wrought special Miracles by the hand of Paul hands of Paul so that from his body were taken under this sick handkerchiefs and aprons and diseases departed from them and evil spirits went out of them then certain of the Vagabond Jews and Exorcist took upon them to call over them which had the evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus saying we ad jur thee by Jesus whom Paul preacheth and there were seven sons of of onekea a Jew a chief of the priest which which did so and the evil spirit answered and said Jesus I know and Paul I know but who are you and the man in whom the evil spirit was was leaped on them and overcome them and prevailed against them so that they fled out of that house house naked and wounded this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling in Ephesus and fear fell on them all and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified can you say amen amen so we want to we we want to have we we want to have that that life within us can you say amen amen now let's let's read uh uh uh are we doing all right am I read reading too much all right well let's let's go ahead and let's let's let's cover some more territory here this is this is wonderful praise the Lord amen they they knew the righteous life that accompanied the bearing of that name for whosoever nameth the name of the Lord let him depart from sin be ye holy ye that bear the vessels of the Lord Thou shalt not bear the name of the Lord thy God in vain these Ephesians were Christians they bore a name that name was Christ who was who was uh the spirit of God within them which was one of the three-fold names of their lord and for not my for my name sake uh Hast labored and Hast not fainted these believers were laboring for Paul were uh weren't laboring for Paul or for any organizations they weren't committed to programs institutions whereby they built up Holdings of value they worked for the Lord they were his servants not the pwn of organizations they didn't go to church on Sunday and talk about that name and then forget about it the rest of the week they didn't give lift surface to that name no sir it was their lives that were given all they did they did in the name in that name in that name they acted and if they could not act in that name then they refrained from acting they were Heavenly placed Christians whose Behavior was in their lord now I'm going to read that to you again these were Heavenly placed Christians whose Behavior was in the Lord but that false group that false Vine group wanted to defile that name and they hung like suling wolves in the dark waiting to get in and tear down but the Saints stood the test kept the word and in uh and the name Revelations this is the complaint of God Revelations 2 and 4 nevertheless I have somewhat against thee because thou Hast left thy First Love now we went over some of this the other night um but I don't think that we read um much of this here so I'm going to go ahead and read uh do you all have any of this marked up in your books so maybe we didn't read this part yes okay okay so we so we we done that last week okay all right you know if we did um um it it would save us some time if if we went through that um cuz I my deal is I want to get to the nians tonight if we can I want to I want to hit I want to at least get into the nicians and um um and and so I want I want a few minutes for that um let's read a little bit of it and then um it says nevertheless I have somewhat against you because you left your first love to understand this you must realize the spirit is not speaking to the original Saints of Ephesus alone this message is to the entire age which lasted 120 years years his message then is to all generations in that span Now history keeps repeating itself in the generations of Israel we see Revival in one generation only to see the fires fading in the next in the third Generations yes I'm glad we're reading this in the third generation Embers may be glowing slightly but in the fourth there may not there may be no vestage uh whatsoever of that original Flame then God lights the fire again and the same process is repeated it's simply the manifestation of the truth that God has no grandchildren salvation is not passed on by natural birth anymore than is there any truth to Apostolic secession it isn't in the word you start out with truly boring again Believers and the Next Generation comes along and they are no longer just plain Christians but they have taken a denominational name and they're now Baptist methodists and I want to add message Believers Etc that that is exactly what they are too they're not Christians they have to be born of the will of God not the will of man to be saved but these folks are all coming together now by the will of man I don't say that some of them aren't right with God not for a minute do I say that but the original fire has died down and they are not the same anymore the fervent desire to please God the passion to know his word the cry for reaching out in the spirit all begins to fade and instead of the church being on fire with God it has cooled off and become a bit formal and that's what was happening back to the Ephesians they were getting a bit formal the abandonment to God was dying out the people weren't too careful about what God thought of them as they begin to as as they begin to be careful about what the world thought of them that second generation coming on was just like Israel they demanded a king to be like the other nations and when they did that they rejected God but they did it anyway that is the history of the church when it thinks more of conforming to the world instead of conforming to God it isn't long until you see them stop doing things they used to do and start doing things they wouldn't do initially they changed the manner of dress their attitudes their behavior they get LAX that is what Ephesus means relaxed drifting the cycle of Revival and death has never failed all you have to do is recall the last move of God in the spirit uh uh move of God in the spirit when men and women dressed like Christians went to church prayed all night took to the street corners weren't ashamed of the manifestations of the spirit they left the cold the old dead churches worshiped in homes and storefronts or or in in Old store buildings they had reality but it wasn't too long a time until they begin to get cold enough or get enough money to build fine new churches and they put in a choir instead of singing unto God for themselves they put gowns on the choir they organized a movement and ran it by man they soon began to read books that weren't fit to read they let down the bars and the goats come in and took over the Cry Of Joy was gone the freedom of the spirit was gone oh they kept on with the form but the fire had died down and the Blackness of the ashes is all is about all that is left now brother this this last page and a half that we just read is so important I remember when I I had to have something in my heart I was in Pentecost I was looking for something I was searching I I needed something you you take you take people that that were out there that came out of uh uh sin so bad when God touched them they had to have a change the danger is you kids you kids sitting here in in and raised up in church you can you can get content and say I'm a Christian because I believe in a prophet I'm a Christian because I you've got to have you were born Sinners you you you your mom and dad might be Christians but you're still born a sinner your mom and dad ain't teaching you how to lie how to steal gum your mom and dad ain't teaching you how to your mom and dad ain't teaching you how to how to look at things on the internet when you shouldn't and and and those kinds that is part of who you are you're a sinner right here until the new birth comes and there is where there must be a real deep desire saying Lord I need to be saved I need the real baptism ISM of the Holy Ghost can you say Amen now I heard a preacher say the other day and it and it's one of those nickon type preachers uh you know he's up there he's up there preaching and said now now my dad my dad had to have it he my he was he says but he when he come in he had to have his world changed he said I didn't have to have mine changed I was born with uh uh with with with the Holy Spirit in my life and I'm thinking huh and it's that kind of teaching right there that'll cause young people to miss the Rapture that's right we cannot for a minute say that I'm okay I'm okay friends if the Holy Spirit and what you're hearing in this and and what we're reading in these in this church age book and what if if there's not something that's convicting you you can come to the Lord and say Lord I want I want a new birth I I I want that craving down deep in my heart I want the power of the Holy Spirit to live through me come on now if you don't have that conviction that when you're R flapping your jaw and or you've got your bad attitude and you don't have a conviction that is saying uh Wendell you need to straighten it up when H if you don't have that kind and you're able to justify your wrong when the scripture says and you're able to say well no no no no no no not Christians Christians don't want nothing to do with that Antichrist Spirit that's right Christians wants to be free from that thing I don't want no interpreter of the Antichrist telling me I'm okay and this is just no I want the power of the holy ghost in my life I want the Holy Ghost living in me can you say amen and so so this is this is so real this is so true amen I I I believe there should be a desire for Souls there should brother brandom says did did not brother brandham tell us that that that one of the the signs of the Holy Ghost is it is a crying and sighing for the sin that is done in the city amen I tell you talking to a little bit uh to to the young people last night at at at the Bible study they were gracious enough to to to to to listen to me for a little while and and but but I but I told them you know my in my early walk with God how content I was with and how much I loved him and how much I I wanted to tell the others about who what I had it it was it was it was crazy but but my my wife and I I mean she was I was 16 and she was 15 and and my my brother and sister W uh would would have to tag would tag along with us and but all of our dates we were all over the hills of kinwood talking to somebody else about Jesus and we'd go we wanted to fight I'd go to the roughest place around I i' I'd go the people were there drinking and and I just go right in the middle of them and just tell them the Lord can save you the Lord can help you we had you know that stupid yes but I did WI some Souls stupid was coming to paon e at 19 years old stupid amen just insane coming over here and trying to to win souls to the Lord but I wanted to do something for the Lord you know what I mean I want that kind of a fire in me I I I I didn't have to have it I didn't have it I didn't have a pull pit to preach from all the time I had something here to see today message message preachers just think you know when they when they get a call to preach well they they know nothing about going out wi and SS and preaching to the lost that's well they think man just hey hey I've got a gift in my life now now let me preach well that's not the way the apostles none of them done it that way and that's not the way that I've done it I went out finding souls to save amen yeah come on and and I and I think we we missed the point when we don't have that burning cry in our heart to make this message real to others now you're not going to quote brother brandham brother brandham said this brother brandham said that well the prophet said no that ain't it brother brandham took you right back to here and if there's anyone that has a right to be able to share this with the lost and Dying World we have that right amen I think they need to hear from somebody that's genuine True Believers in the Bible that you can that you can say I know it's real I know I've experienced it for myself that's what we want we want that fire can I hear it amen and I want you kids to have that amen it's good play music appreciate that good to lead songs appreciate that it's it's good to help out like you guys have done those are we we've got servant-hearted people but I'm here to tell you if you get the anointing of the Holy Ghost in your life God will God will shake this town he can shake a world through through your life you believe that all right let's continue reading amen a a few moments ago I mentioned that John understood what it was to love God the great Apostle of Love would certainly see see it when the church began to lose the first love of God that first love of God in 1 John 5 and3 he said for this is the love of God that we keep his Commandments one little deviation from that word was a step away from Christ people say they love God they go to church they even shout and rejoice and sing and have a great emotional time but when it is all over watch and see if they are in that word walking in it living in it if they go through all the other and then don't walk in that word they can say they love God but their lives tell another story I wonder if John didn't see a lot of that before he died people saying they loved God but not obeying his word oh Ephesian Church something is happening to you someone is trying to either add to that word or take from it but they are doing it so subtly that you can't see it they have made a move they they haven't made a move so big you can see it out there in the open it is under the cover they are bringing in bringing it by way of reason and human understanding and it will take over unless you refuse it go back to Pentecost before it's too late but as usual people don't take God's warning that Revival fire built upon the sacred word and is so wonderful and the manifestations of the spirit so blessed that a little fear Creeps in and a whisper in the heart says how can we protect this truth we have what can we do to see this revival goes on that is when the Antichrist Spirit comes in and Whispers look you have the truth now see that it doesn't get lost organize set up your Creed on what you believe put it in a church manual and they do it they organize they add to the word they die just like Eve did for taking one wrong word it's God's word that brings life it's not what we say about it that counts it's what God Said Amen can you say Amen why has this why is there so many in the in the message ranks that have that have H just just let the fire of God die down why is it that uh you know I I remember George Smith U preaching on the gifts of the Spirit and how how ironic when when he was over there helping the brandom Tabernacle out and he was he was going through the very Basics and going through and how the gifts of the spirit and I thought it was so ironic as I asked how how's that going you know and and it was it was it was it was quite interesting and I thought now brother brandham was gone a prophet that had such Divine gift and moving of God in that exact building and the generation that was in there knows nothing about it they know all about this God's not wanting it like that God's not organized God's not organized his holy spirit is in his word the prophet came to bring us back to life amen so we're not taking the words and saying yes I'm a message believer you Baptist you know but I'm this no no it's God living in a body am we should expect him to be with us can you say amen I want that same fervent I am not satisfied with with just saying I'm a message believer and the Holy Spirit that was in that Prophet amen crying out for souls and crying out to be right brother brand you could hear it in him he he he his own self I must be right I want that same God in Me saying I must be right can you say Amen how many wants to get it right I want to get it right yes amen now all right let's see uh w're okay we're getting late let let's let's I I want I want to get let let's read let's read a few more and then uh we're almost to the seat of nanism and then we'll we'll start there again next week we it's the warning of God Revelations 2 and5 remember therefore from whence Thou Art fallen and repent and do the first works or else I will come unto thee and will remove the Candlestick out of his place except thou repent God tells them re remember evidently something had left in their minds they had forgotten something he told them to turn back in their minds to their porn of origin the origin was the first a of the of the first age was Pentecost they had fallen from it they had forgotten the glory and wonder of it it was time to go back in mind and then in reality back to when they could say for me to live as Christ back to the Purity when ananas and safaris were dealt with back to the gate beautiful oh what a reproach it is to drift from God and and countenance those out uh uh from God in countenance those acts that defile his name let let those who name his his name depart from sin and keep their vessels pure for God look at what you want were in your mind and heart and your life then go back to it what is it what is the way back the way is repentance if a sinner has to come to God by a way of repentance then a lukewarm or back slider will have to repent that much more repent bring forth fruits meat for repentance prove it by your life if you do not repent said God I will remove your lampstand certainly a church in that condition can't give light to the world its light has turned to Darkness God then will take away his faithful messenger and his and its faithful Shepherds and leave them to themselves they will go walking or they will go on talking about about Christianity but be re uh be berried of it repent quickly don't hesitate evidently Ephesus did hesitate for her lifespan was not very long the glory of God deceased or or decreased ever so rapidly it was not long until the city was in Ruins its glorious Temple became a shapeless Mass the land become Marsh inhabited by water file the population was gone except for a few unbelievers in a squalled village there was not even one Christian left the lamp was rent from its place now it does not mean that she could not have repented it does not mean that we cannot repent we can but it must be quickly we must be a true it must be a true heart CED to God in sorrow and then God will restore and the glory will come again aren't you glad for that if you have if you're finding yourself if if if even on these Wednesday nights and and and and you're hearing some of these things and it's and it's and it's and it's hitting your soul God's saying hey I i' I've got my blood for you can you say amen amen got my blood for you praise the Lord amen so we're thankful for that now we we we we did not we made it up to the seed of n leonism and we will go from there on next Wednesday are y'all enjoying these Wednesday nights amen now the these uh and and brother Brandon would tell us okay so so here is here is Ephesus then you've got the second age you've got the third age he said now what started out here as Deeds then they become sayings over here that you you've got you've got some of those that were that that were of the uh in the second Church age the synagogue of Satan we've got this right in here by the time you get over here it is now the doctrine of uh the nicians it's the doctrine of the nicians by the time you get to this third Church age they it is now called the seat of Satan now now now catch that by the time we get up to here ain't nothing left nothing no more so so brother Bradon would tell us and he's and he's going in and as you're reading uh and I I really read let's let's comb over that that uh this church age book I really like for y'all to do that and not just not not just wait on me to read let's let's let's really uh uh pray over over this but but you'll notice there if you if you're looking at that 93rd uh the 93rd page uh he says how it started out it's called the Deeds then it become a Doctrine it become the standard it become the unbending way so Satan was coming in with the deeds and then it become the doctrine then it become the standard what it is is Satan wants to plant the seeds make you think you're okay and then before you know it then then you start teaching it then you start saying you know well you know but that see and then it's the unbending way what we want to do is let this be the seed let this come as the doctrine and let this be the unbending way amen amen if the musicians would come any any question mark or or any any any questions here tonight praise the Lord no questions hallelujah amen all right there a there there is no stupid questions at all always feel free to open up on these Wednesday nights you're always welcome we're sort of taking our time for a purpose and that because um what you might think is so stupid there's there there there could be about 95% of everyone else thinking the same thing so just ask it and we'll all go woo you're stupid but I'm sure glad you asked amen oh go ahead well the the that is a good question because as brother brandham will get into it what they they had received the glory there was first of all the false Vine is absolutely of the devil and the True Vine is this is the spirit of God but they're living off that same life of that early church and so um and brother Brandon will will be going in through that like Judas Judas had had the gifts of the Spirit and and that is going to be coming up so that false Vine did was able ble to perform some Miracles was able and and but as they begin to grow and and come through then we begin then we find but their nature was against the word so at the beginning they looked a lot alike except they just had a different take than what the others believed of the Apostle Paul I personally believe that they were saying they were they were looking and and and saying well that's the way you see it but we sort of believe you know I we think the Apostle Paul man this way and then and and and before you know it you know that's where you got your two two two different opinions was that what she was asking or no because when you're when when they're first coming they they're they're both Blades of grass and they both but then it becomes just a uh you you through those Dark Ages then you begin to find whoa whoa whoa and the nickan spirit is is to conquer the Ley it's it it's as brother Brandon would say it's the seed of ruination and men and and and and basically what it is it was just okay it would be like it would be like here in our church it would be like it would be like us the deacons and the and trustees and and US preachers all getting together and devising a plan you know making it a more of a business and and and and trying to uh it it and and that's basically what they were trying to do they the Catholic Church came in with they found way to make money and they were and the people gave all of the power to a few a few men and um and those men and were not holding those men accountable to the word of God and so when you do that you just got the blind following the blind so what we so it's it is so important for every one of us and and and I've got I've got some quotes in my 59 notes pages of notes here where where where brother brandham says the church ends up a business it's a it's a major business and and so you you appreciate appreciate you you appreciate brother brandom in this age staying so far away from the money aspect of it so that he could we could keep our eyes upon the tress of the gift that God put in his life it's we're we're so brother if you don't see Calvary through this message I know they want to pick on him I know they want to pick on brother brandom this that they're just a bunch of bozos you take any you take any man and you you you you you any any any man that is willing to look at what brother brandham taught and look at it through the scripture you can't help but see exactly what the spirit of the Lord was trying to tell us that's right I'm thankful for it I'm thankful for this message those of you that are online if you need Church age books write us let us let us know we we'll get you Church age books we're going to we're going to order a bunch of books here for for some of those here so um I I I think I think we've give out all of the church age books we've had but if there's any online that wants them or you can order them from Jeffersonville but these Church age book exposition of the seven Church ages is is so in is such an incredible gift amen I believe it praise the Lord amen yes yes sirr ruin yeah MH CH [Music] came well I you know I I I will say I I will say um and and it was going to be in in uh actually it was fixing to come in in that in it'll be in that next page or two where brother bradam says now now to say that he says the elect cannot be deceived because the nature of the seed can only agree with the word that's right and so it's not that we've got a critical spirit criticizing this or that or criticizing you know well that church over there you know they're doing this or no no no no no no no the thing is is Lord I am not going to allow uh uh that spirit that that seed of ruination to take root in my life Lord and and again I don't think it's NE I don't think it I don't think it's actually that you know every word of the [Music] book but it's having the life of the book in here now I I'm a firm believer that we all should be listening to tapes I'm a firm believer if you don't know what the prophet is saying how you got to you got to push play and Obey you got to do that you've got to you got listen to what the prophet has said saying and and and and and the prophet's message should not be background music amen if you've got the tape playing well listen to it don't be having your tape playing and then you're carrying a conversation with brother or sister or whatever sit down and listen that's right listen to what that Prophet is telling us now it's okay I mean I have no problem listen to it while at work or driving or whatever I I I what I'm trying to say it's not background music this is this is front and center music this message is very important can you say amen and the spirit of that Prophet the spirit that was upon that Prophet is leading us back to him so Brothers get in that word get in this message but don't substitute knowledge for life don't substitute knowledge for life there's a lot of message seminaries we are not in interested in message seminaries there's a lot of people that have that have been in this church that could quote this they loved this thing here that aren't even serving the lord today we we we don't want that we want the life of the Holy Spirit and that life will point you right back to Christ the word every time amen praise the Lord did you have your hands up while ago brother Harry no okay all right anyone
