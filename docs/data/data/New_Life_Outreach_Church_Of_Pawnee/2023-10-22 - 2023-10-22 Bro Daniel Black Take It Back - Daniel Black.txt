eternal life is something that dwells in US eternal life is in you now amen it's not in the future and so we're we're thankful that the down payment of eternal life and brother bradam says healing is a down payment Victory is a down payment so everything that we have amen yes we're still living in these mortal bodies but the soul still comes out and says I believe and it brings about healing it brings about miracles it brings the the Angels down Among Us amen because eternal life is within your soul yes this is getting gray amen and the body's Fallen apart but there is eternal life that can never die on the inside of us amen and so we're so thankful to the Holy Spirit and for that great promise that we have here this morning amen you can be seated for a moment we're we're sure excited to have the black family with us and um we um uh so appreciate brother Daniel black and his family uh back when the nol church was uh just still reeling losing their pastor and and uh the pastor's wife was you know uh going through uh so much of a struggle of course brother Tim Jes had passed away and then the co had left uh uh sister Joanna with uh just really damaged kidneys and and things and so um and we you know uh I was sort of given the responsibility of um and and the privilege of of guiding the church a little bit and helping them through that through that those Stormy Waters and and brother black uh was one that that stood up stood with us and and said I'll help in any way that I can over there in no and um uh he and his family come and preached over there uh uh weekend after weekend and and I appreciated brother black for and his family for giving uh all that that they had to to help the uh the church there and and uh being willing to to help guide them through and and I appreciated that in in brother black he has he has a Ministry of that that is um that is very an encouraging Ministry and so we've been wanting to get brother black back over this way for uh well for some time and so uh um we're we're thankful that brother black is was was able to come and be a part of our uh our fellowship today and also to minister the word uh to us here this morning so I just feel like we're just really uh we're just really blessed amen and um and we are looking forward to the uh to our fall fellowship and uh looking forward to what God uh has in store for us now you know there's there's some that um and rightfully so that that that feel that maybe we shouldn't have um these kind of fellowships on a Sunday and I know a lot of people who dismissed their services and and put um and and put Games and Things ahead of God and um but you know I I I will want us to have church here this morning and and I I I want us to to enjoy ourselves and I want us to enjoy our our service around the bonfire tonight and um but we're we're we're thankful also for our kids and sometimes we do the youth camps and uh it's for the 13 years and older and so we've wanted to do a little bit of something that we could do for the uh for our young for all ages and and um uh where where the young ones could still have fun and the old ones have fun and well and and us adults to be able to enjoy ourselves in Fellowship as well and um uh I see this no different as as boys out uh in the parking lot of of of the Bram Tabernacle in between the services they would have their service at 10:00 in the morning come out and then go back at 7:00 that evening and in between time the boys would be throwing balls and and keeping themselves active and and um I I think that here this this afternoon being able to Fellowship around the one another's company and um and the different ones that will that may be coming in and fellowshipping with us I I just I just like for it to just be a one wonderful day just a just a glorious day to where we can uh just in in encourage our Youngs and they love bonfires and and I like bonfires too amen and um and so uh the good thing is is a lot of these these young ons especially these boys they've been out every almost every day of this this last week uh helping getting things set up and uh uh they'd get out there in the morning times and work until it's dark and so we we appreciate all of the Brotherhood among among our our young ones that uh helped us to uh to build the slide and to and to to build you know just I we we appreciate it and um uh so uh I think it's brother Merl that said this kind of a thing doesn't doesn't just doesn't just happen there's a lot of work that goes into that and uh uh so we and we appreciate the these these kids for jumping out in and and also appreciate the ones who came out and was just so willing to give of their heart and say I I want to put my my shoulder to the will I've got a I've got kids too and and uh I I want to I want to be a part of the blessing I think we're blessed I I I I I think we're blessed with young people I think we're blessed with leadership who who love young people and amen and that is investing into the Next Generation Now the older we get we don't really uh the older I get amen and losing the energy and and um uh I could find a lot better things to be doing with my evening times than to be coming down and helping um these youngans amen but when you know that you are investing into this this next Generation it it it it's it's wonderful because you want these kids to receive the Holy Ghost be interested in them you want these kids to be uh uh you know to to to excel then then be interested in our Sunday School classes be interested in our in in in all that is being involved amen incourage that kind of thing because listen we're we're we're believing that God still rais raing up preachers we're believing that God's still amen uh uh raising up prophesied God's still raising up uh uh a Preachers Wives amen and and you say well you know that's no no no no no no no I believe every spiritual thing has a natural uh element to it it has a natural element to it and for me to want to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost there were Elders in my life amen that invested in me took me fishing gave me pocket knives give took me hunting doing those kinds of things in This Boy's Life they invested in me I trusted in them I wanted what they have and before you know it I was eating out of their hands amen and they prayed me through to the baptism of the Holy Ghost a amen and so I believe that that what we're doing here today is a amen uh is is something that that we have here it's not all here here says H here says ah I see the vision and so we're thankful for what God has blessed us with I appreciate all of our young people amen I appreciate them and and and and love them and I appreciate those who share the same vision and the same burden I've been blessed uh in this I'm blessed just to know that we have had uh out of this congregation and different other uh have have have uh have raised preachers and Preachers Wives I'm glad to know that we've got pastors and evangelists that are on the field today that are a blessing great blessing prominent blessings amen because there were people here that had vision and I say God bless every one of you amen and so uh as we get ready for brother black to come amen may may maybe we can just stand back to our feet and um and and just maybe we can sing that song uh only believe as brother black begins to come we want brother black to just uh take his Liberty today and uh and and and preach to Us Praise the Lord amen only believe only believe all [Music] things only believe onlyy

is here and Jesus is here all things are possible and Jes Jesus is here amen let's give the Lord a hand this morning it's so good to be in the house of the Lord with you just want to say God bless you good to see you uh let our musicians be seated if you'd like to uh just sure enjoyed those songs that were sung uh you know let's just give the Lord a hand this morning amen you know I hear them sing like that and I think man I wish I could do that just uh I got a I I Make a Joyful Noise that's about all I can get you know and uh uh hearing brother Wendell talk about getting older and you know and you start seeing the hairs going gray well I'm experiencing some of that uh I got a couple in the front and some on the side this brother you know what I'm talking about he's like brother Daniel I'd take what you got but you know and brother Wendell you ain't lost a hair brother uh he ain't lost one and brother brother Bren talked about that one time so I'm losing I'm going bald he said I ain't lost a oneand she said will you mind telling me where they were at and he said well you tell me where they were before I got them that's where they're at you know I've often wondered does that mean our theophany on the other side's bald and every time one hair goes he gets one hair you know I'm not sure how that worked exactly but you know I know when we get on that other side brother we're going to be perfect we're going to no more ailments there no more pains there and I'm looking forward to that I'm looking for a time because you know you want to serve the Lord in the fullness you can but sometimes you just don't feel good some sometimes your body hurts sometimes just different things but there's coming a day brother and sister it's going to be an eternal youth meeting on that one and I'm looking forward to that amen praise the Lord I want to me you on a little thought of take it back and uh go to St Matthew chapter 18: 10 through 14 take it back you know I believe God's given us promises in this word and I believe that he will give it to you but you got to be willing to go take it back from the devil you know the devil will take as much as you'll give him it's like having an employer uh when you work in employ an employer and you employers forgive me but if you have an employer sometimes they will take as much as you give yeah but they won't give you nothing back you know as much as you give listen give me a little more give me a little more and I made a joke to our dealership manager because it showed this man sit standing in front of a car a fancy expensive car and he says if you work hard you work long hours you give up everything that you've got I'll buy an extra another one next year you know in the world there's things like there where you can invest all you can and and you know they'll they'll take as much as you can give well with God God will give you the more you can give to God the more God will give back to you and in this service you will get exactly what you put into it you come expecting to see God come and speak God will come on the scene for you amen uh let's go to St Matthew chap 18: 10-4 it says take heed that you despise not one of these little ones for I say unto you that In Heaven There Angels do always behold the face of My Father which is in heaven for the son of man is come to save that which was lost how think ye if a man have a hundred sheep and one of them gun astray does not he leave the 90 and9 and goeth into the mountains and seeketh that which has gone astray and if so be that he find it verily I say unto you he rejoiceth more for that sheep than of the 99 which went not astray even so it is not the will of your father which is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish and we'll go to one more scripture in Ephesians chap 1 and Verses 4 just one scripture there says according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love let's go to the Lord in prayer heavenly father I I humble myself before you this morning and Lord I ask you that you would just use this yielded vessel this morning that you could speak to hearts Lord Lord we are here to Worship You Lord Lord I ask you to come and speak to us in Jesus name amen God bless you you can be seated I think I'm gonna move this thing up here that might help let me assure you this morning that the Lord is it's not his will that anyone would perish the Lord has got a perfect will for our life and the enemy will do his best to steal away your confidence because you know it don't matter what you're doing if the Lord can take your confidence away from you and what you're doing you will not be successful it's a job no matter what it is how simple it is you if you're constantly doubting yourself because you take somebody that has confidence in what they're doing they'll be the best that they could possibly be at that so always remember the devil will try to take away your confidence you know when I've talked to salesmen I I've helped helped salesmen to to see how the road to sell and how to sell vehicles and how to do certain things and I've heard a lot of people say you can't be a Christian and be car salesman but I have proven that to be wrong you can do that and you can be a Christian you can do that with Integrity because you know what I'll tell you somebody that that that's that that's a robber that's somebody that works on the clock and you'll hide and not do your job not do the best you can you are a robber because you're not doing the best the scripture says do all that you do heartedly as doing it for the Lord and not for man you know we we should be the best of the best at everything that we do if you're sweeping the floor you should do that in the name of the Lord in such a way that God could bless that you know and so the Lord has shown me on how to help salesmen and I don't see their confidence is gone they've lost their confidence and what it is whenever you have a product and you're presenting that product to somebody you want to PR to present it in such a way they realize this thing I can't do without this product is so good I can't do without this thing and brother and sister the gospel is so good it's got to be presented in such a way that said I've got to have that but you know somebody can lose their confidence in it they can lose that steill in it the product's not wrong the the person has lost their confidence and you know we got to have confidence in what God's given us do you believe that you've got to have confidence in what it is because the devil he can't tell you it's wrong he won't tell you the message is wrong he'll lose your confidence for you that you can receive those promises and that's where you've got to take it back you know each of us has got an identity and it's an identity that God has called us to and the identity of who you are is who God says you are but the devil will try his hardest to make you present a different life to where you are manifesting something different and then after you leave a a a the presence of some people and maybe you said something you just didn't mean to say and then you say God forgive me I did not mean to say that and you will beat yourself to pieces I want slow down just catch this for just a moment the devil will try so hard because you'll you'll see your brother or your sister maybe they say a certain thing a wrong way he will try to cause you where you see their identity of something else on you know what that brother ain't quite what I thought he was that sister ain't quite what I thought they was because you know what they fail you know brother B says you can kill a man by speaking against him because you kill his influence that's right this right here brother and sister is the greatest weapon that we have in this life is because it's our words and the way we talk about one another so let not just St not just grabbing your identity of who you are but the identity of who your brother and sister is because you know many times as I'm saying you're fighting this F because you're you've got to go you want to become what this word says you are but we are fighting a devil and he will come to try to divide and conquer and cause you to look at your brother in a way that he he he may look at himself do you realize you can nobody can ever criticize you like you all right you know the real you we know the real us when we look in that mirror and we see who we are we say God thank you for your grace thank you for your mercy because you know what it's a daily walk while we're saying God I can't even walk without you holding my hand I need your mercy in my life so how in the world can somebody ever look that down on on somebody else come on brother and sister we've been given the greatest thing in this life of the message of the hour but the greatest that is something that was here before even the message got here it's the Holy Spirit Well we will have that Holy Spirit on the inside of us brother and that spirit inside of you is what makes you who you are you take a dog you know how you know he's a dog because he acts like a dog and that means he's got a life of a dog inside of him he wags his tail he sticks his tongue out he does all kinds of stuff that dogs do because he's a dog he's got the life of a dog in him that's the evidence of it you don't have to go up there with the stethoscope and stick your your your your stethoscope in your ear and say I wonder if this guy's alive all right you just let a cat out the door the Instinct just comes right out of him amen this precious dog that would never hurt a fly let a cat out there oh yeah you know what I'm talking about brother and sister that's the way it is with a Christian it should not be that somebody has to put the stethoscope on you to see if you're a Christian or not there should be something inside of you that is pulsing I'm talking about a love brother Brenham talked about that spring and he saw that spring just up bubbling and just a bubbling and just a bubbling said what is it that makes you what is it that makes you bubble it's because the deer drink from you the rabbit drink no not them is it because I drink from you no what is it something inside me just makes me Bubble brother and sister I'm here to tell you I've been serving the lord since I was 19 years old don't tell me that's something that just enthusiasm that wears down 19 years later or 20 21 years later I'm getting older 21 years later that thing still bubbling on the inside of me to where you can have this you know I've thought many times have have a little Eagle sitting inside of a shell and he would hear the noise of wings flapping on the outside and he would hear a Revival on the outside of his shell he would hear the flapping of the Wings he would hear the screams of all these things and that little eagler sitting inside this shell and he's wondering what's it like out there I hear that there's a Revival out there I hear that somebody can have that unexhausted Fountain inside of them that will Bobble on the inside what's it like because I am trapped inside this shell and I'm trying so hard I want Revival I'm going to tell you brother and sister if you've got that pull in your heart for Revival you keep pushing this morning you keep fighting you're stay in the presence of God you stay in the word and you say God I want that Revival I want that Fountain of fire that won't that w't burning me so hard that's all I think about is god brother and sister because it's not you it's him because if you serve god with this right here you'll be up and down up and down up and down up and down you'll go around the circle round the circle round the circle never no no consistency but you get with him yeah I'm brother and sister I'm telling you what it's a real fire on you never notice how by the window you can you can't push somebody with a rope you can take a rope and try to push them I don't know what games you got going out here but maybe you got something I can cize what I'm talking about you take a rope and you try to pushing it won't work I me to tell you you put that lasso around them you say come on up here you come get some of this revival of what I've got cuz you know what we as the Bride of Jesus Christ Our Life should be everywhere we go but we are walking on that rock we're standing on that rock no matter who we interact with they should about to say I want that I want that I may not agree with what they say I may not agree with how they dress I may not agree about how they wear their hair but I'm going to tell you that's the spirit of Christ cuz I'm tell what your spirit is the greatest gospel you'll ever have you can quote the quotes all you want to but if you're a bitter old court on the god you're bitter I all you are that's right and that's the saddest thing to see is people that will have this message and they're the most bitter people you ever talk to but here tell brother B said you ever notice there some people you just can't stand to be around like you just feel nervous it's the atmosphere like you're right around themselves that's right but you get around other brothers yeah get around other sisters and there's just a love you love to be around them what is it it's the atmosphere brother and sister our spirit that we have brother said I would rather see you with the wrong Doctrine and the right Spirit then to have the right Doctrine and you got the wrong Spirit brother and sister because our spirit is your testimony that's right that's right it don't matter how much we jump in front and Shout it's how we treat people I mean listen to what I'm talking about this morning they'll have great evangelists and big preachers that come later you listen to this little spare tire this morning okay the greatest thing you could ever have brother and sister is the way you treat people people do not care how much you know until they know how much you care that's right yes sir our life we can have such a spirit on us brother and sister because there is a dying world out there families are broken and they don't know what to do there's fathers out there there's mothers out there they got all these bills they got to pay and I don't know how I'm going to pay them they see Wars that are on the rise I don't know what to do yeah they're weak they're scared they're they're scattered yeah and they don't know what to do but we know what to do brother and sister you are the gospel it's not a oneman Ministry anymore this is a many membered body where the life that you're living where you are walking in the spirit you are walking in the grace brother and sister where you can bring peace to someone's home amen that's the greatest I would rather have that than restoring a leg or something amen the devil will try to take your confidence away he'll try to take it away and you know what we are not a cookie stamp church and I thank God for that is there some water up here brother oh it's right here I see it I should have put my glasses on huh I think I need some stronger ones but you know what we are we were on a battlefield yeah and on this battlefield that we're on right now you get Battle Scars yes sir and you know when you're in the heat of the battle there's sometimes you don't know what to do okay there's sometimes you got to make a decision and maybe nobody else agrees with what your decision is but you got to make the right decision because you know what you've got to be the one that lives with it we God will honor your decision of what you take and what I Take God will honor that and that's why it's so so important that we are led by the spirit because you know what a lot of the bondages that we can put ourselves we find ourselves under we say that devil put me under this bondage but a lot of times it's our own decisions that got us where we're at brother and sister we got to take some accountability you know you get a lot of credit card debts said that devil put me in all this credit card debt that old devil was the devil that pulled that wallet that card out of your wallet and swipe it or was it you that did that come on somebody we got a hat rack out there we'll go put our Halos out there and put them out there and we we'll pick them up after service but you know what it's our own decision God is a good provider God will meet your needs God will give you everything that you have need of but I believe we must be a good Steward over what God has given us and whenever you are a good Steward of what God is God is faithful that he will meet those need it may be right on the due date but God will give you the money to get it paid amen I don't believe that the shin out woman was was was drawn in credit card debt to the point where she said I just got to buy that newest skirt I just got to get that and then I'm so poor now I've got me my son's going to starve to death and we're going to eat our last meal I'm sorry I don't think it was that way I believe that was and she's waiting on the the Shak glory to come I know it may sound funny but brother and sister we find ourselves a lot of times we put ourselves in those situations then we say oh God deliver me now you know what we got to take some mature accountability to we're saying Lord help me to do this mature ride help me be a mature Christian help me to grow up in this thing and be someone that you can count on God I believe that sh out woman was doing the best she could do with what she had and God let her go to a point where she said I don't feel God I don't see God I'm paying my ti I'm giving the offering a little bit that I have I'm doing everything that I know to possibly do and I don't know what to do this woman saw her son dying this woman saw her son that was so weak day by day by day getting weaker and weaker and weaker and weaker and she's saiding but I'm holding on to a promise that we've got a word here that says God is faithful he is is Jehovah jyra he is a God he is Jehovah Rafa he is Jehovah sha she didn't have all the quotes all she had was just that little bit of word and she was holding on to that promise and little by little watching her child die how easily could she should have just let down the bars and say I'll just go with the world how easily would have been her and say you know what there's nothing to this message but something inside her says I'm staying with this word my finances may be tight we're dealing with starvation right now we're doing all these things but I'm staying with with this word and here it come one day one cool morning may she what even expect it here come a prophet of God and I want to catch someone stop you this is not even on my nose by way this Prophet if you look at the scriptures he says you go to this widow woman I have commanded her to sustain thee yeah if you were to go ask this widow woman has the Lord told you to sustain the prophet today I have no idea what you're talking about he ain't said nothing to me but what was it this woman had something inside her it was a respect to the word it was a respect to the presence and this woman was she felt alone she felt by herself she felt like you know what I don't know how I can do this but she was walking in what she knew and here it come a moment a visitation come across her way and she had respect that visitation and God honored go he said give me a cake how many knows the Scriptures it was a it was a visitation that God crossed her path and her attitude her respect to the presence of God in that moment God met her requests God met her needs there was a little woman that heard a prophet of God one time talking about the third pole and things that were taking place and something inside of her said it ain't nothing but the truth and because of her attitude toward the M of God he said ask what you will and it'll be done for you you asked for a million dollars right now it be right here but what did she say I want the salvation of my boys oh brethren and sister it is our respect to the move of God well you got to walk with the spirit it's not just in church anybody can move in church it's when you're out them doors and you are walking with your Shepherd when you are walking out them doors and you're F Walking with God and say God I just want your presence God will allow you to go under certain stress yes sir God will allow you to go under financial burden God will allow sickness to come God will allow these things because it's an opportunity for God to move on your beh and God to move your Mountain everybody wants to be the world champion boxer but you know we can't go out and print out a a champion belt and say well there's a world champion boxer I'd love to be that way I'd have one no in order for you without wear that

want a testimony like that in order to have that testimony you got to go through the fire brother and sister it's so hard to go through the fire yeah I heard I was reading my scriptures the other morning and I was just praying to the Lord and my heart was so heavy for brother Donnie Reagan in the burden that my brother's going through and I just couldn't imagine this is a giant in the faith for me I would rather meet brother Donnie Reagan that as someone in the world but you know this brother he's a a preacher that's preached Divine Healing preaches Jesus Christ is say yesterday today and forever demonstrated it Miracle after miracle yeah and I was going to read in the scripture we talked about Saul when he was taken home and they took his head off and they took his armor and they hit his put his armor up for everybody to see it and there was a fire that come on the inside of me and said that's exactly how the devil tries to do he'll try to take some kind of weakness in your life and he'll try to put up say look at this we defeated God's Army he didn't defeat anything I here to tell you God still a Healer today God is still a Resto today and my prayer was brother Dy you

trial of fire the last year a trial like I've never never gone through in my entire life right you know we were visiting the the the church and no and I love those Saints I love them love them I love them I love them did I mention I love them I love them and you but I knew that's not what I was supposed to do and it went contrary that anybody else thought but I have to walk in what I see I have to do cuz I've got to be the one that's got to live with that I've got to be the one that's got to take it I'm going to give account to the Lord one day always remember that when a preacher and your pastor is preaching to you you got to remember if he don't preach that to you he will be held accountable for it right brother and sister I've been in a trial this last year like I have never gone through in my life where on the outside I look like I was alive on the inside of me I felt like I was dying on the inside out and I would just try to praise CU because the devil took my confidence away because I just like you know what how did I miss how did how did I do this how did I I would never offend anybody in the Lord I don't want to offend anybody much more anybody Lord help me Lord help what did I do and for over a year that devil was fighting me fighting me fighting me fighting me to the point where I just wanted to commit suicide I said you know what I can't do this anymore I just I have you ever felt that way I come to a point where I was said you know what I don't know what I could do and I heard y'all had some special meetings coming on here brother Jonathan Martin brother Sean Martin and I can't remember the other's names you know the meeting I'm talking about I hope you do I heard about these meetings going forth and I said you know what I'm I'm going to these meetings I am going I'm sick of that stinking devil fighting me I'm sick of him binding because you know what I have I looked at myself and little did I do anything in air what did I do and I felt this I said I am going to these meetings and I get myself up and I'm getting my tie ready and I'm standing in front of the mirror and I felt the question come to me and says why are you going to these meetings and the honesty from my heart I said I am looking for allil I am looking for a refilling of the Holy Spirit I'm looking for these stinking chains to be broken and left broken Lord I need help and God and that was my honesty in my heart we get to service here where our service is already G and that brother's PR preaching Lord once more Lord once more and we're sitting right there beside where that brother is sitting over there in one of those flimsy white chairs forgive me he was I hope that don't sound mean I was I'm I'm kind of fat you know 230 lbs I was sitting on top of that that chair right there and it was just a squirming and I was holding it and every time I tried to say an amen I like I feel like I'm going to collapse in the floor and someone say Daniel got in the spirit you know I know I was out the chair you know I'm sitting here to toward this service and I'm just thinking Lord I want to break through this thing God I I need your help I need I am so sick I do not want to walk like this I want your victory in my life I want your spirit God I need a refilling of your spirit and they had a prayer line at the front here and people were going through that prayer line and I was standing there right here in the back and I was right with that brother sitting right next Closer by I was standing back here and I just hading my hands up before the Lord Lord and I said Lord I want my Revival back I'm so sick of not walking in my Revival I had my hands up in the air and I was praising the Lord and I had wine come in my mouth just as short as I'm talking to you right now just like you're going to take a communion wine and you stick it inside your mouth and you be Burns in your nose Burns in your mouth I hadd my hands up I said oh my literally shock me for a second I look around I was like how do you know we're doing communion tonight and we're sitting here and I got my hands up so God I just and I began to pray just like we're going to do communion my

look up and there ain't no communion table there ain't no bread here's brother Daniel I am not telling you to look for signs this is something to happen to me my brother and sister I broke through something I BR I said oh God I thank you for this move of God in my life I thank you for Revival God I thank you for this move cuz you know what that wasn't for anybody else that was for brother Daniel once more Lord I ask you to touch me once more Lord if you come one more time Time Lord give me and that brother just kept echoing that and I've just been chopping at to bit to share my testimony on that with [Applause] you when you're on the battlefield you get Battle Scars yes yes and it hurts I want to share something with you my wife and I we like we got a side by side and we celebrated 21 years here recently of marriage and uh praise the lord we got on this side by side and we on this side by side we began to he said you know what let's just get a away she said you know what I want I took an I I stepped down from a position my job I was the Lord blessed me in the last nine years I've been the top salesman of our dealership it's been very good but I said you know recently after after this act I said you know what uh I say act you know the presence of the Lord touched me I Saidi laying down everything I don't care about finances I don't care about these things Lord I just want to focus my eyes on you and I told my managers that own dealership I said I'm not going to sell cars anymore I said I'm just going to take I I said I'll do pictures and they're like they've been trying to do every way possible to get me back on the cell floor and no I I'm done so we're 8 to five Monday through Friday and broke as I've ever been in my life and I'm as happy as I've ever been in my life we didn't have the money the finances to to go anywhere for our our uh anniversary she said you know the one thing that I want she said I want you and me let's go Side by siding you and me let's just go and let's just drive and see wherever the side by side takes us now you're talking we get inside this side by side and we're on the Buckhorn and we're finding stuff that I don't think anyone's ever seen before we're in this other side by side we're deep in the mountains and I go over this hill and we start going down this Valley and I saw trees that were cut and that were falling over and I felt The Voice come down to me and speak to me and said these trees weren't Born This Way chopped down something happened to them these little trees are deep inside these Woods here and something inside me said what if it's some just like a person just like a sheep that they're so deep inside there that nobody even knows what they're going through they're suffering they're wounded they're hurt and there's like no nobody hears me yeah nobody hears My Cry in these in these mountain and the lord gave me this scripture I not to read it with you it's in Matthew chap 9: 35-38 it says and Jesus went about all the cities and Villages teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing every sickness and every disease among the people but when he saw the multitudes he was moved with compassion on them because they fainted and were scattered abroad as sheep having no Shepherd then said he unto his disciples the Harvest truly is plenteous but the labors are few pray ye therefore the lord of the Harvest that he will send forth labors into the Harvest this was a people that was scattered they were weak they were fainted and they were as if they didn't have a shepherd and they were so beat down and brother and sister my heart becomes so heavy of sin how many people do we pass every day that are just like this scripture where they're alone they need they need help brother and sister may we be that help in this hour you are the laborers I'm the labor brother wend you are the laborer help us Lord that we could be faithful laborers before the Lord to where our neighbors can see what we Rejoice about because it's so easy to put it on the preacher and say the preacher got to do the preaching but you're the one that does the preaching do you know that you are the Vindication that he's this man's preaching the right message how because he's preaching the word and you are taking that word and you're walking with it we are the Vindication that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever Amen brother and sister in this hour it don't go anybody can jump and shout when things are going good yeah but it's whenever you are walking in the valley when you're walking by yourself and you say you know what I don't feel a thing but I know this message is true it's whenever you keep pushing amen I pray that I'm getting this over cross okay okay listen what brother R says he says did you know that God knew that we'd be standing here 10 million years before the world was ever founded did you know he knew we'd be standing here this morning then vinity of God knowed every fly every Gat every time they'd bat their eyes and how much Tallow that would produce before the world was ever form God knew it now you say well if he knows it then why are you preaching that's part of God's program preaching is his program when he looked upon the apostles he looked upon the Harvest he said the Harvest is r and the labors are few pray the Lord of the Harvest that he will send forth labors into his Harvest so many remember that well why would they have to pray to the Lord of harvest to send forth labors in the Harvest if the lord of the Harvest was standing there knowing it would be done why it's because God arranged it now listen God so arranged it that this program cannot move without you and I and as long as we're not doing what God leads us to do we're paralyzing his program but when the church moves by the anointing of the Holy Ghost then we're in the God's Will and then we're doing God's program brother and sister you can paralyze the move of God in your life because we have got to follow his Spirit whenever you are led by the spirit you are moving God's program how many of you believe you can be led by the spirit you can be led by the spirit not just this brother you can be led by the spirit where you hear that word that's what that brother's preaching what he does is because he's saying don't just stay right there don't Plateau you know that around the message there's a mentality not meaning is that you just plateau in your walk with the Lord don't ever Plateau brother how old are you how old are you 53 years old are you plateau brother that brother hadn't even begun the fight that brother has got to continually strive to grow in the Lord continually strive to be led by the spir spirit continually strive to conquering battles if that brother's got to do it what about you you say amen I I believe as there's a scripture it says as for me in my house we will serve the Lord you know our house is our Sanctuary brother BM said let me come to your house and spend some time with you watch what see see what you do with your time see what you watch see what your pinup he said then I'll tell you what kind of life you're living it's our home brother and sister that is our Sanctuary to where our home should be consecrated to where that spirit that house is a spirit of a habitation of the spirit where God can come and dwell in that house but you've got to consecrate that that house to your to the Lord you have got to brother and sister you have got to conquer it and where to I say conquer conquer the spirits that try to come against the home because he'll try to come against Mommy and Daddy he will try to cause arguments and divisions inside the home you know it breaks my heart brother wend when I hear around the message message families that bicker and fight all the time yeah but then in church oh praise God yeah I'm not saying don't praise the Lord brother I'm talking about that's why the real gospel meets the road is in your house when the doors are shut when it's you and you and God alone when you have the choice you can either pick up your phone and start looking at that filth or that nonsense or you can say I have the power to lay it down you know what we want miracles of seeing the the blind being restored and that people raiseed out a wheelchair I want to see people have the power where they lay the old l life down and the new life being taken up all right that's right brother and sister you know I hear talk sometimes around the meeting sometimes of not not you in particular I'm talking about but around people the one that will jump and Shout the most listen to how they talk after the meeting listen me brother and sister because that's where the rubber meets the road of the real you the real you and I you know brother R talked about one of the greatest confusions to me when I come to message I sure didn't understand how the world could a woman preach prophesy speak in tongues somebody come up there and that woman preacher pray for somebody and they be healed how in the world could that happen anybody ever see that they absolutely because God is Not vindicating that woman as being in her position rightful position God was honoring faith and the rain falls on the just and the unjust so don't think you're something because you're shouting and jumping when the holy spirit's going it's what you do with this right here cuz if you use this thing and you tear your brother and your sister down and you're talking gossip inside the church and you're talking bad about the pastor don't even begin to tell me how spiritual you are because you know what a man will speak from the abundance of his heart you get around somebody very long you will know what they've been thinking about because they will talk about it and they will begin to edify so you can be the greatest preacher on the Earth but if you're using this and you're tearing down your brother and your sister amen I believe you believe the same thing and I'm also say anybody else does this thing I'm just preaching what all my heart brother and sister your your family is the greatest gospel there is in this life because you you can you can see somebody come in this restaurant beautiful long hair and dresses men not wearing shorts holy coming R in in there and he's like M that's what I want to be and then you're around him for just a few minutes and you listen to what they talk about and how brother and sister it's the way we treat people brother Brenham talked about the meetings that he had said go to the meetings he said people would say are you brother Brenham you I'm brother bam he said I want to shake your hand he said because when I go to those me that's the sweetest people in the world I want that I'm here to tell you I feel that with you guys this message is not to say you be this I'm encouraging you when you're going through that brother and sister and you feel like you're not doing nothing for the Lord that's when you were doing something for the Lord whenever you're going to the restaurant and you got everything wrong that could possibly go wrong and you're still happy amen that devil will look at him is why don't you do something with them they're too happy why don't you do something with them they they they said put some Financial stress on them we did put sickness on them we did put this on them we did and they just keep fighting they keep moving forward no matter what I throw at them they keep bubbling no matter what I do I've tried taking their confidence away I tried taking this away I've caused people to talk bad about them they keep pushing brother and sister that's the Bride of Jesus Christ of this hour down the ages everything the devil could throw at you young people you keep pushing in the midst of a darkest age where it should be absolutely impossible for a young people to be filled with the Holy Ghost we' got young people filled with the Holy Ghost you say Amen when it should be impossible for a man to walk through this life and not be sunk in in the swamp of pornography we've got men in this age and young boys in this age say I've overcome that devil I keep pushing amen because it's in the dark time brothers and sisters that's when the real you comes out amen Amen brother and sister and somebody you you yourself can be somebody's Revival you yourself could be the per the thing that somebody needs I was praying over this this exact thing Monday or Tuesday of this week I said Lord God may may I be so filled with your spirit God that whenever I'm interacting with somebody that I will change everything about them in their situation and uh I like to sing I ain't no good at it but I like to sing I like to whistle I'm always whistling I'm on the lot and if you ever go to Bringing Dodge you'll hear whistling it's well you find me you just follow the whistle you'll find where I'm at I like to praise the Lord I believe that God gave us something we can be happy about well I'm I'm just being brother Daniel I'm just going through and this customer comes by and he says hey can I ha to ask you this he said but my car is broke down he said can you give me a ride up here I said I'd be glad to absolutely I said give me just a few minutes I go get my Jeep and go inside there and mind you I didn't have to change my radio station to something real quick because I got a brother to get the vehicle you know uh hello we got inside the vehicle there and I said we were just going down the road and I said how are you doing today he says I'm doing all right he said how are you I said man I am awesome I said ' God is so good we're going down the road and he said uh he said well I could I could feel the Lord just to kind of Bru you know and I feel the Lord moving inside there and I said he said well I got laid off my job I said well praise God I said that's an opportunity for God to move and he said what I said praise God I said God's going to move on your behalf buddy I said God is faithful God will move on your needs and we're going down the road and that Spirit of the Lord just kept a broing inside that building next thing we knew we were having Church inside this little this little uh this little Jeep and we got to the house and he said said man he

another you know once more Lord we're sitting here on the lot and I'm trying to do pictures I do not want to sell cars anymore I tell my customers I don't want to sell anymore I can sell to my old ones but I don't want to sell cars anymore I'm doing these pictures and I'm doing a video when I started doing what's called a 360 video you're going around and I feel that spirit and I'm just thaning God your promises are so good they're yay and they're amen God thank you for this brother and I just brother B talks about he run around the the tree I had never felt that before until that day I was

and his wife and hey how you doing I said oh doing awesome I said there he is just as happy he was last time we saw him I said I said well how y'all doing guys we're shaking hand for just a few minutes and we start going out to looking at vehicles and I don't want to sell him a vehicle I began to talk to him about the Lord I said you know what I said God is so good I said you know what I I actually humbled down for my my big fancy Jeep I said I got this old simple 16 Jeep Grand Cherokee I said it's got a lot of miles on it I said but you know what it's got the presence of God in it and he said you know what that's what we need huh he kind of leaned back the 78 79 year old man he kind of leaned back on his car like that I said you know what I said you I said I've made a commitment to God that I'm going to be the Revival everywhere I go I'm going to put fire if I talk to somebody and the salesman sitting beside here I told him I would give you my deals and you can feel his confidence dropping really fast because because go I'm not selling the vehicle tell him don't buy this vehicle I started talking about the Lord I said you know what you can have Revival I said God will move in your life God wants to move in your life if you will welcome the Holy Spirit he will come he will come right here on this lot and the man took his hat off he said let's do it right now I said absolutely grab him right there begin to pray oh God I ask you to stir this man's Faith would you fill him with the spirit so much God that everywhere he goes he can move in your spirit brother and sister that is my encouragement to you you can do this you can be the witness that was a woman that's that come in the presence of Jesus Christ and she ran with to from the well and she began to testify come and see a man come and see this thing that CH he knew the desires of my heart come and see she wasn't the Evangelist she was the testifier I'm here to tell you brother and sister you are the testifiers of the grace of God you are the ones that can say come and see a man come into this presence come hear this word CU it changed my life but the devil will try to take your confidence away he'll make it where you go you didn't get your prayer answered get out of here devil we're going to come to a close but let me show couple more testimonies but it's okay I've had such a Revival and I was praising the Lord and I was in my Jeep and I was singing I was just praising him and I come to the stop lot and my work is literally right here I could throw a wrench and bust a window if I wanted to I don't want to but I could if I want sometime I was walking up I this say my truck was behind me it were at a complete stop and there was a turn where I can get in the left lane and I can make my left turn he would stopped and I started to move left and I am right in The Blind Side of this semi- TR and he starts moving straight over and he's pushing me over and a semi- TR is coming this way and he's going to crush me right in between the two semis and I can't go backwards I got someone behind me I can't stay where I'm at I'm gonna get crushed the only thing I know to do is just floor it so I hit my gas and I floor it I missed this semi and this one over here hit me just picked the whole side of my Jeep up and slammed it down and I just go through the light and pull over and the guy just kept on driving and Old Devil said where's your Revival at now I said slap the dash I said you looking at it we sitting here for a few minutes and I call the cops on myself hey I've been hit I said this is what happened he said so you're calling the cops on yourself said yep that's what happened okay officers on the way they go through there and he well you didn't do anything wrong he said you did what you're supposed to do he said don't worry about it well if you look at my Jeep it's already fixed fix the lord gave me a wheel and he got the the deal fixed on it and it's back to New well the next very next day i' I've been dealing with a stomach ache and my for the last probably three months but the last three weeks was so bad that it would make me sick I would just hurt so bad but I couldn't uh took a little bit of cut and pay I'm making like a quarter of what I used to make so if you can imagine I don't really want a doctor bill so I was trying to hold off and hold off and my stomach was hurting so bad that day brother and sister it just I could hardly walk and I got home I got a little dog about this tall not the yellow one this a black one uh this thing walked

reinforcements you know he said Daddy you've got to go to the doctor you always tell us if we're sick we need to go to the doctor doctor we go to the doctor okay so we'll go to the doctor we're

beel begin to tell me you know what there is something seriously wrong going on here and uh we're sitting here for just a few minutes and that devil got right on my shoulder he said where's your Revival at now you're sitting inside an ER and you're telling me you've got Revival you're going to sit here and tell me you're going through this and you've got Revival and she played that song and my my son Elijah was singing them specials and my the leading the song and my daughter henah is singing a special and we were playing inside that little sanctuary and the music going and you could see each person eventually SL listening to this this service that we're in the waiting room and I said devil you're looking at the Revival well the doctor he said and I'm telling you what that pain is was hurting so bad there if you touch anywhere I'm talking it felt like something was ripped on the inside we thought maybe something got ripped in the in the car accident we go back to the doctor and the doctor does the test on it and he comes back and and he says your your results are pristine he said I'm not talking about just a little bit he said I'm talking you are absolutely your fluid your test

I'm here to tell you it's not during the feelings and the emotions it's in it's in the Still Moments whenever you are walking by faith and God can bring healing to your body in those times and I told her she cancel the P I don't need to go to doctor and my stomach is them wrong it's still big but it's over three months I've been dealing with this pain in my stomach brother and sister and I'm not I'm talking about a Divine Healing that God brought healing to my stomach I'm talking about a Divine Healing where God can move you so if you've got a need this morning I just want to encourage you to Let's claim the blood let's all stand there's a Revival for you you say Amen where you you can be the Revival where you can be filled with the spirit where you can claim your healing brother and your sister and I just want to encourage you because there will be times remember these words Whenever there will be times when you will feel like you are walking alone there will be times whenever you like you know what I feel like I'm the devil will try to tell you there's something wrong there's something wrong you did something wrong you did something wrong I've had this happen me brother and sister let me give you one last testimony me I've had it happen to me where the devil will tell you you you got something wrong you got something wrong you got something wrong and then whenever you say what have I done wrong and he will make you feel so bad because you've done something wrong you've done something wrong you've done something wrong and then you ask yourself what did I do wrong and you began to look and say what did I do wrong and there's nothing there the devil will try to make you walk in condemnation of telling you you've done something wrong you've done something wrong and when you look at it there's nothing there it's a lying spirit and that spirit will try to make you feel the bondage of this right here brother and sister this is your Battle Ground because you the devil will try to make a person feel like they ain't got the Holy Ghost when they do he'll make another person feel like they got the Holy Ghost when they don't you can't go by speaking a tongue you can't go to shouting it's what you are here you can try to act like a cat all you want to or a cat try to act like a dog but you let me put its tail in a viice you will find out real quick what it's made of that's right and brother and sister whenever we're walking this walk anybody can shout we're here but whenever you got that pressure and we're under the greatest pressure this world has ever seen right now pressure yeah that devil is just squeezing and squeezing and squeezing and may he only get the lily of the valley the more he squeezes more of that genuine Life coming on the outside of me we know the real us let me encourage you this morning and say Lord help me to be more like Christ Lord help me to be that Spirit whenever this press and this pressure is coming on that Lord I can love my wife like I've never loved her before that I can love my husband I can have patience with my children as I've never before that I will love my pastor listen to me there is a spirit going around of trying to cause divisions trying so hard to cause divisions in families in churches that Devil's trying to separate let me call let me challenge you this morning that there will be a spirit of unity among us where we will not allow Satan to bring divisions in our family ask for me in my house we're going to serve the Lord ask for me in this church we're going to serve the Lord and when that Pastor gets up there and he's got to preach and lay the wood so to speak may I say ask for me in my house we're going to serve the Lord yes sir you know a lot of people love it when that brother will preach as long as you don't preach on them oh that brother needed that I hope they're listen I hope that brother's listening oh that sister needs that preach that brother brother and sister we need to say I need that sir I need that may this words right here never ever ever speak against my brother and my sister and may this right here never ever ever sit and listen to Somebody talk about it because those spirits will come inside a church and it'll cause brother and sister begin to talk about one another talk against the pastor talk about this brother and sister that is not the Holy Spirit we as we must remember we are fighting not flesh and blood this is a spiritual warfare to where spirits will try to come against the church come against the CH the the the families or try to come against the pasture we must acknowledge this spirit is not of God he's trying to divide us whenever we say Lord I want Unity amen let's all bow our heads for just a moment I know this is not one
