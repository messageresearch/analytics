here this evening and and um I trust everyone's had a had a good day uh thus far and um we appreciate uh the help tonight uh getting the tent loaded up and um uh we we just came skitting in just about the time for church this evening um Brother Bruce Fletcher from the nol House of Prayer is is in the hospital and and um they've given him a pretty uh rough diagnosis he's not too much older than I am and and and um and so we ran up there this morning to pray for him and and um uh so I appreciate my chauffeur amen my wife driving me and and um so we want to continue to pray for Brother Bruce Fletcher and um while we were up there uh we had a tornado warning and so they took this sick man that's so sick and they had him out in the hall and all the rest of us out in the hall and and uh so tornadoes everywhere Satan's just having a wonderful a wonderful time on this Earth but we're preparing for another world and there will be no tornado Satan will be bound destroyed can you say amen I wonder if we could just go to the Lord in prayer before we read the scriptures here tonight and if you've got a need on your heart why don't you just raise it before the Lord tell him what you have need of this evening as I looked on the prayer page and seeing sister Becky's request and sister April's request and of course being there with Brother Bruce [Music] and reading brother Kobe's deal and the man being killed and this this life is full of Sorrow the only way out of this friends is the Lord Jesus father we look to you tonight as we have seen just in these four instances that I've just mentioned here Lord and how that things can take a turn so quickly [Music] and oh God there's only one relief and that's you and Lord we have a Dying World that needs you Lord father we need you here tonight there not a One Stop fixes all we we need you every day of our life and Lord I'm asking that you would see the needs of the congregation here today and that you would meet every one of their needs see sister Angie and see my father Lord oh God that you would strengthen and heal and raise them up off the bed of Affliction we pray Lord that you would see these other need needs that have already been presented to you Lord we're a needy people we need you we thank you for hearing our prayers we're asking Lord that you would just be with us here tonight and you would open the words of Life To Us Lord we don't want to partake of the tree of knowledge we want to partake of the tree of life for your words are life their health and their strength we thank you for it ask that you would anoint the speaker and the hearer tonight that you would be glorified in everything that is that has spoke this evening in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ can the church say amen amen and amen God bless you we're going to turn here to back to the Book of Revelations and and um the second chapter and we're just going to read that 11th verse and um we have uh been on the first portion of that 11th verse uh for the last three Wednesdays and um we um and it's it's talking about the the Holy Ghost and last last week we we um dealt with the inside teacher and um those that didn't get uh didn't get to hear that I know some were still off on the trip and and so we um I would encourage you to just go back and it was just some some good things to to go back and and uh and and listen to but La last week I will put my laws in your heart and so it's so it's not the tree of knowledge but it's the tree of life and and um and so we're going to still deal brother brand I'm still dealing with the Holy Ghost and so let's just read here in Revelations 2 And1 he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit Seth unto the churches now brother brandham again last week he said now amen he that hath an ear God has to give the ear that's the inside teacher if you don't have that if there's not a seed in there then you'll never be able to hear him amen God bless you you can be seated here tonight so we um we as we remember what we are studying amen we we are we are studying remember the two Vines within the framework of the church amen now there's also the the the trees there's the two trees amen you've got you've got the Allelujah I didn't I I didn't bring our other um from this past weekend I don't have my other uh markers hey this one's working better there's the tree of life [Music] amen there's the tree of death so we've got life and we've got death they're both side by side they're both in the same Garden amen they're both they're both available they're they're available to Amen to uh to to everyone so um each of us are a product now each of us are we we understand that the as we looked here the man we we were supposed to be the product of the tree of life you yourself um I'm just going to put the elect amen that thing is a bad that that thing I'm on we need to throw that baby away amen so um the elect was supposed to come off that this tree of life amen everything about you was supposed to come off of that body Soul and Spirit should have came off that tree of life amen you were Adam was a soul at the beginning God created Adam in his own image you he was then he was put in a body amen uh in in Genesis 2:2 uh and 2 and 7 amen and but and he could have lived forever but he come come and took partook of the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil and when he partook of this it brought the elect Amen in a fallen condition now you and I amen every time a child is born you're just another Apple Amen on the tree of death every one of us when we're born we're born on this tree of death and and and and we can't help it amen it don't matter you're you're every one of you the the most innocent of of Innocents back there the the baby girl Juniper that was born she's born off of the tree of death right and and there was no way to get you back over Amen to this now your soul your your soul is still here your soul is still predestinated your soul is in that Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world but you're you're you are your body is born right here in this sir and your your your spirit is the nature of the flesh so so we we are all born and and here here's here's the problem we tried God tried to get uh Israel to understand his word back back in the Old Testament he tried to reveal his himself to those people amen so here you are let's just put let's just take this this uh little this little fruit right here amen and now uh and now here you are you're you're the product of this now God's trying to show his laws his love his Holiness his Perfections he's trying to show it to this individual here but this individual is came off that tree of death we've come off of that amen so when when Moses brought the law and the pillar of fire came down there was nothing that that that that thing uh uh that that this could produce because we're all we're we're all dying creatures we're we're we're all uh uh subject to death can you say Amen now but the only thing is on the inside of that elect is an eternal Gene seed that came from God right yes Hallelujah so brother brandham would put it this way amen can y'all see if I if I if I do it down here he says here's he he drew three circles yeah all right this is the body this is the spirit this is the soul yeah all right all right all right so so you understand it all right so you've got you've got your three you've got your three this came off the tree of death this came off the tree of death this did not come off the tree of death this came off the tree of life so what are we going to do when people are coming in with this easy believism and that's what brother bradam was dealing with last week brother bradam says or he's fixing to deal with it right now actually and now last week we dealt with the fanaticism part of it that if you if you jump and shout and you rejoice and you're this that and the other then you've got the Holy Ghost and he's and he's trying to show us that Spirit man can be so anointed by the devil but if it has not this Soul has not received eternal life in it you're still going to die that's right amen you understand so so as we go into to our lesson here tonight remember I want you to understand what brother random is trying to say it's not in learning the new birth is or or the Holy Ghost is the new birth this right here something happens right there amen uh uh sis if you'd put up the heart put up that one with the heart or or the uh uh the one with the Holy Spirit in it and brother Bram says when you deal with the seed here then it will take the spirit and it'll take the the body in its control okay have I scribbled around too much Hallelujah y'all understanding what I'm what I'm saying so you get he says you get the holy spirit in the soul with the new birth then it's the inside teacher it tells your mind what you're going to listen to it has the authority over uh uh o over your conscience and your memory and your imagination and your reason in and your affection it takes control of your sight it takes control of your smell and your hearing and your taste and your touch it it takes control now if that Soul has not been reborn if it's not received the life of God in it then then you're you're still totally off that tree of death now how many is ah someone brought my other stuff up here while I wasn't looking amen praise the Lord so so we um so so how many understand that y'all understand what I'm talking about now okay let's um uh uh now and and and and the reason I want to really now why what is the purpose for these Church ages he's trying to tell us God came in with his tree and then Satan came in with his tree and and the thing is Satan's tree is going to grow bigger and wider than God's tree Satan is going to do what he done in the Garden of Eden point you to the tree of knowledge and get you to get it here instead of get it here Adam was a living soul and so must you be through the new birth how many understands that now amen so today we've got the pendulum it seems like the the the pendulum is is is rocking it's either extreme fanaticism you got you're running all over the church and and if you don't speak in tongues and if you're not prophesying then you ain't got the Holy Ghost then the pendulum comes over here easy believism oh just just shake the preacher's hand and recite a Creed or or uh uh in the message circles just believe that God sent William brandom as a prophet and and now you've got the Holy Ghost both of them are wrong right God's not in fanaticism God God's Not In formalism God's in life God's in life that's what he's wanting and that's what brother bandam is is the holy spirit through brother Bram is just pointing out don't leave that life amen because that's the inside teacher that's the one that brings you into that that place with God can you say amen amen so let's let's look here at page 144 four and um we're going to start at that first at that first uh uh paragraph there he says so you can see now that we cannot afford to say what the Bible has not said when scripture teaches us that the work of the Holy Spirit and the manifestation of the blessed person uh of that blessed person is to bring the truth of each age to the true seed of that age then we know that the spirit has to be abiding in the person or he cannot receive the truth for that time amen that is exactly correct and if these ages bring out anything surely they surely bring and bear out this truth now that's where we finished up last week now we're starting fresh now before we leave this subject I want to make myself very clear on the baptism with the Holy Ghost on what the baptism of the Holy Ghost is according to the word it is not according to me and it is not according to you it has to be according to thus sayith the Lord or we are falsely LED Amen to begin with you will notice in my meetings when I have finished preaching an Evangelistic service or some teaching message I cast the net and invite a response from people I ask them to come forward and receive the Holy Spirit my Pentecostal friends upon hearing me say this believe that I'm inv inviting people to come forward to be baptized with the Holy Ghost because they've already been born again so when I invite those who are Spirit-filled to come and deal with those who have answered the invitation to receive the spirit these dear ones search forward and deal with the people in such a manner as to encourage them to yield to God and believe to speak in tongues this has caused great deal of Confusion And I want to tell you exactly what I mean I mean for The Sinner to come forward and be born again which is to be baptized into the body of Christ by the Holy Ghost which is exactly what took place in Pentecost or at Pentecost when the church was launched in other words to be born of the spirit is to be truly baptized with the Holy Ghost it is one and the same now I realize that it is going to be confusing for a moment here as most of you know I was ordained a Baptist preacher and I have steadfastly declared that the Baptist have missed it for saying you receive the Holy Ghost when you believe for that is not so so now he's he's he's going to he's going to hit this and this is where amen we don't have to worry about fanaticism in the message we um you know some some people uh they're saying there's too much fanaticism going on right now in the message well I've been in fanaticism I I I I know what's out there but what we've got to watch out for is this easy believism so I want every one of you uh for the next four or five uh pages I want us to really listen or really catch this he says he says for that is not so you receive him since you believed Acts 19 and 2-6 he said unto them have you received the Holy Ghost since he believed and they said unto him we have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost and he said unto them unto what then were you baptized and they said unto John's baptism then said Paul John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance saying unto the people that they should believe on him which should come after him that is on Christ Jesus when they heard this they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus and when Paul laid hands upon them the Holy Ghost came on them and they spake with tongues and prophesied there it is Paul asked have you received since not when uh you believed there is a great difference there for it is after we believe that we receive Ephesians 1:13 is is an exact word repeat of what happened in in Ephesus according to Acts 19 in whom ye also trusted after that ye heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation in whom also after ye believed not when you believed ye were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise now here is my point too many of our modernists and even our fundamentalist so-called believe un salvation at a certain specific time which in many cases is making a decision and that is and that has been called receiving Christ or being born again now to receive Christ is to receive his Spirit to receive his spirit is to be born again to receive his spirit is to be baptized with the Holy Ghost amen these folks believe that is wonderful but they stop there they receive the Holy Ghost but you receive the Holy Ghost after you believe it has always been that way and always will be the very first word of Direction to the people was by Peter at Pentecost and he said repent be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promises unto you and to your children and to all that are AAR off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call can you say Amen so so when you when you are when when you are receiving Christ now brother brandham is is making something very clear here there is a difference Amen in receiving Christ and giving yourself to Christ amen when when you come and and you give your life to Christ and you are Justified amen that's the blood of Christ coming down and washing you and you're when when justification amen he takes away all of your sins he takes away every the blood is powerful you don't you don't start receiving the blood after you receive the Holy Ghost you receive you receive forgiveness of sins amen God God God justifies you you in a in a state of justification but you are not alive right right your soul is still dead and as long as that soul is still dead you are dictated by the tree of death it don't matter how many prophets preach to you how many true preachers preach to you it don't matter how much you read the Bible if this Soul has not been energized by the tree of life amen you can only think according to the tree of death that's right you can only live according to the tree of death amen God has Hallelujah I love this God has ordained it that the Tree of Life abide here which will dictate Body Soul and Spirit can you say amen amen you become that so so I when I give my life to Christ is one thing but when I receive the Life of Christ is when the Holy Spirit comes in me okay amen amen hallelujah so so it's not in oh yes I believe it's right oh yes believe brother brenham's a prophet oh yes I believe this the Devils believe right but Devils can't live the life of the Tree of Life Hallelujah they can manufacture knowledge but they can't manufacture life amen and that's what Satan's doing he has done a whole bunch of knowledge but I'm so thankful that there's still the tree of life for all of God's children amen well glory to God all right y'all are are we ready let's go on down to the next paragraph these directions came as a direct answer from Peter relative to what actually happened at Pentecost what came to pass was that God according to Joel was pouring out the the promised Holy Spirit upon All Flesh he was not poured out before that time or given before that time that that this was it but this was to come uh from now on by repenting being baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and then God was Duty bound to fill the ones who came Peter or or any of the other Apostles never said you must be born again and then filled with the spirit this is the pattern of experience relative to receiving the Holy Spirit note carefully the very next time that the Spirit fell Upon A people acts 8 5-17 then then Philip went down to the city of Samaria and preached Christ unto them and the people with one Accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spoke and hearing and sing The Miracles which he did for unclean spirits crying with a loud voice came out of many that were possessed with them and many taken with palsies and that were lame were healed and with great joy in that City and there was great joy in that City but there was a certain man called Simon which Before Time in the same city used sorcery and be Bewitched the people of Samaria giving out that himself was some great one to whom they all gave heed from the least to the greatest saying this man is the great power of God and to him they all they had regard because that of long time he had Bewitched them with sorceries but when they beli Philip preached the thing things concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ they were baptized both men and women then Simon himself believed also and when he was baptized he continued with Phillip and wandered beholding the Miracles and signs which were done and when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God they sent unto them Peter and John who when they went down prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Ghost for as of yet that he was Fallen upon none of them only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus now then they laid their hands on them and they received the Holy Ghost according to verse 12 they believed the word amen now I want you to catch that they believed the word they were then baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus but according to verse 16 in spite of all that they had still not received the Holy Spirit it was only after believing and being baptized correctly that they received the Holy Ghost this is the pattern that was set out set forth by Peter in Acts 238 through 39 another scripture that cast wondrous light on this is found in Galatians 3:13 and 14 uh cursed is everyone that hangeth on a tree that The Blessing of Abraham might come upon the Gentiles through Jesus Christ that or in order that we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith Now by no means can it be said that the blessing of Abraham is the new birth and that the promise of the spirit is the baptism of the Holy Ghost as with as as two separate events for the scripture reads thus Jesus died on the cross by means of that death and Resurrection The Blessing of Abraham came on the Gentiles leaving the Jews this transpired in order that the spirit might become available to the Gentiles to understand what I have just said is to clear up why students have never ever found Paul saying at any time be born again and then be spirit filled you they have inferred it uh is there and they have put their own meanings uh to make it say it but the scripture does not say that Jesus never said either look at John 7 37-39 and read it now with understanding in the last days that great feast of that great day of the feast um Jesus stood and cried saying if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink he that believeth on me as the scriptures hath said out of his belly shall flow rivers of Living Water but this spake he of the spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because that Jesus was not yet glorified now it says here distinctly and emphatically that the believer upon drinking uh upon drinking by coming unto Jesus in faith would have rivers of Living Waters poured out of him and it places this experience at Pentecost now keeping this thought in mind we read John 4:10 and 14 if thou knewest the gift of God and who it is that saith to thee give me to drink thou would have asked um of of him and he would have given thee living water but whosoever drink of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst but the water that I shall give him shall be in in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life this same living water is mentioned but this time is not a colar river it is called an artisian well there is where people make their mistake because it is called a well and a river they think in one place it's eternal life given by the spirit and in the next place where it is called a river implying a great diamondis uh it has to be the spirit now giving as as an enduement of power not so it is one and the same it is the spirit that gives life and power that came at Pentecost now now everyone understanding this so so here's here's what brother Ram is saying they say you receive eternal life when you repent okay they say that you have amen the b or that that that that eternal life that you are born again when you repent the new birth does not happen at justification the new birth happens at the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen now there there there is a problem there brother Bram is dealing with this here there's a problem with this easy believism saying that I'm newborn and now I'm waiting for power no no it's your the new birth and the power comes with the baptism of the Holy Ghost there's where the nature change comes in it's not on the believing that's justification it's in the receiving of the life that you have the power of God living and residing within you living his life through you can you say Amen so so why does the church set powerless as a as in in in as a whole is because we've got fanaticism claiming they've got the life of God and they ain't got it and then we've got this formalism saying oh we've got the word and they ain't got it there's got to be not a believing but a receiving of the life within you if you don't you you you you you learn the way you'll learn how to act you'll learn learn learn it's not in learning this message is not learning this message is the is is is the the Holy Spirit giving a book to people who has received the Holy Ghost when you received the Holy Ghost the inside teacher why when the open book comes amen you can see those seals you can see you you might not be able to explain it but there's the inside teacher saying that's the truth that's the truth that's the truth and he lives his life in and through you that's right oh I'm telling you you're a powerful church this this the the the open book is not to a dead individual who is still on the tree of death come on the book of life amen or the the open book is to those who have had the experience of God's eternal life on the inside of them they know what to do with that book The brid will know what to do with that book and she will she will she will follow thus sayith the Lord or she'll keeps steal why because there's something on the inside that's that's lining up with it amen praise the Lord you love him all right now he says uh down to the next paragraph now what has caused this misunderstanding the answer is experience we have gone by experience and not the word away with experience as your measuring line there is only one Plum line only one rod and that is the word now watch carefully and get this Peter said repent be baptized everyone uh in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost Paul says have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed this is the whole of our problem right here people repent of their sins they get baptized in water but they don't go on and receive the Holy Ghost you believe unto the receiving of the uh the spirit Believing on Jesus is the step in the right direction which is toward the the Holy Ghost but the people stop there they go as far as water and then stop they believe and then stop the Bible does not say when you believe uh you receive when you believe it is have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe now I have heard this ever since I've been in the message and you know what they do they use that experience don't use experience as the plum line and they tried to use that I've heard so many preachers use that to to say well you don't need the baptism of the Holy Ghost and God don't speak in tongues we're we're we're full of experience we stay with the word no brother bradam says take the word as your Plum line and if you're going to take the word as your Plum line don't stop at just believing go on to receiving amen see sometimes we take these quotes and we don't well we don't want they never read this up this last part of it all they're doing is you and what they do is we use these things to pit against each other we we don't I I'm not I'm not wanting the pendulum out here in fanaticism and I sure don't want it over here in in formalism I want the life of the word amen and every one of us want the life of the word I'm telling you you get the life of the word it'll make you think different it'll make you act different it'll make you talk different yes amen that's right it'll it'll it'll it'll it'll make you pick the right kind of jobs it'll make you pick the right kind of girls and boys it'll make you do all of that the preacher won't have to amen the preacher won't have to just constantly be because why why why is it when you know when when the preacher constantly just trying to bring the the the word of life amen to a person that's not been born again it's just it's it's it's it's useless there's nothing there to receive it yet right amen so you con telling you need to be Church you need to be doing this you shouldn't take that job it's keeping you from church it's get and the natural goes right back to the tree of knowledge and says well but it ain't going to hurt well it but script see you're the inside teacher is not there to bring you in line with the Tree of Life True you've got to have the inside teacher and it will agree with every word of God without the but but but but but but it'll be your Plum line you boys get the Holy Ghost we ain't going to have to holler and scream and tell you to get away from those Jezebels the Holy Ghost is going to direct you back it's the inside teacher sir before then you'd be chasing skirts and lips amen and boobs and and that and and every every Fallen man will do it every man that is right that that is off this tree of life will follow amen all the sex symbols of this world [Music] true What Makes You Different amen you look the same Hallelujah got to find my green my green dude here hallelujah amen you've got you you you you you're still looking the same as as the other guys what's different on the inside has been that Eternal Jean seed that has been ignited and it comes from right here and it directs now from the inside of that Soul that's been born again it's now directing what goes on in every one of those deals there amen y'all follow me sir so if you're in church and you're struggling you're struggling to live this life you need the Holy Ghost now the devil temps me and the devil's going to tempt you he will he'll tempt every one of you but the inside teacher he's got your he's got your number yes the inside teacher saying no no that's not who we are no you go back to that tree of life you've been given the baptism of the Holy Spirit you are you have the very character of God living in you Hallelujah no preacher can do that no sir no Prophet can do that no Mom and Daddy can do that only the baptism of the Holy Ghost all right any questions real quick before we go any further praise the Lord amen well I must be doing pretty good amen or brother bram's doing pretty good amen all right now let's see uh h let's go let's go back up let's let's go back up to where the uh the the Bold letter is but they don't go on and receive the Bap of the Holy Ghost you believe unto receiving unto receiving the spirit Believing on Jesus is the step in the right direction which is toward the Holy Ghost but the people stop there they go as far as water and then stop they believe and then stop the Bible does not say when you be you you receive When You Believe it's it is you have received the have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed the exact literal translation is did ye have did ye having previously believed receive the Holy Ghost the people believe and then stop they don't receive the Holy Ghost and then you believe unto him having repented you go on and receive the Holy Ghost do you see it that is what is wrong with our fundamentalist they have no power for they stopped short of Pentecost they are like the children of Israel who came out of Egypt stopped short of the promised land now those children of the of Israel uh now those children of Israel left e Egypt two million strong they all journeyed together all saw the same miracles of god all partake of the same mana and water from the smitten rock all followed the same Cloud by day and the pillar of Fire by night but only two re reached the promised land only two were true and were real Believers that is correct because the word tells us that the rest died because of unbelief because of unbelief they could not enter in Hebrews 139 or 3:19 since now then since that is so only two entered then the rest were not TR uh True Believers what made the difference two stayed with the word when the hearts of the 10 spies fell at kades barnea Caleb and Joshua and Caleb did not stagger for they believed the word and said we are more than able to take the land somebody say we're more than able to receive the Holy Ghost receive the Holy Ghost because brother brandom is telling us that that promised land was the Holy Ghost they knew they could because God said I have give you the land after after all those Israelites all the power and goodness and deliverance of God they did not enter into rest which is a type of the Holy Ghost you can see uh right now that very few will ever believe all the way to receiving the spirit of God now I I I want this lesson tonight to really really ring deep I want us now if you've got the Holy Ghost you know the devil will will try to tell you well if you got the Holy Ghost he'll tell you you ain't got it and if you don't have the Holy Ghost he'll tell you you got it yes sir he that's that's the way he does it so you've got to line your thought your belief everything you are the core you the core of your actions the core of your motives the core of everything you've got to be honest and ask your am I lining up am that's good because if not you're simply learning how to fit in you're simply an imitator God don't want a Pharisee God wants a body he can live in can you say Amen so what we what we must do is what's causing that M why did why did I put that text out what what what brother am I trying to correct or why what why did I say this what what am I what's the motive what's the motive the motive must be the Holy Ghost living his life through every one of us why why do I why do I act the way I act what's C what's what's see the river that's inside you if it's the Holy Ghost and if it's gushing out now people have put it as the excitement it's like a river that's good it's like fire in my bones and I just it's just and and and everyone wants to make it as if it's running and shouting and dancing well it'll make you do that too it it'll it'll do that but what is it it's the character of Christ bubbling out yes sir it's the nature of Christ bubbling out it's the very laws of God coming forth from a from our very inertive inertive innards amen it's what we want it's who we are can you say amen amen that now that is is is the holy spirit it's something within you that you you're not thinking about it it's who you are oh Church oh I tell I I I always tell you you boys and girls when it's just me and you and one on one I say oh make sure you go all the way because this life this life that I'm talking about is not just a sermon to me this is not a sermon I've experienced this life it's it's something that goes way down deep now do I make my mistakes of course of course of course amen there's going to be those times where I where where I I I I I make those mistakes and and we all make those mistakes why amen Body Spirit so this here the body was not reborn when when Jesus says you've got to be born again Nicodemus says H do I need to take all of me and enter back into my mama's room well you would still come back out off the tree of death that's right the tree of death the body is the product of the tree of death right Born Again can only happen right here in this Soul Hallelujah and I've already taken too much time the next part brother brandom is that the next these these next few pages brother bram's going to start dealing with election and he's going to tell you there's only a certain amount of people that can be born again he's going to show us that you can have the Holy Ghost on your spirit man and what I'm going to do is I'm going to use green for death okay amen well how Hallelujah all right never mind all right so so if the spirit and the Soul come or the spirit and the body come off the Tree of Life Death H how many agrees with that that's the reason why just just Keys could you put that uh back up there again that's the reason why Satan can tempt us the scripture says that you can be tempted by the devil amen hallelujah whoa Hallelujah so you can be tempted by the devil and you can imagine things that are not right can y'all read that up there y i i I'm having a hard time reading it I'm here conscience the devil can come in on your conscience right and mess with you your memory he can still come on your memory and anoint your memory reasoning HH oh he'll try to get you to start thinking and reasoning well sister so and so and H brother so and so ah yeah now I explains it or well the Bible says this but I know it says that but listen we're living in the 21st century here and hey if I'm going to if I'm going to get me a girlfriend I'm going to have to dress a little bit differently I've got to be reasoning affections he still has control you came from that you're tempted to tell a lie you're tempted you're tempted but when that Soul has been has received its life that seed has been energized by God now it comes out of this inner gate brother Bram calls the soul so he calls that the throne room and now the king is sitting in there and now the now the spirit is not born again the body is not born again amen it can still be controlled by either or one or the other you your body will most likely choose video games it'll most likely choose fun and pleasure your body will it'll never want to come to church it'll never want to come matters of fact the least amount of time that it can give for the things of God the better but it will it will it will come over just to look good for everybody okay just to just just to pay their dues this body will go either or but it's its nature is this way the Apostle Paul says within en means two laws at War there's the law of death and there's the law of Life spirit is the nature of that body is that right amen that's good how is it that in this last age people are speaking in tongues and they are they play the part so well but Jesus says on the inside of them they're full of dead men's bones how is it is because inside here there's not been a new birth sister Caya would you put that other picture up there with the snake Hallelujah if the spirit if if if the spirit of the of of you have another one with where you got the two the three circles and then and then um well those are good too Hallelujah but but that one that I've got with a it's the same one that you put up there originally but it's got the it's got the snake in the in the middle of that so but if the devil if this is dark what did Jesus say what did Jesus say she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she lives that means there's nothing here to energize the serpent the snake is down in here okay and and and it's it's it's it's it's it's going to live Satan's going to live his life all right all right all right we're fixing the close I'm I'm not we're not going to read no more of the church age book tonight but I want you to catch this how is it that it would deceive the very elected if it were possible on because the devil how is it that brother Bram says the devil can speak in tongues and the devil can work miracles how is it um sister ke uh could you could you look that up in uh the uh in uh in in that day they'll come and say have we not prophesied and cast out Devils see have we not yet prophesied in thy name now brother brandham says you can how many's heard brother brandham say you can have the Holy Ghost every day of your life and go to hell yes sir now this is where it gets really scary yes sir this is where it gets really scary because we're fixing to find out that when brother when brother bradam we we found that out last week where brother bradam said when you receive the Holy Ghost it's till the day of your Redemption you cannot be lost but then he turns around and says you can have the Holy Ghost every day of your life and go to hell how is it that many will say to me in that day Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name in thy name cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works how is it that Jesus will say and then I will profess unto them I never knew you depart from me you worker ye that work iniquity how how h h h how does this happen H how can how can you do that and then on that day he say you bunch of idiots you never receive the Holy Ghost G you never received my life come on you never partook of who I am brother BR aren't you died for a prophet Amen brother brandom says the spirit man is subject to Two Worlds right the spirit man amen is subject to the to the spirit Spirit man Spirit you can't see you can't see your conscience you you can't see your memory you can't see your reasoning you can't see those things it is a spirit and it can be subject to Devils it can be subject to God how is it the preachers can go out there and and and and preach work miracles living a life of adultery uh uh having multiple uh uh Affairs and all of that is because they Spirits can be picking up off the things of God and they and through their body they can perform Miracles they can preach and be anointed that's right because of the Spirit Outlet this imagination conscience memory uh uh reasoning affections and it can come out and it'll come out through your hearing or your or your Voice or your touch or it'll come out this is anointing this that's right and this is As Dead As 12:00 Spirit anointed body anointed devil residing on the inside that's right well Glory so so that's the reason why we we we can't go by experience Lord let me line up let let me get really serious here what's my motives what's my what's what what's what's moving me what's motivating me what's compelling me I I'm not I'm going to I'm going to put my cloak of of of a Preacher aside I'm going to I'm going to take off the CL of oops of of a preacher and I'm going to what a sight I'm going to come I'm going to come as I'm going to come before you today with without without the the cloak of a without the cloak of a of a singer with without the cloak of a Preacher without the cloak of a of a of a of a of a giver I'm going I'm going to I'm going to throw that I'm going to throw it aside and I'm going to come naked before you Lord come on and you tell I want you to really examine me I want to be right yes sir I want to be right with everything that I've got this is serious I want the Holy Spirit to have its way in me not with how many hats I wear not with how many garments I wear not with well man I'm a singer and I'm a musician and I'm a pastor and I'm a good father and I'm a good husband and I'm a good grandfather oh man God must be pleased if you don't have the life the devil's children remember remember Hallelujah love him this is tree of life and the tree of death is all under the umbrella Hallelujah the umbrella of church that's that's where deception is that's right Life Death Church see what I'm saying so when we look at this then it makes us really grasp this and and uh makes us really think and there is what brother brandom is trying to get us remember through this through through these uh Church ages he's wanting us to see how Satan has slid in here so Satan is worshiped instead of God and God is the word Living Word M live your word in me y'all understand you can't understand what I'm talking about this is more important than this that's the reason why it's the reason why people can go totally insane and still have the Holy Ghost wow that's the reason why Hallelujah bad deal Hall amen going to redo it I want I'm I'm closing amen all right Body Spirit which is mind I'm just going to I'm just going to replace that spirit with mind and then so body can die and go to the grave and you're still saved mind can go totally crazy insane to where you don't even know what a about you don't even know your own name don't even know who your mom is don't even know I mean it's gone and you're still saved that's right because the soul has ate off the tree of life can you say that it it don't but but the others they want they not worried about this they're worried about what they look like they're worried about what everything else this is not important you get this taken care of you women will dress right you you get this taken care of these days we're needing to preach to boys you you you get that taken care of and you ain't looking like a little pimp amen you you you get the soul taken care of you will look like a man you will a woman will look like a woman Christians will look like Christians if the musicians would come amen I'm tired tonight and so I'm there's no telling what I'm going to say amen amen I will put my law in their inward part now brother brandom now now now the back of what I'm saying here brother brandham here this is what brother brandham says about you a child the bride brings forth on the word can't die because it's the word amen did you get that she can't die cuz she's the child that child can't die because he's a word child he is a seed child he's an eternal child amen hallelujah now that's exactly what Jesus Christ was was a spoken Eternal child child didn't have to die but he did it in order to pay the debt that's the only way that it could be paid nobody else could do it they was all sexual born after the devil his plan this is the devil's plan tree of death but every he said you got it now but every man no matter whether he's a pope priest Bishop whatever he is he dies because he's a hybrid he was born between Satan and Eve everyone now he's not calling you serpent seed every one of you came off the tree of death because Eve accepted Satan's lie and caused every one of us to be born sexually born therefore we're born we're we're we were born off that that's the reason why I say you're just a fruit off of the tree of death all right he says now they they may call it whatever you want but it was Satan and Eve the original word had nothing to do with it the original word was life amen amen do you love him here tonight do you see why it's so important that God would come and make sure that we're understanding there's a difference he's not he's not interested in doing another denomination doing another another a greater understanding we're not here because we have greater understanding of the Bible we're here because God wanted to see fit that you're not deceived in this age for the tree of knowledge has come and blooming to its finest the tree of knowledge is blooming and for everyone is clamoring after the tree of knowledge God's saying don't look at the tree of knowledge come look at the tree of life the tree of life is a lowly life tree of life is not it's not as pretty as the tree of death prayer is not as pretty as entertainment Bible study is not as not as not not as as lucrative as friends staying true to the word of God is Not is is not God is important as jobs and work and money and careers all of those [Music] things when Jesus when Jesus came the scripture says when the word was made flesh when the word was made flesh he was not some kind of spectacular Superman there was no Beauty there was no Beauty in this Divine One in flesh [Music] there was nothing to look and say h there was no Beauty in him but he was the word of life amen this looks pretty this looks big right now it looks scribbly this looks H the the new the Virgin born son come to take you off this tree Hallelujah and to put you on this tree he's come to take you away from here and Satan wants to keep you there he wants to keep you there on that [Music] tree let's come to the tree of life every one of us and if you don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost don't don't get discouraged you're the elect of God God's ordained you to this don't let the devil keep you from your desire every one of you in this building here if you're the elect of God you've got a desire to please him but the tree of life will try to come the tree of death will try to keep it and hamper it down you've got D down in your soul and I want to say every one of you kids every one of you kids have got that seed on the inside it's there that's why you cry at altars that's why when the spirit of the Lord comes down and it it moves upon you that's that's the reason why we have the desire to love the Lord It's the [Music] seed apple seeds are still apple seeds while they're in the package but apple seeds will never produce apples until they come to [Music] life they say that they're they found they found some of the grains they found some of the grains uh uh that that was there in from Joseph's time some some of the seeds some of the wheat seeds thousands of years later they they I I don't know how they can prove that but that's what they say and and the big boys are all they're all verifying it they found some of those seeds that had been hidden in the dark underneath the crevices and you know and they took those [Music] seeds and they put him in the ground and did you know that those seeds that are thousands of years old that looked all looked like nothing like seeds I mean they were withered and shriveled and they were they were well thousands of years old did you know they put him in the ground they watered them let light come on them and those seeds produced [Music] wheat God's already God's already got he's predestinated those seeds in you from before the foundation of the world yeah and the only thing we're waiting only thing you're waiting on Amen the only thing that God's children are waiting on is just the light to come down Holy Ghost come down and just come into my heart and just make that seed to live ah Hallelujah you get the true Holy Ghost you're not going to excuse one word we got to press the battle with everything we've got Saints you believe that tonight do you love him amen any questions before we sing that song I love that song that brother Kobe's sung [Music] before any any questions at all you're welcome I don't want to leave anyone with that scribbl with that scribbled up chart Hallelujah if Jesus if the Virgin born son had not [Music] come there'd be no hope of eternal life for me and you tonight we have the right to partake of the tree of [Music] life now we pray we earnestly pray for these these ones that sister Angie Brother Martin the these other ones that that that has been recently brought to the prayer request today we pray for them and we come based upon the word of [Music] God but if God should decide to bring them on home it won't matter what happens to this body so long as the soul has eternal life we pray for sister Torrance diligently and it wasn't that sister torren didn't have faith sister torren had great faith we believed and we prayed with everything that we had for sister t to be healed and she progressively got sicker how she looked forward to coming to church and when she would come she'd just beam as she and rejoice in the word no matter who was [Music] preaching did we fail did God fail when he took sister Torrance home no she was a Christian she had eternal life this body must [Music] go this body must fail I have no guarantee of tomorrow
