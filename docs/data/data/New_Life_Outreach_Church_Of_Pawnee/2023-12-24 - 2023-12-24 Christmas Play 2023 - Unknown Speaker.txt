and we'll let and whoever wants to participate guys you you know we'll just all participate here but we're going to do the guys and the gals and um um and help you you know as I say uh you're welcome to to to join in all right um some of these I I use this morning some of these scriptures and so I'm I'm just going to um we're going to put some of them out there and just see how we go okay all right so girls we're going to let you all answer this one all right 1 Timothy 2 and 5 there is one God and one mediator between God and Men the blank Christ Jesus oh yeah we got to have mics here [Music] mhm all right sure why not so they want the help they the girls wants the help of the grown-ups on this side and the boys wants the help from the grown-ups on this side but that one is pretty easy I preached on this one pretty long this morning man huh man the man Christ Jesus that's right so so if y'all want to help out we you you girls can do that or or this side can help and that side can help all right so that's good so we've got girls the girls are already ahead by the way amen okay here's here's another one this is in 2 Corinthians 5 and9 to it that blank was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation boys MH I can tell we're going to have to have a timer [Music] oh my goodness okay all right so what's y'all's final answer the spirit no all right so I guess we'll give it to the girls girls y'all want want to take it huh 2 Corinthians 5:9 to it blank was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself is that your final answer yeah just what's your final answer God is correct God was in Christ all right okay so girls here it's going to be back to you now um yes and you got to go whoever whoever's doing it you've got to go through the guy with the microphone and tell them what you guys of thought all right because I do happen to know that brother Merl gave y'all the answer on that one okay girls in the Book of Matthew who told Joseph that the baby was to be called Jesus he has a very SI oh good all right we got a 30 second timer here an [Music] angel all right boys in the Book of Matthew who told Joseph that the baby was to be called Jesus is it raining outside Gabriel any you adults want to pick Mary was the one who who told Joseph according to the Book of Matthew all right don't look up boys not looking too good huh no I said in the Book of Matthew who told Joseph that the baby was to be called Jesus all right so pretty good pretty good okay let's see here um let's let's look here what else Kobe gave me some here all right boys of the four gospels only one does not say anything about Christ's birth or beginning which gospel is that Mark Mark is correct Mark is correct all right chapters one and two in Matthew and Luke both give detailed accounts of when Jesus was born and then in John 1 and 14 it talks about him becoming word made flesh but Mark does not say anything about it all right um okay so girls to whom did Luke write his gospel what what was what was the purpose behind his writing and and who did he write it to you could probably get some help time is over all right boys oh y y'all got y'all y'all want to y'all want to give an huh well but you didn't ask them it's already over but go ahead and tell us your answer throw something out here huh all right name something God okay no he didn't write it to God okay all right so boys to whom did Luke write his gospel what was what was the purpose of his writing and who did he write it to that's a tough one all right if you don't know it you don't know [Music] it Mara he wrote it to Theophilus and you adults would remember remember that once it's once it was said but he but yes he pinned it to theophus to convince Theophilus all right so who do I go to now uh so it's you boys all right what was the name of the Prophet that predicted the birth of Mary's baby boy Isaiah Isaiah is correct that is right all right girls it it's um um let's see I'm going to give you another scripture Colossians 1:9 for it pleased the blank that in him should all fullness dwell for it pleased the blank that in him huh father father is correct that's right all right let's see um uh boys Colossians 2 and9 it says for in him dwelleth all the fullness of the blank bodily godhead godhead is correct I'm telling you what you guys better be glad that you've got some adults behind you tonight man okay all right that's good the the scripture says that he is uh that he was the he had the godhead bodily that is correct all right um Girls 1 Timothy 3 and16 without controversy great is the mystery of godliness blank was manifested or manifest In the Flesh Christ no the word nope you adults y'all want to Y y'all want to help them out there without controversy great is the mystery of godliness blank was manifest In the Flesh God God was manifest In the Flesh that is correct God was manifest but they didn't no one got any points on that one but God the whole purpose the whole purpose for Christmas Is God getting a body so that God could live with us God was a teenager God was a baby God God lived among Among Us can you imagine that God had a headache God felt the pains that we felt he took on a body to know go God knows our our our our misunderstandings God knows our confusions God knows all of these things the Bible says that he was in all points tempted like we are and yet that body was without sin isn't that just wonderful all right let's see um let me get another one here um let uh I'm reading through these [Music] here all right it says um who who am I talking to this time the boys all right there're in in Luke 2:1 when the angels announc to the Shepherds the birth of the savior they say for there is born to you this day in blank blank blank blank a savior who is Christ the lord the city of David correct city of David all right okay let's see um okay uh girls in the Gospel of Luke what is the name given for an army of angels praising God huh what's y'all's answer when whenever you got your answer just put it in the mind there's there's two there there's two words by the way Heavenly Host Heavenly Host is right that is right all right oh boys this going to be a hard one right here get them are you saying that they're the smarter ones all right so it's uh so which prophet told where Jesus would be born Hosea Jeremiah or Micah Micah Micah is correct yes so I I tell you what you guys are uh doing awesome tonight all right girls got you a hard one right here I don't even think the adults are going to be able to help you on this one here who did the angel tell about the death of Herod in a dream why aren't you boys over here helping where where where are the Teen why aren't the teenagers up here helping what's going on I know you are but they just they just abandoned you up here on the front row you're having to carry the load Joseph Joseph is correct Joseph is correct all right okay boys so how did the Magi avoid returning to King Herod and revealing the location of Jesus a dream they a Dream well you're you you are you are both right that so so the script so it actually it does say there in Matthew 2 and2 that the M Magi were warned in a dream to not to return to King Herod and so they departed uh into their own country a different route so that is correct that is correct all right so um girls how many times how many times is the actual term swaddling clothes mentioned in the entire Bible Well the boys said y were smart two huh two two is [Music] [Laughter] correct two is correct all right uh boys according to Luke what did the people do when they heard about the birth of Jesus from the Shepherds we only read it this morning no pressure um according to Luke what did did the people do when they heard about the birth of Jesus from the Shepherds you got you guys got to confir talk talk to the guy with my I I mean we'll take your answer anytime you want marel Marbles What marveled V not B marveled is correct the people Marvel when they heard from the Shepherds all right girls John 3:34 says for whom God hath sent for he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God for God giveth blank the Spirit by measure unto him the Father loveth the Son and hath given all things into his hands once again for God giveth blank the Spirit by measure unto him for God hath given all things into his hands John 3 and 34 for he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God for God giveth blank the Spirit by measure unto him the Father loveth the Son and hath given all things into his hands are we already past that 30 seconds these girls think it's been an eternity all right throw an answer no you can't be looking anymore you just got to throw an answer say say something go ahead [Music] huh NOP boys John 3:34 for whom for he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God for God giveth blank the Spirit by measure unto him the Father loveth the Son and hath given all things into his hands willingly no for God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him for God hath given him all things now we have the spirit when we receive the Holy Ghost we have it by measure the whole the pillar of fire on the day of Pentecost they it it split up into 120 clothing tongues of fire so we've only got a portion of the Holy Spirit within us Jesus was the fullness of God so all of God lives in Jesus so when you get to heaven the only God you will ever see in heaven is in the body of Jesus Christ amen y'all y'all got that so now we have the spirit by measure amen but Jesus had all of the godhead in him got that all right so where do we go now okay so it's the boys and they will fly past this and um um see how do we do this that what gets us in trouble a lots of times is is we have a bunch of different answers and we want to give different points and then it's hard to catch up and um how how am I going to do that Isaiah 696 um just one point just give one point for the for the whole thing and if you don't get the whole thing right the girls can steal it all all right boys here you go y'all better get it put together all right all right too bad you ain't got the rest of the guys helping you but all right so here we go y'all ready Isaiah 9 and6 For unto us a child is born unto us a son is given the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called blank blank blank blank blank blank blank blank blank blank blank blank there's really on but there's five answers his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor Mighty God Everlasting father the Prince of Peace oh you got it awesome awesome this is awesome all right girls you're going to have three here all right it's going to be three but you only get one point all right this is this is going to be this is going to be really easy where did Mary have a Little Lamb song Come no that wouldn't that wouldn't all right so Matthew 1 and 23 Behold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name blank which being interpreted is blank blank blank all right they shall call his name blank hey now you guys aren't supposed to be helping them on this side by the way they shall call his name blank which being interpreted is blank blank blank you are you are you tied up are you are you on mic is not working did you hush did you push the button you might have muted it this has got to be heard all right now we give it to the boys he said time's up uh oh keep keep make make sure we're not we we don't want to mute the mics all right Emanuel God With Us that is correcto all right man this is awesome okay boys Hosea 13 and4 says yet I am the Lord thy God from the land of Egypt and thou shalt know no God but me for there is no blank beside me hey I'm I'm I'm I'm making them a little bit tougher this year this is easy I preached on this a year and a half ago savior savior is correct did you know you mean gamy knew that one pretty good amen all right so there is no savior besides me so when we come up when you hear people talking about Jesus is the second person of the godhead you just ask him where's that found in the Bible you'll never find the second person in the godhead but you will find the uh the the Eternal god Jehovah saying there is no savior beside me there are three scriptures in the Bible that says that there you there are there is no no savior beside me so what happened was the Eternal God created a a blood cell in the womb of Mary and then God lived in that body Jesus is the fullness his body is the fullness of the godhead can I hear an amen all right now huh it matters matters of fact let me just let me just read this to you here real quickly before we before we give the girls uh here but Isaiah 550 45 and 21 says tell ye and bring near yay let them take counsel together who ha declared this from ancient time who have told it from from that time have not I the lord and there is no God else beside me a just God and a savior there is none beside me look unto me and be ye saved all ye ends of the Earth I am God and there is none else I have sworn by myself the word is gone out of my mouth my in righteousness and shall not return that unto me now so someone say unto me every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess this is god Jehovah saying it but in the in the Book of Revelations who's every knee going to bow to they're going to see Jesus and they're going to Bow their need to Jesus it's God's body you see that that's what Christmas is now God when they kneel to Christ they're kneeling to that great Eternal God that's living in that Tabernacle well I thought I'd put that in there too amen all right let's see um let how far are we have we went past our 30 minutes okay um let's let's see here Kobe's given me some here I'm looking over I didn't really get to look at him too strongly here before I came out let's see um okay Jesus girls this is for you is true or false Jesus Christ Our Savior was born on Christmas day huh that's that that is correct there is no date for the birth of Jesus that is mentioned in the scripture and they took and and they and and and they they they celebrate uh uh uh December 25th is has been the Son of God uh Pagan worship hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years before Jesus was born huh the son God that's right the s u n God they done it you can look at it I mean everyone knows it they they and they always done it on December the 25th so uh can can can you all tell me who started it who who brought it the son of God's birthday it was the it was what Catholic it was the Catholic church that's exactly right so you know but we don't care we we're not we're not into all the all the Pagan stuff about it we're just glad Jesus was born and we're thankful to know that he is our savior amen all right let's see um are we I uh I started with the girls and I ended with the girl or no so I need to end with the boys correct is that what I need to do all right so here let's let's look here I'm looking through Kobe's stuff he sent me I'm going to try to get you guys a real hard one huh let's see um h okay what did God when when an angel according to Matthew 1 and 20 uh an angel tells Joseph the young woman uh that he he is about to marry is pregnant with a child conceived of the Holy Ghost and his name would be Jesus and um uh the question is why was Jes Jesus selected as the name of the child an angel tells Joseph the young woman he is about to marry his bre okay let me reward this that I I'm just reading an angel tells Joseph that the woman he is about to marry is pregnant with a child conceived of the Holy Ghost and his name will be Jesus now this is important these days why was Jesus selected as the name of the child why why why why was why why why was he named Jesus the angel told Mary not Joseph the angel told Mary not Joseph well that is that that is correct that's exactly right and I'm just trying to understand what the name Jesus [Applause] means okay all right girls what what you you this this is this is back in your court oh you could tie this thing up the Bible says it it's it's a sentence Jehovah Jehovah why was Jesus selected as the name of the child the reason that Jesus was selected as well you already said Jehovah saor huh Jehovah Jehovah savior it it it it yeah I mean it it it it it is actually that he would save his people from their sins and so that's what the and we'll take that because that is salvation but but the but uh yes but that he he says his name is Jesus because he will save his people from their sins so should we give these girls that that that answer huh I know well sometimes you just got to override everybody and you've got the mic yeah you got all right so here here we had it uh today we had we had a tie between the girls and the boys and we appreciate all of you for participating and uh appreciate you uh you adults participating too you know I uh I I I just did y'all enjoy that play I thought that play was was awesome and I'm so thankful so thankful for that all right we're

you know their Shadow but uh I want to thank uh everybody that has volunteered to help with this without you it's it's it's not possible so without further Ado I present to you you the parable of the apples there we go there was a certain professor of religion named Dr Christensen who taught a small college in the United States Dr Christensen taught the required survey course in Christianity at this particular Institution every student was required to take the course he if his or her freshman year regardless of his or horror major although Dr Christensen tried hard to communicate the Essen the essence of the Gospel in his class he found that most of the 16-year-old students looked upon the course first year students 16 first year not old that's all right that's okay they're most of his 16 first year students looked upon the course as nothing but required drudgery despite his best efforts most students refused to take Christianity seriously this year Dr Christensen had a special student named Caleb Caleb was studying with the intent of going onto Seminary for the ministry Caleb was popular he was well-liked and he was an imposing physical specimen he was the starting center on the football on the school football team and was also the best student in the professor's class one day Dr Christensen asked Caleb to stay after class so he could talk with him Caleb how you doing good how are you hey I got a question for you how many push-ups can you do I do a hundred every night 100 wow that's pretty good Caleb do you think you could do 150 I don't know I've never done 150 at a time do you think you could I could try well can you do 150 in sets of 10 10 for every student in the class besides you I have a class project in mind I need you to do 150 push-ups in sets of 10 for this to work can you do it I need you to tell me that you can do it I think I can I'll give it a try good I need you to do it this Friday let me explain what I have in mind Friday came and Caleb got to class early and sat in the front of the room when the class started the professor pulled out a big box of apples everyone was pretty excited it was Friday the last class of the day and they were going to get an early start on the weekend with a party in Dr christensen's class Dr Christensen went to the first girl in the first row and asked charity do you want one of these beautiful apples yes Caleb would you like to do 10 push-ups so that charity can have this apple Caleb jumped down from his desk to do a quick 10 then Caleb again sat at his desk Dr Christensen put an apple on Charity's desk Dr Christensen then went to Michaela the next person and asked Michaela you saw what charity got do you want this apple okay Caleb would you do 10 more push-ups so Michaela can have an apple okay Amy sorry Lydia would you like an apple she wants an apple Caleb would you do 10 push-ups for Lydia and so it went down the road oh a Lydia there you go Maya Maya would you like an apple and lene okay uh I had to add Madison I didn't have to but it's just I had to change it would you do 10 push-ups for Madison so she can have an apple I can't give her the Apple until you do 10 push-ups Caleb did 10 push-ups for everyone on the front row before they got their apple and down the second aisle to kylin Simeon Noah Uriah and Andrew kylin you saw all these girls got an apple don't want to leave you out would you like an apple you can't have it not until he does 10 push-ups okay simy you've been a pretty good uh boy in class this your first year what uh what what school did you come from what town Pony you came from ponie yeah now you're at college I bet you're I bet your parents are are really proud of you for being the first kid in in their family to ever go to college hey would you uh would you like one of these apples sure well that's great but you know what Caleb's going to have to do 10 push-ups or you can't get the Apple Caleb would you mind doing two 10 push-ups for Simeon wow running out of apples another young fine man in class Noah how are you doing you doing good how do you like college how do you like school how you liking School you like school yeah you think I'm a good teacher good professor well thank you I should give you two should not but I can't give you any until somebody pays the price somebody's got to do 10 push-ups who's got to do 10 push-ups for you do you know Caleb Caleb uh Simeon has volunteered you to do 10 push-ups for him so he can get an Apple would would did he do 10 class want to make sure I'm not looking very close so you're going to have to make sure he does the do the required work okay they said he did they said he did 10 push-ups and you got you got an apple who we got next been in my class all this time you're right do you like apples you want an apple what if Caleb did 10 push-ups for you so you can get an Apple would you would you let him do 10 push-ups he he said he would let you do 10 push-ups Caleb would you do 10 push-ups for Uriah y'all can count them out if you want to it's up to you wow do what maybe okay okay go ahead and say your part then Dr Christensen came to Aaron Aaron was on the basketball team and in as good condition as Caleb he was very popular and never lacking confidence when the professor asked Aon do you want an apple can I do my own push-ups no no Caleb has to do the push-ups well I don't want with perfect obedience no Dr Christensen Shrugged sorry with perfect obedience Caleb started sorry sorry sorry sorry Caleb would you do 10 push-ups so Aaron can have an apple he doesn't even want sure he's doing push-ups your part hey perfect didn't want one you said you didn't want one well look Aaron this is my classroom I'm the professor I'm the teacher my desk these are my apples just just just leave it on your desk if you don't want it just leave it there leave it right there now by this time Caleb had begun to slow down a little he just stayed on the floor between sets because it took too much effort to be getting up and down you could start to see a little perspiration come out of around his brow Dr Christenson started down the third row now the students were beginning to get a little angry Dr Christensen asked Brianna Brianna do you want an apple Caleb Brianna doesn't want an apple but would you do 10 push-ups so Ranna can have an apple that she doesn't want absolutely all right Robert Fairweather would you like an apple sitting right next to her to Brianna that doesn't want one no Caleb Robert doesn't want an apple doesn't appreciate your push-ups would you do 10 push-ups for Robert so he can have an apple that he doesn't want will might get hungry see who's next where's these boys at where's these boys at there's one one where's Austin he's they're all separated we got two brothers in class going class same time one of them must have faed a grade I guess but they're in college together so we'll give them the benefit of the doubt Austin's the oldest or maybe uh Dylan did an accelerated program and he got done with high school quicker Austin you want an apple no another person that doesn't want an apple Caleb what's going on that they don't appreciate you would but would you out of the kindness of your heart would you do 10 push-ups so often can have an apple thank you wow younger brother Dylan oh man I got any apples left Dylan appreciate what he's doing would you like an apple his brother doesn't even want an apple Caleb you need an apple would you do 10 push-ups so he can have an apple that he doesn't even want Yeah by now a growing sense of uneasiness filled the room the students like Robert Austin and dilling were were beginning to say no and there were all these uneaten apples on the desks Caleb also had really put forth a lot of extra effort to get these push-ups done for each apple there began to be a small pool of sweat on the floor beneath his face his arms and brow were beginning to get red because of the physical effort involved as Dr Christensen continued four students from another class thinking there was a disturbance in Dr christensen's classroom had wandered in and sat down in the window sill when the professor realized this he did a quick count and saw there were now 19 students besides Caleb in the room he started to worry if Caleb would be able to make it the first newcomer Dr Christensen went to was Colton he asked no I'm sorry I I had to change that because they they weren't available uh U didn't get with you U so it's Luke and Paul Luke and Paul first newcomer was Luke Luke how'd you get in here you're not in my class you just walked in I guess I just you know I finally noticed you were sitting here this guy here two ladies over there they're not in my class either but since you're here do you want an apple yes sir Caleb was really having a rough time he was taking a lot more time to to complete each set he asked the next person Paul Luke Paul just did 10 push-ups so you can have an apple Paul Paul I don't know how you got in here either but you're here yeah since you're here I get to ask you if you would like an apple free Apple yep what about it Caleb you want to you want to do 10 pushups so so these these guys from off the street another class come in here sure they want an apple Kaleb sced but managed to do 10 more push-ups Dr Christensen gave an apple to each Luke and Paul a few moments later Jonah a recent transfer student came to the room and was about to come in when all the students yelled in one voice Jonah didn't know what was going on Caleb picked up his head and said in here Caleb Caleb hold on hold on do do you realize that not only for all the kids in the class you're going to have to do 10 more push-ups for Jona so he can get an Apple I'll do it for him too wow come on in Caleb do 10 push-ups we'll just let you get Jonah's out of the way right now I messed up there Caleb did 10 push-ups very slowly and with great effort Jonah bewildered was handed an apple and sat down Caleb's arms were now shaking with each pushup in a struggle to lift hisself against the force of gravity sweat was profusely dropping off of his face and by the time there was no sound except for heavy breathing there was not a dry eye in the room the very last two students in the room were two young ladies both cheerleaders and very popular Dr Christensen went to Haven the second to the last and asked young lady I know you're you're not in my class I haven't seen you before I've seen you in the hallway and walking around and other classes and uh know this is your first year and uh I don't recall your name Haven Haven that's a pretty name Haven Haven just like the rest these kids uh would you uh would you like Caleb to do 10 push-ups so you can have an apple would you like an apple um no thank you no thank you Haven doesn't want an apple Caleb maybe she sees how worn out your getting and how much effort you're putting into this and but I just want to know do you have the strength to do 10 more push-ups so Haven can have have an apple that she doesn't want grunning from the effort Caleb did 10 very slow push-ups for Haven then Dr Christensen turned to the last girl Eliana you're Eliana right Eliana do you want an apple Eliana with tears flowing down her face began to cry no no Aliana Caleb has to do it alone I have given him this task and he is in charge of seeing that everyone has an opportunity for an apple whether they wanted or not when I decided to have a party this last day of class I looked at my grade book Caleb is the only student in this class with a perfect grade everyone else in this class has failed a test skip class offered me inferior work Caleb told me that when a player messes up in football practice he must do push-ups I told Caleb that none of you could come to my party unless he paid the price by doing your work your push-ups he and I made a deal for your sakes Caleb can you would you do 10 push-ups so Eliana can have an apple as Caleb very slowly finished his last pushup with the understanding that he had accomplished all that was required of him having done 200 push-ups his arms buckled beneath him and he fell to the [Music] floor and so it was our Savior Jesus Christ the only perfect sacrifice the only one worthy the only one able to pay the price for our sins to give us a salvation by grace died on the cross pled to the father it is finished into thy hands I commend my spirit with the understanding that he had done everything that was required of him he yielded up his life and some of the those in this room many of us left the gift on the desk unreceived unappreciated uneaten two students helped Caleb off of the floor and into a seat physically exhausted but wearing a thin smile thank you young men well done thou good and faithful servant not all sermons are preached with words my wish is that you might understand and fully comprehend all the riches of grace and mercy that has been given to you through the sacrifice of our Lord Jesus Christ for us all now and forever whether or not we choose to accept his gift to us the price has been paid wouldn't you be foolish and ungrateful to leave it lying on the desk [Music] class dismissed the [Applause] end let's give uh all the kids that uh helped out a hand they get to keep the apples I do have uh three apples left that don't have an apple Colton come get your Apple you got to make an effort to come get it who else what other the kids we got here oh where's he at huh he's passed out he wouldn't got a drink see is there how many is there any other kids that didn't get an apple I got two left uh Micah come get you an apple buddy there you go and give this one to your daddy all right well I hope that you enjoyed that and that you got the meaning of the story and that it's not bad if you throw in a little entertainment make it interesting you know I hope hope that I I we we I kind of do that on the Fly we're not professionals but uh I enjoy uh doing that with y'all immensely more than you ever know uh how much I enjoy uh making y'all a part of that and uh that's what that was a joy to like we heard this morning it was a joy for Jesus Christ to to come and be with us God to come down to to Earth and to dwell with us it was a it was his pleasure you know you know and and then sacrifice he that uh that Jesus Paid uh uh you know the scripture says it pleased God to to bruise him not that God bruised him but that he was that he that he suffered that knowing uh what what the results of that was going to be that we would be able to uh live with him eternally amen I mean what a gift that is that none of us deserve so thank you again for for listening to my story uh now if it's not too late we have one small skit we're going to try to do on the Fly and it probably take five minutes how many hands would like to see a little skit all right so I need Mary and her kids uh like right here uh we need let's put this chair up here and you kids all you kids can uh I'm G to kind of moving around but if you kids want to stay where you're at or get on the floor uh close around here that's up to you either way we're going to pull this out for a little bit of special effects so if you'll and I've got a I just had a thought of using this and you'll see why in here in a minute and uh we'll get this spread out just a little bit doesn't have to be perfect okay now kobby he's going to be my narrator I've done this little skip before and uh I thought well let's have uh Kobe and there write this and I'll just we'll just kind of acted out so uh this is called uh the man and the birds all right brother Kobe the man to whom I'm going to introduced to you was not a scrooge he was a kind decent mostly good man generous to his family upright in his dealings with other men but he didn't believe all that Incarnation stuff which the churches Proclaim at Christmas time it just didn't make any sense and he was too honest to pretend otherwise he just couldn't swallow the Jesus story about God coming to Earth as a man I'm truly sorry he told his wife but I'm not going with with you to church this Christmas Eve he said it feel like a hypocrite that he'd much rather stay at home and that he would wait up for them and so he stayed and they went to the midnight service shortly after the family drove away in the car snow began to fall he went to the window to watch the flurries getting heavy and heavier and then went back to his Fireside chair and begin to read his newspaper minutes later he was startled by a thuing sound then another and then another sort of a thump or a thud the world was that first he thought someone must be throwing snowballs against his living room window but when he went to the front door to investigate uh oh sorry brother window I need help here let's just put this right there on you right now yeah in your pocket yeah he found a flock of birds huddled miserably in the snow they had been caught in the storm and in a desperate search for shelter had tried to fly through his large landscape window well he couldn't let the poor creatures lie there and freeze so he remembered the barn where his children stabled their Pony that would provide a warm shelter if he could but direct the birds to it quickly he put on a coat gashes through the deepening snow to the barn sorry he put on his coat his gashes and trample through the deepening snow to the Barn he opened the doors wide and turned on a light but the birds didn't come in he figured food would entice them so we hurried back to the house and fetched breadcrumbs and began sprinkling them on the snow making a trail to the yellow lighted wide open doorway of the stable but to his dismay the birds ignored the breadcrumbs and continued to Flap around helplessly in the snow wrong with he tried catching them he tried sh them into the barn by walking around waving his arms instead they scattered in every direction except into the warm litted barn and then he realized that they were afraid of him to them he reasoned I am a strange and terrifying Creature if only I could think of some way to let them know that they can trust me that I am not trying to hurt them but to help them but how because every move he made tended to them confused them they just would not follow they would not be led or shed because they were Afra afid of him if only I could be a bird he thought to himself and be with them and speak their language then I could tell them not to be afraid then I could show them the way to be safe and warm to the safe warm barn but I would have to be one of them so they could see and hear and understand me at that moment the church bells begin to ring the sound reached his ears above the sounds of the wind he stood there listening to the bells listening to the bells peeling the Glad Tidings of Christmas and he sank to his knees in the snow and began to cry out to God lord now I see I hear and I understand now I know why you came to us to be with us to Simply tell us not to be afraid saying I will be with you even in you until the end of the world soon his wife and his kids arrived home safe and sound he excitedly told them the news the next day they had the best Christmas ever the end [Applause] do you enjoy [Applause] that
