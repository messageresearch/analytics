[Music] and love God's foreign [Music] foreign [Applause] the great mystery that's a that's a powerful song because it is quite the mystery to the world and even those of us with the Holy Ghost sometimes have a hard time fathoming how that God so loved us that he became a human it's always been his design Adam was created for God to have a body a body that that he could use and that Iman that's that's what God's intention was to fill him like the Holy Ghost does us today and to live his life When sin came in and wrecked the whole plan or wrecked the whole thing according to the carnal man amen and God came in flesh and God redeemed us and he didn't just go back to heaven the holy spirit is here he's still living in Earthly bodies today and I'm so thankful for that here tonight amen good to be in the house of the Lord isn't it amen and we have sure enjoyed the songs here tonight and enjoyed sister Sharon special and um glad to have these these upcoming musicians right here amen we got a whole new set of them here tonight so we had three of them last week and three this week and uh and so we we appreciate these these musicians and and takes up takes a lot of practice a lot of work and uh so we're we're sure proud of them amen if you have your Bibles why don't we just go ahead and go into the scripture here tonight and we won't um hold you too long but we we do want to we're going to go back to um Revelations the first chapter and um amen we've been reading this same verse every time but I'm I'm wanting you to catch it we're going to deal with amen the last of the Sevenfold personage of Christ and we'll start at Revelations 1 and and 3 or 13. in the midst of the seven candlesticks one likened to the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot gird about the paps with a goat and girdle his head and his hair was white like wool as white as snow his eyes were as a flame of fire his feet like undefined brass as if they had burned in a furnace and his voice as the sound of many Waters and he had in his right hand Seven Stars and out of his mouth went a sharp two-edge sword and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength amen let's go to the Lord in prayer father we just want to thank you Lord as we have been going through on these Wednesday nights Lord of the your glory and Lord how you have revealed yourself into these different personages Lord and and how they have meant so much to us and we're just asking the Lord that you would be with us tonight and let your blessings be upon our hearts Lord we're tired this is midweek and we're just asking that you will be here in a real special way thank you for it Lord in Jesus name we pray can the Church Say Amen amen God bless you you can be seated here tonight amen and um all right so we're we've been dealing here um with these seven percentages of Christ how many has been enjoying those looking at these different percentages of cries amen now last week we talked about how you know the mouth or the voice of many Waters and the sword amen and and how that God has given us a third pull Ministry greater than any other time this is the Judgment time this is the time where the bride is coming to his completion and so um we will walk right in we will be the final voice to the final age we will walk right into the rapture we will fight our way into the Rapture with that two-edged sword that comes out of the mouth of Christ amen and so amen uh the the same Living Word it's the Living Word that was in Christ is is walking in the midst of the candlesticks and so amen this layout of sea and age Jesus is taken off the covers he's taken off the Veil tale of of the of the mystery and so it is no longer a mystery we can see plainly what God has had in in plain view that has been God in his church amen so you've wondered well where is Jesus where where is Jesus he's he's a uh if he's real where is he we want to but the scripture says that Christ would come in his church he would live in you like he lived in Jesus that's the Revelation amen now you got to catch that that's the Revelation it is God in you the hope of glory and and so this is so good no other ages had this but it's in the seventh age that God's given the promise that he would do this through the seventh Church age messenger and we would see Christ in his deity and brother Branham would say he is God very God now that's that's that's an exact quote he is God very God Amen so Jesus is not the second person of the godhead Jesus is the body of Christ can you sing man so as we deal with the countenance of his face as the son now of course this is this is talking of of the of the realities of the return of the Lord amen then and the scripture says did you know um did you kids know that there will we we won't even need a Sun or a moon in that New Jerusalem that we're going to be living in amen there won't be no sun there won't need be any moon for the Bible says the lamb amen if you want to look there let's let's turn there uh real quickly there in Revelations 21 and 22 and we'll turn to some of these here tonight and um and and deal with some of these we're sure glad to have um sister Susie Mast and the girls here with us these ladies and it's been such a delight to have them and and Sister Sister Susie's just like family even though she's extended family she's Loretta's Mama but you know we sort of we've we've sort of Taken Loretta in as our girl too and and so that just makes us family sister Susie and uh so we sure we sure love um sister Susie and and and all of her children she's she's got a wonderful got a beautiful family amen so are we there at Revelations 21. amen all right so it says um which which one of you kids want to read the first verse we're

let's let's do it wait just a minute we need a mic amen we're going to have to have us a mic here and I'm not using this mic so we'll turn this one back on praise the Lord amen all right so we'll go ahead and read it now Temple therein for the Lord Almighty the lamb are in the temple of it man all right sister Haven praise the Lord and the city had no need of a son near of these soon in it for the glory of God did lighten it and and the lamb who is the light therefore amen so the the glory there was no need for the sun there was no need for the Moon for the lamb was the light now now there's going to be a moon and a sun in the new Earth how many knows that there's going to be a moon and a sun in in the new Earth but that City won't need the news will not need the moon or the sun why because the lamb so will there be any night time in that City will there be will there be night time in the in the in the new land in in the new heavens and earth will there be night time yes there's going to be night amen you're going to have Moon you're going to have the Sun but in that City there will never be any night praise the Lord amen all right who volunteers to read the next one for me any volunteers among you boys uh amen you're going to hold that or am I going to hold it praise the Lord save the show walking the light of it and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and the honor unto it all right so what's going to happen the nations of the earth will walk in the light of it amen and so we we are so we are looking forward to that time the countenance of his face as the Sun so we know that we're this is the this is the uh this is the talking about this last day now let's just look into this for a few moments here tonight uh and and I want us to look here at Matthew the 17th chapter brother Branham when he when he talked about this in the church age book he he he went straight to this uh passage of scripture here in Matthew the 17th chapter amen his face was as the son and how many remembers Mount Transfiguration that that's what he's talking about here Mount Transfiguration there in Matthew the 17th chapter then we're going to read at the first verse amen when you're there Say Amen all right it says and after six days Jesus Takes Peter James and John his brother and bring them into a high mountain apart and was transfigured before them and his face dis did shine as the sun and his raiment was white as the light so now here Jesus is he's his his face is is transformed showing of this last day now let's just keep on reading and behold there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with him then answered Peter and said unto Jesus Lord it is good for us to be here if thou Wilt let us make three Tabernacles one for thee one for Moses and one for Elias and while he yet spayed Behold a bright Cloud overshadowed them and behold a voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased hear ye him now I want you to notice three things here he has Faith shown as the sun there was a bright Cloud that uh uh covered over them and there was a voice out of the cloud that said hear ye him amen and it says and when the disciples heard it they fell on their face and were so afraid and Jesus came and touched them and said arise Be not Afraid and when they had lifted up their eyes they saw no man save Jesus only and as they came down from the mountain Jesus charged them saying tell the vision to no man until the son of man be risen again from the dead and his disciples asked him why say the describes that Elias must first come and Jesus answered and said to them Elias truly shall first come and restore all things but I say unto you Elias has is come already and they knew him not but have done unto him whatsoever they listed likewise shall also the son of man suffer of them then the disciples understood that he spoke unto them of John the Baptist now now this is important because this was this was a a pre-figure of what the resurrection was going to be and so the disciples were a little bit and if you wouldn't mind turning oh if you just turned back um uh to the Matthew 16 and 27 um and and while you're turning there I'll talk but it says uh you know but but but the the disciples were confused uh when they when they seen Christ glorified because there was a scripture that had been prophesied been written that Elijah had to come uh before this takes place so Jesus I want us to look here in Matthew 16 and 27 he had just told them right at the end of this last verse and right before he he is transfigured he he was he was telling that some of them is going to be alive when and and uh and see him coming in his glory so look here in Matthew 16 and 27 it says for the son of man shall come in the glory of his father and with his angels then he shall reward every man according to his Works verily I say unto you there be some standing here which shall not taste death till they see the son of man coming into his kingdom so so here Jesus just told there's some of them there that's not going to taste death they're not going to die until they see the second return of Jesus Christ well now they're all confused they're they're confused they're asking that's the reason why they they they asked they said hey wait a minute Elijah has got to come first so they knew the scripture that before the second coming and before this Transfiguration or before Christ would come in his glory there had to be an Elijah and so uh why did they think this because the scripture had already declared let's let's just look there we these are familiar passages but I want to connect these scriptures together to show you why the disciples were were a little confused they're in Malachi the the fourth uh chapter in the fifth verse even it is a familiar passage of scripture but I but I also want you kids to know how to turn there as well um so we'll wait on you to get there they're they're in Malachi 4 and 5 it says behold I will send you Elijah the prophet after before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children the heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse now when is this supposed to take place before the great and terrible day of the Lord so the disciples were asking as they're coming off that mountain amen Jesus just gave him a preview he gave him a preview there was Moses and Elijah how many knows what Moses and Elijah represented anybody huh the law on the prophets that's right but they were also representing they were also representing something here the dead Saints and the living Saints Moses died amen Elijah was raptured so here they are Jesus is they're they're showing that when this and when this time comes when he comes in it there will be the living Saints and the dead Saints so amen the dead in Christ shall rise first and those which are alive and remain shall be caught up to meet the Lord in the air amen now so so they're asking before this takes place amen we we've got to have an Elijah so so when does this take place if you go back there and read in Malachi 4 let's go ahead and start at the first verse for behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven and all the proud yea all that do wickedly shall be stubble and the day that cometh shall burn them up saith the Lord of hosts that it shall neither lead them neither root nor Branch now how many knows that the Earth is going to be caught on fire amen the Earth is going to melt away with fervent heat God's going to renovate the Earth that's what it's talking about amen but unto you that fear my name shall the moon light no sell the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings and ye shall go forth and grow up as calves in the stall ye shall tread down the wicked and for they shall be ashes Under The Souls of your feet and in the day that I shall do this saith the Lord of hosts so now so we definitely know that Elijah had to come before this great day of the Lord but yet even in the appearing of Elijah sunlight was going to shine amen so we're going to be looking at it in the figurative spent since the spiritual sense and the natural sense we do believe that Christ shall return we do believe that he is the light of the world but it's and it's not just in in a spiritual sense God is a real light he is light can you say Amen but yet through the voice of the Prophet that was to come there would also be the son of righteousness with healing in his wings isn't God so precise and when when brother Branham come in our generation there were healing campaigns and miracles and healings all it was when God sent this Malachi for prophet the son of righteousness Amen to prepare us in the way of the Lord can you say Amen so so I want us to look here now now let's let's let's look back for for a moment the disciples were asking Jesus about Malachi's prophecy amen now in Matthew 17 they had just witnessed Jesus being transformed transfigured they had just witnessed his face shining as the son they had just watched Moses and Elijah which had been gone from the earth for hundreds and hundreds of years they're standing there so here is Christ here is Elijah and here is Moses and here they were showing it was like it was like the rehearsal God was showing these disciples what it was going to be that there would be the dead Saints the living Saints would be with Christ reigning on the earth amen when he comes into his kingdom amen isn't that just wonderful amen so and then the bright Cloud overshadows Jesus and a voices spoke that spoke out and said this is my beloved Son hear ye him now so here they come off the mountain when they're coming down off the mountain they talk to Jesus amen and they said now if the son of man is is coming in his kingdom right now isn't Elijah supposed to come now though I want you to go back to Matthew the 17th chapter and let's let's look at it again Matthew 17 and 10. now if the son of man is coming in his kingdom isn't Elijah supposed to come now Jesus response was in the 10th chapter and his disciples asked him uh why then say the scribes that Elias must first come and Jesus answered and said Elias truly shall first come and restore all things so now he's letting them know now wait a minute I this is not this is not this first coming I've got to be a lamb I've got to go to Calvary I've got to pay the ransom price to redeem all of God's elected amen that's that's the reason for my first coming what you saw was the second coming when I'm coming in my glory and Elijah shall first come because at the end of those seven Church ages it's going to be all is going to be mixed and Scattered and he's going to have to restore our faith back to bring us into this into when when the son comes into his kingdom then he says now you're right you're right you've seen before telling of my second coming my second coming I will claim what is mine I've shown you the order I've shown you the resurrection I've shown you the Rapture I I've shown you the redeemed and Elijah truly shall come to forerun that now so amen going down to the 12th verse now we just we just read in the 11th verse and Jesus answered and said Elias truly shall first come and restore all things but I say unto you that Elias has come is come already and they knew him not but have done unto him whatsoever they listed likewise shall also the son of man suffer of them then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist can you say Amen so now so now Jesus is just now telling him are you kids understanding Jesus is just telling them yes Elijah has got to come before the second coming but I say he came before my first coming and no one understood it amen now if he came if he was to come in his first coming there has to be scripture for that too so there there in in Malachi the third chapter if you want to turn there real quickly now again on these kind of on these kind of deals we uh we want to just take her time and and anyone who wants to add anything add you're welcome to do so we are we have been really been blessed to have um um brother brother Billy and sister Debbie watch in on these Wednesday nights and um uh she said it would she wished she could get on some of these questions and things and understand I don't know if you can turn these these things up to where they can hear questions that are asked in the in the audience or not but um and then and then sisters got some questions too um that she would like for us to address and so we'll have to do that here before long uh Malachi the third chapter and the first verse it says behold I will send my messenger and he shall prepare the way before me and the Lord whom you seek shall suddenly come to his Temple even the messenger of the Covenant which he Delight in behold he shall come saith the Lord of hosts now you can say now when was this to take place Jesus said there in Matthew 11 and 10 and you can write that and if you're still in Malachi the third chapter right there in your fly leaf right there Malachi or Matthew 11 and 10 Jesus said this is the Fulfillment he said this is he of whom it is written behold I send my messenger before my face which shall prepare thy way before thee so Jesus is saying yes Malachi 4 and 5 will have to happen before the great day of the Lord but I say John has already come amen Elijah has already come in Malachi the third chapter amen and no one understood brother Branham would even go and he says if you would look real closely if you would look real closely at Malachi 4 and 5. amen it says that he shall turn the hearts of the children to the fathers and the hearts of the fathers to the children did you know that that is spoke of of both comings of Elijah amen so here's here's the deal there was Christ that was to come and and and this is this is where we've we've got to understand here is there is two comings of Christ amen this coming of Christ he was to be sacrificed on the altar of God Amen praise the Lord this is this is the altar of God he would be a lamb that was sacrificed on the altar of God and he was to the scripture says that he was to turn John was to turn the children now it wasn't little children like you all it was it was to turn the young Church the the ones that were to come to Christ he was pointing them to this lamb that was to come that's what John's sole purpose was to say Behold the Lamb of God that is him that is him can you say Amen now he was killed for it because he was so vehement about God's word and so vehemently uh defending what God what God was doing in that day Jesus said no one knew him amen so then now the disciples are seeing Christ as it as as the Conqueror they're seeing Christ His Image his face is radiating like the sun Christ is now he's no longer the lamb now he is coming to claim what he has purchased Hallelujah coming to claim and what is Jesus Jesus was the word made flesh so God would send and Elijah to point to this second coming just like it was an Elijah to point to the first coming of Christ so that's the reason why if you look there uh I I I'll read it to you there in Malachi 4 and 5. it says or four and six and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to the father so now here's again here's here's two comings amen two two total comings there was an Elijah this this Elijah had to come to point the fathers uh uh fathers to the children that's the new church how many understands that amen they were babes in Christ that was that was the first that was the first Elijah the second Elijah was to turn oops if I couldn't do this right turn the hearts of the children back uh if I can spell two fathers all right so so this is that's the second coming of Elijah two comings of Christ two comings of Elijah how many understands that now when it says turn the children back to the fathers who are the fathers hmm the original Faith the original the the the original Bible back to the Twelve Apostles back to the teachings of the New Testament Church amen so so Elijah the first Elijah was pointing he all of his disciples were were following Elijah they were all following him and that day the Bible says when when John seen the dove come down upon Christ and remaining upon him and he said Behold the Lamb of God the Bible says and many of John's disciples walked with him no more and followed Christ he'd done his job he was pointing to the lamb and they were to follow and there's where his disciples were at can you say Amen so now here we are it takes it takes Elijah again to identify Hallelujah to identify Christ you say well that'll be easy that'll be a piece of cake we'll all see Christ when he comes in the sky coming out of a of a big cloud everybody lost seam and we'll all know when he comes right the Bible says it will be a secret coming that will be like a thief in the night no one will know anything about it Hallelujah there in in Malachi or they're in in in Matthew Jesus talks about the Midnight Cry and how that the sleeping virgins they were all sleeping but it took a messenger to come to say arise for the bridegroom comes trim your lamps get ready the bridegroom is coming so it took that Elijah to point to the great coming King Hallelujah and the church world now you say now what did Brother Branham do can anyone tell me what can can you tell me how brother Branham pointed to Christ when we haven't even seen Christ how could he point to Christ if he never saw Christ brought him back to the Bible brought them right back so Elijah turned the hearts of the young Apostolic fathers to the children amen that's when the Bible was was he was uh those those Apostles wrote the Bible amen and here we were given we were given the words of eternal life all of them they all was whether it be Paul or Peter or John the Revelator they they all they were they were they they would become the fathers amen now he's turning us back to the fathers because Christ is hid in his word Christ is hid in his word amen is that right so uh I will send my messenger and he will prepare now now Peter that that great day that great transformation day that happened on that mountain that day it never left Peter Peter was Peter it in one place he called it I was he said I was on that Holy Mountain now now it wasn't that the mountain was holy it was just that the holy God was on that mountain and he remembered what took place he never forgot the happenings of that day never so so he understood that he had seen the rehearsal of the future and Jesus would be coming into his kingdom with the living and with the Dead and he also knew he never forgot that Elias must truly first come and restore all things according to Jesus so when when you look there at that acts 3 and 20 and we can turn there real quickly acts acts the third chapter and the 20th verse Acts 3 and 20. when you get there you can say Amen praise the Lord amen we'll wait a little bit longer now here cry here Peter is talking to the church talking and he's saying amen he's the 21st he shall send Jesus Christ which was before preached unto you whom the Heaven Must receive until the times of restitution of all things which God has spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets since the world began so how long how long does Jesus have to remain in the heavens until their times of restitution of all things how are these restitution going to come behold I send Elijah the prophet he'll return the faith is that right Jesus said Matthew 17 and 11 Jesus answered and said Elias truly shall come and restore all things that's that's Matthew 17 and 11. he shall first come and restore all things what is this this Elias amen when he appears the son of righteousness shall appear with healing in his wings God is going to come with divine revelation can you say Amen now are you following me so far I bet you kids y'all y'all y'all follow me amen how many how many understands two Elijah's well actually there's five Elijah's that come that have already come Lenae you know you know which which one all those Elijah's are take a guess the first Elijah what was his name Elijah oh you're good and the second one Elisha and the third one what was the third one John the Baptist and what was the fourth one William Branham and then what's the fifth one it's the Elijah that is to to appear to the Jews amen so so Elijah has got a special purpose it's a restoration Ministry all right now I want us to look at Revelations the uh 10th chapter and we we read this a lot but I want to read it again because it's talking about this great one this Mighty angel that is to come Revelations 10 and 1. praise the Lord and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face were as was as it were the son and his feet as pillars of fire now once again let's go what would what rev what's the Sevenfold personages Amanda Sevenfold person wasn't his feet as it was in a burning fire amen it was like under a brass and his face was shining now once again this is the mighty angel now this is not this is not Christ in his physical form although Christ will come in his physical form but this is the anointing the divine revelation the angel of the Covenant it's the same Angel it's the same Christ the same Living Word that was with the children of Israel in in the Old Testament amen that same Angel of the Covenant is right here and and so the the uh uh rainbow was over his head has his face as as it were the son his feet as pillars of fire now he's got a purpose for his coming he's got a purpose for this coming there's going to be a literal light when we see him face to face I believe we'll see that that glory of the Lord but there is a light that is shining in this day son estness with healing in his wings that have come to prepare the way of the Lord that's called the shout the Bible says as he's descending there would be a shout there would be a voice and there would be the Trump of God now the shout was that messenger or God coming down to a prophet Ministry saying prepare yeeds away of the Lord he is coming be prepared amen so now let's let's let's watch because we're going to connect we're going to see now now keep this in mind uh sometimes we we we see everything that the angel said and this kind of thing like that but remember the Angels coming to Earth for a purpose watch what that angel does watch what that angel does all right so it says uh the second verse and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon C and is left upon the Earth cried with a loud voice as when a lion roared and when he had cried seven Thunders uttered their voices and when the seven Thunders had entered the voices I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven Thunders uttered and write them not and the angel which I saw stand on the sea and upon the Earth lifted up his hand and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein are and the Earth and things that are there are the sea and things which are therein that time should be no longer but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound amen the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets amen so now what's the connection he came down with a purpose what was that purpose what's what happened he came down and gave the book to the angel the mighty or the Earthly Angel so Christ the anointing came down to the Elijah and he gave he gave the cry he pointed our hearts back to the the fathers and he showed us what God's purpose and plan was amen now again the Bible says so as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the revealing of the son of man amen this is not the physical coming of Christ but this was prophet God in flesh Among Us the word manifesting himself praise the Lord yes yes you you can now now that that cloud is not Christ there is not Jesus Jesus has a physical body but this here A man was was the cloud you know while we're talking about the cloud did you know that the scripture says that that a cloud Cloud receive Jesus up into the heavens amen praise the Lord and and I I I was I was wondering here um they're in they're in Luke I think it's Luke 21. let's look here at Luke 21 real quick well well what we're talking about the cloud uh we'll we'll uh we'll just look at this real quick Luke 21 and 25. [Music] and he's given the signs of his coming and there shall be signs in the sun in the moon and the stars and the Earth upon the Earth distress of nations with perplexity the Sea and the waves roaring how many can say that that this has happened in our day men's Hearts failing them for fear and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth for the powers of Heavens shall be shaken the powers of Heaven these these are all the all of the politicians these are the Kings these are these are preachers those that are set up in high places amount everything is shaken you know you can't even go you can't even go to the um to a concert I was telling dad you know I was reading reading on the news been been seeing these guys where where you got you know these country concerts or rock and roll or whatever but but these guys the fans are throwing stuff there on the on the stage throwing hard objects at these guys and and their hurdles some of us had to have stitches and to wear that uh uh I had read were there was a country star was out performing the other day and and it got so much into his mind about what could well I guess that's what happened but he he struggled through a song and then and then ran off the stage close the whole concert down and it you know until they no one can enjoy themselves anymore because they you don't they're throwing you know so so there's this girl Miranda whoever uh I don't I don't know her but the night she was performing and someone just got up someone just got up and was taking a selfie you know not not she wasn't even getting storm stage or nothing taking a picture of her and she just chewed that woman out just tell it don't you knowing this we want safety and and and and the girl didn't even do anything but but but this is where it's everyone's fearful for what's coming on we're living in that day but look at what God has given us now watch this it says uh uh man's heart's failing for fear looking for things coming Heaven shall be shaken the seventh 27th verse and they shall see the son of man coming in a cloud singular with power and great glory and when these things begin to come to pass then look up lift up your head for your Redemption draw a nigh now I I believe that the revealing there is a there there there's two things that have been promised there is the revealing of the son of man and there is the coming of the son of man amen the revealing of the son of man has been promised to the elect as Sodom is preparing to burn it was prophet God in a body that came to Abraham discerned his thoughts and gave him the words to change his his body amen gave him those words of Promise gave him his own name to change his his body amen so so those clouds amen what what about what what about that scripture and and we understand that cloud was made up of angels what about there in in Thessalonians uh one and seven sister keys amen and um this is talking about uh uh is that is that not it maybe maybe second Thessalonians 1 and 7. yeah uh let's let's go up to the fifth verse and his manifest tokens righteous Judgment of God that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God for uh which he also suffer seeing it as a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you do and to you who are troubled rest with us when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels and in flaming fire taking Vengeance on them that know not God that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ so so I you know I I personally believe that this right here the revealing revealing himself with the mighty Angels revealing I think I you know uh your opinion is good is just as good as mine on this on this right here but I I believe we have seen the revealing of Christ in this last day with these Mighty angels and what is that to do to give to give a peace to those of us amen that are looking for that for that Rapture of the church is that right amen so so we we as as we look here at this mysterious one as we look at this at at that light that was shining his face whereas the Sun and while and while while even dealing with the uh with the cloud you know some people say that the cloud is you know um is irrelevant but I I tend to believe and again I I do believe that that uh there will be a revealing of Christ in his physical form but I do not believe that that was that was exactly what they were what God was talking about in Revelations 10 and 1. that Mighty Angel was the anointing the logos of God coming down to a prophet and when that Prof when that word came to that Prophet then he preached indictment then he brought a curse to the world and you watch after 1962 1963 you you'll see that the world's systems just progressively went they just started tanking is because a prophet was on the scene speaking the word of God it was a light to the elect but it was judgment unto uh unto the world Amen so brother Branham would say I I just I just got a few here and it's it's something that you had mentioned that uh about the cloud because uh he says in the reproach for the word there in 62 he was talking about the vision he says you I can just see them with their heads kind of turned sideways and those wings tipped back full armored and here they come like that and just just come right down and took me right into the Pyramid of a consolation of them and I seen I was lift up off the ground and I thought maybe I heard way in the distance that Roar that womb like a plane when it crosses the sound barrier and you you've heard it happen just like a distant Roar another place he says it shook the Earth and when it did I was still looking Westward Way off into eternity I saw a constellation of something come and it looked like it might have been little dots there could have been no less than five and not more than seven and they were in the shape of a pyramid like these Messengers coming and when it did the power of almighty God lifted me up to meet them and it's never left me eight days has gone and I can't forget it yet I never had anything to bother me like that has my family will tell you I could see those angels those shaped back Wings traveling faster than sound could travel they came from eternity in a split like the twinkling of an eye not any not enough to bat your eye just to twinkle and they were there I didn't have time to count I I didn't have time no no more than just look these Mighty ones great powerful angels Snow White Wings set in heads and and they were they were and and when it did I was caught up into this pyramid of constellation and I thought now this is it I was numbed all over and I said oh my this means that there will be a blast that will kill me I'm at the end of my road I mustn't and tell my people when this Vision leaves I don't want them to know about it but the heavenly father has let me know now that my time is finished I won't tell my family so so they'll worry about me uh because he's fixing to go and and these angels have come for me and and I'll be killed pretty soon now in some kind of an explosion then it came to me while I was in the constellation no that isn't it if it would have killed you it would have killed Joseph and I could hear Joseph calling me well then I turned around and I thought Lord God what does this vision mean and I wondered and then it come to me not a voice just just come to me oh that is the angels of the Lord to give me my new commission and when I thought that I raised my hands up and I said Lord Jesus what will you have me to do and the vision left me for almost an hour I could not feel amen now so here so here here we have it now I'm not going to keep you long but I want to the face shining as the sun now remember this coming of the Lord or this revealing of the Lord this Mighty angel that came down came with an open book he came with an open book he came with divine revelation we are in the spiritual coming of the word it's that word coming of Christ to point us to the physical coming that is to be upon us is that right second Corinthians you don't have turned there but second Corinthians 4 and 6 is for God who commanded the lie to shine out of Darkness hath shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ so what what did God what did this seventh angel do he pointed us to the light of all lights he pointed us to that word amen now we're in the Rapture time this is fixing to come where that we're going to be in that city where the lamb will be the light but right now Hallelujah there's a restoration time and restoration time requires light it requires light and so God has has given us that and and we're going to get into those other things a little bit later on but I just wanted to bring this in to you now how many of you kids can understand uh you all understand where I'm coming from or not give me anyone have any questions or comments you want to add to that here tonight early on you know 17 year old boy coming into the message and then my personal Bible study yeah and listening to the tapes and just just to say I I tried to listen to at least the tape a day you know yeah yeah what really hit me uh one just it's a simple scripture and you might put it up there in a second uh trying to sort out the set of the multiple comings of Elijah is Luke 1 17. okay yeah yeah can you put that up there and that is a good one showed me that yeah before I the message that came to me just a personal revelation and that just really touched my heart yes you know that I could see the the separate comments especially from the before before the first coming of Elijah I mean first coming of Christ and the second coming amen but that that explains the coming of that's John the Baptist right it doesn't say that that John the Baptist will turn the heart of the children to the fathers you know see it stops there where it says the spirit and power of Elijah's to turn the heart of the fathers to the children so and then it goes to something else it doesn't say the heart of the children to the fathers that's right so that just something that just really hit me strong as a 17 year old boy it's just never left me you know and so it really helped me yeah yeah that I could see that that was John the Baptist and that the one that would turn the hearts of the the children back to the fathers would be a another coming of Elijah yes yes you know and and that's the thing because the the even the disciples um everyone in that day was looking for the Messiah to come to to as a conqueror as a conqueror to to rid them of Rome they were under Rome's bondage and so they had a hard time understanding but there had to be the lamb and then there had to be the the the line there had to be the one that paid the price there had to be the one that comes to claim and so if you look there uh put that back up there sister khalilah um they're in in one in 17 it it it it it goes back it's quoting the scripture then he shall go before him in the spirit and the power of Elias to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and here it is and then Jesus stops and then the the disobedient uh to the to the wisd wisdom of the wise talking about Redeemer that was uh pointing pointing them to the Redeemer that was to come but now here we stand and this is where Jesus was trying to to in in that Matthew the seventh or Matthew where I I had first started off Elias must come and restore but I say Elias has come and they killed him amen so so y'all understand that and the reason that is so important is because the their um a lot of people want to want to put that scripture they want they take that scripture right there and say we don't need any Elijah in this day and so because that was fulfilled in Jesus that and because that's he's quoting he's quoting there in Malachi 4 and 6. but he stops right in the mid-sentence to finish let's let's look at something else just real quickly and then we'll then we'll wrap it up uh uh the spirit of the Lord God is upon me let's let's look at that one that's a good one for for us to to see where is that at um that's what is that Luke the spirit of the Lord God is upon me Luke 4. uh yes and uh the 18th verse hmm and this the spirit of the and someone else find that while we're while we're doing this we're uh that is an eye what is that Isaiah Isaiah 6 huh it seemed like it's 61. so someone would be looking for that one too and then we'll we'll compare the scriptures the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives recovering of sight to the blind to set at Liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord and he closed the book gave it back to the minister and sat down and all uh and the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him and he began to say unto them this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears now let's see what what scripture is fulfilled let's go back and look there in Isaiah 51 61 yeah all right and that'd be good for you kids to turn to too but keep if if you haven't already keep keep the scripture we just read open if not you can you can do it later but I want to I want you all to compare Isaiah 61 and one amen the spirit of the Lord God is upon me because the Lord hath anointed me to preach Good Tidings into the meek he has sent me to bind up the Brokenhearted to Proclaim Liberty to the captives the opening of the prison to them that are bound to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord now watch Jesus stops right there in the middle of the verse closes up the book and says this day this scripture is fulfilled now some of us would be saying hey you don't you don't stop in the middle of a verse well first of all they didn't have verses back then but but it is he stops mid-sentence the sentence is not over to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord he closes the book hands it back and says this day this scripture is fulfilled and he leaves out the day of Vengeance to comfort all that mourn can anyone tell me why he done that it wasn't for the first coming the first coming he was the lamb Second Coming he's coming as king the judge he is coming with vengeance that scripture could not be fulfilled that day so he stopped mid-sentence said this part of the scripture is fulfilled this other is still waiting there is the same explanation on on John how we get the two coming or the two comings of Elijah at the first coming and the second coming one is to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and it stopped that's what we just read it stopped it did not say and turned the hearts of the children to the fathers because that was for that John the first coming of or the the the the the John the the third coming of Elijah and this other is for the fourth coming of Elijah you girls understand that no see Jesus it's Jesus both ways this is the same this is the same Jesus and the same Jesus but this was the first time he come to Earth this is his second time there is a John that is to turn the hearts of the Bible of the guys that's going to write the Bible and be the leaders to turn them to Christ we don't need we don't God's not raising up uh uh new disciples to write Bibles anymore now God sends us Elijah to point us back to what God had originally done to those fathers you see that or no you kids understand Hallelujah any questions comments praise the Lord amen I I believe that the that that cloud has has a lot of significance we don't worship that cloud that cloud is not Christ but but that crowd but to me that cloud is is significant because it does fulfill promise it does fulfill that that that that that that rainbow that was over over that uh a mighty angel that was none other than the Living Word coming to Earth with an open book to sh to show you and I where we are and what we are in Christ is that right now some people try to say that was the second coming and they've got they've got all kinds you know they got all kinds of of crazy thoughts but they didn't get it from Brother Brown amen there is a literal body of Jesus Christ and there will be a literal marriage supper man I had a guy telling me that that uh that we have we're already in the millennium that that the coming of Christ has already come and and we are feasting at the marriage supper of the Lamb right now Hallelujah I said well what are you going to do when it's when brother Branham says and it'll be miles long no there ain't gonna be no miles long table I said yes there will there's a literal body there will be a literal marriage supper of the Lamb and I've got a place reserved right there at the table amen huh that's right that's right we're all going to be young hallelujah amen that even ties into the reason that we baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we're not just baptizing up to the anointing of Christ yes you're baptizing into the body of Jesus Amen that was sacrificed and raised back for us you're not just baptizing in the name of Jesus because there are many jesuses but there's one Lord Jesus Christ and that physical Lord Jesus Christ has to come back not just an anointing in a cloud with a physical Lord Jesus Christ has to come back again amen that's exactly right that's exactly right and you can't you can't mix you you can't mix that up you you if you if you do you're you're missing you're messing with scripture and you can't take any Revelation that brother Branham had and uh and and and and and go off go off the seed with it if brother Branham said things he said it for a purpose not to make new doctrines he said this to make things easier like the bride coming of Christ he's letting he's you know we're in the bright age well that doesn't mean there's only Seven Ages there's not eight ages there's only Seven Ages but yet brother Branham to let you know and to separate you from this evil God forsaken age he says he's lifted you into the bright age that doesn't if you got eight ages now you got to have the eighth messenger and then we've got too many guys clamoring to be that messenger we got everybody there's no we we there's only seven Messengers our age seventh age is William Branham that is our messenger amen but that messenger has given us a message to pull us out and prepare we have heard the Cry of the bridegrooms or the Cry of the of the messenger saying prepare ye the way of the Lord and we have separated ourselves from the world Amen so so here's here's the deal I'll I'll leave with you before we dismiss praise the Lord amen what did Brother Branham say that Christ that the threefold purpose of Christ what was he trying to do amen God in Christ right let's see yeah yeah God God in Christ and you guys help me out here I'm just I'm just going off the of of my knowledge here memory all that God was he poured into Christ all that Christ was he's poured into the church brother Brandon would say that's preeminence preeminence Christ having preeminence in the church all right and then what's the third take us back to take us back to the uh Eden I'm just going to put Eden all right God in Christ revealed that's his revelation God revealing himself in Christ second Christ having preeminence in the church third Eden The Mystery of the Rapture is in threefold what's the first Shout I need to put that a little closer let me do this I'm going too fast what's the next voice preeminence what's the third catching away Revelation is the shout God in Christ the revealing of himself preeminence in the church The Voice the word having preeminence in US Eden rapture catching away rapture amen all right brother Branham said the seventh seal is in threefold what is the threefold and I and I messed it all up here I'm gonna I'm gonna put this I'm gonna erase this what is What is the threefold can y'all remember the fenders everything was in symbol the Thunders brother Branham says the fun they asked for the brand of the Thunders revealed brother Branham says the Thunders are the revelations contained in the Seven Seals so we're not looking for the Thunders to come in the future the Thunders is is the voice of God that revealed the word of God so the Revelation this is the Revelation number two what was what was what was number two brother Brandon Salem seven seal he said the seventh seal is the third pool under that seventh seal was the third pool what is the third poll message preeminence all right what's the third he said now there on the third he says it's a threefold manner he said I've seen the one unfold I've seen the second one unfold today but the third one came in an unknown tongue and I couldn't make it out he said that will be right at his coming that will be the body change the catching away no man knows the hour are you seeing the rapture the threefold purpose and uh uh uh uh and and this and the seventh seal is all the same thing it's in a threefold manner are y'all catching it revelation preeminence of that word in the cry revelation of who God is revelation that's what brother Brandon said come back come back come back Revelation amen that's what the Thunders were yet open it up it revealed and then the preeminence or the word the message taking root in the church and then all three of them is going back to Eden they're catching away the resurrection and then and then of course uh uh uh the the the the last phase of the seventh seal so the seventh seal when people when brother Brandon would say no the seven seal is not open it's the same thing as people are trying to tell us that the Rapture has not begun the Rapture has begun now when we say we're in Rapture they're going to say they all look at you and say you are crazy right well the Rapture is not totally over it's a shout the shout has come the preeminence the word is having its effect within us brother Bradham says what we need is thousands of Living Voices that are thundering out the word of God living in sweetness and humility the word having preeminence is that right but the third face will be at the coming of the Lord when he takes us back and that will be the literal return and and and and some Knuckleheads try to make it make it more complicated than that but that's that's exactly the way that the Lord or that's that's exactly the way brother Branham taught it amen and so when you look at those well then it's then there's no more confusing about it there had to be a shout saying come out and then there had to be a surrender to that word and then the body change is coming next amen and by the way the seventh seal is just the seven silver the brand so that seven seal is going to be it's it's it's like that Roman candle that Jesus keeps on going amen it'll be the total he says it'll be the ending of time it'll be the total ending of everything Hallelujah we still have a millennium here on the earth that is still a part of that time there will be an unfolding even after work caught away from here praise the Lord but I'm so glad I'm so glad that I am I'm out of this place the light has come and I say the radiance of this mighty one is so Supreme and so Eternal is that right if you haven't seen if you haven't seen the light of this word you'll never see him in the light of that City but it's seeing him here that's where it's all that's that's that sealing your way into the kingdom of God any questions amen praise the Lord amen any any comments anything that you want to add you're welcome to do so praise the Lord amen all right God bless you and if the musicians would come praise the Lord well so his face as uh shines as the sun Hallelujah I'm glad I've seen his face I'm glad I'm glad that God's made it made it so real I'm glad his word is is living it's a reality amen and every one of us and through every one of us oh God let the word let the word have preeminence in me if we're going to see a body change there's got to be a preeminence amen go go go back and listen to what brother Branham had had said there in Christ is the mystery of God revealed the whole purpose the whole purpose God revealing himself God in Christ now all that was in God God emptied all of himself in Christ all that was in Christ he has all emptied himself in the church that he might have preeminence within us amen praise the Lord Shine On Me Shine on me let the light from the lighthouse [Music] shine on me [Music] and on me let the light from the light house [Music] Jesus shines oh shine on me let the light foreign [Music] please tonight while there is light in the evening time there shall be light [Music] let's let's occupy till he comes let's be fervent about this word that he come too many places where brother Branham said now the shout was that message going forth that bridegroom call the next is the preeminence have preeminence in me have preeminence in me let your let your word let it anchor deep in my heart and I believe God wants to have that preeminence what does it mean by preeminence it doesn't that's not necessarily talking about a religious a religious activity it's that that word is is the anchor it's your Guiding Light it's your it's when it's when your spirit your spirit's not converted your your your spirit can you still be a POI pull over here and pull over here your Soul's the only thing that is that is stabilized your spirit man it's the nature of your flesh that wants to pull this way or that way but the word is the anchor says no I'm going to keep my spirit spirit you're going mine appetites you're going to stay in line with God's word I'm going to believe it the way God believes it I want to let my soul be anchored can you say Amen let that word let that Elijah anointing that cry the mighty Angel come and took the book and gave it to the gave it to the seventh angel and then the command was for you and me to come and take that book and to eat that book well you become what you eat so Lord I'm going to be diligent about this I'm tired of my I'm I'm tired of my my spirit getting riled up and pulled this way and pulled that way let me stay in that secret place that third pool that secret room that place that no one else knows about let this message anchor me let that Mighty angel so annoyed me I want to live this life [Music] till I'm no longer just tossed and here and there I believe God sent him sent this message to me I believe God sent the mighty Angel to me I believe God done this to me I'm going to stand here upon God's word help me Lord how many wants that message to have preeminence in you let it have preeminence we teach these things and these are wonderful things but we don't want it here we want it here we want us to see visually Where We Are

brother brother Merle says that when he was 17 he was listening he tried to listen to a tape today a day [Music] I you can't really you can't really uh I have found in myself you can rush through them if you're trying to listen to one whole tape a day you miss out a lot I would rather you catch what the prophet is trying to say even if you do it I mean listen to the whole tape that day but then listen to it again the next day you know and listen to that listen to that same tape for a week and just and you know that's that's me you don't have to you can listen to one tape and uh separate tape a day but if if it's something that you're you didn't quite catch go back and listen to it again it ain't we're not we're not getting trophies or stars for how many tapes we listen to and God's not gonna say okay how many taped messages did you listen to when you was on Earth so but he does want you to catch what the prophet is saying that's important is that right so listen to that message daily I'd encourage you to but this this here as we're as we're starting to go through the church ages I'm not going to be going through the Seven Ages and teach them like brother Brandon he's already taught it so you you if you're going to want to catch it the way brother Branham uh but I am going to be pulling some nuggets I'm going to start uh pulling a lot of nuggets out and it may be for a long time but if you do it uh you'll know where I'm at amen all right okay well God bless y'all uh thanks for reminding me I I was supposed to have done this last time and and and I told CIS Khalil I

burden to buy these for whoever wanted them so we appreciate that such a keys while we were on these series she said you know I want to get a bunch of these for the for those who know it especially
