families and everybody here I'm not going to start with names but you're all family so God bless you let's let's start with the the scripture Isaiah chapter 40. and we're going to begin this evening on on verse 3 but when you go to verse 40 in my Bible it says the prophets new message and you know I want to look at that this evening and we realized that at that time it was a new message but it's already a past message it's already taken place so I just went ahead there and just said the prophet Isaiah's message so he had a message and then so we want to to to read just a little bit about that this evening and as we go uh our title this evening would be when God speaks when God speaks so uh you promised just to to to stay with me and pull this evening and you know let's just say you know let's just make it a wonderful Wednesday service amen and I'll try to behave the best I can pastor Abe amen uh so Isaiah chapter 40 verse 3. and we'll read all the way to verse 5. the Bible says the voice of him that Christ in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the Lord make straight in the desert a highway for our God we have to realize that Isaiah was prophesying this somewhere between 740 to 680 BC before Christ come on the scene so this was big big big time before that Christ had come on the scene and we go to verse 4 now it says every Valley shall be exalted in every mountain and Hill shall be made low and the Crooked shall be made straight and the rough places plain and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed somebody could say Amen right there and all and all flesh shall see it together for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it so God had spoken it and it's got to come to pass I have in one more scripture I want to turn to the Book of Matthew and turn to the gospel of Matthew and we want to look at chapter 3 when they can just say Amen Matthew chapter 3 and we'll just begin we're going to read a few verses there so we'll start in verse 1. and here we have the ministry of John the Baptist Matthew chapter 3 verse 1 says in those days Came John the Baptist preaching in the wilderness of Judea and saying repent ye for the kingdom of heaven is at hand for this for this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah which was Isaiah saying the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the Lord make his paths what make his path straight so we have here already this is he that was spoken yeah there was a word that had already been spoken and now we say well this is that this is that word that was spoken by the prophet amen verse 4 and the same John had his raiman of camel's hair and a a lettering girdle about his loins and his meat was locusts and wild honey they went out to hear Jerusalem they went out to to him Jerusalem in all Judea and all the the region round about Jordan and were baptized of him in the Jordan confessing their sins and when he saw many of the Pharisees and the Sadducees come to his baptism he said unto them o Generation of Vipers who hath warned you to flee from the Wrath to come bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance and think not to say within yourselves we have Abraham to Our Father for I say unto you that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham and now also the ax is laid unto the root of the trees therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance but he that cometh after me is mightier than I whose shoes I am not worthy to Bear he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with what with the Holy Ghost and with fire whose fan is in his hand and he will thoroughly Purge his floor and gather his weed into the Garner but he will but he will burn up the shaft and the UN with unquenchable fire verse 13 says then cometh Jesus From Galilee to Jordan unto John to be baptized of him but John forbade him saying I have need to be baptized of thee and cometh thou to me and Jesus answering said unto him suffer suffer it to be so now for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness notice then he suffered him and Jesus when he was baptized went up straightway out of the water and lo the heavens were opened up unto him and he saw the spirit of God descending like a dove and light lightning upon him and lo a voice from Heaven saying this is my beloved Son in whom I am while please let us bow our hands dear precious and heavy father Lord we just are grateful one more time to come into thy Mighty presence Lord God we're two or three are gathered here this evening Lord God certainly father we confess we have no abilities Lord God or nothing to offer Lord only Lord God that we can step aside father allow you to speak through US Lord and to us this evening father Lord it would only be possible of you thine Holy Spirit would come and take complete control Lord we surrender everything that we are to thee this evening Lord God father not only the speaker but the hearer this evening Lord we come in one Accord father with our hearts already open to hear your word father Lord we pray this evening that you would just come Lord God in a special way to each and

Hallelujah somebody go ahead and just pinch yourself this evening let you know you're awake it's a Wednesday night and God is good all the time and all the time God is good we we want to just not to hurry this evening but not to keep you long either but you know when when you open up the scriptures and then you start reading the message of the hour I come to a portion where brother banham's talking about baptism and we come to the scriptures that we read this evening and many times it was asked our Prophet a question and when that they would read this scripture and they would ask that the question why would Jesus have to be baptized and of course we know after all we we understand that baptism is an act of of confession it's it's an act of repentance and an act of confession and when we look into the scriptures we know that Jesus had nothing to confess we know that Jesus had no need for to come and to to confess anything because he's holy and we know that Jesus is spotless and we we know that he is the unadulterated word of the son of the Living God and we know that Jesus is God and was God God and he was the infallible God but yeah the question is asked why then would he need to be baptized after all the scripture says that he was in the world and the world was made by him the very one that made the world is now coming to be baptized and in that brother Brad takes that question and he asks he says why would he have to be baptized and we find the answer thus in the scripture that when Jesus said to the prophet he said thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness now the word we want to look in there this evening is the word us because we have an understanding that Jesus Christ was the word and he comes to the prophet because the word always comes to the always comes to the prophet but now we find out that the one who was spotless and unadulterated the very maker of the world here he comes now to the prophet and he's saying us now when you look at the word us the word us means concerning a person himself or herself the speaker and one or more people so in other words Jesus was saying we have to fulfill all righteousness right but he's including us now we have to look here this evening and say wait well well why wouldn't he just be able to do it all by himself because then he would go against scripture so now he comes to the prophet he said thus said becometh us to fulfill all righteousness and here we have a scenario of the two greatest leaders in the entire world here you have the prophet of God and here you have the maker himself Jesus Christ so you have the two most powerful people in the world and we find out that we when we look we have to identify and we're going to kind of pick up where we left off a little bit on the last preaching here can somebody say Amen so we see that Jesus it wasn't that he just shows up in any kind of form or fashion but we recognize that Jesus was the word made flesh so in other words we come to to this little corner brother Wendell where we saw a manifestation taking place right here of what of the where being coming flesh so we had to understand that here was all that the prophets had spoke everything that they had said concerning Jesus had now come and it was manifesting in other words Jesus walked off the pages he walked off of the pages and here he comes and now he's speaking to the prophet can somebody say Amen so in other words the prophet of God told us it's the word and the prophet together so here we have the living breathing word now coming to a prophet can somebody say amen and notice and he comes out of the pages he starts to talk to the prophet and he said and be cometh us somebody say us and become his off us to fulfill all righteousness in other words he's saying to John we have scripture to fulfill the reason that this is taking place is it had already been spoken about other prophets and now we have to fulfill our portion so in speaking that we we see oh well we can just put it this way for you this evening we're the message of the hour when he come out of the pages we have the word everything that was spoken of the prophets and thou what what Isaiah had spoken about John had everything had just come out and manifested out of scripture and here it was John living and breathing living and breathing was the prophecy that was spoken about him here we are Jesus now living and breathing breathing what everything that the prophets have spoken about him so now we have two prophecies meeting together living and breathing that's why he had to come and say us John it is us me and you not just me but you too for what for what to fulfill scripture I would ask a question just you know just a home church tonight you know when you look at it you know we we look into the scripture and we recognize that if you add a word or you take a word out of the scripture that it's you have a curse coming to you now you have to recognize the importance of that is because Jesus already has spoken something that has to come to pass and when we try to come in and change that in any way come on church then we start to change the mind of God and we cannot do that notice I like to part when you when you could look and and and have the revelation of the two living breathing word come alive and now they can say John worth the message of the hour it says we have to fulfill scripture notice brother about him takes that and he says it must be fulfilled he said all the word that God has spoken what must be fulfilled all the word that God has spoken it must be fulfilled notice brother bam takes that he said God cannot say anything without having it fulfilled when he has spoken it it is a finished work it's already finished when God speaks it so when we look at the prophecy of Isaiah when Isaiah spoke that prophecy it was as good as done it was already good it's done and no wonder that Jesus would come and say it it would becometh us to fulfill the scripture that was spoken because it cannot be changed it cannot deviate in any way John we must fulfill that scripture and notice he Brother Brad said God never speaks God never speaks until he's ready for it to be and when he speaks it's just as well as already happened now we can say amen and we can say hallelujah and we can say yeah but brother man what does that even mean to us what does that mean to us tonight notice brother man takes then he says now if that wouldn't give us a basis to put our faith on what are we going to get we're going to grab our faith and we're going to put it on the scriptures and know that it's got to be fulfilled if God said he's going to have a bride in this hour then I'm really just saying it's got to be fulfilled and it's going to take someone not Hallelujah notice he says now if thou wouldn't give us a basis to pull our faith on this warning how are we going to take the word and the promises of God and put your faith there knowing that there has to come to pass when God speaks the word it's already finished when God speaks a word it's going to take a little more than that when God speaks the word it's already finished when God speaks the word it's already finished and notice he says and what about his promises that he's given to us notices everything that he has said it's already a finished work he said so therefore somebody say therefore so therefore when we receive his word into our heart when we receive his word into our heart it's already done it's completed when not when it's just up here not when it's right here but when it drops into our heart it's already completed what's completed the word of God it's as good as already done when it drops into your heart you say well let's take a look brother let's see let's see her dropping into and let's see what that it does how many want to see her dropping into notice we see that that John when he was on the receiving end of the word here comes the word and the pro and the word always comes to a prophet and so John's on the receiving end of it and what is the word counting him that it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness the word coming to a prophet and guess what John being a prophet we find out that he understood he understood when that word dropped into a revelation to himself so here it was it wasn't that John just said oh oh that's nice you know oh yeah we've got to to fulfill it no immediately him being a prophet he what did he do he had to bring your brother back to scripture he couldn't just say oh that's a nice word that was great for us but he had to take it right back to the scriptures so in other words John being a prophet someone say a prophet John being a prophet immediately brother Miguel what did he do he took it to the scripture he said well this is the one this has to be the sacrifice that has to be lost so in other words now he realized and he received it well before he was saying I can't be I'm not the one how am I going to baptize you right he had no understanding of these things but as soon as he said us that we have to fulfill the scripture immediately and drive from John uh everything that John had known everything that he realized about scripture had just dropped Bloom and it hit him he said well that's the sacrifice [Applause] okay all right well the sacrifice has to be washed according to the scripture so president told us he said that's the type that now Jesus was the sacrifice and the sacrifice had to be washed sister Julian have to be washed but we also know the prophet of God told us that there was an anti-type he said Not only was it a sacrifice that needed to be washed but he was also the high priest and before a high priest could be anointed he had to be washed so Jesus was now what the word dropped into John being the prophet boom he's the sacrifice and the high priest he's the sacrifice and the high priest before that come on Church do you see it when it drops there's a lot of times that your pastor preaches and he preaches and he preaches and you go homo that was nice that was nice but what happens when it drops it's at that time you say hallelujah oh Lord now I see now now I see it's it's making sense everything's making sense my position everything that I'm doing is starting to make sense Hallelujah so we we had an understanding that now John realized but he just didn't realize making something up he wasn't just oh yeah no he immediately took it back to the scriptures immediately now that was the sacrifice yes the high priest how many believe that Jesus Christ is our high priest no and he had to be washed what before he could be anointed the sacrifice had to be as the type Hallelujah it had to be clean and the attack types the high priest it had to be washed before he would be anointed I would ask you was John the greatest man until that hour John was the greatest man that had lived until that hour someone say until that hour and notice the greatest man of war notice immediately he was humbled no and John being humbled hello and John being humbled and many times and we we receive the word we're humbled we're humbled by the word and then when we're humbled by the word then sometimes we say well you know what oh lord I can't do anything oh I'm nothing but you got to be humble to a point to where you have to understand that you have a portion that you have something to fulfill I want to ask you if we look at John brother Wendell and and John would have just said you know what it's been identified this is the sacrifice this is everything that the Old Testament was talking about this is the high priest oh no there's no way that I could do it there's no way that there's no way that it's me and many people say no no I don't see with all the people in the world all everybody all the drugs all the things why would he choose me and you know many times we can say well we're humbled by that but I want to tell you tonight but he did Choose You and he answers you and you have a portion to play in it it's not that you go back because John could you imagine if John would have said no I I can't do it I refuse to do it he would have been changing sister Fresco the word of God but the word of God could not be changed because when it was already spoken it was as good as already being done so what he's saying that he had to suffer it the Bible says and he suffered it and he baptized Jesus thus fulfilling his portion and so we noticed that many prophets and especially our prophet had wanted to to go back and just be a Wilderness man how many of us men I'm going to ask you tonight just said well that I've thought of that that I would just leave and and I would just find myself in the mountains of Colorado or Idaho or Alaska or New Mexico or wherever that would be and I'll never come out and I'll stay there and you know the prophet of God thought that too but God told him that he would become a bomb he told him that his wife would leave him because he had a greater prophecy to fulfill all right you go home and study it up brother Brandon had a great portion to fulfill could you imagine he would have said well I'm done with all you people I'm done with these people they're they're too much they they cried too much they complained too much they why too much oh it's just it's just gonna come out and maybe I'll just come out once in a while and preach and then I'll Retreat back but that wasn't his fulfillment he had to fulfill all now you're catching it he had to fulfill all see us up there he had to feel fulfill all what scripture and we realized that when he did yeah what he did what happened the Bible said that there come a message out of Heaven on the wings of uh [Laughter] and what did that message say he said this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased and we know that it's who he was pleased to dwell in and so now we see because that scripture was fulfilled righteousness being fulfilled bringing forth the Redemption message of Grace you know what the point is this you know what the point is tonight if John yep yep you if John didn't fulfill his portion we wouldn't have the grace that we could say Grace Grace that's why Jesus is telling them us us you have a part to play in it not just the preachers you young man you have a part to play you young ladies you have a part to play for what to fulfill scripture notice but if I'm taking that and we find out that as soon as this had taken place Jesus's Ministry was ready what do you say about that while he was washed and he was anointed and what was it brother Brown said it was a word that would redeem the whole world could you imagine John's position he had to say yes he had to suffer it but we realized that Jesus on the cross what did he say he said it is it is finished notice brother I said John looked and he saw and brother bear asked how did he know this was Jesus notice he said he saw a dove that had been told him by the spirit of God someone say spirit of God the spirit of God had already told him why because he was a a prophet and he told him upon whom Thou shalt see the spirit descending and remaining on he is the one he is the one he is the one what that will baptize with Holy Ghost and Fire he's the one that will baptize with Holy Ghost and Fire notice we built that up just a little bit tonight to start bringing it to you all this had to take place because there was a holy ghost that was coming to baptize you with Holy Ghost and Fire so John had to fulfill our righteousness he had to fulfill the scriptures so we see Jesus proving what the prophet said that he would do I want to ask you did he heal the sick did he raise the dead did he calm the storm did he turn water into wine did he multiply the fish in the bread did he walk on water did he cast out Devils did he preach the gospel he did everything he was supposed to do doing it well brother man a fulfilling all righteousness yeah oh it is good it's good for us tonight Church notice he goes on to say he proves all his words all of his words just think of it all his words notice what brother Brown says next he says and you were his word [Applause] he fulfills all his word and you Glory he was the word and you were part of his word and that's the reason you're sent here no but then I'm here to pay bills and uh try to get the best retirement I can get my job was to get the best job I could get and and you know to to just just to to be and pay my bills and get groceries on the table that wasn't your purpose [Music] to be a good good person brother man just you know just just kind of help someone out when they can well that's nice well about that I'm a financial backer well God didn't say he needed any Red Cross he was the word and you were part of his word and that's the reason you're sent here to confirm your place in life [Music] [Applause] you know what he said when he preached his people said I don't think you got it what do you mean he's saying I don't know if it dropped from here to here because when it does and you realize you're part of the word let me tell you there's when I know tall wigglers it's just oh brother I tell you we get excited about it well be part of the word I've never felt like that well just uh enter in okay all right I was sitting about there for the meetings right and then I came and preached and brother Daryl said oh we got to give all give it all Give It All yeah and I'm like I Gotta Give It All got to give it all right because I'm not just a toe Wiggler when the preacher says you know we've got to give it all I'm saying okay well then that's inspired brother Wendell was inspired he's the one who pitched he the the lineup right it wasn't just his choice he didn't just pull out of the lottery God put it on his heart and so I come I said I don't care what takes place you know what uh here I am with with a fractured tibia Plateau fracture walking since I don't even know brother William saying you know what I kept telling sister saying I don't even know if we're gonna make it I don't know if we're going to make I don't know if we're going to make this meeting she's like ah stop being a baby I said ah but it but it hurts and it's I don't know I I don't know I don't know I said I don't know and then I said well then you know brother Wayne couldn't make it because of his his dad right so I said oh no it can't be two I said well we're gonna have to suffer but what's he said brother he said give me your all that was it we heard it on the way over here as we were driving yeah here I said if if somehow you know something takes place and I'd land up jumping off of this thing and I'll end up hurting it and breaking it at least I'll do it for God right right we got you know if we're gonna do it we're gonna do it for the Lord so I said it don't matter but let me tell you it came and the Lord touched it in a supernatural way felt better than I had ever felt came out of there but that's not the point of the story the next night I come out and you know it's like well you know I'm just gonna preach a little bit all right we're we're off other notes but you know as a minister you know all the ministers are up there and you know how we get up and go there and we know that behind you right right here they're scoffers they say these guys I could go to a meeting but it just it just you know when I see that it kind of turns me off you know what I mean it's like ah there you know they're just patting each other's back and doing all these things well anyway that's what the devil was telling me so I came out there and I'm saying I have an excuse right I had a broken leg so you know I can say I preach Brothers you know I I told them you know if I don't get up too much you know just know you know I sure enjoyed it when you were all were pooling I sure enjoyed it oh and they pulled let me tell you it does something when you guys pull it does something to your pastor I'm telling you it's sicken it's get that devil right well anyway he that the devil tries to be in the meeting he comes in yeah and he's trying to tell me he said oh you know you already did your portion they'll understand you know if you don't really go for it you know and I said wow that dumb devil I'm gonna do it doubly doubly I said I'm just oh I'm just gonna get I'll tell you all Hallelujah again and brother preacher preach it and I don't care what anybody says yeah and the devil said oh you know this thing's going to be broadcasted those Pastor friends that you have out west they're gonna see you brother they're gonna see you and then you know all those Teamsters oh that club oh that that that that that disappeared and we don't need it anymore but you know you think the devil just comes and tells you that interesting says oh I can't because you know oh brother Emmanuel you know he's just this and he's all this one and that but tell you know what get out of here devil if you guys realized what the preachers have to go through if you need just a little bit go and talk to Sister Fresca go and talk to sister Shannon come on go and talk to sister Sharon go and talk to to our sis right here right how much do do you sisters go through for for for the husbands a lot right questions right oh well Kobe what's going on oh everybody wants to know yeah right and then the hospital is this all right brother I'm just telling you what he said go and testify a little I said I was letting you know what was happening right there and he was saying don't do it you know you're okay just sit there and I say you know what I'm not gonna sit down I've never been one to sit down I'm going to give it my best I gave my best when I preach I give my best when I'm sitting on the Pew I give it the best wherever that I am and you need to give your best too [Applause] I don't even know where that came from but I think we do don't worry you won't see me for a while can we just speak about us just a little bit just just brother that won't be too much longer notice mother Brown said he said that that's the reason you're sent here to confirm your place in life and then he says right away he says I don't think you got that so there's something that we have to grasp there we have to grasp that we have a position we have a place here it's not just to go to work every day and you realize it brother but I'm talking about in a message called it becometh us to fulfill to fulfill all righteousness he says it'd be and I want to tell you tonight it becometh us also tonight to fulfill our portion of the word notice how many realized that you know when we look into scripture Enoch is our type we know that Enoch was raptured right and then when we go over to Noah we recognize that Noah's dealing with the Jews and that they'll be carried over into by of tribulation and so now we have our understanding now with that I'm going to close on this if the musicians would just come up this evening I'm going to close on this on this quote brother Brandon preached he said in the days he said of Enoch he said just before the flood he said when Enoch looked out there and saw Noah building away on that Ark now notice how brother battery immediately puts in there and he talks about he says Enoch was a prophet someone say a prophet he said Enoch was a prophet he said Enoch knew that he was a type [Music] so the thing is Enoch had already know how did he know because he was a prophet he knew that he was a type and he was a type he knew exactly what type that he was now we have to recognize notice he says Enoch knew that he was a type somebody say new he said and he knew that before the floods came that he had to give an example so we look at Enoch's life now and we recognize it wasn't that he was just blindly walking into this Enoch was a prophet and he knew exactly what was taking place he knew that he had to go to his wife and he had to talk to his wife and he had to say sister he said I love you with all of my heart I love you I do but I just want to tell you I have a journey [Music] and let me tell you it takes somebody with courage if you knew that you were going to pass away or leave the scene and you would no longer see somebody here [Music] on this Earth again until we cross over would it change what you would say you know we oh I would say this brother and I would say that but if you really knew this was the last day that you were going to talk to somebody here on this Earth I want to tell you it would be difficult and Enoch knew what he had to fulfill yeah so when he went to his wife he's talking to his wife and he said well I love you dear and he knew that he wouldn't see her again on this Earth and that she would miss him no doubt but not only that the Enoch had to go to his children and he would have to talk to his children and he would grab his daughter and say daughter I love you with all of my heart with everything that I have stay with the word stay with the word and then he'd look over to his son and he'd grab his son and say oh son I love you oh no doubt he would want to see what he would become no doubt he'd want to see all of his grandchildren in the lineage Beyond but let me tell you it was becoming on him to fulfill his portion together and Enoch had a portion to fulfill notice but the Raptor says that before the floods came that he had to give an example so one afternoon it was becoming to him to take a walk I'm going to tell you tonight he knew that he was leaving he knew that he was taking a different walk [Music] and notice his brother said and it was becoming that he'd take this walk with God and some how that day he changed his path it was a little different than it was the day before and and the day before Hallelujah notice he said instead of going around the side of the Hill today he took the King's Highway and he just kept on walking somebody said Keep On Walking he just kept on walking and they found him not because he was not and he had walked up the King's Highway notice what brother Brandon said he said oh God let me be that Enoch oh and it's time to fulfill my portion let me be like Enoch let me be like Abraham let me be like Elijah let me be like brother Branham let me fulfill my portion no matter what it would do here on this Earth come on Church no matter the human emotion that we go through we have to fulfill our portion and God said he's going to have a bride clean and spotless I want to tell you here tonight you're here to fulfill that portion of righteousness Keep On Walking little bride keep on pushing on little bride Keep On Walking keep on marching Up The King's Highway you love the Lord deceived let's stand to our feet notices and I can see knock as he was becoming to him for he was a prophet and he knew what was going to happen so I can see him kiss his wife goodbye oh I could just imagine brother Wendell brother Brandon seen by a vision [Music] come on because he was a prophet he said oh I can just imagine him kissing his little wife goodbye oh and say darling I'll see you later take up his children and kiss them goodbye and go down to his merry son and his married daughter and kiss them goodbye and say well where are you going father are you going out for a little walk and him saying yes going for a stroll but he never took the old familiar path that day he took the Kings Highway he went on to Glory it was becoming of him to do so sister Fresco Brothers said he didn't want to leave [Music] he didn't want to leave but yet it was becoming to him that he fulfilled all righteousness because he was a type of the church today [Music] you know sometimes you hear a young lady say brother Manuel I said I don't want to I don't want to go yet I haven't yet been married I I want to find out what it's like to to be married or you know I haven't had any children and brother I you know I wanna I wanna tell you you know of course we have these desires but I want to tell you it's time for us to leave no matter what our human emotion is we must fulfill scripture let's just bow our heads this evening [Music] if anybody would like to be remembered in prayer the same just just raise your hand this evening blessed father
