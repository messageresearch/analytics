been good to us amen have you experienced his love his peace his Joy his happiness amen I believe we can experience all the attributes of Christ every day of the week every step of the way amen let's open our scriptures to Genesis 13 and 14 I enjoyed the songs this evening and the specials amen I'm so thankful the bride of Christ has some talents in it that can sing and can play create an atmosphere for the word to fall in amen now let's have a simple subject this evening um on the same lines of this morning but if I had a a subject it would be looked from where you are in Genesis 13 and 14 the Bible would say and the Lord said unto Abram after lot was separated from him lift lift up up now thine eyes and look from the place where thou art northward Southward Eastward and Westward amen can we bow our heads tonight dear gracious Heavenly Father Lord what an honor and a privilege it is to come into your house one more time father as we fill your presence that settled down Among Us Lord we ask that you would speak through these lips of clay tonight father you see this little thought you placed upon My Heart Lord I ask that it can be a strength and an encouragement in some way tonight Lord God we lay their service into your hands father and we ask that you would speak tonight Lord move among the hearts and the needs we ask these things in your precious name amen you may be seated um like I said my subject would be look from where you are and brother Brandon would say uh Romans 8:20 said those who he has predestinated into the Covenant you couldn't come with it yourself no man can come to me except my father draws him those who were predestinated he has called those who he has called he has Justified and those who he justified he has glorified then In God's Presence you are already glorified waiting isn't that marvelous and now while we're waiting for the Redemption of our bodies we are sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus uh the Holy Spirit moving upon the believer great powerful baptisms going forward the world on the outside laughing God working with them uh among them Healing The Sick showing Visions all kinds of signs and wonders the evening sun going down the Christian is looking up and I think this is pretty incredible he's he's painting a good picture for the Christians and then he says the atomic bombs are hanging in over there the world all shaking and don't know what to do and the Christians are shouting the Praises of God come Lord Jesus isn't that wonderful and he would say how can a fellow have the blues and believe something like that can't do it the blues Days Are Over All weariness and sadness is passed away now can't do it God had said so it's just got to be sure as there is a God in heaven we are going to do it and I think it's pretty incredible how he is saying that God is moving but at the same time that the tribulation is going to be settled setting again we see that the America's going to be bombed and be into ashes and he would say you can't get the blues there's no way you can get the blues knowing that there's prophecy going to be fulfilled and I believe we have too many prophecies that we can look to to be down to be discouraged to be brought down by the lies of the enemy you see sometimes we just have to look from where we are our present condition or present circumstances and see hope and see a promise that God has given us you see you might not have it in you in your hand yet but it's a promise that it's going to be fulfilled you see brother Brandon would talk about the loaf of bread and he would say if you ever got hungry he says and somebody came up to him and say what what do you need and he would say I I need a quarter to buy a loaf of bread he would say if somebody had given that to me I can Rejoice now for the loaf of bread even though I don't have it yet I've got the purchasing power of the loaf of bread all they have to do is take that quarter and go purchase what the quarter is able to purchase and brother Brandon would say faith is not your healing but a produces your healing and so we see the promises of God are yay and amen even though we might not be in the Fulfillment of it yet we can still believe that I'm looking away from present conditions present circumstances that I'm walking through looking to a promise and that is going to produce a Rapture a body change no matter what I go through nothing can keep me Earthbound and brother Brandon would say well you say I hope I can get get it all right I hope I can be well I hope I can get the Holy Ghost I hope I'm a Christian I hope to do this you don't want that that Abraham never looked at that a man against hope he still believed God's word faith is beyond hope hope comes from back here in the inside faith comes from in here and so Faith don't hope so Faith knows faith is a substance and brother Brandon would say hope is looking hope is looking and hoping to obtain something but faith has by Revelation faith is the substance of things hoped for and so when I mean we're looking from where we are are is by faith we we might be in financial trouble might be in discouragement but by faith we know that God is going to see me through not hoping that we're going to make it through weariness not hoping we're going to make it through troubles but by faith we know we are going to make it through and Abraham had a lot of problems that he can look to he he he had plenty of excuses that he could justify his heaviness by he was an old man uh Sarah was an old woman she couldn't have a child he couldn't produce a child and but even though he had all of these excuses he still never looked at the conditions that he was in but against hope believed in Hope and I believe that he's an example for us to look to that against hope we can believe in hope no matter how dry it looks we can look at at a promise that God is giving us but you see if you're constantly looking at a present condition that is going to bring you down with heaviness because the world's Bleak you know you wake up in the morning maybe you got aches and pains in your body if you're focusing on that that is going to discourage you or or maybe you look at your your bald head brother Mor you wake up and you think my goodness I'm getting older every day it's going to bring you down but if we can also look away from present conditions and look to a promise that God has given us then we can receive what God has given us in this generation brother Brandon would say this there was one here today he's the only one Hallelujah he's got the light switch in his hand those who set in the regions of the shadow of death great light is sprung up don't reject it receive it in the name of the Lord and it's easy to reject uh the promises of God when we are in the heaviness you know because brother Brandon would tell us in order to believe a lie you have to reject the truth right so when order to to dwell in the negative you have to reject the positive right and so in the Bible would tell us in in Psalms 26 or Acts 26 and8 to open their eyes and to turn them from Darkness to light from the power of Satan unto God and so we uh so the Bible is telling us that Darkness and Light is completely different the power of Satan is darkness and the power of God is light and I believe that the shadows of heaviness comes from Darkness you know it's a heaviness and depression and anxiety and negativity it's not from the power of light it is from the power of Darkness so when before you can get the fruits to to manifest for the things of God you have to get out of the negative like I was saying this morning before you can be a tree of righteousness you have to be there has to be a swapping of Beauty for Ashes the Garment of Praise for the spirit of heaviness so before you can produce the light in your life you have to give up the negative before you can have the positive you got to give up the negative and and brother Brandon would tell us here strangers one to another but you you have to you have a very strange nature that is a deep thinker always Crossing Bridges before you get to it it's always a bad thing never happens the way you plan it and by that it's developed into a peptic condition of the stomach giving you stomach trouble that's right isn't that right sir if that is right raise your hand which is right couldn't be nothing else God Almighty knows it you know you now throw aside every negative thought and will go home and eat your supper and praise God and give him Praises for it and so we would see that this was the shadow of Darkness was producing the negativity which was bringing an ulcer inside of his body bringing a stomach condition and that is really incredible to think that maybe lots of sicknesses is from negativity you know have you ever thought about that before this man had a condition and his body because he had he was dwelling on negative thoughts you know brother brand I I believe brother Brandon would say if you fear cancer and fear you're going to get it something is going to come upon you and so if you're constantly dwelling in the negative and instead of on the positive it can produce a weariness and heaviness and discouragement but if you can throw aside every negative thought and don't worry about it brother brandom says he's crossing the bridges before he ever before he ever got to him it's worrying it's stressing and hoping it's going to make it all right somebody is looking at the negative instead of the positive but Brandon would say well our thoughts well our thoughts are always negative we come in the prayer line I notice we've come in the prayer line and and I will he tell me this is it this oh my you never get nothing like that no you're so negative to begin with come to the fountain filled with blood drawn from emanuel's veins and which where sinners plunged beneath the flow beneath the flood loose all their guilty stains that is it come with faith believing so there's a difference in having faith believing and coming and being negative you know too many times we we we uh we maybe we come to church with a negative with a negative mindset well we're just going to hear another sermon or or just hear a pastor teach on a Wednesday night and when we come with that attitude we don't come with faith believing to see the Supernatural and when that happens we can no longer see the promises all we see is present conditions and I say if there's ever a time to look away to Jesus and look away from present conditions and look to a promise this is the day not to be negative with the things of God but to remain positive brother Brandon would say he'll test your faith is that right he'll test your faith to see don't you believe that he said do you believe that I Died For You at Calvary to hear to heal you or to take take away your worries or whatever is wrong with you and I think that is pretty incredible that brother brandom he ties sickness and worries together you know many times we think sickness oh my we got an illness we need to see Jesus God's got to heal us but he's putting gift that weary is the same illness as sickness but he says it's okay the same God that died for for your healing also died for your weariness and for your worries and I don't believe we have to be weary every day you know we're living in a fast-paced world of pressure and anxiety but I don't believe that we have to live in a condition of worriness and brother Brandon would say May the spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ move down and settle down and come on this audience and may the glooms of fear and doubts and unbelief be moved away Lord I believe that you'll give it to us just a touch of your presence They will receive it just move the Gloom back enough that their spiritual eyes can be opened up to see what is standing here in the building tonight to see your presence is omnipotent and that really stood out to me that brother Brandon was saying just the touch of your presence they can receive it and move the Gloom back enough to see for their spiritual eyes to be open to see the omnipotent presence of Jesus Christ and so gloominess can blind her eyes to the supernatural that is right Among Us you know how many's ever how many's ever have the thoughts after you Youth Camp I I know I have like after this last Youth Camp you come to church that next Wednesday or next Sunday and you think man I wish I wish that uh we can have services like at Youth Camp how many's ever thought of that or we come through our convention you know our meeting and the power of God would move and you just wish that man I wish we can have those services and what it is is it's the meetings Blues you know what I'm talking after the meetings your friends are back home you know Austin's girlfriend went back to Ohio and now you're sitting there my goodness if only this would last eternity I could be seeing her every day you know it's the meetings blues and here brother brandom is saying that it's Gloom that is blinding you to the omnipotent presence of Jesus Christ and I say Lord Let The Presence of Jehovah come and bathe over me and and push back the Gloom enough that I can see that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever I might not feel him right now but I know he's here I might not seek him with natural life but I know he is here I'm not allowing the the the the the the spirits of the age blind my eyes where I cannot see that the same God that moved at Youth Camp moved in our convention is the same God that can move on a Wednesday that can move on a Sunday morning that can move on a Sunday evening it's pushing back all of the Gloom and can see that Jesus Christ is here standing in our midst and you would and brother Brandon would would tell the story of Elisha and his servant how that his servant could not see the Chariots of Fire because he was so focused upon the upon the uh the syrians I believe that was coming up to kill them and here he looked out of the tent and could see they were surrounded by all of the Syrian Army and he would run back to Elisha and would say hey look what's going on outside we're surrounded and the prophet would look at him and would say more are with us than with him and this man could look out the window and think more with us there's just me and old man versus the king's Army how are we going to obtain the Victory and know many times we look at ourselves how am I going to obtain the victory how am I going to see a Rapture how am I going to see a body change there's no way I'm going to make it through the struggle I'm going to make it through this circumstance and then the prophet would say Lord open this Poor Boy's eyes that he can see he was so focused on the present condition that he would fail to see there was Chariots of Fire that surrounding Camp to produce the Victory and oh if you can just look from your present condition and you can look into the Unseen realm you will see that there's ministering Angels every step of the way that was pulling you along you know the Bible would tell us that after the devil left Jesus after he tempted him in the wilderness the ministering Angels would come and minister to him it was after the battle and you know but brother Brandon would tell us all Jesus had to do whenever he was on the cross was move his hand a certain way and the legions of angels would come and take him off the cross you see in the toughest struggle the toughest part of his flesh being tested there was ministering Angels oh even when he was on the cross but the Brandon would say the God had left him and it was flesh laying sitting there on the cross there were still Legions of angels oh and I say you may feel like your flesh is beaten down you may feel tired you may feel weary there's Legions of angels that is guiding every step that you take brother brandom says God sends forth Angels Glory what are they ministering Spirits Glory ministering Spirits sent where from the presence of God what to do Minister his word they're not to minister some Theology of some denominational group but to minister his word that's it ministering Spirits sent forth oh Hallelujah now you understand that's why you can never commit suicide you've tried you know brother brandom he would try to take his life and he would put the gun to his head and it would just click it would misfire he would try to grab the the electric lines to kill himself I believe he ministering spirits and that's why you've tried to give up you've tried to turn around you tried to say Lord I can't do this but you're still standing here today it's not by your might not by your power not by your ability it was ministering spirits that was with you every step of the way oh Hallelujah even in the worry whenever you're stressed it's ministering spirits that is ministering to you every step of the way and brother brandom says this when he died at Calvary he healed you when he died at Calvary he saved you and he took away your worries and your troubles only thing he can do now he might he might do like he did when he was on Earth because the Bible said he's the same yesterday today and forever is that right when he was upon Earth he did not claim to be a great person he just preached the gospel he dressed like other men went along just like Meek and humble and I think that's so incredible that brother brandom says if he was here he would do what he did back then he didn't claim to be somebody special he just preached the gospel and what did the the the the preaching of the Gospel do it brought forth Miracles it calmed the weary Hearts it it brought it took it brought a piece to the troubless and brother brandom says when he died at Calvary he he he took away your worries he took away your troubles and here we are preaching the gospel today proclaiming and enforcing what Calvary has already done for us and I believe it's the same gospel we're preaching today that it was that Jesus was preaching back then and the Bible would tell us in Genesis 1 and three God said let there be light and there was light and God saw the light that it was good and divided the light from the darkness so whenever the light would come upon the Earth it divided the light from the darkness so every shadow that was brought on the Earth by the darkness was then taken away because of the light and I believe that the same God that commanded let there be light like the Apostle Paul like I read this morning has shined in our hearts it's taking away every Shadow of Doubt every shadow of unbelief because the light shined in a heart you see God divided the light from the darkness and I believe in brother Brandon would say there's a man that that has a light switch in his hand let me see if I can if I can find that quote there but brandom he would say that uh uh there's a man here that can turn on the lights and he would say he is holding the light switch in his hand and I think that is so incredible that all you have to do is say Lord I'm in need just like we were saying this morning whenever the disciples was there on the boat the the the the one that was able to bring a peace to the storm was there all along all they had to do was wake him up right but the brandom says there's Jesus that has a light switch in his hand but all you got to do is ask him and I say Lord help me to look from my present condition and say Lord turn on the lights that I can see the promises that is for in fulfillment of today and brother Brandon would say at this glorious Sunrise God Vindicated his word and all the glooms and doubt that have moved in the people's minds were removed the Bible would say though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I fear no evil for thou art my rod and my stat and they comfort me he's not keeping you from the shadows of of death but he's he's guiding you and keeping you not keeping you away from the shadows of death but he's keeping you through the Shadows when we go through them even in the negative there's a positive word that is bringing a comfort the Bible would say in 2 Thessalonians 2:1:1 that ye'd be not soon shaken in mind or be trouble neither by Spirit nor by word nor by letter from us as the day of Christ is at hand and he and he's specifying there's Spirits there's words maybe even letters that comes to you but but but but keep in mind that the day of Christ is at hand so I don't believe that men's words can trouble us I don't believe that the letters that comes against you can trouble you if you keep in mind and focus on the coming of the Lord there is something that is going to take you through you see many times we like focusing on the negative that we miss out on the bless blessings of God how many's ever been there you know like like I was saying a few minutes ago we get uh we we we we like the the environment of meetings and we get depressed when we come back to church and I as I was looking at these things this really stood out to me because whenever you are at meetings you forget about your troubles how many's ever can testify of that you forget about your troubles you forget about things that are at home and then you want to go from meeting to meeting to meeting to meeting because you like that feeling right there's Li Liberty there's Freedom you all the all the worries that are staying at home there's nothing coming against your mind but I don't believe that just happens that at camps or meetings but we can get so involved with this message that when we go to work we can live in Liberty when we when we at home with our family there can be a freedom we still have to deal with things but it's not worrying us amen we still have to deal with pressures we still have to deal with struggles but we're keeping our eyes upon the POS POS and brother brandom says you might have lost your health you might have lost your fellowship take him at his word and be certain that he is God the gloomy times that's looking now might not look so gloomy if you'll just take his word and be certain that he is God oh man that really done my heart good the gloomy times might not look so gloomy if you just take God out of his word and be certain that he's God too many times we make you know we make a mountain out of an ant hill oh man I I'm going down for the count this time I'm about to die but the brandom says it might not be so bad if you can just look up the promise of God and that and and I hope this this can come together a little bit this evening that if you can just look from where you are the troubles might not look so bad if you can keep your eyes on the promise the circumstances might not be so bad you might feel like you're about to go down from the count but just remember there's a promise and brother Brandon will talk about the German painting that that uh uh that the that this painter would would paint a picture and it was called the the the cloud land and brother brandom says from AF far off it looks like a bunch of gloominess he says there's a bunch of clouds and he says once you got up closer it would change and it's so incredible he says if once you got up closer and really looked at it he says it wasn't clouds it was angels and he says it was Angels Wings beating together from afar all you can see was clouds from afar all you can see was circumstances from afar all you can see was troubles but if you look up close there's ministering Angels oh Hallelujah if you just look through the lens of God's word you can see that the reason I'm still standing today was there was angels that was guiding me every step of the way brother brandom he would say in Germany once I saw a picture and it always said always stuck with me a German painter has painted a picture that's called the cloud land and when you see it off at a distance it's the horriblest looking Gloom that you ever seen the the clouds just Matt it together when you're looking at it from a long distance but when you get real close to it it changes it's angel's wings beating together singing Hallelujah to the Lord so that's what Gloom is sometimes if you look at it at a long distance it looks gloomy and dark but take God's word and be sech him that is God and move up close to it you'll find that it's just Eagle wings beating together he says that's what Gloom is sometimes from a distance it looks like you're going down but if you get up close and you look it's just an angels Wings sing Hallelujah to the Lord and that's the reason that we have to look away from our troubles we have to have to look away from our present conditions cuz here was Abraham the father of Nations without yet having a child and here come here come God speaking to him after he separated himself and it's it's so incredible that once he was still identif ified with the world or identified with lot he was never going to hear the voice of God but once he separated then God would come and let him know now that you're separated from lot now look from where you are and if there's ever a time to separate from the things of the world it is now and if you are it's time to look and possess oh my it ain't time just to look back and say man I wish I can have no he would in the Bible would tell us after that after that verse the next verse he would say arise and walk through the length of it the breadth of it so once you look from where you are and see the promises of God now it's time to possess it oh Hallelujah I think it's time that we possess every promise that God has promised us in this generation oh if anybody had a reason to cry and to and to whine it was Jonah and brother Brandon would say that we don't have it as near as worse as Jonah would have it you know and the Bible would tell us that he would cry out by the reason of his Affliction but then at the end of it he would say I will yet again look towards the Holy Temple and once he looked towards the temple the Bible would say he would call the things that he was looking at lying vanities ain't that incredible that before he would turn his eyes from his present condition to the Holy Temple he was crying out by the reason of his his Affliction but once he lifted up his eyes he would say these are lying vanities oh oh Hallelujah these are lying vanities these ain't going to take me down but it's just taking me to the predestinated will of God and ain't that incredible to think about that even though he was running from God God would allow lying vanities to bring him right back to the course that God had for his life hey and you never know maybe you feel backsliding you may feel like you you're running from God but God still has a hand upon your life you know that's so incredible you can never outrun the grace of God you see and the Bible just says In Jonah 2 and8 and they that observe lying vanities forsake their own Mercy they that observe them they that are constantly looking at them or forsaking their own Mercy the next verse but I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of Thanksgiving so it went from crying to God to to to changing to a voice of Thanksgiving praising God we can still praise God on the hard times we can praise God in the trials we can praise God in the circumstances but the brandom says oh how gloomy it must have been he's talking about the widow woman that was about to eat her last meal and die oh how gloomy a must have been death laying there at the door her her and her son had to eat one little piece of a cake and Dy that was all of it and sometimes right in the midst of the Gloom we hear the voice so right there can you imagine being this little woman you're running out of water you have one meal left Not only was she about to die but her son was about to die and that really strikes home as a parent I'm sure parents can can can can testify of it I'm sure she felt like a failure another failure Not only was she about to die but her son was about to die and I'm sure she tried everything possible to find water or maybe to find some meal or or or or find some oil but all of her failure or all of her all of her e efforts were in vain and here she was she was about to die and then she would hear a voice in the midst of her Gloom she would hear a voice and what would that voice ask her to do and you know I think it's it's it's it's incredible that the voice would ask her give me a cake give me something to eat now she had to turn from her Gloom and look to a promise because all she had was one meal left right all she had was one meal left that she was going to die and here had come a prophet saying give me that last meal you got give me that last cake that you would have and then the Bible would say here in first king 17-13 and Elijah said unto her fear not go and do as thou has said but make me thereof a little cake first and bring it unto me and after make thee make for thee and for thy son for thus saeth the Lord for the Lord God of Israel the barrel of meal shall not waste neither shall the course Cruise of oil fail until the day that the Lord send the Rin upon the Earth so once she looked away from her present condition and will look to a promise then the barrel of meal would rise up you see God ain't forsaken you God God hasn't left you but the Brandon would say God I'm looking to you now maybe you had worries maybe you had financial troubles whatever it is no matter what it is cast it right Yonder against Calvary for all the things are possible to them that believe he would say in another place and meet with us Lord and give us one of the greatest nights that we've had yet people are waiting with great anticipation and the and Lord while this great anticipation is on May men and women look from this Earthbound condition that we're setting to a heavenly father that is ready to pour out his blessings and power upon us maybe look from this Earthbound condition to a heavenly father that is ready to pour out a blessing upon us you see I don't believe God has done with new life Outreach you believe that believe that this evening God ain't done with this little church God ain't done with your marriages God ain't done with your home homes he's not done with your children but God is look waiting for you to look from this Earthbound condition your present condition to our Heavenly Father the Bible would say in Deuteronomy 28:2 and all these blessings shall come on thee and overtake thee not just come on the but they're going to they're going to cover you they're going to wrap you like I was saying this morning that brother brandom says we're wrapped in the life of the blood cell of Jesus Christ so if we're wrapped in it that means the devil cannot get to you unless he can get through the blood and here de Deuteronomy is saying these blessings shall come upon thee and overtake thee and I say Lord I'm willing to look away the B brother Brandon would say but Jesus wants to give you the best thing that anybody could give you and the and the only one that could give it eternal life healing for the body swap your weariness for Joy take the Gloom away and give you a shout of Victory it's the blessings of God that is going to overtake you but you got to swap the weariness for joy and that's going to give you a shout of Victory oh man you ever want to praise God get rid of the weariness you want to praise God get rid of the Gloom brother the Brandon going say this somehow or another or somehow another I feel we're going there's something laying right ahead for us now just remember I believe I'm prophesying great Joys lay ahead believe it that's right many sad in Hearts will be made great Mysteries will be made clear people who were sad would be turned into joy and the and it says the congregation rejoices he says I believe I'm prophesying that there's something ahead for us not some great Joys lay ahead of and he says believe it and I believe I can quote this Pro quote the prophecy for New Life Outreach this just wasn't for for uh Jeffersonville but I believe that's for New Life Outreach there's great Joys ahead of us there's Revival ahead of us the the the the the Rapture is ahead of us healings uh deliverances whatever you have need of but the Brandon would prophesy and he would say great Joys lay ahead of us oh Hallelujah he says many people who are sad would be turned into Joy many people that are sad depressed lonely feel Forsaken and he says just believe it oh Hallelujah and I believe I'm claiming that prophecy for this little church that I believe that God is still working in these pews God's still working in this pull pit God's still working getting a bride ready for the coming of the Lord but I like how it says at the end of that quote the congregation rejoices because they swap their weariness for joy and then they can put on that Garment of Praise and say hey I'm identifying with that prophecy I'm identifying you know you can look at blind bmus and and and and history would tell us that the blind people would have a Beggar's cloak on and that cloak would identify him as a beggar and so whenever Jesus would come by his way and would give him his my sight he didn't need that cloak any longer because his weariness was swapped for joy and he can lay off the beggar's garment and take on the Garment of Praise he can say Look What the Lord Has Done I once was blind but now I see and I think it's time that we take off the spirit of of heaviness and put on the Garment of Praise and said Look What the Lord Has Done I once was discouraged I once was bound for hell I once was heading to a tribulation but now I got a new garment on and I can praise God hallelujah I can praise God cuz there are some good things in store for me brother Brandon would say not not not say well I if I can feel it I'd feel the glory of God falling oh that is nothing to do with it not a thing open up that mind that's the Battleground that's where the battle sets in Array right here in the front line your mind open up and see every doubt I doubt my doubts I'm doubting my doubts now I'm believing God's word here I come Satan something is going to take place sure it will yes sir I'm doubting my doubts you see too many times we doubt God's word and believe the doubts brother brandom says I'm doubting my doubts and I'm saying Satan here I come too many times we stay on the offensive and on the defensive instead of going on the offensive and saying I want my joy back I want my peace back I want my healing back I'm looking from where I am to a Heavenly Father brother brandom says I wonder if we all tonight can look and see what Barabas saw someone taking our place he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquity the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes I was healed you were healed I wonder if we the guilty ones who should be sick can see in him our deliverance you who should go to hell see in him your freedom see your path to Heaven I wonder if you can see what Barabas saw on that day I wonder if we the guilty ones that should be sick can see in him hallelujah amen brother Brandon would say this the Bible would the Bible said he ascended on high and gave gifts unto men there was an atmosphere that hung over the Earth of Darkness of Gloom and death and weary the prayers couldn't even come up because but because of the atone because the atonement wasn't made but he broke through the Veil and opened up the way he broke the veil of sickness he broke the veil of sin he broke the veil of weariness he broke the veil of depression he broke every Veil and when we look at him we see in him our freedom we see in him our joy we see in him our Liberty and and the joy of our Salvation let let our musicians come this evening I like how the Bible would put it in 1 Peter 1 and6 wherein you greatly Rejoice though now for a season if need be ye are in heaviness just for a season and you see seasons are going to pass Seasons comes season goes just like fall comes spring comes winter comes summer comes they come but you know that there's an end coming to that season and here the Bible is saying if right now you're in a heaviness it's only for a season and I believe that season's going to change one day Amen brother Brandon would say and when when he's seen when he's seen in the beginning in our first parents fall he seen the Covenant he made with Adam he tried to hook the ladder unto him and failed there was nothing else he could hook it to but to bring down his own son and he hooked it to him so it can't fall now so what are we worried about what are we stewing about why are we going along great with a great big long face let's look up and grin look up and not only grin but laugh not only laugh but raise up holy hands everywhere giving praises and glory to God for his promises are yay and amen not yes and no or not yes and no but yes there's no no in it it is yes he says how can we fail now why are we worried about it why do we have a long face he says look up and grin you know I was there in Pennsylvania there brother Jim Shu mak's meeting and Uncle Shawn was ministering and he read that quote I'd never heard that before just look up and grin he says why the long face what are we worried about just look up and grin I see we should be the happiest people on the face of the Earth amen we know we're we know we're ending of tribulation it's a rapture we know our end ain't the depression it's a sound of mind we know our end ain't going down in defeat so if there's ever a people that should put on the Garment of Praise it is US amen I know it's a Sunday evening so I I I just cut it short but I pray something was said today that was a blessing in some way uh I I I I pray something was said to be a
