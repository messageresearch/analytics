lasciviousness to work all uncleanness with the greediness but you have not so learned Christ if so be that you have heard him and have been told by him as the truth is in Jesus that you put off concerning the former conversation the old man which is corrupt according to the city to the deceitful last and be renewed in the spirit of your mind and that you put on the new man which after God is created in righteousness and through Holiness whether far ing away lying speaking every man truth with with each neighbor for we are members one of another be hungry and sin not let not not the son God upon your Wrath neither give place to that devil let him that still that hymns that's told still no more but rather let him labor working with his son the things which is good that he may have to give to him uh that needeth that needeth let not corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that that which is good to the use of edifying that it may Minister Grace unto the hearers grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed unto the day of redemption you you begin from 26 Brothers so so much [Music] [Music] be put away from you with all malice and be kind one to another tenderhearted forgiving one another even as God forgive as God and if even as God for Christ's sake had forgiven you you okay um [Music] mukristo blessed Jesus we thank you for the portion of the word we have read yes amen Amina yeah I may have your seats praise the Lord yeah this evening I want us to talk about I want to talk about about the Seal of God I'll call my text you must be sealed remember whatever shared it if I have not mistaken Embassy this evening I just I had something that I wanted us to share but I felt like we share we have this sharing the name let's say the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah amen Amina it is you must be sealed and we're going to see the reason as to why we must be sales there is a reason and is a solid reason why we must receive the holy spirit amen Amina the Holy Ghost we cannot receive the Holy Spirit that we cannot receive the Holy Spirit until when we know who he is he preached several messages what is the Holy Ghost why was the Holy Ghost given um he talked about the Seal of God he talked about the talking all those sub messages speaks about the Holy Spirit just like the way it is from Genesis to Revelation it is all about the holy spirit it's all about Christ Jesus is the Holy Ghost yes amen and the Holy Spirit is blessed be the name of the Lord and remember the Bible says that anointing breaks the yolks it is the holy spirit no it is the whole that is the symbol of the Holy Ghost blessed be the name of the Lord this evening we are talking about you must be sealed and I must be sealed [Applause] and Jesus asked him foreign let us begin from 20 29 it says that let not not no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying agamante buddich [Music] we better not speak it out amen that's why the scripture tells us relationship when we meet when we come together let the Lord come with some this one with testimony amen Nina blessed with the name of the Lord because when one comes with sounds another one with the testimony we are edifying one another blessed with the name of the Lord Jesus because God has done this to me the other one comes with a song [Music] [Applause] I have been singing this song has been singing inside with the name of the Lord and you may find in that situation atmosphere maybe one of the brother in that meeting he has been down that it may Minister Grace and to the hearers amen whatever we are saying whatever we are speaking amen it must Minister Grace not discouraging them not trampling on them blessed with the name of the Lord and he says [Applause] blessed with the name of the Lord in the message in the Seal of God the prophet asks where is the Seal of God say what is not talking about amen then he gives an example when goods are going to be imported or maybe even if it's from moving uh good from Kampala to Mali already that container will have a seal container ready [Music] for a cast from Japan and they are coming maybe through containers blessed with the name of the Lord when those schools are packed [Music] spiritual things will move will cross through many countries but nobody will tamper with those sales it is amen Amina praise be to God and the prophet in the message adoption he says that uh uh he says that is the instructor argument he will check he refers this as the box of the Holy Spirit it says that God wants to gives us the Holy Spirit but he cannot put his whole spirit in our dirty lives amen we know the three stages of Salvation that is sanctification justification and then the Babson of the Holy Spirit you cannot people touch the Holy Ghost before going through this process of God by the time God seals you God gives yourself it is when you are ready for the sale you have been tested you have been cleansed amen you have been Justified when you just believed and you are Sanctified and then after God gives you the Holy Spirit and when you are given the Holy Ghost destination blessed with the name of the Lord we are living in that time today when people does not care about it preachers have preached about the Holy Spirit until the lady has just used to it but brother let me tell you God is summarizing with a gentile in the grace of God is soon going back to the Jews the gentle door will shut and there will be no more Holy Ghost the property the message says that oh that we all know we are living in the laude foreign I do not look for the American Church to get any better woman it will continue to get worse amen churches are getting worse and worse it's not going to get better it's going to get to us it's going to get harder all the time the Revival is gone you are only leaning in the field foreign amen Mina and after all those economic crisis he says we get harder and the harder again it's not going to get better it's going to get worse it's going to get harder all the time the Revival is gone amen Amina five years ago ten years ago men and women used to spend time on their knees they go on the islands to pray they go in the forest amen but today you'll hardly find one Soul at the altario I know what I'm talking about blessed be the name of the Lord where young men would spend their night at church hearing the message I mean gospel song Amen they come early to church and by the time you come the church is on fire show me one today what blessed with the name of the Lord and if a promise save us going to go what's going to help you and me it is the token it is the Seal of God because the holy spirit is on the word of God Amen what places the Holy Ghost is prayer blessed be the name of the Lord you say that when he the Holy Ghost is come on he will bring this thing into your remembrance said with the name of the Lord Jesus was with the disciples and remember when they went to pray he came like three times I know that spirit is willing but the body is weakness Jesus was with the disciples yes amen the Holy Ghost shall not come inside them but many the same man after the day of Pentacles amen you not even need to wake them up it was now the Holy Spirit living in there blessed be the name of the Lord we must be sealed and we must know why we need the holy spirit amen Amina you are looking for money but you are not looking for the Holy Spirit blessed in the name of the Lord we are seeking for food the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit wants to be sold um amen and that's what God demands from USA is going to get worse if the world will stand another 50 years the whole world would be totally insane again the prophet spoke this verse in 1964. today men and women they are marrying dogs they are marrying pigs the other day I saw among a clip of a man who were the crocodile was some more busy um can you imagine blessed in the name of the Lord now what this is what the prophet spoke about nothing the bridegroom with a solid wire oh goodness you don't want it to have open mouth that is insanity foreign and it is okay it is okay according to the world system in Singapore but when you arise and preach against that against homosexuality against those things they are crazy [Music] blessed be the name of the Lord supposed to Roman 8 38 says that for I am persuaded um to separate us amen when we are sealed we are still in Christ Jesus blessed with the name of the Lord as we are looking for money as we are working as you're educating our children let us not forget let us not forget that God send the Holy Ghost blessed in the name of the Lord but when I'm in the message Resurrection it says he say that I believe that that every everything is blessed in the name of the Lord we cannot believe the word without the Holy Spirit we cannot keep this word without him this word cannot work without him because the Bible says that when he the Holy Ghost you say that that when the spirit that raises he will Quicken our motor bodies that's why we must be sealed amen what will make you overcome last is the Holy Ghost what foreign you may be a good pianist you may be a good preacher you may be a good singer you may be a good housewife a good businessman all those things are good but you need the holy spirit because all those things will end the Bible says gift will assist but what is going to keep you going is the holy spirit blessed with the name of the Lord amen why schools are sealed air into everybody it's up to it's his destination and when God gives us this uh the holy spirit that is a down payment remain with another Peace you are presenting the Holy Ghost amen when the other peace comes you must have another Peace in you God is this you are eating the world you are increasing the rate of magnetism in you and that is the holy spirit comes Jesus Christ you'll be carried objectively because you already have the same element in you here we are in the end time coming from the East and the west and North and the South what are we doing getting ready for the Rapture getting ready holding our souls for a few minutes till every fiber is filled with the Holy Ghost and she will go up then she'll go up um signifies the ownership [Music] they're saying that men and women are ready for the Rapture it's not only coming to church in fact the main many things the main indication that you are ready for the Rapture it is when we're here but you have received the Holy Spirit amen when we hear men and women young men and young young boy young boys and young girls they are hungering for God they are seeking God night and days blessed with the name of the Lord amen when you see that anger when people are thirsting for the Holy Spirit you know people are getting ready for the Raptors the devil also comes to church that the devil also when hears the name of the Lord even trembles in others one God and even trembles his religious man every Friday the Devil comes to church so you are coming to church does not scare him category blessed be the name of the Lord so it is not a traditional custom to come to church seeing Tim Pizza what scares the devil is when you are taking a higher step go to the direction I must receive the holy ghosts don't know that language they cannot impassionate that again blessed me the name of the Lord amen the spoken word make the kingdom of the devil blessed with the name of the Lord the Holy Ghost will never crack jokes the Holy Ghost will never freedom foreign you find they have put shot aside they'll invest they're playing chess oh God bless you brother God bless you not the Holy Spirit the holy spirit will feed on the message amen he will feed on the world they will be done praise and worship praise be to God and if you're doing better stand before I I say something was not allow the devil to make you doors I've never seen somebody being given KFC and uh knocking the table even when he had been taken by a nap and you just maybe dream like kevs you may end up working I said this is more than KFC this is more than chicken and chips this is the worst of eternal life amen heaven will pass away but this world will not pass away blessed with the name of the Lord in this message the prophet has something is spoken he spoke here and we're going through them foreign he said the spoken word makes the devil the kingdom of the devil crumble and fall is out there and just disintegrates Saturn's Kingdom amen when we are sealed when we are the Holy Spirit blessed with the name of the Lord Brother our words with authority remember the Holy Spirit the prophet says the Holy Ghost is the law enforce when you claim something through the world [Applause] sound in politics certainty in home everything is uncertain you may say I got a job brother I got a promise just let them change bosses once a man can marry a nice woman get her back out of the country there is not polluted [Music] take her in a home I'm taking my car and set a television in there TV and the first thing you know you come home she's acting like some of these movie stars and you think you got a visitor she may not need to look for to go and buy makeup because she's in that in the in the village you will get the red ink pen and paint and mouth ful and get this charcoal and then put on the eyebrows amen mean she acted like this this movie said and there is no security in it [Music] when you're corrected by the word of God you must be subject to the word amen liberals represents a type of sin a chicken and when a man wants stand correction by the word of God he is full of leprosy and blows up and Carries [Music] blessed be the name of the Lord amen I mean now listen here when Christ in The Passion of the Holy Ghost comes upon you in a true baptism of the Holy Ghost Christ you got all this versions sealed in you that's Faith Godly knowledge Temperance if a man is born of the spirit of God it is automatically he lives the life amen that's why we need the Holy Spirit we cannot play we will play church and finally be we will be found we must be sailing going on [Applause] holding the Four Winds of the Earth says nobody knows this wind means in the Bible he says now anybody sorry now enables knows what winds mean in the bible now this is after the opening of that it says that now everybody knows what wins means in the Bible wind is war emperor foreign that the wind should not blow on Earth not on the sea nor on any tree and in verses 12 Revelation chapter seven he says and I saw another end you are sending from the East and he cried with the loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to Heart the earth and the sea oh yeah the first end the first four angels they were told to hold the Four Winds of the earth and the prophet is telling us the winds means to war strife blessed with the name of the Lord and in verses 2 of Revelation 7 we are seeing another Angel ascending from the East having the Seal of the Living God yes seven three says till we have sealed the Servants of the Servants of our God in there foreign [Music] [Music] desperation he says that token is Christ [Music] Israel was commanded to stay under the blood until the matching order come Israeli again don't go out from under it foreign and now the same is today there's only one place that uh that spiritual death cannot strike and that is the word death can't strike the words is the Living Word of God brother let us enter in the world that will not strike you there blessed with the name of the Lord sickness will not strike us there and what the residual let us apply the tokens let us be sealed in Christ is the Fountain of Guru Hills he said listen did you know that the Bible predicts that in the last days foreign blessed in the name of the Lord where men go in labs these are the things which are biologically engineered blessed in the name of the Lord and the disease will break out upon the people and what does and they will fall on everyone without the baptism of the Holy Spirit foreign [Music] jamb Warfare yeah when men and women use disease as a weapon to destroy another woman is not the story of coffee they say it was manufactured and when it came yet it mainly kills them who think they are Mighty remember before Angels they were told to hold on the Wind from the East the West the South and the north do not hurt them then God sent the ceiling Angels blessed be the name of the Lord and he told us to stay under the world praise the Lord everyone without the best of the Holy Spirit this is not just the stories you know the spiritual the things of the Holy Spirit they are not just stories they are believers who are still struggling by demons every time I switch off the light detect me receive the Holy Ghost and let us see if that devil will come which will understand amen amen blessed in the name of the Lord time will come when it comes I remember one day one time brother was preaching he was preaching uh the message here door in the door and he gave a story of a man who invited Jesus in his home he told Jesus saying the night he was attacked and he was tortured and Jesus was there seated yes about Jesus foreign [Music] just like that amen amen so now Jesus I've given you my entire service when they came and attacked they really mistreated him back where Jesus was things we are okay so this man could give apart several Apartments to Jesus separated until when he gave him his bedroom amen so if you are disturbed by demons Jesus entered there yes amen that demon of blessed will think that is as usual um and Jesus will open the door and ask him how may I help you yes yeah amen [Music] but must say that sickness and diseases man would actually root in their flesh agamentially was given commission don't you touch any of those don't you come near those who have the wine and the oil don't touch those who have the Seal of God upon therefore our heads you think cancer is something the Bible says there is coming a time man will rot right in their flesh and the boosters will eat of their carcasses before even they die the pain of cancer is so hard compared to hunger and thirsting to look for the Holy Spirit blessed with the name of the Lord he said something when I was reading here he said that look at all this television and things getting this fiction things in order it will come a time I predict that people will be completely totally insane the world will be the the world will be and the Bible speaks of such hideous sight as they show in movies today foreign gracious egg that lived in the Earth for so many thousands and millions of years hatched and come apart that is just a mere things to that to what is going to happen again is what is saying here amen he knew this that is just a mirror things to what is going to happen he says when hell is open and the table comes out with all of his mysterious things [Music] with the hair like women with the long hair foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] blessed be the name of the Lord sing us in their tale like they will torment men and women for months why the world will be completely totally insane it is just about one degree from it now listen without the Seal of God the Holy Ghost and to think that if you be in hell not always tormented with the demons evil spirits forever separated from God what about then and then you may be there with the Sun rises in the morning you may be there before this oh sorry and then you may be there before the sun rises in the morning you better be ready friends don't make this a joke don't make it a television film we are not making movies Minister spirituals we are not making jokes you may be there before even the sun rises it's showing us the agency amen if we're seeking God the way we are seeking for material things we would be much better amen say where we go very early in the morning at our workplaces nobody want to give his body excuse of coming late but we give God excuses blessed be the name of the Lord it is because we just don't know the gods because if if we fear our boss more than ourselves there is something wrong somewhere amen if you go late for work three times if they hope they will give you warning later and I'm telling you will be leaving home at 4. because that is your source of income that's what hope you keep family moving but we are talking about the source of eternal life the falling of righteousness blessed be the name of the Lord amen may God give us the grace if you're of Christ you are sealed with the Holy ghosts and if you are not but only way you will have a mark one of these days [Music] blessed with the name of the Lord we must be sealed to take a look back amen this is individual Affairs we must Jesus said you must be born again yes the bible say that when Jesus other John was killed was in prison he started preaching the gospel of God telling them that repenting the kingdom God is blessed in the name of the Lord he says God gave Abram a sign that was the token amen and today God is giving men and women of the Holy Spirit blessed through the name of the Lord we need God to revive us we need a Revival amen we need to mean business with God praise be to God Amen Let Us utilize this altar here [Music] a few weeks back we shared about hungering for God weeks and we say that when we are not hungering for God there is something wrong and we say that we need the warming spirituality [Music] foreign because if men and women who lived those days they lived knowing that Jesus was coming there next to me but we are living the time where you ask somebody when you last prayer for 30 minutes and it will hardly remember he said it was in the Xmas don't be deceived get the Holy Ghost you will pray like machine again blessed in the name of the Lord what we need is the Holy Spirit what Brother Martin is the Holy Ghost what our family need is the Seal of God we must be sealed to take it to a ticket and if we are not sealed we have heard from the prophets one of these days you will find yourself somewhere with the demons Hallelujah the Bible says draw nearer unto me Bible example you cannot be far from I think God will come near to you yeah this week amen let it not done on us before receiving the Seal of God the prophet says that the young man who came to Jesus running yes he was good he had kept all the Commandments he was missing something and that was eternal life and he came to Jesus let us run to Jesus to give us eternal life amen blessed be the name of the Lord that is what will change our worship that's what will set our hearts on fire when

are not sure that you receive the box of the Holy Ghost you better go on your knees now when I was praying I hope I have him the other day they prayed for me and I felt shocked probably I have him probably that was the Holy Spirit there let us be sure because the Bible tells us we should work our salvation with fear and the trembling be sure that you are pregnant with the Holy Spirit blessed be the name of the Lord the holy spirit is not an option it's not optional services to every Christian every morning you must take this subject this is the key subject Amen in a goddess Institute we only

do we play our partner we leave the rest to God Amen we saw where the prophets say that things will be hard and harder again but the Bible tells us what we are facing right now we can compare with a joy to because yeah but still yeah when we are not sealed if we don't have him in us even when you hear about that Joy you think they are mere words you see that's what make it the difference but somebody who is sealed he knows what he's talking about he missed even he visits there once in a while yes somebody says I thought Jesus what makes that person say that he's so Jesus foreign [Music]
