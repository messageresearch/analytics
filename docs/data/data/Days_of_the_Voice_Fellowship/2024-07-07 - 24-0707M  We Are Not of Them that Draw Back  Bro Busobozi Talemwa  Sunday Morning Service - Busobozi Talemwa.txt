little angels if the baby was to go that of of yours brother [Music] Brian she's G to a good place babies don't go to hell isn't it amazing amen that's why the bible say that if we want to go to heaven we should be like little children and so uh brother Brian and your wife you're going to get reunited with your amen and and and so we are so happy and now our brother Martin and his wife have even a a greater responsibility now that when you get a child and you know child grows you you have responsibility to raise the [Music] child to teach the child and to raise them in the fear of and so what we do is we dedicate like when God gives you something you give it back to him so that he will help you now we we don't have any ability within ourselves we only rely on the holy spirit amen so

your word it is your reward and you have rewarded them youve blessed them and Lord I pray oh God that you will keep the the whole family united together and now Lord You've also given them another little bundle of joy this little Shalom shom Lord we know that the enemy is not happy many times he tries to take these lives while they in their mother's womb and many times after their birth like you told little Jeremiah I knew you before you were in your mother's womb I ordained you to be a prophet to the Nations Lord I know that whoever is born here and whoever is living you knew them before the foundation and you knew that this child will be born Lord and you would give uh this child to brother shalom and his wife they have a responsibility to raise this child Lord I pray that you bless this child as youve given this child to them they now give the child back to you and I dedicate before you father for protection for Grace Upon Our Liv Lord may you keep her away from all these demons

always encamp around for your name's Glory father we dedicate the whole family back to you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen [Music] amen sister Winnie and and brother martin came a long way we all started out inana it's very good to see that we are still having go [Applause] [Music] together praise the name of the Lord amen I have a note here from Sister Stella she says that uh she needs our prayers as she'll be traveling back to Amura today God bless you we will remember you in prayer amen and also I'd like to welcome back sister uh Sister Rose from Tanzania I was in touch with her and you know she was asking me for prayers several times it is good to see that the lord gave her grace amen praise the Lord I I told you on on on Wednesday that I would make an announcement today [Music] um I have been having a B for now a while to you know to to set an outreach program on radio I believe that the gospel that we have is the truth and I believe it is our duty to uh to communicate it and send it [Music] out and so um by God's grace I I've been trying to wait for an opportunity and for leadership this week I went to UBC radio somehow I've been feeling the leadership towards the North and so it will be an English program it's very expensive I realize that English programs are more expensive than the local language [Music] programs but it varies of course from Station to Station so we'll be doing 15 minutes so we'll be just going at it straight away and so um we will be doing uh 15 minutes on UBC radio radi we were supposed to begin today this Sunday but the week was a bit busy we didn't have time to do all the recordings uh but next Sunday we will announce to you let you know the times uh but we are targeting Sunday morning from I think 7:45 to 8 around so we we will see how the 15 minutes will go if it goes very well then we will continue with it if not then we can add add on more [Music] time so it's going to cost us a total of uh um I think I lost track on the on the on the on the amount of of per [Music] program yes 200,000 per program and that would be 800,000 shs a month now I know God has already provided that money amen because it is his perfect will for the word to go off and I know God is going to send me partners and these are among you that are going to support this program praise the Lord so just pray about it and see how the Lord the holy spirit will lead you [Music] amen amen and also I'd like you to pray over a certain request that I have received from West n over about over 1,000 Believers will be gathering uh in in I don't remember I don't remember the name of the place but in West near Congo on the north on the north east east of Uganda and they have asked us to go and and and speak uh also I'm inviting uh some um other ministers I will announce them next Sunday once it is confirmed so let's be in pray about that as well I have a prayer another prayer request here says God bless you all Saints I request you to remember my sister in prayer who was [Music] operated and she's still in critical condition together with the whole family because the devil is fighting us this is Sister can I is she here she said the not okay we shall we're just going to pray for her just just now okay I think that's it um of course our youth meetings are already this month we are beginning to uh you know make the meetings preparation and by God's grace we already have our speakers confirmed so we need to pray God Will Supply whatever is need you know the body of Christ is always in need there a lot of things we need to do it looks like there is needs everywhere but our God is Jehovah I believe he will provide I mean isn't it amazing to see going through year by year sometimes when you have a mountain before you and you have great financial need you do not know how it will be provided but God is always faithful amen he always provides so for me as long as I know I'm in the perfect will of God then I know God Will Supply according to his riches shall we stand up we pray for our sisters as we commit [Music] ourselves to the word our loving father once again we come before you to pray Lord for our dear [Music] sisters that have sent in needs Lord you know these people you know their needs Lord sister Su has sent in the need need Lord of of our loved ones that need a portion of healing from you may you apply upon them that healing Bal because we believe there is still balm in May you raise the whole family oh God and your name shall be glorified we thank you Lord for our sister [Music] Stella that we pray with her Lord that she be back I ask that your grace upon her life Lord may you lead her may you direct her and always provide all her Lord in Jesus name amen sister Stella was able to reach out to someone um on um I think give them a little book of the message and is angan church so he contacted me the other day and he said he called me he said pastor you do not know me but I've been following and i' would like i' would like you to reach out he has about he has group of more than 150 people most of them are anglian and he said I would like you to preach to us this message we are planning as we see how the Lord will lead there's a lot of work to do will you pray for us amen just keep keep the ministry in prayer amen we can sing a little praise God we used to

Jo [Music] [Music] [Applause] oh you [Music] s oh [Music] oh let us pray our lord Jesus we are just Desiring your presence today as we know that you saved us you redeemed us and gave yourself for us now Lord we are here in your house we have gathered here today to see you to see you Lord high and lifted up to see you oh God moving in our life in our lives individual lives father you know each person here today and even online you know their needs and their desires father Lord we are coming before you reverently asking that you will come and minister to the needs of the Saints father father Lord I'm just a vessel I'm just a vessel of clay Lord no goodness in me but if you can take me out of the way come Lord and speak through me to your people father I know that everybody will be happy within their heart knowing that God knows their need and he spoke to them Grant I pray in Jesus name amen amen shall we please turn to our Bibles Hebrews chapter [Music] 10 vers 35 Brother Sam this is not as good as it was yesterday so I do not know what changed uh Hebrews chapter 10 Hebrews chapter 10: 35 praise the Lord if you there say Amen okay verses uh 35 cast not away thereof for your confidence which has great recompense of reward for ye have need of patience that after ye have done the will of God ye might receive the promise for yet a little while and that and and he that shall come will come and will not t now the just shall live by faith but if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him but we are not of them who draw back unto pedition but of them that believe to the saving of the Soul [Music] amenit um I just fa to give you this little admonition f usually when you coming on church Sunday morning preparation does begin in the morning preparation begins a day before so especially the young people I'm requesting that when you know you have a service on Sunday morning sometimes you find young people doing on Sunday the reason is they slept very late last night and the reason why they sleep late night restri I brother I have to restrict myself especially I don't I'm not on any social media Maybe which I use on my phone but I've had to put a limit and I limit myself a few minutes platforms and when the time passes the limit passes it will block me out so sometimes if you don't see me responding to you on WhatsApp it means maybe I'm blocked I can't access you realize these things take time it's a it's something we need to talk about address especially those of you who have smarton you know YouTube these days you can keep [Music] scrolling you know they have those shorts and those you keep scrolling scrolling scrolling scrolling you do not mean to be there 1 hour but you end up being there for five hours I think social media should not [Music] contr are for us to control not for them if you really want to come to Sunday in the church and be blessed you need to intentionally prepare set yourself up for the blessing and you only do that by sleeping early the night before rising up in the morning come refreshed come ready come and there is no way we cannot hear from Heaven I would usually appreciate if we stay put when we come in the service where's brother brother where okay brother okay yeah you are there I would appreciate that the Deon stay with me throughout the service really sometimes you find the same person going out for sometimes because they kept their phone in vibration and someone is calling them and the presence of God comes down because of this person going out coming in going out coming then it just takes away the anointing so let us try to uh stay in one place uh that we might be able to do not not disturb the atmosphere that God will be able to speak to us praise God have you found out what happened something must have happened something must have wrong I'm not hearing myself and that makes me straight at home so we um I think the quality of the sound is not bad Brother Sam but there's a problem either with the volume or the sound or something one of these monitors has gone on I do not know brother Dix might want to go support you and try to find out what's the problem okay so sometimes those things happen and uh you find that there is a a problem okay so with the brothers so as you can see we still trying to renovate the [Music] place it's slow than we expected yeah is well and it's going as as planed it will be done so the deons were telling me to inform you not to uh how they call those things step on them right well are we ready for the word this morning ask your neighbor you ready for the word are you ready for the word now I'm speaking to you this morning for we are not of them who draw back [Music] if you can go back to Hebrews 10 it says cast not away there for your confidence which has great of reward for you have need of patience after you have done the will of God you you might receive the promise yet a little while and he that shall that shall come will come who is going to come [Music] friend who is coming Jesus Christ he that promised to come will come as a matter of fact is coming soon and he will not now the just shall live by faith but any man draw back the only thing that is going to help us and and give us the ability to believe in this [Music] christianne is by faith it is Faith going to enable us to walk in this journey I will tell you it is increasingly becoming difficult for people who profess Christianity to live in this world is increasingly becoming difficult to live as a believer because almost in every of life and Society you go there is compromising everywhere there is compromising in our standards there is compromise in the ministry there is compromise among the L there is compromise in the families there's compromise in marriages there is compromise in the standards we used to hold you find that even many who claim that they were alive they dead although they still believe and think they are alive we are seeing the scripture in fulf what what does speak about the we living I wanted to look at it in Revelation 3 this was not in my notes but I just wanted you to look at that vers 14 and unto the angel of the Church of the Lans right the things sayth the amen the faithful and true witness and the beginning of the creation of God and he says I know neither cold or I would th one cold orot so God is complaining he saying the works of the people that are living in the age called not they are not so you find believers who are called believers but they are not r h for God they are not also cold in the world he says they are larm so because you are larm neither cold h i will spew thee out of my mouth because thou sayest I am rich and increase with goods and have need of nothing but you do not know that you are wretched you are miserable you are poor you are blind you are naked this is what God thinks of our age God thinks of Our Generation as a naked generation of a generation which is poor which is blind which ised and he gives a Cel he says I canel Thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou may be rich white that thou may be close the shame of nakedness do not appear amen it says anoint your eyes with may see and he says as many as I love I rebuke and I ch Beal and repent tell your brother be zealous and repent now we are in a generation of people who who are not Sinners people are not Sinners when you preach to them they tell you I'm saved many times I've been walking on the streets maybe I'm traveling somewhere and I see this this people and I feel AB to reach out usually I reach out to people whatever I go tell them about this message tell them what God has done in our generation tell them about the second coming of Jesus tell them about the oncoming judgment tell them about one God praise the name of and many times you you would be out there and you find this these women painted with longings know all the make the painted nails in the nutshell painted Jezebel now you would go to this woman and tell her and many times I've asked them what do you think about giving your life to Jesus they tell you but I gave my LED Jesus many years ago oh really so you a believer I'm a Believer go it used to be you see a Believer by how they look but these days it is no longer that way you know how you see watermelon a watermelon that is nice and and and Beautiful on the inside water you could tell that this is a good watermelon this must be red this must be Tre and then you harvested but these days because of the hybrids you know you cannot tell you will see it on the outside it will look so beautiful it will look as if it is right but when you harest it you cut it open it is as white as deception you know all the demons that were attacking the generations before us are now attacking Our Generation so you have the Demons of deception and you know they have deceived the people to feel their good and they increased with goods and they have need [Music] of saying they are naked they wretched they are poor they blind how do you know you are in that condition even if you're backsliding away from the principles that you used to hold dear if you backsliding from the things that used to be important to you there are things that used to be important to Believers one of them is coming to Church do we believe the Lord is coming soon but when you come here on Sunday on Wednesday morning rather Wednesday evening you don't feel like people are really believing Jesus when you come here on Friday overnight surely cannot look as if he's coming Sunday morning many people come late to church if you're filled with the Holy Ghost in your soul you hardly wait for those do to open you begin preparing yourself for the service the night before your heart is warmed up your heart is exped you here waiting to hear from God many times you know because you were reading the word used to read the Bible songs we used to in Sunday school read your B every every read how many pray every day if you are here and you don't you are backsliding you are backsliding repent because that is Christianity can notot be up and down the whole week you know you not thought about God pray at all read the Bible listen to the message come on Sunday morning I expect to have a wonderful that is why it is so hard to preach on Sunday it is on Wednesday some of you come be on Wednesday you can testify we always have a FL ano so you having many people have given too little time to go we need to go back to our foundation we need to go back we need to have that expectation that Jesus is coming back very soon how many believe it really you believe is coming back very soon you need to stay prepared to like you but many have dra back many have even gone back the things they used to do many have gone back the things they left have gone back the place they left off from you used to go to The Prayer Mountain what happened you used to go and have time with God I say what happened why don't you have that H anymore you know you cannot be filled the power of the Holy Ghost unless you have the hunger un you have The Thirst there is something that has been evaporating from the church last days hunger and people are no longer hungry imagine you don't to church on Wednesday and you not problem somewhere we need to wake upwing back again we need to come back to our first you don't come for night prayers you think it is okay it is not okay the spirit of this Ed is drawing us away we are forgetting why we are saved we are forgetting why we are here let me tell you why we are here we are here because we believe he's coming believe Jesus is coming that is the them of this church that is why we are different because we believe in the Rapture believe the Rapture may happen any time we not here for big mystery no the Mysteries are only meant to prepare us but let me tell you the reason whyin because we believe in his coming we would just go there for 1 hour or 30 minutes we but time came our eyes were open our eyes of understanding we were able to see that is not enough to prepare us even what we are hearing there we need to hear a fire to he something that will shake us we need to hear something which will wake us how many Christians are sleeping today let me tell you amen I'm going to be one of those little ones that will shout the rooftop there is something someone with ears to hear we hear will revive themselves they will be restored back again I'm telling you there is a great Falling Away who claim their standing they away they have a name they alive he says in the word they dead they have a name they Christian and when you ask Christ if he knows them he will say I never knew them when you see how would we know that he doesn't know them Christ cannot know you if the word does not know you but many of us believe the things we do the life we live if we look and compare ourselves with the word tell you brother if the word of God denies you Jesus will deny you there you need to realign yourself with the word of God you need to wake up you need to come back again to the reason why we end time message we know we are in the end get ready for the coming of the Lord the coming of the Lord is nearin they forgot about it that's why you know the the programs they is only to you know make themselves more comfortable here and then they begin to talk about their successes how many people they have and how many beautiful churches and they think that is success success is how many souls are prepared for the coming of the are you hearing I wouldn't I wouldn't mind if I preach to 100 people and all of them go to heaven 50 people all of them go to than to have a conation of and make praise the name of the Lord in the message return and the church would have been a church tonight have been glorious fathers would have accepted and stayed with the Holy Spirit that God had brought them out of the them organization amen when was the last time you sang and felt the presence of when was the last time you prayed and you felt that you were breaking through when was the last time you you were on fire you couldn't rest you go to church but days many times you find many Believers are not even B they've not g to church and even then they've not been following the service did you come to church no why I was tired I feel sick did they stream the service are you going to the you may not like me after this but it's okay you rather me now and go to the let me tell you there are many things going to distract us is Notting but we are the devil is Notting the devil is going to try everything he can to hinder you to bring down your fire the devil will not stop for anything the Bible says he knows he has for a short so he will try his know come and people never want you never want he's trying to make you go back he's trying to make you draw back he's willing to do anything make you amen know he was used by the devil the children of God and make them dra take away the favor of God from themed his best amen but he couldn't cast let me tell you there is no amount of words amen from anyone all the demons com defeat the of God but there are other things can use make you and I draw back we see it in the Bible how tried everything then there is one more thing he tried he went in the back parts of the children of Israel the prophet would say things you are not proud of things you did and you not happy with and the devil will try to look for those go behind you pull it out and try to show you and show everybody else you are unworthy so that you will be discouraged so continuing in the journey but even that as long as your sins are under the blood devil cannot use them against that he cannot there is one way one thing he was successful when he tried everything he tried to use their C fa casting them is teaching them aach prophetically uttering wrong things but it fa this are amen the spirit of you know whereby he would come and pervert them and present to them things which were beautiful in their eyes he said I will lay a stumbling block before them so that they will not be able toship their even if they did God will refuse and so what did he do he brought them you know an invitation to a society to a gathering praise the name of the Lord praise the name the Lord praise the name of the Lord it used to be that we believe we were enlightened it used to be that we believed we were enlightened that we we have the truth we have the light of the world how many believe that but I don't know if truly that is the truth because amen if you believe you have the truth you cannot settle until your neighbor has what you have your friend your brother your sister pray request for you to receive brother Pastor pray for my mother pray for my sister brother for my into the truth we no longer hear those We are Becoming called ourselves we have been invited to another place you find those Believers inviting people to their but these days you find Believers going to fellow because their friend invited I don't have a problem with you attending anything but the question is the fellowship you are going to visit do they have something of value to offer [Music] you answer me what are they going to offer oh no you know this fellow they're going to give me three Gods I don't believe it but my friend told me to go so if you don't believe the three God the trity you don't believe baptism the you don't believe in women PR you believe in Hol what are you doing in the camp of unbelief oh no you know they sing so well some of these people know how to sing let me tell you let me let me make a confession and this the truth they know how to sing better than us they know how to preach better than us the only thing they have is not the truth that's all they don't have but they know how to do this when you talk about women preachers who told you they don't know how to PR you know women preachers preach better than men by the way you know some of you think we are saying women don't know how to preach history has that women actually are better public speakers than [Music] men they know how toce people they know to the that even thought she had so much ability in that she knew she would convince the devil [Music] otherwise she knew she would do it the extent said do not eat but she was over excited and she knew how to you know she was good with our words she added on what God Said She Said we not eat Hallelujah I even touch God never say that was an invention of evil because women have women have more words women have sweet words if you are refusing what I'm saying samon was a very anointed you believe that he was a great man ofo when was so good with that even Sam keep the secret that he had for many years the secret of his strength The Secret of his power he could not have the strength to keep it before the words of the very powerful women are good well but the Bible says they are not to be teach the Bible or to rule over that's why they can teach in the because theying over theing author over the man work in Sunday he say even older women theyo can teach good things and which good things okay now I'm I'm very unscripted this morning I just of the holy spirit so in Titus right there go to Titus go to Titus I want you to look at it right there praise the name of the Lord is a lot good church so women can be teachers to what kind of teaching that's what I want us to see here have you seen Titus okay but th okay vers three chapter two of Titus the aged women likewise that they be in Behavior as becometh Holiness not false accusers not giv to much wine teachers of good things [Music] are you hearing that can you say amen amen so our mothers should be teachers our older sisters should be teachers teachers of what of good things that they may teach the younger women B does not contradict in first Timothy 2 says I I forbid a woman to teach authority over the man but here he saying they should be teachers teachers of who of the young [Applause] women but this days young women want to teach their mothers sister shut up and learn from the old on seek for C seek don't be of you good do not humble I know many of yous are very humble why when I speak something in the negative I'm speaking to someone who online the name of Lord amen the young Ladi should be humble should accept to be told because the Elder mothers they have seen all this they know this there is nothing they don't know accept them to teach you sit down and learn ask them and understand but when you see what they do that is what shows they don't want to learn they have hard hearts even long nails that is the generation we living in it is the generation we are in the young women they should teach them to be sober to love their husbands you mean that even you have to be Tau how to love your hus comes to you and says I saw you I noticed your husband looked very hry hry are you sure he made something for him before came to chch to me she me how to behave how to treat myand your [Music] hband she has right you are doing this wrong and you older mothers don't feel ashamed to do that it is your responsibility some things are not for the pastor to do no some are for the older mother you have a responsibility [Music] to teach them to [Music] beber to be teach them how to love their husband because they don't know many of these young girls don't know and that's why the Bible here is trying to actually say the Bible of God actually supports people to Mar when they [Music] young years now years and you are expecting who to teach you now what are you telling me see Mar when you are young desire to be married young can I address this for just a moment sometimes we think it is not the young man not choosing the girl sometimes it's not the man's problem it is because the boys too also they have their own shap of problem they make decision they here they are there they walking with cross legs you can never know what they want they talking with sister you you have a big problem f with the ho ghost hallelujah amen yes sir it used to be if a young man wanted aister don't go here don't go there no go through the right Channel go through the right door amen the Sheep will be stolen if the person coming is not going through the door you find that they come through the ventilator you find someone has gone through the window and then he s and then he says I like that one is a bear oh run away for your life and you sister you don't do that and you draw back from the teaching the sound teaching we give you and it brings you a lot of issues away from those who don't use the right channel if a brother comes to you sister says you know what I love you are you sure says yes does myor know that AAR that's a that's not a ship a praise the name of the Lord but if he a good sheep he [Applause] say but don't tell your father your mother it is the devil that works in secret but children of God they walk in the Hallelujah we are children of the light we are not of the darkness no we are not we are not and the young ladies they have issues they don't want to get married they don't they are they too busy devil is also ready for them with demons and spirits of feminism you know whereby the devil will tell them they call you a woman they want you to be less than you you a womanity by the way did you know women who speak these things on the international stage when they go back at home they have husbands that they obey yes they do many of them but the devil is simply using them to destroy the generation and you find them saying I cannot submit to a man others would be I'm happy the way I am others would be I don't want to take all my life and put it in the bottle Demons of God has delivered us from our girls must get married when they are young they yeah they should go to they should while the chance is there opportun is there praise the name of the Lord but I will tell you this school will not even teach you how to love your husband don't mix up things if you're having scho and if you're having yourges having your but when it comes to family when it comes to marriage it must be the Bible Way to your own hband and you are coming sub to me as your you cannot submit your these are demons of the end time may God you submit your boss your boss tells you this okay almost kissing their but when your [Music] husbands a problem the Bible not say submit your say submit to your husand can we say amen sister praise the name of the Lord they should be taught how to love their husbands also T how to love their children these younger women they don't know how to love their children they don't know they should be Tau sometimes you find a child doing something little like this and a mother will get AAP child will something [Music] when a mother Sayes that another older mother don't with it are not raised like this teach the child don't beat beating does not teach the child not all the time beating teaches the child actually does not these children here and they learn if they don't see you praying will never be able to you should teach them by doing your life should teach them and because people around and you saying let us hum our and your children are beginning and then you're like you stupid sorry sorry sorry you understand and you slap the and you're calling the child a foolish but remember this child is not foolish this child is following your example you bring them here in the church and you slap them and teaching them how to pray by force I've never seen you pray at home God you should teach them by example yes you should they should know when we are praying everybody is closing their eyes I've seen it because I have a growing children learn by what they see many times when we are praying closing our eyes and then you always as parents always have to open up and see and many times you see this child watching you then you close your eyes you keep praying the second day same thing the second month this child will do what you doing because the child Leed it know how opening your eyes wide open that is praying and Mom just never mom is praying and daddy can't even pray the child will never Lear and brother told us we see not first if the children the parents can't do it the children can't do it and so they have to teach their children to younger mothers to love their children are you following me to be discreet Amen to be CH that thing is Tau TOS are the on who teach them and olds teachs to teach their children praise the name of the Lord they should teach them to be keepers at home good obedient to their own husbands that the word of God may not be Blas do we still believe things but what the devil does the devil will invite you to come from the C teaching you the truth and will take you in a place where they do all sorts of things that are extra all right so you find yourself dropped in a fellowship which is not a fellowship of the word oh my am I preaching to Believers today the Bible says whatever the cus the fresh meat the fresh kill is they are the what oh come on that is the the eag areed we are e we are E and E are always gathered around where the is hallelujah come to our Bible class and go to bible class and they reject every word you have no business you don't have a business on an altar that does not hold the word of God dear every you go to must be lifting up the word of God hallelujah do not accept to be defiled def in anyway but this man called balam he took the children of God he made them to be invited into the party of and they went there and when they began doing their worship they started worshiping doing their Dan you know how they do them we still have the same Spirit here today you don't know we still do have throwing their legs of course dressed in the way you know how and you feel is it is not fine that's not the god of the Bible the god of the Bible will show them how to dress decent if you have the spirit of God in your he will tell you sister brother you must dress this sister he will make you keep your hair not cutting it off brother he will make you shave and look but you see they go to this part and they begin [Music] dancing and then begin and people think it was not it was entertainment it maybe it was worship to another the of God praise God praise God and then afterwards the Bible says the children of God the sons of Israel they saw the beautiful bodies of the other and we know the have the beautiful choir but some of you have been in PC what goes on there there this brother who is a leader and all these sisters in the choir moving around them the musicians most of them are living dived lives is this what we want is this what we want we should not draw back we should not go back where we came from we should hold the standard stand of the word oh my many of them are in church having boyfriends having girlfriends oh mothers excuse me let me talk to the young people today you find them living in that kind of life cabi doing all sorts of things but when they come in the church these very people doing these things supposedly the spirit will fall on them first you find them rotating everywhere falling everywhere but when you see their life it is lacking there is no of Christ I don't care how much you shout I don't care how much you say I believe I don't care how much you say God bless you what I want to see is your life you cannot claim to be a believer and Fall Away the teachings of the word and that's the only area will try to capture and then when they became last he went into fornication but God was angry the devil was happy he said I fulfilled it God said I'm angry with all of you 23,000 Israelites were killed in one day and the Bible says these things were written for our example we too should not fall in the same are you following me church we should not fall in the same seat and the scripture would say here they just shall live by [Music] faith and I was reading a it says but they went right back into the into it like a dog to its vomit to swallow went right back again into that and now we've wondered another 50 years wondering in the wilderness there was a time when God said you've been on this mountain long enough come on we are going over may it be's experience now in this an experience again that that God the holy spirit will speak to the people of this generation they sons as they did back there when the old Fighters have died out that F that fought I want to show you Saints about why when you do not draw back how God is pleased let us all turn to Genesis 22 and it came to pass after these things that God did temp did tempt Abraham and said unto him Abraham and he said behold here am and he said take now thy son thy only son Isaac whom thou lovest and get thee into the land of Moriah and offer him there for a bur offering upon one of the mountains which [Music] and abam Rose up Ear morning and SED his ass and took two of his young men with him and Isaac his son and C the wood for the burnt offering and he rose up and went up un the place which God had told him praise the name of the Lord that's 10% praise the name of the Lord amen now I want you to look at this church how many believe they have a calling of God upon their I believe I have a calling amen for as many as he did call he did justify know he has Justified us praise God and yesterday yesterday was what Saturday no Friday God called another one our brother was baptized the name of the Lord let us give the Lord hand of Praise hallelujah amen and I believe God is still calling amen and so God called Abraham and and and he called him out told him to go to a land which you will tell him was it easy it was not easy it was very difficult it was very hard it was very complicated to forsake everything brother cannot serve God unless you forsake everything you have to forsake everything for the sake of Christ praise the name of the Lord if you cannot forsake everything then you're not a worthy candidate you have to accept to for tell your neighbor you have to [Applause] for you know what you have to forsake do you know it neigh do they know maybe your joy was giving it Joy or something that was you know these things are the things you forsake yes you have to forsake your boyfriend for yourfriend how many foren those things amen yes if you around somewhere and someone did not say Amen it means [Applause] for you need to forsake you need to forsake and when you forsake those things then you will follow the voice of God and God later on you know Abraham in that new land you know he was in that place and you know he still did not have a child but then God came down and gave him a child one thing that I know about God he fulfills all his promises sometimes it takes a while but he's a faithful God he's a faithful God he's a faithful God my sister what is your name Juliet sister Juliet God is a you don't need to question him about promised you he's faithful to now I do not know what your needs are you came here in the church today but you see God is speaking to you now acces hallelujah hallelujah and I want you to see here God gave Abraham a son even he had promised God is going to give you what you desire as he had promised God is going to give you your job as promised is going to give you your husband promised is going to heal your body as he has promised God is going to lift you to another level promised everything he promised is going to do is going to answer your pray your PR you feel it don't feel it God is going to accomplish because God is God is not a son of man to love Hallelujah all you need to do is forsake what you need to forsake you just follow God youire give it to you hallelujah our god never failed our God is the god of Abraham and if he did this with Abraham do the same thing with us today amen that's why he even told them begin to shout before the walls came down not after but before you don't understand what say not after before many of us want to shout we see the Mir but he says if you believe it the just shall live by faith begin to shout before the miracle and they shouted they shouted and the words came down listen brother listen sister problem may still be there you may see it you may test itell it oh it doesn't matter if God has said I will heal you begin to thank him sh glorify his name I'm going to bless you to thank him for the bless if God said taking you to another level you are still on this level don't you worry begin thanking thank you Jesus thank you for the new for the glory to God and then you will see it coming we have to be persever oh my God thank you brother for that testimony brother Alan he was persever he was supposed to go to hospital he was very bad actually his message was threatening but I was just inspired to send those words he was inspired let me tell you a preacher may be inspired to say something no amen has to be inspired faith has to be inspired was inspired say I won't even go to I am healed I am healed I am healed you may be here and you are sick oh I'm telling you brother is more than able to heal you and by saying that you can receive a revelation I am Hallelujah now you go and test and you find the problem is still there keep your testimony don't dra back God is not happy with those don't [Applause] away with your ttim say I am here say you are crazy yes but I'm here and abose up early AB was who does this God gives you a child all this child and God tells you give me this child many of you don't want to give your child God gives you a job and because of a job you refuse to serve him why are you not coming to church I have a new job don't worry God will take it because who caning bring it if he brought it he can do [Music] what that is hard it is also threatening but it's the truth so if [Music] God breakr sister breakthrough God Ser God when you poor God when you are rich God when you have a j God when you God when you happy when you if you are sad amen should be louder will intimidate the devil woo hallelujah hallelujah amen hallelujah amen God loves the broken broken in heart let me tell you brother sister if you are broken God loves you that way wants to come you God God Amen I don't even know I I'm excited what I'm saying is the truth praise God was broken man having no child for years God gives him a child and then the God says come give me this years years you can't you can't seem to see blessing of God and when you begin to see it then it goes away I think I'm C do not those words when that ever happens to you know being set up for a blessing and tells him I'm going to take and then on the third day Abraham walked for first day first day second third doing what going to sacrifice his only son talk about faith then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place and Abram said this here with us I and the L will go up and worship and come again to you friends I want you to follow this listen to me you know they wed for first day third day and Abraham could not find where he has to sacrifice child AB was broken AB was did Abraham the whole time have a mind to go back [Applause] I don't know what do you think I think he might have thought about it it's very difficult maybe we give up up keep moving neighbor moving Ming and as he was moving the Bible says on the third day what is three is what is perfection is comption comption perfe seven is comption is if you've not attained that moment break through maybe you your your suffering is not yet perfect when it becomes perfect that's when the miracle is going moment but many people give up at that moment Abraham has walked for the first day he has his child and the servants and donkeys is tired the second day he was an old man the third day he's tired maybe was like maybe should give up but then a far off on the mountain he saw the place how did he know that that was the place God must have spoken to him and told him Abraham that is the place I don't know how many of you can see by faith the place of your breakthrough but that place of your breakthrough you have to go there alone yeah now you're fine brother you have to go there alone amen according to the word according to the promise the place of your breakthrough are you following me how did Abraham go to the place of his breakthrough listen follow me closely as he was down here I love I always love this place and for what it means he was together with his boy and the servants with the donkeys but I told them listen young man we need I need to go with my boys on the mountain as far as you are concerned stay here with the donkeys someone didn't pick the Revelation sometimes you need to tell some people and some situations to stay with the donkeys if you've seen the place by faith have to climb climb climb the mountain it is not easy that's what I'm saying but before you climb you have to leave some people with a donkeys you go up with everything leave your boyfriends your girlfriends Your Love Of The World leave it with the donkeys and go on up go higher higher by faith Higher by Revelation not throwing back I'm going higher can you say I'm going higher I'm going higher by faith I'm attaining my promises I'm going to sacrifice Hallelujah you have to reach that place where you are ready to sacrifice everything actually the Bible here says that by faith Abraham when he was tried he offered up Isaac he never killed him but he actually had killed him already his and he had received the promises offered up his own only begotten son of whom it was said that in Isaac shall th seed be called accounting that God was able to raise him up even from the dead hallelujah hallelujah who is your ISAC who is your ISAC oh is your Isaac your little thing

It Up to Abraham it was his son to you it may be anything that is laying a stumbling block you when you decide to give it up God can raise it up again hallelujah amen some of us we forsook the world

Lord oh we climbed up on the on the mountain of Calvary by Faith by the belief of the truth we've been climbing climbing climbing climbing where you forsake everything of the world brother sister whatever you forsook whatever you forsake for the Lord he will give it back he will give it back and more my God you need to be shouting Amen on that brother God gave back Isaac and also God give another sacrifice God will give back everything plus more God will recompense you and he will reward you and Abraham is father of Faith but many of us drop back at the first stumbling block hindrance

rting cars spending in very good apartment one year the m is finished let me go back make more I'll come back for sure and I start my project and they will never start the project can't you see the devil is making them lose their purpose in life let me tell you young people no matter where you are no matter what you are doing even if you are right with God the blessing of God will always follow your life just follow the word amen and the blessings will follow you but if you standing you know not in the right way how can God bless you even when you go abroad you will still man saying that they Beed me stay here stay in your country pray seek God go in the marketplace work don't don't accept poverty don't accept the same place you have been in if you have been in it for one year just

are more than able hallelujah amen oh God is good isn't Hallelujah let us not draw back we are not of them that draw back go and many of you the problem you don't succeed you have the double mind James 15 says if any man if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of God that give to all men liberally Andra not it shall be given him you want wisdom oh God what do you want me to he will give you what to don't think that praying from Monday to Sunday will give you jobs money will come from Heaven some of us we need to change our mindset praying every day is not enough you need to exercise your faith by applying wisdom what can I do if you don't have it Go and ask God when you ask God In Prayer God will give you wisdom God do this and everybody will may not even disagree with you but if it's your faith go and do it don't fear when you go in the name of the Lord he will make you successful but let him ask in faith nothing weing for he that WTH is like a wave of the sea driven with a wind and TOS for let him that for let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the world a dou minded man is unstable in all his ways don't be double minded in your ways about serving God no question are you hearing me church about coming to church no question by the way why am I emphasizing you won't even Prosper the other things you're doing if you don't attend Fellowship it's not possible it's not possible unless if you're not a Believer these rules apply to Believers only you have to be in the Lord for him to bless you does he bless the ones who are out for sure he does because they are serving their God and they're working with their hands and and and and and and he will bless them because the rain falls on the just and but I've never seen a father who disciplines children that are not his he a father will discipline his own children every home has its own rules and our house home the house of the Lord the rules are here says never forsake the assembling of of yourself together as we see the manner of some which some are you among the do you think is happy with those it's not of him that run but is of him that show mind it's not because I work to her no it is because you worked and God blessed you so if you work too hard and you don't find time for the Lord how are you going to grow in your spirit how are you going to grow in your understanding of the the reason we come to church is not to make money is to grow in the knowledge of Christ and by growing in the knowledge of Christ you in many ways you're going to be like him I'll continue with this
