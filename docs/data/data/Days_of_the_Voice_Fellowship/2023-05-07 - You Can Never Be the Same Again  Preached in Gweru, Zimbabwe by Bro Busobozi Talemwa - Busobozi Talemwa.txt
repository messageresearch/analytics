if you can only pass by our side Lord but where we are we will never be the same again father we invite you Lord to just come now through the preaching of your word and may may we touch you may we feel your presence Lord may you do something for us by the end of this meeting Lord we just commit ourselves into your hands Lord come and take take care of the vessel Lord for we do not have any abilities of our own we need your help Lord Jesus give us enough strength father and inspiration also to speak to your children this afternoon we give you thanks Lord as we ask you these blessings in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you once again now I'm going to ask my brothers to give me a little more sound because for The Voice I've lost most of the voice a sound a man praise the name of the Lord so we are going to straight away go to the world as we are still standing and I appreciate I appreciate everything we're in the presence of God how many already the presence of God Amen from the special singers you people can really sing that's really wonderful amen it just brings down the presence of the holy spirit amen I just told the pastor that bassist is really doing Justice for the best guitar that that was really wonderful and you have a terrific song reader I mean this is just wonderful amen and my brother where is he while he was speaking I was like why doesn't he take the service you took away the tire and he brought the spare tire I don't know why but and we're reading uh only one verse and then we shall be seated now when they saw the boldness of Peter and of John and perceived that they had they were unlearned an ignorant man they marveled hmm praise the name of the Lord and they took knowledge of them that they had been with Jesus is so we just have a small thought tonight and really like her brother was speaking whenever we come in the presence of God we don't come to power a lot of scriptures and quotes to you that is not the purpose of the preaching because the courts you can read them at home the purpose of a preaching is that his presence will come and that he will meet our needs and so really if we all can be in the same Spirit it doesn't take one hour it doesn't take 20 minutes if it is five minutes and it shows up five minutes then that's all that we need in English amen amen and so a brother that spoke after the first meeting in the morning I was supposed to preach on something else this afternoon but I had this in the pipeline and I did not know exactly what the Lord wanted me to speak my brother while he was speaking you know the Holy Spirit told me exactly the words he spoke them you can never be the same again and I just picked that up I said yes Lord I'll just speaking so I'm speaking to you this afternoon you can never be the same again now I want you to notice Jesus today this weekend every Everybody all over the world they are remembering about the uh Jesus but really many of them don't even know who Jesus is but actually I want to say the bride knows who Jesus because we know just more than a man we know that he is the word we know that Jesus Christ was gone came down from Glory foreign [Applause] [Applause] are able to understand routines you see that Jesus was not just a man he was the temple of God he was the body of God he was the children place but now people can be able to worship initially they used to go to the Temple of Solomon but now the temple shifted from Solomon's Temple Solomon to the body of Jesus and I want to say the body of Jesus is here today you are the body of Jesus and you are the chosen Place Jesus Christ has chosen to be and he has chosen to dwell in us and to live in us and also Jesus Christ is here today in the form of the world of Yahweh the message is Christ did you know that this afternoon from when Jesus if you read a new if you've read the New Testament nobody ever met Jesus you can check your record again no one ever met Jesus and remained the same now we notice here the Bible Begins by saying they saw the boldness of Peter and job you have to pray for my interpreter so you can preach amen praise the Lord amen and that you also can say Amen that God will be able to come and amen do something for us you know they saw the boldness of Peter they saw the boldness of John because of the boldness [Applause] they got shocked surprise that these people at this what have they eaten who did they talk to me and soon the Bible says that these two men had been with it foreign I've never seen the man in my life what was that he was full of fear Peter was full of fear he did not know he knew what he believes that that encounter with the Holy Ghost hallelujah amen but wait until on the day of Pentecost when Peter met Jesus in that form everything changed Peter was no longer a fearful man the Bible says he became he became let me ask you the question why what made him born the people themselves gave a testimony because Peter had been with Jesus of course as I'm going through this preaching tonight I want you to understand when I said Jesus in your mind I want you to understand I'm not talking about Jesus two thousand years ago I'm talking about the Judas today I'm talking about the Holy Spirit I'm talking about the world because it's the same yesterday we find the Apostle Peter says he did not have enough education even to sign his own name Jesus gave him the keys Peter and John passing through the gates called Beautiful brother says they perceived they were ignorant and unblocked people but they took he to them knowing that they had been with Jesus and he says that is the thing we look for today is to be associated with Jesus and if you ever associate with him you will never be the same again and he says that is true you can never be the same person after once associating with Jesus before we get into the into this a little bit deeper I want us to look at this situation but when Jesus was born he went among the Jews the Jews having received him they did not believe and so because they didn't believe him he left them and went to the Gentiles now Jesus Christ has revealed himself among the Gentiles and the Jews right now are in blindness they are blinded for our sake I've met a few Jews myself I've made a few Jews said you know uh Jesus he said what who do you mind they don't even know the word Jesus they don't know it you think that they know they don't know they are blinded but look at what Jesus has done for the Gentiles our prosperity as a nation it's because of Jesus look at America America Prosper America because of Jesus as long as they worship Jesus as a nation America prospers as they are turning away from him the judgment is coming you know the cup has to be filled in order for the judgments to begin but let me tell you the Bride of Jesus will not be here when the judgments of God I am so glad I will have taken off foreign [Music] do it [Music] because we know there is one reason why America is not attacking Russia America foreign I will see you in the Rapture because I'm not going to be here hallelujah amen during those times I'll be gone Peter and John Peter John they changed because of being with Jesus take your Bible to Acts chapter 3. verse 1. if you see a one now Peter and John went up together into the temple at The Hour of Prayer and a certain man lame from his mother's womb was courage let me first read verse by verse and a certain man who lame from his mother's womb was carried whom they laid daily at the Gate of the temple which is God beautiful to ask arms of them that entered into the temple [Music] is beautiful who sing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked an arms and Peter fastening his eyes upon him with John said look on us praise the name of the Lord are you understanding what is is reading is that a man here is a man brother come up here is a man seated right there because he can't walk and he meets Two Gentlemen who wants to be Peter had an encounter with Jesus and the Bible says and Peter fastening his eyes upon him with John I got tied it up already they say look on us hallelujah give me the next verse he said look on us this is verse what verse five and he gave down to them expecting to receive something he was expecting to receive something this man was expecting to receive something from Buddha and John say oh you want to give me some dollars give me something then Peter Hallelujah and then Peter said amen and imagine this where Believers like you and me what happened in their lives who just believe let me tell you Peter and John we are real Believers but they didn't have the ability to do this because of the encounter of Jesus amen they met Jesus and they were never the same and [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] what happened to him I want you to take a look at your life since you believe in the message are you the same many people can be able to look at me think about myself so you can now think about yourself as well they can be able to look at me and they can indeed know something has happened and amazement what has happened how can God do this I want to say none of those that had been with Jesus remain the same energy it is impossible to be with Jesus and you remain the same Peter who was previously fearful it's no longer the same the only thing the devil can do this the devil will try and hinder you from having an encounter with Jesus but let me tell you he can only delay [Applause] I don't care where they are born the moment that's it that seed has to be changed let me tell you the devil can only hinder some of you believe 10 years ago amen what happened the devil tried to hinder but he did not hinder hallelujah amen because you were in the mind of God you are a seed of God even the mind of God [Music] in my hands but I will lose none of them the father can never lose me you see as I serve God as I live for God I always am conscious of that you when the devil attacks me in some ways I am always comforted by the fact that the father can never lose me he can never lose any of his own every seed that was predestinated must come in contact with him and this is exactly what I'm going to demonstrate for you in this service tonight and maybe we I don't know if all of you are believers I I don't know but I also know in a congregation like this no doubt there might be some people Seated on the fence you know what offense is how many understand what I'm talking about not inside not outside you are just there because you're born in believing homes because your fathers and mothers are believers you may be think you're a Believer like that also but God does not have grandchildren right now you must have your own encounter yourself something must happen and I want to show you tonight by the word and demonstrate it to you here and they had a change in their life the change may be negative or positive now don't get tied down again by traditions and Creeds and organizations don't be led astray by listening to those that deny the power of the world and deny that Jesus heals they deny that just filled it with the Holy ghosts now this is the the big one for me this message has enough power to save [Music] you may say why is he talking about salvation you have never been saved you must have an encounter with him whereby you have an experience you know otherwise you will be in a church and you will continue drifting in sins praise the name of the Lord so I'm telling you because I there are many people there are 10 of churches and I've never met Jesus and maybe you may be hearing me today I have good news for you today I'm not going to chase you out of church you can have an opportunity to really truly be safe you remember Brothers he was going with him now this was a prophetess son he was he even met the angel of the Lord amen but I want to tell you this boy he initially did not have an encounter with Jesus despite of all that he would still go out and try and to try a drink and and escape from home try to do his other things even try to marry an unbeliever let me tell you it takes an encounter with Jesus when you meet him changes your nature when you meet him he changes your desires who deserves your soul at the end of the day if your soul is not safe oh my God and form of Jesus Christ Google [Music] Hallelujah come on if you have had it can you put on your mouth and say I am God is free man he said we are loose by his own blood if you still hold your faith and the denominations it is certain by the evidence that you have lost your faith our faith is not in Creeds our faith is in this world this message the devil tries to stop us but if there is a group of people the devil will never stop they believe as the True Believer [Music] they can never leave it because oh [Applause] right I am one of them I was in a very formal Church whereby you sit and you behave as if you are in a in a place where they keep dead bodies well you know what it is you know whereby you sit and they read for you the words goes but let me tell you what happened what happened Jesus [Music] there is no way we can shout there is no way we can't rejoice and now we know yes Jesus [Music] hallelujah amen and here's the good news he must meet you if you're a seed of God oh my mind never say maybe I'm stopping even if you're suffering when Jesus contagious about it there is something must happen is [Music] [Music] foreign they if the world is being preached The Sinner will be are they a good sinner that some of them have left us let me tell you why are you here because you were meant to be here before the foundation of the world that is in here another one can call you anything they want but when Jesus but because it rained so much a man cannot become an orange and we must be like Jesus Hallelujah [Music] let me show you here when Jesus met somebody give me for John 5 John 5 verses foreign there were a fists of the Jews and Jesus went up to Jerusalem now there is at Jerusalem by the Sheep Market a pool which is called in Hebrew having five poachers in this layer great multitude of important Fork of blind Holt with it waiting for the moving of the water for an angel went down at a certain season into the pool and troubled the water whosoever then fast after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatever disease he had come on and a certain man was there which was which had an infirmity 30 and 80 years when Jesus saw him lie and he knew I knew that he had been now a long time in that case he said unto him will thou be made come on give me the next bus praise the name of the Lord the important man answered him sir I have no man when the water is troubled but while I am coming another step down before me come on Jesus said unto him rice and take up my bed zombie wait a moment let us understand this easy what changed this was what was happening was it the provided way of God yes it was a Revival but when Jesus comes when the the word of Yahweh comes foreign buddy I know when the angel of the Lord came to my wife you know it had to be that the first one to be thrown inside whatever disease even I believe even if he was poor you know today he did not say he did not say only diseases whatever situation as long as the angel of the Lord came and the person here when he came out lying on a palette and when Jesus came Jesus the Bible says this place had all sorts of people different man of things and this man was sick from one of them and Jesus told him would thou be made in other words I would want to call it this way when Jesus comes you're away the first thing he asked are you under expectation do you want a change he wants something to happen like the prophet of God like God spoke to the prophet of God why did God ask him you mean God did not know but he wanted foreign but these next words I love them Jesus looked at the moment and he told him rise up now I wanted to hear those words after understanding the situation of this man um [Music] does this still apply all sorts of conditions what is your condition when Jesus comes and the brother before I came here declared already that Jesus is here even the songs if what if this man said I I have been here all my life but I wanted to hear what the Monday and immediately the man was made and the two cup is and on the same day immediately when you meet Jesus immediately your situation is over here hallelujah amen I had no school fees to study done this enough is a good disease I don't even know why I'm sharing this now but things change when I met Jesus and I told God this message is true I want you to pay my tuition my mother because of this precious message and I said God are you not do you want me to go to school if yes are you not going to prepare for me and I'm telling you God did not he didn't take him months if I give you the one Testament to take long uh before I would go to the to the school institution was already cleared the God of this message to you it might be something yeah tell me where is Jesus today Jesus is in his way when you meet Jesus he was lame and Jesus simply says foreign praise the name of the Lord Jews that are for sale unto him that was cured foreign [Music] [Applause] Bobby [Music] amen bring them to China if they come to church and Jesus is there yes [Music] foreign I don't know whether you understood that his message [Music] amen those in the back they do here this message it's the truth Jesus Christ came in a place where there were many sick but he walked by them [Music] foreign foreign [Music] yeah not thy father and he answered and said unto him all these things are very observed from my Youth Association then Jesus beholding him I see a lot of people out there that said well even if I don't leave my trousers even if I don't throw my earrings I know Jesus loves me foreign would believe foreign [Music] um only Believers of this message believe this kind of teaching attention that when things are good it doesn't mean God you know loves you so much and when they are bad it doesn't mean he has a costume if you are rich very rich we in the message they say the blessing of God you must be ready but we as Believers know there is no cast to break anything because Jesus Hallelujah when he was on the cross there is no more castles to break as long as you believe in him the castles are broken and this man was told to carry his cross and follow us I am young I have my girlfriends do you name my girlfriends how can I live there forsake them completely foreign how can I live you know I love the discourse amen can't I serve Jesus when I'm going to the district [Music] foreign he thought about his riches Iman what is your riches that is where your heart is anything that you put your heart is your richest you have to destroy it you have to sell it off for Jesus foreign whether I feel it or not I believe it is the word of God and now this man was like the message is complicated but he had met Jesus he said now this is hard and he was sad and he went away grieved foreign [Music] this man met Jesus he never believed did he go away foreign [Applause] [Music] [Music] If the message is not real to you stay under the world [Music] cannot remain the same let us see one more example here hallelujah are you still listening John chapter 4 John chapter 4 verse 7 verse 7. there cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water give me a drink for his disciples we are gone our way into the city to buy mate I was imagining how could 12 men go about to buy meat [Music] Jesus did this on purpose he lives here hallelujah he lives he left everybody else it is so he can meet the gentlebride then saith the woman of Samaria unto him how is it that thou being a Jew asks a drink of me a woman of Samaria for the Jews have no dealings with summary is the gift of God foreign [Music] this message is disorder which Jesus has given us and we can never fast again amen amen by the water that I I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing into everlasting life the woman answered and says I um all right but Jesus said unto her thy husband the woman answered and said I have no husbands you have well said for you have five husbands is now not thy husband and so you speak truly the woman said unto him sir I perceive the doubt our fathers worshiped in this mountain in the place where men ought to worship woman believe me stand the hour coming he is a neither in the mountain no year that Jerusalem worship the father you worship you know not what do you know what we worship for salvation is of the Jews and he said but the hour comes and now he is when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father secret search to worship God is the spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth the woman said I know I want you to follow this story which is called Christ when he's come he will tell us all things amen the woman was getting somewhere she had not caught the Revelation the full Revelation she was on the right path she was realizing that this is somebody else and she was realizing that this man had spoken to her things that no money it brings things from Undercover you bring things it brings things from under cover when you sit under the preaching of the message you know the word begins to design you [Music] am I Iman I hope there is no one like that that when the word of God is the word is a designer God brings the world in such a way and Jesus said unto the woman foreign [Music] foreign as we reach the climax of the service this woman is not forgotten she was the seed of God and God knew her by name God had to dismiss all the 12 minutes [Music] and then when he went remember this was the time such women come to draw water this was not in the morning this was in the afternoon we are prostitutes I expected to be at the water they usually went to a drug lord at such time of the night of the day so when Jesus came the Bible says he had to go to Samaria why because there was a woman that needed Redemption my life can be and the woman was not minding her the woman wasn't minding him just like the nature of man in East when you see the nature of man is when you sinatasa you hide away from God they were not interested [Music] but God as a man who was rich was interested in every little thing about Adam and his foreign and this woman did not know but God knew you may not know yet your life amen at that moment when this woman heard Jesus speak when you come under the word and you hear the word this is Jesus speaking to you something was already beginning to work you know when a child of God hears the world you may not know you will not even be conscious about it and one of these days it's going to come out on the outside and something was foreign you know this was her business [Music] she came to draw water and this was a business some people come to church for other reasons you come to church for another reason but Jesus and this woman came for another purpose but when she had Jesus speak to us she threw up support she didn't care whether it bricks and the Bible says she began to run to the city she didn't walk to the city tell me what was going on she met Jesus she was never the same again she went in the city and told everybody [Music] foreign Hallelujah I'd like you to stand on your feet and hear these words it's already five and I can't continue foreign speaks from a message I just read a portion of this Jesus Christ is the same yesterday the hour is coming when this world will shake under the impact of the Church of the Living God that is moving forward in great power Guru how many believe that I'm gonna understand and Jesus says this man was possessed the devil had him all bound he's talking about the man in the terms and so the devil says I know you Jesus why do you come to torment me before my time the devil spoke right quick if you're gonna cast me let us go over into the halls and they run into
