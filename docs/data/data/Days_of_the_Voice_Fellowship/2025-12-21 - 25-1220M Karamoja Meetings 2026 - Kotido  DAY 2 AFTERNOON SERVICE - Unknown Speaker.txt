========================================

And slowly we are being formed into his image. So while the man of God is coming, I just want you in your heart to pray and say, "Lord, speak to me." So don't allow anything to distract you. You know when Jesus came in the temple one time there were many people like I've heard we have about 7,000 here but you know when there are many people usually other people behind there go in other businesses. So they started going into the business of selling this and that but I don't know why you are here but myself I came here to hear from God I want to hear the So, how many are here for the word? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so, just open your heart. For the Lord is going to speak to you again. Amen. Amen. Pastor Simon, if you can please come. Do we sing a song here? only believe. All right. I know we are going to read the word. So if you want to stand, we sing that as pastor. We can do it without the music, without the piano, without the I know it's very easy. Our prophet sang it. I want all of us to try and sing it in English. The word is only believe. All things are possible. only believe. &gt;&gt; The angel of the Lord loves that song. And I believe is here with us this. &gt;&gt; So let us sing it together. Holy Billy. Holy Billy. All things are possible. &gt;&gt; All believe. Only believe. &gt;&gt; Believe. &gt;&gt; Only believe. &gt;&gt; All things are possible. All things are bo I get on Oh, no. Let us bow heads in prayer. Gracious heavenly father, it is an honor for us to be here again tonight to fellowship around your word. May the Holy Spirit who is the interpreter of the word come and speak to us. Have your way. Have your will in our lives. Once again, we rebuke the powers of the enemy. In the in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, thank you Lord. Thank you master. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Can we say amen? Amen. Can we say hallelujah? Hallelujah. Can we say praise the Lord? Amen. Amen. Amen. I I'd like to read a scripture. Hebrews chapter 4 verse 1 and 2. The Bible reads, "Let us therefore fear lest a promise being left us of entering into his rest. Any of you should seem to come short of it. For unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them. But the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it. Verse three, for we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, as I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest, although the works were finished from the foundation of the world, forchech. Foreign speech. Foreign speech. Foreign speech. for I May God add blessings to the reading of his word. You may please take your seat. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We want to continue from where we stop this afternoon. It's a burden in my heart to if God should help us to see the importance of the word of God. Everything that we see around us was made by the word of God. There is nothing as powerful as the word of God. God said, "Let there be and there was." So the earth, the sun, the stars, the stars, the entire universe was was created by the spoken word of God. Jesus said, "ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE to them that believe. WHEN GOD SENDS HIS WORD, the only thing he asks of US IS TO BELIEVE. IF you are sick tonight, as the WORD OF GOD IS BEING PREACHED, I don't need to lay hands on you. Yes, we believe in laying hands. BUT IF YOUR FAITH CAN RISE TO THE LEVEL while the WHILE THE WORD IS GOING FORTH you can receive your healing. Even right now YOU CAN RECEIVE THE HOLY GHOST AS THE WORD IS BEING SPOKEN. WHEN MEN FELL, men lost a sense of direction. BUT GOD PROMISED TO REDEEM. AMEN. AMEN. HE BROUGHT HE SENT FORTH HIS WORD TO HEAL OUR BODIES. HE SENT FORTH THE word to heal our spirits. BROTHER SAID, The greatest miracle is THE HEALING OF YOUR SOUL. If you are SICK AND YOU ARE PRAYED FOR, THERE'S A POSSIBILITY that tomorrow you can get sick again. BUT WHEN GOD HEAL YOUR SOUL, it is eternal. WHENEVER WE COME TO CHURCH, THE REASON WHY WE COME IS BECAUSE OF THE WORD. AMEN. AMEN. THIS IS THE WAY GOD OPERATES. SO, THE INTENTION OF GOD IS TO HEAL YOUR SOUL. HE WILL SEND HE WILL SEND A PROPHET. He will send PREACHERS when they go out. He gives them gifts of healing. Can we say amen? Amen. Amen. THE REASON THE REASON WHY GOD DOES THAT IS TO ATTRACT THE ATTENTION OF THE PEOPLE. Praise the name of the Lord. AND WHEN THE PEOPLE SEE THAT GOD IS A GREAT GOD, THEN GOD WILL GO FURTHER. TO GIVE THEM the word. WHEN MOSES WENT TO EGYPT, HE DID A LOT OF MIRACLES THAT ATTRACTED THE BELIEVERS. HE CALLED THE PEOPLE OUT OF EGYPT SO THAT THEY CAN GO TO A MOUNTAIN TO WORSHIP GOD. God told Moses, he said, "WHEN YOU GO TO EGYPT, YOU WILL BRING THESE PEOPLE BACK TO THIS MOUNTAIN SO THAT THEY CAN WORSHIP ME. AMEN. AMEN. AMEN. Moses brought them out. AND AFTER THEY'VE SEEN THE SIGNS, THE MIRACLES, AND THE WONDERS, GOD TOLD MOSES, "NOW YOU COME UP THE mountain and I will speak to you." WHEN MOSES WENT UP THE MOUNTAIN, GOD SHOWED him his plan THIS PEOPLE THAT HE HAD BROUGHT OUT OF EGYPT. THEY SHOULD SHOW THEM THE WAY HOW THEY SHOULD worship him. In Hebrews 8:5, PAUL WAS TELLING US, he quoted Deuteronomy. WHEN WHEN GOD CALLED MOSES, HE SHOWED HIM THE VISION OF THE TABERNACLE IN HEAVEN. HE REVEALED TO THEM THE WORSHIP. WHATEVER MOSES WAS TO DO ON EARTH, GOD REVEALED IT TO MOSES ON THE MOUNTAIN. GOD WARNED MOSES. He said, "MOSES, I KNOW YOU ARE AN ENGINEER. I KNOW YOU KNOW HOW TO BUILD ROADS AND BUILDINGS. I'M SENDING YOU DOWN TO BUILD A HOUSE FOR ME. But Moses, see to it, MAKE SURE THAT YOU BUILD THIS TABERNACLE ACCORDING TO THE PATTERN THAT I SHOWED YOU IN THE MOUNTAIN. Praise the name OF THE LORD. MOSES, PROPHET MOSES the pattern. SO THE MESSAGE OF MOSES WAS WITH THEM WHEN WHEN THE TIME CAME FOR SOLOMON TO BUILD THE TABERNACLE. SOLOMON WENT TO THE MESSAGE OF MOSES AND HE STUDIED THE PARDON THE WAY THE FOUNDATION MUST BE LAID. EVERYTHING THAT WAS TO BE IN THE TABERNACLE, MOSES HAS ALREADY GIVEN them the P. AFTER THEY AFTER THEY BUILD THE TABERNACLE ACCORDING TO WHAT MOSES SAID. WHEN THEY WERE DEDICATING THE TABERNACLE, GOD WAS SO HAPPY. THE GLORY OF GOD filled the TABERNACLE until until the MINISTERS WERE NOT ABLE TO MINISTER. WHY? BECAUSE I FOLLOW THE WORD OF THE LORD. LIKE I SAID THIS AFTERNOON, IF WE WANT GOD TO ACCEPT US, WHATEVER WE DO, IT IT MUST BE DONE ACCORDING TO THE WORD OF THE LORD. AMEN. AMEN. AMEN. AMEN. LISTEN. ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE IF WE TAKE THE word of GOD AND ACT UPON THE WORD OF GOD. THERE IS NOTHING can stand. NOTHING CAN STAND BEFORE THE WORD OF GOD. AMEN. AMEN. AFTER MOSES left the ark of the covenant. MOSES, Moses said, "THE MINISTERS MUST TAKE THE ARK OF THE COVENANT. put it on their shoulder AND THEY WILL GO BEFORE THE PEOPLE. AMEN. AMEN. The the PROPHET THE PROPHET WAS NOT AROUND. BUT THE BUT THE WORD OF GOD WAS WITH THEM. AS THEY HELD ONTO THE WORLD and they were walking, THEY WERE GOING TO WASH JORDAN. AS SOON AS THE PRIEST'S FEET STEPPED INTO THE WATER, GOD OPEN THE RED SEA. JORDAN, WHAT DID THAT? IT WAS THE WAR. WHEN THEY CROSS OVER, THERE WAS A WALL OF JERO. THAT WALL WAS SO BIG THAT YOU COULD DRIVE CHARIOTS IN THEM. JOSHUA WHO IS NOW THE COMMANDER. He have lived with Moses. HE HAS OBSERVED MOSES. HE'S HE'S NOT TELLING THE CHURCH. Let a priest take the WORD AND GO AROUND THE WALL OF JERICHO. Seven days. ON THE SEVENTH DAY, THEY SHALL GO AROUND IT SEVEN TIMES. At the END OF THE SEVEN DAYS, THEY SHOULD SHOUT. THEY SHOULD SHOUT. AND WHEN THEY OBEYED THE WORD THE THE INSTRUCTIONS OF JOSHUA, THE WALLS OF JERICHO CAME DOWN. AMEN. HALLELUJAH. BLESSED BE THE NAME OF THE LORD. Thank you. I UNDERSTOOD THAT THIS PLACE WAS IS A DESERT. You can SEE THE PRAYER OF A SERVANT OF GOD THAT THAT BELIEVED IN THE WORD OF GOD that believe in the message OF WILLIAM ROGERS. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. AND HE CHANGED THE SITUATION. GOD IS THE SAME YESTERDAY, TODAY AND FOREVER. GOD IS still alive. If you believe the word of God, GOD IS MORE THAN ABLE TO CHANGE YOUR SITUATION. If you don't have children, IF YOU ARE I WANT TO SAY TO YOU TONIGHT, IF YOU CAN BELIEVE, GO AND RECEIVE YOUR CHILDREN IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST. If you are sick, RECEIVE YOUR HEALING IN JESUS NAME. AMEN. BLESSED BE THE NAME OF THE LORD. &gt;&gt; LET ME TELL YOU FRIENDS. I don't even have to scream. BUT IF I PRONOUNCE THE WORD, if you believe in the word of God, HALLELUJAH. AMEN. WHATEVER YOUR DESIRE IS, GOD WILL GRANT IT UNTO YOU. THERE IS POWER IN THE WORD. WHEN JOSHUA told Joshua, he said, "My servant Moses is dead. I want you, Joshua, to lead the people into the promised land. What I want you to do, the only thing I'm asking, you see the book of the law, the message of Moses, make sure you meditate on it. day and night. God says, "IF YOU DO THAT, WHATSOEVER YOU DO, you will you will prosper." CAN WE SAY AMEN? AMEN. PROSPERITY. You want prosperity. YOU WANT TO SUCCEED IN LIFE. IF YOU WANT GOD TO BLESS YOUR FAMILY, IF YOU WANT GOD TO BLESS YOUR CHILDREN, BELIEVE IN THE WORD OF GOD, what made God unhappy? What makes God to be unhappy if when is when people disbelieve his word. The Bible says believe his prophets you will prosper. There are some of you here since you believe the message, God has prospered you. GOD HAS promoted you. GOD HAS BLESSED YOUR BUSINESS. GOD HAS BLESSED YOUR CHILDREN. IF YOU WANT YOUR CHURCH TO PROSPER, PASTOR, STAY WITH THE WORD OF GOD. WHEN I'M SAYING THE WORD, I'M TALKING ABOUT THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. Praise the name of the Lord. May God help us. WHEN GOD GAVE THEM THE WORD, THE PAUL IS SAYING Paul said THE WORD THAT WAS PREACHED THE GOSPEL was preached to them. the same way it was preached to us. BUT THOSE WHO HEARD THE PREACHING, THEY NEVER MIX THE WORD WITH FAITH. They never believed. THE PROPHET OF GOD SAID, FAITH IS A REVELATION of the word OF GOD. CAN WE SAY AMEN? AMEN. Jesus said JESUS SAID WHEN YOU ARE PRAYING PRAY LIKE THIS. OUR FATHER WHICH ART IN HEAVEN. Be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in EARTH as it is in heaven. CAN WE SAY AMEN? AMEN. GOD HAVE A WILL. THERE'S A WILL OF GOD IN HEAVEN FOR YOUR LIFE. THERE'S A WILL OF GOD IN HEAVEN for the woman you marry. THERE'S A WILL OF GOD IN HEAVEN FOR THE PLACE THAT HE WANT YOU TO LIVE. THE JOB, THE BUSINESS, BUT WHEN YOU PRAY, GOD KNOWS YOUR WIFE, GOD KNOWS THE RIGHT JOB, GOD KNOWS THE RIGHT HUSBAND. SO WHAT WE DO AS CHILDREN OF GOD, WE GO TO GOD IN PRAYER, LORD, LORD, SHOW ME YOUR WILL. Praise the Lord. WHEN GOD REVEAL HIS WILL TO YOU, his will line up with his word. God hate adultery. If you go and pray, "Oh Lord, Lord, I want to divorce my wife. I want another wife." You know that the will of God, the word of God said, "Don't commit adultery." WHEN YOU PRAY, AN ANGEL APPEAR TO YOU AND SAY, "I AM I AM ANGEL GABRIEL. GO AND DIVORCE YOUR WIFE. YOU SEE THAT SISTER OVER THERE? YOU SEE THAT WOMAN IS YOUR WIFE. WE KNOW THAT THAT IS THE DEVIL. CAN WE SAY AMEN? AMEN. GOD will not go against his word. JESUS BELIEVE HIS OWN WORD. AMEN. AMEN. JESUS HIMSELF SAID NOT MY WILL be done. PRAISE THE NAME OF THE LORD. THE WILL OF GOD FOR TODAY. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. GOD SAID, "BEHOLD, I WILL SEND YOU ELIJAH THE PROPHET." HALLELUJAH. AMEN. WHEN ELIJAH THE PROPHET COMES, YOU WILL TURN THE HEARTS OF THE CHILDREN to the fires. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. THE REASON WHY WE ACCEPT BECAUSE WE CAN SEE HIM IN THE SCRIPTURE. WHEN JOHN THE BAPTIST CAME, THEY ASKED HIM, "WHO ARE YOU?" JOHN THE BAPTIST SAID, "I AM OF ONE CRYING IN the wilderness." HALLELUJAH. AMEN. ISAIAH ISAIAH HAVE ALREADY PROPHESIED ABOUT THE COMING OF JOHN THE BAPTIST. WHEN JOHN CAME, HE IDENTIFY HIMSELF IN THE SCRIPTURE. CAN WE SAY AMEN? AMEN. BECAUSE A PROPHET HAVE SPOKEN TODAY, WHATEVER WE DO, GOD HAS SPOKEN through his prophet. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. IF YOU WANT TO START A CHURCH, THERE'S A WAY GOD SAY YOU SHOULD START A CHURCH through the prophets. Can you say amen? Amen. IF YOU WANT TO MARRY a woman, the prophet OF GOD HAS TAUGHT US HOW TO MARRY OUR WIVES. If you want to ADDRESS the word of God for today, I'VE SHOWN US HOW OUR SISTER SHOULD REST. HOW THE BROTHER SHOULD REST. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHERE YOU ARE. If you are A BELIEVER, WHAT ARE YOU BELIEVING? THE WORD OF THE LORD. WE ARE A BELIEVER of the word. A believer. A believer. Believer. Believe the word of God. WE CALL OURSELVES MESSAGE BELIEVERS. WE BELIEVE THAT GOD HAS SENT US A MESSAGE. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. TO SERVE GOD CORRECTLY, WE MUST COME TO THE MESSAGE AND CONSULT THE MESSAGE. YES. LISTEN. AMEN. One day God had blessed King David to be a king is so prosper. He had a desire to bring the ark of the covenant back to Israel after the Philistines took it. The same mistake we are making TODAY a prophet in the land. Instead of David consulting the prophet, he consulted the generals. Amen. Amen. And they adise him, King, what we should do, let's build a cart and let's put the ark on that cart and let's bring the ark back. He was so nice. I thought where did David get that idea from? David never consulted Moses message. He never consulted the prophet. I think what happened one day, Israel lost the the ark of the covenant. I believe it went in the hands of the Philistine. one night the Philistines and God plagued them. I plague the Philistines. So, and they said let's take the ark and send it back or let's put a car and put the ark there. And if this if this goes back to Israel, we know that their God is is God. church. When they place the WORD upon the animals, the power of the word, DIRECTED THOSE ANIMALS straight to Jerusalem. The power of the WORD SAID BY WORD HAVE I HE IN MY HEART. WHEN YOU KEEP THE WORD IN YOUR HEART, THE POWER OF THE WORD WILL LEAVE YOU. HALLELUJAH. THE POWER OF THE WORD WILL PROTECT YOU. THE WORD OF GOD WILL FIGHT YOUR BATTLES. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. But listen, the Philistines were not under the covenant that Israel was. I want to advise you. Don't copy the denominations. There are things that they would do and get by. Are you with me? Maybe David got the idea. This is what the Philistians did. But the INSTRUCTIONS of God TO ISRAEL THROUGH THE prophet Moses. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. WHENEVER THE WORD IS COMING by the priest. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND SO BECAUSE DAVID NEVER OBEY INSTRUCTIONS OF PROPHET MOSES AR OF THE COVENANT WAS COMING THE POWERFUL WAS REJOICING REJOICING. MY ANOINTING WAS THERE AND WHILE THEY WERE GOING AMEN WHILE THEY WERE GOING THE ARK THE ARK ALMOST FELL DOWN and one BROTHER OH let me go AND HELP KILL HIM RIGHT BECAUSE THEY NEVER FOLLOWED THE INSTRUCTION. YES, IT IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT as pastors, AS MINISTERS BECAUSE YOU ARE LEADING THE SOULS OF MEN. THE LORD OF PEOPLE IS IN YOUR HANDS. WE MUST BE VERY SERIOUS. YOU MUST BE VERY CAREFUL. IF YOU TELL THEM THE WRONG THING, GOD WILL REQUIRE THEIR BLOOD AT YOUR HANDS. AMEN. THE ONLY THING THAT we should DO is to go for the message. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. THE WAY WE RUN OUR CHURCHES, we should do it. IF YOU BRING TRADITION, IF YOU MIX THE WORD OF GOD WITH YOUR IDEAS, you are ALREADY HALLELUJAH. AMEN. When you follow the word, you will succeed. You know the reason why we have problems even our homes and marriages because we don't want to follow the word. Some of you you have problem. You come to the pastor. The pastor will show you the word of God. But you turn your back from the word of God and then you run into trouble. Many are in situations today because they refuse the word. The scripture say don't smoke. Drinking is not good. And some of us are going to church and still drinking. Sometimes you see preachers that are preaching behind the pulpit, but they are sleeping with the women in the church. They have girlfriends in the dark. YOUR CHURCH MEMBER MAY NOT SEE YOU. YOUR FAMILY MAY NOT KNOW, BUT THERE'S SOMEBODY THAT KNOWS. THERE'S AN EYE THAT WATCHES YOU. AMEN. AMEN. GOD GOD WANT US TO OBEY HIS WORD. GOD WANT US TO LIVE A HOLY LIFE.

It's not BY YOUR OWN EFFORT. The only thing that God want you to do is to believe. One day you will die. Oh, you say I'm powerful. Are you powerful than God? God sent us a prophet. So that we can accept that prophet and what that prophet says. Then when we take that prophet what he says then and then we will be changed. You see we cannot go to heaven with the way we are. I want to show you something in the scripture. Abraham was an idol worshipper. Abraham God came to him. He said, "Abraham, come out of your father. Come out of your tribe. Come out of your city. come and follow me. In other words, when we come to God, we move out of our traditions. Can we say amen? AMEN. GOD DELIVER YOU from the tribal spirit.

DON'T TRY. IF YOU TRY, YOU YOU'LL BE IN serious trouble. GIVE YOUR LIFE TO JESUS CHRIST. Paulo &gt;&gt; was saying, "I marvel. I'm so surprised that you are soon shaken." You are very quick to move away from the word of God. He said, "Who have bewitched you? He was telling Timothy, "The things you see in me, the things that I have done, the way I preach, the things I train you, I show you the word. Commit the same thing to faithful men who will TEACH OTHERS ALSO. PRAISE THE LORD. WE MUST BE FAITHFUL TO THE MESSAGE. LISTEN, Moses was no more around. It was Joshua and the church. BUT BECAUSE JOSHUA was meditating upon THE WORD OF MOSES, ONE DAY, you know, when you listen to the word of God, it gives you faith. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. WHEN YOU LISTEN TO THE WORD OF GOD, IT GIVES YOU FAITH. JOSHUA JOSHUA HAVE GREAT CHALLENGES AHEAD OF HIM. I BELIEVE IN THE MESSAGE OF THE PROPHET. HE WAS MEDITATING ON THE MESSAGE. And one evening as he was WALKING AROUND, he saw a man dressed in a military attire. JOSHUA IS under commission. HE SAID, "ARE YOU ARE YOU AGAINST US?" The angels say, "I am the captain of the host of the Lord's army." AND JOSHUA SALUTED Joshua worship. AMEN. AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Joshua continue meditating. They were at war. &gt;&gt; They had a war. The sword was going down. Joshua, &gt;&gt; he never even prayed because he has believed the word. Amen. He just look at the son. He say, "Son, stand still." AMEN. THE POWER OF THE SPOKEN WORD. MOSES WAS NOT around but the God of MOSES is not here. OF THE GOD OF IS HERE TONIGHT. AMEN. HE'S THE SAME YESTERDAY, TODAY AND FOREVER. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. THE ONLY THING THE ANGEL WANT YOU TO DO IS TO BELIEVE THE PURE MESSAGE. DROP THE IDEAS OF MEN. CAN WE SAY AMEN? AMEN. IT DOESN'T MATTER who that person MAY BE, WHETHER he's a white man, WHETHER HE'S A BLACK MAN, WHETHER HE'S FROM AMERICA, WHETHER HE'S FROM AUSTRALIA, AND THEY BRING SOMETHING TO YOU. THE PROPHET NEVER SAID IT. AMEN. AMEN. Paul said this after my DEPARTURE will come. Sometimes he s to say but people come to Jesus and people were following him. Now remember Jesus is the word. Jesus knew some of the people that were coming to the service is for the bread. looking to convention they killing goats. They never came to Jesus service for the word. They came for the food. Some of you the service is going on and you are doing boyfriend and girlfriend somewhere there. Don't you fear God? Some came TO because of the miracles. Bible says Jesus Jesus &gt;&gt; never committed himself TO ANY OF THOSE. BECAUSE HE KNEW what was in man. You know even we preachers we have to be very careful so that we not build a following to ourselves. We are here to POINT PEOPLE TO CHRIST. IF MY BROTHER JOHN Mark here is Christ, my responsibility as a minister is to take your hand and connect you with Christ. Are we together? So that you can have a personal experience with Christ. But if I am holding Christ and they are holding ME AND YOU DON'T know who Christ is if I leave Christ, how do you know that I've left him? Because you DON'T KNOW HIM. THAT IS WHY JESUS SAID WHEN THE BLIND LEAVES THE BLIND they fall into the ditch. WE ARE NOT HERE TO MAKE NAME FOR OURSELVES. WE ARE NOT HERE FOR PEOPLE TO WORSHIP US. OH, HERE COME THE bishop from New York. YORK IS THAT THAT'S NONSENSE. Blessed be the name of THE LORD. WE ARE HERE TO EXURE JESUS CHRIST. WE ARE HERE TO TELL YOU THAT THE MESSAGE OF is the truth. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Believe the message. Believe the prophet. Listen to the word of God. MAKE SURE WHEN YOU ARE PREACHING TO YOUR CHURCH HAS PREACHED YOU WERE NOT THERE. I WAS NOT THERE WHEN GOD MET WILLIAM BRHAM. WHEN MOSES WENT TO THE MOUNTAIN, NOBODY WAS THERE. IT WAS MOSES AND GOD ALONE. The children of Israel. including Aaron the high priest have to believe what Moses say. CAN I SAY AMEN? AMEN. THAT IS WHY WHEN GOD SENDS A PROPHET, WHEN GOD SENDS A PROPHET, he vindicates the man so that the people without any shadow of DOUBT will take What that prophet is saying, there's never been a day since the time of Adam that God took a picture with a prophet. GOD, HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. TOOK A PICTURE WHEN PEOPLE WERE DOUBTING MINISTRY came down Texas and took a picture with his prophet. Can we say amen? Amen. They took that picture. The FBI took that picture of the FBI confirmed that this is a supernatural life. When you go to Washington DC, I have been there. So Library of Congress somewhere to the library of Congress where they keep their documents. When you go and ask for brother Bernham speak, they will take it out and photocopy if you want. I've had A COPY GOD. GOD TESTIFY TO THIS GENERATION. I WOULD THIS IS HIS PROPHET. GOD GOD. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. HEALED CONGRESSMAN. THIS MESSAGE IS in secret.

THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR IS NOT ABOUT THE TRUTH. THIS MESSAGE, IF YOU BELIEVE IT, IT WILL RAPTURE YOU. IF YOU BELIEVE THIS MESSAGE, IT WILL CHANGE YOU. IF YOU BELIEVE A PROPHET, GOD WILL DELIVER YOU. SAY, "AMEN." AMEN. STAY WITH THE WORD. Listen to the voice. GO BACK TO THE FOUNDATION. I am a wise master builder. I HAVE LAID THE FOUNDATION. REMEMBER, REMEMBER JESUS SAID TO THE disciples who do men say that I the son of man. Some said master. I heard somebody were saying you you are Elijah. Others were saying you are Jeremiah. Some were saying John the Baptist has come back. says, "That's fine." He did not say that they were wrong because Christ &gt;&gt; was in Jeremiah. &gt;&gt; Christ was in David. &gt;&gt; Christ was in Isaiah. &gt;&gt; Ethopian Enoch when they act Enoch, &gt;&gt; he was reading THE BOOK OF ISAIAH. Who is the prophet speaking about here? Is he speaking of himself or he speaking of another person? WHEN THE SPIRIT OF GOD COME UPON THEM, WHEN THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST COME UPON THEM, THEY BEGIN TO ACT like Christ. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. DAVID DAVID WAS REJECTED BORN UP TO THE MOUNTAIN OLIVES AND HE BEGIN TO CRY BECAUSE HIS OWN PEOPLE REJECTED HIM. WHAT WAS HE DOING? HE WAS ACTING THE LIFE OF CHRIST. ISAAC WAS BEARING THE ON HIS OWN CROSS THE WOOD THAT he was GOING TO DIE ON. SO, CAN I SAY AMEN? &gt;&gt; JOSEPH WAS IN PRISON. THERE WERE TWO PRISONERS. ONE DIED. THE OTHER ONE WENT TO THE THRONE. JESUS WAS ON THE CROSS. THERE WERE TWO THIEVES and went to hell. ONE ASKED FOR REPENTANCE AND HE WENT to paradise. THE LIVES OF THOSE PROPHETS WERE ACTING OUT THE LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST IN PORTIONS. SO HALLELUJAH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN JESUS CAME, &gt;&gt; Jesus was Elijah. &gt;&gt; JESUS WAS ISAIAH. &gt;&gt; JESUS was Moses. &gt;&gt; MOSES SAID, "THE LORD your God, a prophet like me." HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHEN THAT PROPHET COMES, listen to what he tells you. WHEN MOSES WAS BORN, &gt;&gt; YES, PHARAOH WAS KILLING THE CHILDREN, WAS KILLING THE BOYS. WHEN JESUS WAS BORN, &gt;&gt; CAESAR CAESAR WAS KILLING THE CHILDREN. SAY AMEN. AMEN. MOES MARRY an Ethiopian woman. MOSES &gt;&gt; MARRY A GENTILE BRIDE. JESUS. YES. A GENTILE BRIDE. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. IT WAS CHRIST IN THOSE PROPHETS. BUT WHEN HE CAME IN THE ENTIRETY OF THE WORD, he asked them, "Who do men say that I am?" Some people were still having their denominational explanation of who Jesus was. But it was the present truth. &gt;&gt; Jesus is now is more than Jeremiah, more than Isaiah, more than Ezekiel. It was all of the word complete. After they gave the questions, they answered, they gave the answers, he said the Christ, THE SON OF THE LIVING GOD, Jesus said, "FLESH AND BLOOD HAS NOT REVEALED THIS FOR YOU." HALLELUJAH. AMEN. FLESH AND BLOOD MEANS YOUR PASTOR CANNOT give you revelation. BIBLE SCHOOL cannot give you revelation. No preacher FROM AMERICA, FROM GERMANY, FROM ENGLAND, ENGLAND CAN GIVE YOU REVELATION OF JESUS CHRIST. CAN WE SAY AMEN? AMEN. YOU MAY HAVE KNOWLEDGE. YES. LISTEN. We don't fight for our God. OUR GOD FIGHT FOR US. With all due respect, the Muslims, they fight for their God. They can kill for their God, for Allah. We are NOT MUSLIMS.

LET ME TELL YOU THAT COMING OUT IS NOT A DESTINATION. Let me say it again. The coming out Egypt, out of the denomination is not the final destination. After you have come out, there is a message. There's a guide that knows the way. WHEN I CAME HERE IN UGANDA, THAT'S MY FIRST TIME OF COMING. I DON'T KNOW THE COUNTRY. I DON'T KNOW THE COUNTRY. I HAVE TO DEPEND ON MY GOD.

When God looks at you, he doesn't look at you through your sin because you have confessed it. He looks at you through the blood. When you leave this place, you are going to go and make things right. Maybe you have to make things right with someone. Maybe you have to meet your pastor for counsel. Go and make things right. But before you leave this place, I want you to know that same spirit that convicted you is a living God. And you're not going to do this on your own or else you leave this place and then you continue with the kind of life that you are living. But I want I have some good news for you. That same God that convicted you wants to dwell in your heart. He wants to feed you. with himself. That's the power that overcomes the world. If only you can receive his spirit, you will never be the same again. You will have love in your heart for everyone. You will have no room of bitterness in your heart.

You will have the love to read the message and and listen to the message and read the word. You will desire to go to church and hear the word being preached. You will no longer cause trouble in your home. This is what happens when the Holy Ghost comes. Do you believe &gt;&gt; that he can fill you now? The Holy Spirit.

Amen. Amen. God bless you my sister. &gt;&gt; Well, God bless you saints. As the Lord bless you tonight, I turn it over to the pastor. Before I turn it over to the pastor, I ask four brothers to come here. Four brothers. Four brothers. Before the pastor comes, four brothers, come four brothers. I want to we we've learned something that I need I needed I thought I I needed to um uh I don't know how they call it but I need to demonstrate it for you. &gt;&gt; So this one this one is Christ. That's what our pastor demonstrated for us brother. So he's representing Christ. This one is representing a brother believes in Christ. &gt;&gt; So because he believes in Christ, hold him. &gt;&gt; Hold him. He He believes in Christ. This one is representing a brother who is following a brother. that believes in Christ. Hold that, brother. Hold him tight. &gt;&gt; Oh, come on, brother. You have to. Yes. Okay. Okay. You don't need to shake. No problem. Now, this one is also representing a brother who believes in a brother and believes in Christ. Keep holding on Christ. Hold. &gt;&gt; Now the pastor preached to us even in the morning. Listen, listen attentively. &gt;&gt; And he said, listen, I want you to understand this. And he said, the message of the hour is Christ. &gt;&gt; Listen. Just listen. The message is not brotherham. Brother Brham was the carrier of the message but the message is Christ. So that's why that's why listen okay I I I I just listen just listen now. That's why brother Brham taught God told him he told it will be food for my bride in the end time because when you listen now when you read this is the audio which was put in books by the way. When the pastor takes it and he quotes it for you believers, it means we believe that message and the pastors who believe that message will not be afraid of taking it and say brother says and we quote it. That's why your pastors do that because we are message believers. What is the message? It's not brother. The man is dead many years ago. But this message which was recorded is Christ. So brother pointing us and be deceived that the Bible is something else. When you when when you read the message, when you feed on the message, then your understanding of the Bible becomes fruitful. We had the Bible in the denominations and we were blind. BUT WHEN WE RECEIVE THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR, so when we open our Bibles, we can now see Christ. We can now see one. We can now see water baptism in Jesus. That our sisters are cannot be preachers or pastors. WHERE THESE TEACHINGS COME FROM. IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN IN THE BIBLE, but it was hid from the wise from the eyes of the wise and the blind. But by GOD'S GRACE IN OUR DAY, like in the days of Moses, he sent us a message with a message that identifies Christ in our age. Now we have all been believing. This one is you. This one is you. This one is you. believers of different ages. This one can even be your pastor or your apostle or your teacher. Maybe this one is your deacon or maybe this one is whatever it does represents all that. So this is the message. Now you see how you are holding the pastor said something as he was preaching which I wanted to demonstrate for you. He said, "If we only do that and you hold on to this man, if you just hold on to this man, it is fine for as long as is holding Christ. BUT HERE IS THE PROBLEM. Here is the problem that we many times do. When this man lets go of Christ, Christ remains where he was. And then this man holds on to another one following. YOU SEE WHAT IS happening now? WHERE IS CHRIST? WHERE IS CHRIST? CHRIST IS IN THE PLACE WHERE HE WAS AT THE FIRST TIME. SO WHAT IS THE MESSAGE? THE MESSAGE is Christ to say it in a very simple way. So now what I'm TRYING TO SAY THE MESSAGE HAS NEVER CHANGED. IT IS THE SAME MESSAGE. WHY DO MEN COME WITH FAKE DOCTRINES AND THIS AND THAT AND IDEAS AND OPINIONS? Because they are not following the messages. They are following something. See how MANY ARE LOST. SEE HOW many are lost. See how many are lost. WHEN THE BLIND FOLLOW THE BLIND, all fall into the ditch. But the pastor gave us a solution for that. And he has said HERE IS HOW THE RIGHT PERSON SHOULD DO. OH, &gt;&gt; I LOVE THIS. THEY ALL FOLLOWING. HE SAID THIS HOW IT SHOULD BE. His first brother should hold on to Christ. Hold hold him. Now when this one wants to know Christ, hold him on another hand. THIS IS WHAT WE AS PREACHERS SHOULD DO. Even as believers because we are the light in our villages. You are the light of the message in your village. WHEN YOU GET PEOPLE WHO WANT TO KNOW HOLD THEM BY THE hand and lead them to Christ. Make him hold. Make him hold. Bring another one. Make him hold another side. Are there MORE? ARE THERE MORE? COME ON. COME. COME. COME. COME. Make them hold. Brother. You are holding. Don't be jealous. Make them hold. Make them hold. That's how it has to be. SO ALL THESE PEOPLE, all these PEOPLE ARE feeding from the same message, from the same spot, from the same spirit, the same anointing. And that is why my brothers and sisters, we must read the message. GOD HAS GIVEN US GOOD PASTORS. Where is the pastor? Where was the here? God has given us good pastors. But good pastors will always lead us to the message will always not lead us to themselves but to Christ. They will not talk about themselves. They will talk about Christ there. God bless you brothers. You can go back. And that is what Pastor Simon has been laboring to do. Lead all of us to Christ. That's what that's what Apostle did. That's what these pastors, these elders are doing. That's what I am doing. That's what every one of us should do. And we want to say thank God for the message. Thank God for the message. We have a song that says is the old time Holy Spirit. The devil won't go near it. That's the reason why people fear it. It's good enough for me. It makes me love everybody. I I recently I told people in my church, I don't have enemy. I don't have one enemy. One enemy. I love everyone. And I mean it. In all my life, I don't have person I hate. That's what the message will do. When Christ comes into your heart, he will give you love even for your enemies. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So I want to say God bless you pastor Simon. &gt;&gt; Can we all say God bless you? Pastor God bless you. Do we appreciate let's thank God in the year 2011 We the late Apostle John Mark had friends who came from the US. Uh one of them was brother Frank from Germany but they were all 15 in number. Uh, one of them was brother John who came from New York. Okay. From UK, Britain. That brother who came from Britain was speaking a word which I have not forgotten. That was one short brother. He was having a boy. He was called Daniel. He also spoke is when message &gt;&gt; among the 15 what was brother John talking something concerning the message of the hour how it came to then When he looked into the place where he came from, he saw that UK, Great Britain has been overtaken by the riches of the world. He said they in their in their land all the time seeing money in front of you. People are committed to their personal work. But for one to come to the presence of God, it's very difficult. He said God has given you this measure of the hour is so great and wonderful. The one you are gathering He said do not look like the people who are hunting for the wealth and the riches of the world. Why am I emphasizing on this? Pastor Simon who has been our preacher of the night that others are waiting for bishops, others are waiting for other big officials. He says that's not the way. Like for him, he's from New US. &gt;&gt; I am not like those ones. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's better to show the reality of faith like that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Love the message more than anything. Love the message. to brother is a great blessing to the region of Kamoa. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Even if the devil try to block the way God who prepared the message for you is rich of ways. Yes. his half that he will not forget was having a pride at the bride of Christ. The Lord will never leave his suffer. Even if a man can try to block his way, even a person try to block, let me assure you Even the devil is trying to fight the way of pastor in order to remove from them the med of this. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's trying his best. We are aware. We know. But brother stand firm. Stand firm. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. You are doing what the Bible is saying. If you give what you are giving is you are putting to the treasure in heaven. &gt;&gt; From the time you remember what what you are doing for is great. God will bless you and still desire. There's still a lot for you to do for get friends of this chip. They really friends of the sheep. Don't sleep because of Hallelujah. Hallelujah. God bless you because of time. &gt;&gt; May the Lord bless is my my his servant Simon for the evening. I still have hope in you. I pray to come for you to come back so that you stand again in the pulpit. Let's keep on praying for him. &gt;&gt; In the morning when he comes, you'll get the strength. I love the visa so much. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. because of time and the program we are going to close according to the program. So uh the program of today is some announcement from brother John. It's a brief announcement. It's not preaching. I've really benefited a lot. Though I was translating though the high the speed was too high. I thank God he gave me the spirit. Today God has done wonders. So I thank all of you. Uh before I go to the announcement, before I go to the announcement, I send my apology to the people that have missed the apology. Yeah, mostly the brethren from if you have if you don't know English but I know tomorrow by 10 the Sunday service if we have that team English as have a place where we can have that then someone will translate with it will be okay. Is it right? Uh yes. Um according to the way I made the program for this convention, this convention was supposed to move after tomorrow evening around this time or around Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat.
